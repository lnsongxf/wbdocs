Introduction
Hungary’s recently established Equality of Opportunity framework guides the planning and
implementation of interventions addressing the most pressing social inclusion challenges at the local
level. In today's Hungary - despite the centralization of some social, healthcare and educational
services - addressing the social inclusion challenges of local residents, and assisting them to access
relevant services and benefits, primarily rests on the shoulders of local governments. Delivering
relevant services that address communities’ priority needs requires the careful assessment of social
exclusion challenges and their underlying causes, followed by the development and implementation
of strategies and interventions that tackle these needs in an effective and efficient manner.

The Equality of Opportunity framework provides a comprehensive set of resources, guidance and
templates to local governments to facilitate the planning of Local Equality Plans (LEPs). The intention
is that these plans apply the same logic and structure across Hungary. However, recent experiences
have shown that additional and more specific support is needed – particularly in the case of
municipalities who have a limited level of institutional capacity - to facilitate the identification,
development, funding and implementation of complex interventions that tackle communities’
most pressing social exclusion challenges.

Through extensive consultations with various governmental and non-governmental stakeholders at
the national and local level (see Annex II), a series of challenges were identified for moving from a
theoretical planning exercise to an earnest application i.e. operationalization of the Equality of
Oppoortunity Framework at the local level. These challenges included difficulties with handling
complex social exclusion situations; lack of local resources for financing comprehensive interventions
and difficulties with accessing external resources; concerns about local tensions with regard to
invetsing in the target groups of the Equality of Opportunity framework and difficulties with engaging
with and mobilizing local communities. Most importantly though, local stakeholders expressed a
strong desire to receive targeted support that is directly relevant to them by reflecting the realities
that they are dealing with on the ground.

The intention of this Handbook is to provide just that: practical guidance and hands-on instruments
that empower local stakeholders to actively and effectively shape the local social inclusion landscape
within the overall guiding framework of the Local Equal Opportunity Programs.

It is important to note, that - departing somewhat from the LEP logic - the Handbook does not put
equal emphasis on all target groups covered by the LEPs. Rather, it aims to follow a more realistic
approach –reflecting the reality at the local level – by explicitly focusing on those target groups that
are experiencing the most complex social exclusion challenges in Hungary. These are those
popoulation groups that are facing multiple i.e. cumulative disadvantages, such as children from
disadvantaged families, unemployed Roma women with children, and the elderly and disabled
who live in marginalized communities. The Handbook provides guidance and considerations that
aim to sensitize local stakeholders towards the particular situation these target groups face and
equip them with contructive approaches to tackle these issues, based on interventions that have
been tried, tested and have proven to be effective.




                                                   3
The Handbook was developed with several key audiences in mind. Firstly, and most importantly, it is
intended for local governments which have relatively large number of residents in the equal
opportunity target groups 1 or other disadvantaged groups within their administrative areas. The
second target audience of this Handbook is comprised of municipal employees and civil professionals
responsible for the preparation, implementation and organization of the local delivery of social
services. Two key consideration guided the focus on the Handbook in this context: (i) the Hungarian
local government system is extremely heterogeneous by nature and as a consequence, (ii) the local
level obligations vary greatly depending on the size of the settlement.

The Handbook therefore focuses on the challenges and opportunities of those local governments and
related stakeholders that have the relevant primary care capacities and apparatus. Primary care
capacities means that these local governments run more than just the basic social services (child day
care facilities up to primary education and access to basic healthcare facilities). More specifically, the
focus is on those local governments that are in charge of a more comprehensive set of some social,
educational and health services and that also receive funding for the implementation of employment
initiatives. The target audience in this context is the staff which is responsible for designing and
running these services. Having made this caveat, the Handbook still provides useful clues for smaller
municipalities, particularly with regard to how they can best facilitate access to relevant services that
are available within the communities’ vicinity i.e. are provided by higher-tier government agencies -
which often proves to be the most pragmatic way to address service gaps.

The Handbook is organized around a select number of practical guidance notes that include
references to relevant examples and resources that are available. The issues these guidance notes
tackle were selected based on the feedback that was collected through stakeholder consultations.
The notes tackle those challenges that were flagged as being the most common and salient ones.
These issues are among the most critical ones that local governments and other relevant
stakeholders repeatedly struggle with when they embark on operationalizing the Equality of
Opportunity Framework. Some of the tools and advice provided in this Handbook - e.g. the
instrument of developing a proble-solving tree – can however also be applied to disentangle other
complex challenges local governments might want to tackle.

The Handbook is accompanied by a comprehensive set of illustrative local social inclusion case
studies from all over Hungary. Each case study highlights the specific target group(s) - e.g. Roma –
and the category of needs– e.g. education and training, employment, housing – it addresses The
case studies were not selected to only present practices that were innovative and successful; they
also identify shortcomings and challenges that arose during implementation. The case studies are
intended to increase staekholders’ awareness, facilitae knowledge transfer and peer learning. It is
also important to note that the case studies should by no means be interpreted as examples that can
be readily transferred. Even relevant elements of the case studies need to be customized and
integrated into the local context.

Guidance Note 1: Snapshot of the most pressing social problemsi
In today’s Hungary, economic development gap in comparison with the EU average had decreased by
2014. At the same time, internal inequalities in Hungary have continued to increase along with the
intensification of several adverse social processes, all of which cause social challenges at the local
level:
       In Hungary, poverty and social exclusion has been continuously deteriorating since the
2008 crisis. Currently, more than one-third of Hungarians are at risk of poverty or social exclusion.
Between 2008 and 2013, the proportion of children growing up in a household at risk of poverty and
social exclusion increased from around 33 % to 43 %.
       The performance of the Hungarian education system has deteriorated further and
disparities between schools have increased. Early tracking has intensified inequalities as it reinforces
childrens’ disadvantages based on their socio-economic i.e. family background. Moreover, schools
tend to increase the existing differences in equality of opportunity of their students, rather than
creating a level-playing field. The restructuring of the education system (narrowing of financing for
higher education admissions, centralization of primary schools, restructuring of vocational training) is
expected to lead to less marketable knowledge and professions gaining ground.

       Although both the employment rate and the activity rate increased in 2014, they are still low
in international comparison. While activity is increasing rapidly (standing at 67.8% in the third
quarter of 2014), it is still below the level of regional peers. Moreover, while the unemployment rate
is low – in large part driven by the public works program, from which approximately 10 percent of
jobseekers are able to move on to the primary labor market – the disparity in the employment
opportunities of high and low-skilled workers is bigger than in most EU countries. The unskilled
groups in society lagging behind encompass today 15% of the population - that is, one in seven
people belong to this category whereas the proportion of well-qualified persons, managers and
entrepreneurs, is 10% less than those in the neighbouring countries.

        In comparison to the general population, the situation of the Roma households is
considerably worse. The Roma population remains to be generally lower-skilled than the non-Roma,
lives in poorer conditions and faces difficulties finding productive formal employment. A large share
of the Roma population in Hungary continues to live in segregated dwellings and in precarious living
conditions. These conditions are exacerbated by demographic trends: while the general population
of Hungary is shrinking and aging, the Roma population is growing and young.

      The number of people willing to have children and those living in marriages/relationships
has significantly dropped. There is a growing number of young people trapped in their parental
homes, postponing the start of their independent lives, amd more and more people move abroad
(2-4% of household have one member living abroad).

Despite the aforementioned difficulties there are dozens of communities demonstrating that positive
changes can be achieved at the local level by long-term cooperation among municipal or community
leaders and social workers, by exercising proactive, professional and financial planning, stakeholder
involvement, as well as investing in honest, open and transparent communications. Small changes go
a long way and communities have shown that even minor improvements make a huge difference in
the lives of people.


 Social problems that typically manifest themselves at the local level include:

   every third household is struggling with existential problems – with a pronounced need for external support;

   more than 40% of children grow up in poor and excluded householdsé

   almost the entire Roma population lives in poverty and opportunities to break-out of poverty are decreasing;

   raising children represents a longer-term "burden" - this may cause existential problems for retired parents;

   local public works programs represent a dead end for an overwhelming majority of clients - yet they appear in the
    system over and over again;

   schools reproduce poor family background, rather than compensating for it;

   marginalization, lack of perspectives, the fear of external threats often lead to the increase in local tensions and
    the spread of extremist views.

Guidance Note 2: Three strategic steps as the basis of interventions
In today’s Hungary, politicians and society at large are divided over the way they perceive
disadvantaged groups, including whether their disadvantaged status can be attributed to individual
traits or structural issues. The social inclusion debate - including at the local level - can get easily
highjacked by focusing on those clashing perceptions and short-term political priorities. To get out of
this trap, local governments will need to explore the underlying social and structural root causes of
marginalization and exclusion that are the origin of these perceptions, and identify the most
effective solutions to remedy the problems. This includes both, everyday community activities as
well as more targeted and comprehensive social inclusion interventions. Prioritizing these type of
interventions will likely cause some tensions as well as initial resistance at the community level which
needs to be equally addressed.
The target groups of equal opportunity programs are very heterogeneous. There is a wide variety of
“human fate” within each group. However, there are many people actively looking for opportunities
and dedicated to take initiative - but they need opportunities and places to meet and interact, as
well as support and encouragement. Providing platforms for communication and interaction,
granting support and taking into account the specific needs of target groups is not only a social
necessity and a long-term responsibility, but also a legal obligation at the local level, for which many
incentives are available to local governments.
In the following section we review what strategic steps should be taken by all local governments as
a basis for local social inclusion and equal opportunity processes. These steps are
         1. Situation analysis and planning for improved local service delivery,
         2. Obtaining potentially available resources and other financial sources,
         3. Addressing local tensions and mobilizing local communities


Hungarian and international experience ii demonstrates that these three strategic steps are a
prerequisite to building successful and sustainable local social inclusion initiatives.


        Situation analysis for the planning of improved local service
        delivery 2

One objective of the Local Equal Opportunity Programs (LEPs) is to explore whether equal
opportunity target groups (ie. those living in extreme poverty, Roma people, children, women, the
elderly, persons with disabilities) are facing specific problems to which the LEP scheme iii can offer
help. There are typically three basic shortcomings in the situation analysis sections of LEPs:
    -    First, even though local governments have listed the relevant local (and – theoretically –
         available) services in the LEPs from the perspective of the given target groups, they have not
         analyzed their effectiveness, potential access constraints or delivery issues. For example,
         while it is recommended to list the number of pediatricians and vacant pediatrician practices,
         the latter is not included in many LEPs, despite the fact that it provides a more complete
         picture. Not only does it show which services are more difficult to access, it also highlights if
         there are not sufficient local pediatricians in some communities – which would then raise the
         question why this is the case.

  By „situational analysis” the Handbook refers to an analysis of service delivery constraints that target groups
in the local level, in line with the legislative definitions.

                                                        8
    -   Second, the LEP structure does not include services relevant to the target group but that are
        not available locally (or only available sporadically). The development process of LEPs has
        encountered several situations in which not the local level but other agencies (for example,
        the central school management authority) or other territorial levels (district or county) are
        responsible for the provision or funding process of certain services. However, these are not
        required to be covered by the documents, and related shortcomings need not be explored
        either. At the same time, the conflict arising from the methodology of preparing LEPs and the
        document structure should be resolved, and services or capacities available in other
        locations or by other agencies should also be considered when preparing action plans. For
        this, additional data and information should be collected for example via SZOCIR, the
        information directory of social service delivery. iv
    -   Moreover, the question whether local residents commute to another community to use the
        given services like school, social and healthcare services (and if so, what is the service
        quality) is not included in the analysis either. However, for planning purposes, all these
        considerations are essential information for the identification of needs and relevant
        interventions.
    Key elements for developing a situation analysis of local service delivery
    Mapping of service needs vs service availability. The situation analysis should include a
    comprehensive qualitative and quantitative assessment of service needs (based on community
    needs assessments) for each of the LEP target groups and juxtapose this with the available local
    services to identify issues with over- i.e. undersupply and gaps in the provision of services.
    Geographical location of services. The situational analysis needs to reflect the fact that –
    particularly in the case of small municipalities - , certain services going beyond the most basic
    services, are available in geographically different locations, as a result of the Hungarian public
    service provision structures.
    Available funding sources. The analysis needs to provide a comprehensive overview of available
    funding sourcs. This is complicated by the fact that typically services are financed by several
    types of funding sources simultaneously. In addition, the district level is conducting decentralized
    tasks, and counties have recently been given planning responsibilities for service delivery.

Analysis of services using the “pentagon of service delivery” (see Figure 1) The “pentagon of service
delivery” is formed by the key service providers at the local level, including civil society organizations,
religious organizations, other communities, local self-governments, and market actors. The situation

analysis needs to assess the capacity and role each of these actors have in the delivery of social
services. In addition, joint actions and cooperation with the regional units of several governmental
levels as well as centralized organizations will also need to be included.
Quality and effectiveness of service delivery. The situation analysis needs to include an assessment
of the quality and effectiveness of service delivery in order to draw meaningful conclusions for the
LEP planning and review processes. This should include an assessment of bottlenecks for both service
providers and users. Merely providing services to disadvantaged community members does not
necessarily result in their utilization. Service users’ (demand-side) bottlenecks, such as those related
to users’ awareness, access, affordability, opportunity costs, social norms, and risks need to be
assessed. Supply-side bottlenecks include insufficient financial and other resources, lack of
awareness how to deal with certain population groups, etc.
Analysis of major demographic trends. Since LEPs are planned for a period of five years and are – in
principle– reviewed every two years, it is important to follow major demographic trends since they
determine the composition of the local population and the evolution of issues, making use of up-to-
date data and annual surveys such as EU SILC. Young people's migration, as well as their temporary
or permanent employment abroad; people moving to escape poverty and in hope of a better life; the
fluctuation of willingness to have children; the health status of the community– these are all
important factors that may rearrange the situation and therefore the needs of a given part of the
community or group, even within the course of the five-year planning horizon.
Expected institutional and legal changes will affect the opportunities of relevant groups (e. g.
redesigning the school system and training, changing the rehabilitation system of the disabled).
When analyzing the situation and planning interventions for equal opportunity groups, these
expected future developments must be also borne in mind. For example, if the number of young
people is constantly decreasing, the demand for child-related benefits will also decrease. At the same
time, if child benefits are eliminated, it will not be attractive for young people (who will later become
parents) to work in the municipality, and they will end up migrating.


The purpose of the situation analysis is to get a clear understanding of service delivery constraints
to social inclusion that must be examined in their complexity, along with their impacts prevailing
over a longer time. A comprehensive situation analysis covering all elements as highlighted above,
requires a considerable level of capacity at the local level: investments in this should be a
particular priority for smaller local governments.

Extending local resources beyond local funding

The preparation of local strategic documents has become a common local responsibility over the last
few years. For example, individual sectoral strategies, planning of local service delivery, integrated
urban development strategies in cities and related action plans have been prepared on the basis of
local inter-sectoral dialogue and cooperation that have often proven to be effective in unveiling
additional local capacities and resources. In addition, during the 2007-2013 EU programming
period, many local governments and non-governmental organizations as well as their consortia have
developed a certain level of capacity and basic skills for project design, implementation and follow-
up, including identifying the solutions to solve funding difficulties and – sometimes necessary –
certain “tricks”. However, strategic planning and subsequent implementation of activities that
exceed the available local resources remains one of the key challenges municipalities face. This
section focuses on useful strategies which allow local actors to pragmatically handle this challenge.
Clearly identify the available local capacities and financial resources. In technical terms, when
preparing action plans responding to problems identified in the LEPs, it is a key issue to identify local
capacities and financial resources that can be used for the implementation of planned interventions.
For a more specific and more precisely planned activity it is easier to accurately identify the size and
type of resources necessary for its successful implementation. LEPs should focus on planning
activities for which resources are available, or where there is a good chance of obtaining these
resources.
Start with the budgeting of a “minimum package” – which can be scaled up later. The activities
covered by LEPs may include those financed by own budgetary resources, projects implemented
making use of EU co-financing, as well as solutions based on activities and capacities of other
organizations. Apart from the fact that the local government is capable of planning on the basis of
normative funding received from the central state budget, they will also be able to prepare their
plans on the basis of proposals related to the new Operational Programs to be opened in Fall 2015.
However, changes in centrally allocated funds may nullify calculations performed at the local level.
For all these reasons, planning of relevant LEP measures should be primarily based on demand, and
resource planning should be fully aligned with this. This may be achieved by planning a 1-2 year
"minimum package" which may then be extended to a larger-scale longer-term complex program
when additional funds become available.
Make use of relevant centrally subsidized programs. When planning the financial resources,
municipalities should consider i.e. factor in central government program subsidies that are "free"
and can be voluntarily utilized. Such opportunities to increase the resources for social support for
disadvantaged families are available within the scope of several central programs. For example:
-   The social heating fuel subsidy is a state support scheme introduced in 2011, which can be
    accessed by governments of municipalities that have less than 5,000 residents. They can use the
    subsidy to purchase heating fuel and distribute it among disadvantaged families.
-   Under a program aimed at providing summer meals for children, local governments can provide
    free summer meals for children receiving regular child protection assistance (the coverage of the
    grant depends on the size and the financial situation of the municipality).
A common feature of these two main programs is that participation depends on the local
governments' own initiative. The amount of subsidies that can be requested by or awarded to a given
local government is not enough to fully satisfy local needs, thus under certain limits, the local
governments have to decide themselves whom to include in the program, which requires delicate


                                                   11
balancing and thorough knowledge of the individual needs in the community. This can be ensured
through intense cooperation with social workers in the field.

Factor in resources for public works programs. One of the key responsibilities of municipalities is the
facilitation of local employment. This received an additional impetus from the launch of the
agricultural “Start work programs” active employment scheme 3.
The funding for local public works can serve two distinct purposes:
- running local services like local self-reliance, local food supply as well as sustainable local energy
     management as a social enterprise type activity, or
- Production of manually produced foods and crafts for sale on the market.
Within these schemes, both the energy supply for local government institutions and some of the raw
material supply for public catering of these institutions can be covered through employees in the
public works program. In case of agricultural production, apart from wages provided within the scope
of public work and the tools needed for production, local governments may also involve their own
lands in agricultural production and by using produce in the
local kitchens, significant savings can be achieved.                Municipalities as brokers of change for

services to a limited number of users. Unfortunately, in some          local immobile population (and

To tackle this challenge, external support in the form of              simply by negotiations with potential

It is important to pull together all these elements like a puzzle, and to harmonize the resources and
funding opportunities to reinforce the synergies between the various interventions.




Addressing local tensions and mobilizing local communities
Most local tensions are usually created between the general population of a municipality,
and impoverished and excluded groups – most typically Roma – or people living with
addictions or mental illness. The local government and political decision-makers should aim at
handling tensions, create the basis for cooperation between conflicting parties and open
communication if they wish to ensure that their measures be well-founded and accepted and the
results of their interventions be sustainable.

 Micro-regional Start work model programs were launched in 2012 and organised in the following employment
areas: agricultural projects, utilization of bio and renewable energy, draining of inland waters, repairing
agricultural roads, repairing the public road network, eliminating illegal waste disposal sites, as well as
establishing winter-time and other value-creating employment activities for people in the public employment
program. (Natonal Reform Programme of Hungary, 2012).

Communicate widely and regularly. It is especially important for local governments to widely
communicate their activities, programs and investments related to the poor, the Roma and other
equal opportunity target groups. This is the key to strengthening cohesion within the community so
as to ensure that no social group misunderstands the local government's intentions and to enable
mobilization and participation of the community in the planning and implementation of various
activities.
Debunk stereotypes and false sensitivities with facts and evidence. There are many communities
where everyday coexistence is marred by conflicts. For example, Roma families with no prospects of
success are victimized by targeted intimidating actions and everyday discrimination, v with the result
that these communities become increasingly closed and resigned, and their willingness to cooperate
is reduced. Tensions do not only exist between Roma and non-Roma, and the tolerance for other
equal opportunity target groups and their specific needs i.e. the need to invest resources for them, is
often small. In communities where the problem has reached a stage were tensions are a key
constraint, it should be openly communicated that cooperation for a common goal is needed and
worthwhile. This needs to be underpinned by evidence and factual information that debunk
myths, stereotypes and commonly held beliefs. Furthermore, decision-makers need to remember
that no political capital can be forged on the basis of these conflicts: on the long term, aggravated
conditions give rise to mistrust and fear, leading to irreparable fractures in local communities.
Develop a joint community goal and stay on message. The process of defining this common goal
should be implemented in a participatory and
inclusive manner in a step by step process, which Micro-projects as a tool for mediation and

        community leaders in solving the local problems affecting minorities. During mediation, a
        (local) mediator supported by an external mentor forms a bridge between decision-
        makers/local government and the target group. For that, mediators typically facilitate the
        formation of a community action group composed of community members who volunteer to
        participate. The mediator facilitates the proper set-up, functioning and activities of the
        group. For a community action group to be successful, it is important to be able to define
        itself along specifically defined tasks, i. e. that they have "real" mandates towards the local
        government. The ideal outcome of the formation of community action groups is that they
        work together with decision-makers in a common planning process (for example, as a
        micro-project) and reach a consensus with regard to ranking and prioritizing local problems
        potential solutions.
It is important to remember that professional service provider organizations also participate in
shaping the dialog. While these organizations cannot replace the bridge actor or address the target
group, they can facilitate open communication and bring intentions to a common denominator. It is
essential for local government staff to recognize that one can rely on these organizations and the
relevant effects of this cooperation.
    2. Community workers and coaching
The second effective approach to address community tensions, is to make use of community
workers and coaches. vi Community workers and coordinators will learn necessary competencies
within the framework of a training program. Since this training is not subject to qualifications, people
living in the community with the ambitions to help others may enter this career. The work is
coordinated by mentors. Volunteer coordinators are involved to sustain the process as they remain
in the municipality after project closure. Community workers and professionals, e. g. municipal
workers discuss in joint professional workshops the locally "supported" issues (these vary from
community to community, but the organization of community events as micro-projects appears
nearly everywhere). A key element for success is that the role and work of the community workers
has a high level of visibility and differences can be perceived by the general public within the course
of a few months, and local governments and educational institutions can rely on their work and
contributions.

Guidance Note 3: Navigating the pitfalls of raising and managing funds
for social inclusion
The availability of adequate financial resources is one of the key binding constraints for the
implementation of social inclusion interventions and most communities rely heavily on raising
external funds - particularly EU funding - to finance local interventions. With the roll-out of the 2014-
2020 financing period, considerable amounts of EU funds will be available under relevant
Operational Programs (OPs) for the implementation of local equal opportunity interventions. The
most important OPs in this context are the Human Resources Development Operational Program
(HRDOP) and the Regional and Local Development Operational Program (RLDOP). vii The most
relevant priority axes for the financing of local social inclusion interventions are
    •    in HRDOP: 1. Strengthening social cooperation (ESF), and 2. Infrastructural investments in
         order to strengthen social co-operation (ERDF);
    •    in RLDOP: 4. Development of local community services and strengthening of social
         cooperation (ERDF); 5. County-based and local human resource development, employment
         promotion, social cooperation (ESF); 6. Sustainable urban development in county capitals
         (ERDF and ESF) and 7. Community-led local urban development (ERDF and ESF).
The major stumbling block of fundraising emanates from the fact that development funds including
EU funds are still largely available in a competitive bidding system for the relevant communities,
although the proportion of funds allocated locally from the outset is increasing. Moreover, in the
competitive bidding system, neither the subject and time of call for proposals, nor the likelihood of
winning a call can be predicted.
Many communities are constrained to aligning their development plans to the resources that can be
easily obtained, instead of aligning resources for well-formulated development ideas. This leads to
the common practice that the well-formulated and integrated development plans get abandoned for
supply-driven, ad—hoc and opportunistic fund raising activities. Experiences have shown that this
constraint may often lead to ineffective or even harmful projects in the medium term, including
projects that are unsuccessful due to the absence of sufficient horizontal integration, complexity and
preparation time. For example, such investments can be completely annihilated in the absence of
long-term social work.
Against this background, this Guidance Note aims to support communities in accessing resources for
strategic, integrated and well-prepared initiatives
        What can be done without external resources?
External resources (such as EU funding) are broadly believed to be the prerequisite for the financing
of comprehensive social inclusion interventions. There is no doubt that practically in all communities
where positive changes have been recorded, large amounts of external funds, budgetary as well as
EU support, were used. However, it is also equally true that external resources only started to flow
after several years of intensive preparatory work aiming to prepare the ground to address local
needs and stimulate demand. In addition, these interventions included external resources only if and
when they were contributing towards very specific development objectives of the intervention.
The initial lack of external resources should therefore not discourage communities to plan, pursue
and adequately initiate their complex social inclusion interventions. Important gains can also be
realized with relatively little financial investment during a period of preparatory work which
addresses local demands as well as “soft issues” such a community mobilization or tensions early on.
Example of reflecting local demand without funding: relocating a bus stop
In the city of Pécs, in the course of preparatory activities, the community has highlighted a serious
logistical constraint: children going to school had to cross busy Route 66 which had no pedestrian
crossing, to reach the nearest bus stop. When the local government and the transport company

                                                   15
realized this problem, they moved the bus stop to make it possible for the bus to stop before turning
onto the main road.
It is also important to note that investments implemented through external resources have an
impact on the local governments’ operating expenditures. Several local governments invested in
‘prestige projects’ and encountered difficulties with covering the increased operating costs. Other
local governments invested in activities that decreased operating costs. The case study of Gyulaj
(Annex I) – where vegetables and meat produced are utilized in the local government’s kitchen and
wood chips produced are used for heating the local government’s buildings – highlights an example
of this.
      What are the internal capacities that should be developed for writing
      proposals and managing social inclusion projects?
Communities need both: internal capacity as well as external expertise and support in order to
successfully access external funds. They should not substitute one for the other. It should therefore
be established as a minimum objective by the local decision makers that the municipality has both:
internal capacities and access to an external network of professional service providers that enable
the planning of project goals and activities, identifying relevant calls for proposals, and consciously
involving and supervising external consultants
Some municipalities have made significant gains by investing into project development capacity, such
as internal monitoring of calls, writing proposals, developing project management skills, applying for
external funding to provide for their own financial contribution, with a view to participate in as
many calls as possible. One of the best known examples is Alsómocsolád with less than three
hundred residents where the local government has been awarded EU funding every year since 2009,
about 120 million HUF (over 300 000 EUR) on average per year. viii However, due to the significant
borrowing needs related to the requirement to provide own contributions, by 2012 the village has
become one of the most indebted communities (in terms of debt per capita), which demonstrates
the limitations of this strategy. ix
      How can engagement with professional service providers help the
      municipality?
Broad engagement with professional service providers can be an effective way for developing
projects. Such engagement should be developed with a view to enable the municipality to learn from
project experience, as well as to identifying relevant funding opportunities. There are several
organizations with various profiles, some with activities at national level (see Máltai Szeretetszolgálat
and Autonómia Alapítvány further down), others with activities e.g. at county level (e.g. the
association of Roma leaders in Nógrád x, SZETA Eger in Heves xi).
Two examples of organizations with significant field presence throughout the country are the
Hungarian Maltese Charity and the Autonómia Foundation.
The Hungarian Maltese Charity (Máltai Szeretetszolgálat xii) is involved in a number of programs,
partly as program owner (e.g. Miskolc, Pécs, Tatabánya, Veszprém, Monor, Gyulaj, Tarnabod) and
partly as a contributor (e.g. children's chance programs in eight districts in Northern Hungary, North
Great Plain and South Transsdanubia).
The Autonómia Foundation (Autonómia Alapítvány xiii) has several years of experience in professional
support of developing local equal opportunity projects. The Foundation operates the Norwegian and
Swiss non-governmental funds providing resources for small-scale equal opportunity developments
of non-governmental organizations.

        How can external consultants provide help to the municipality?
The experience of cooperation between municipalities and consultants providing proposal writing
and project management services ranges widely. There are examples of cooperation that helped
facilitate the goals of the relevant municipality with specific knowledge and capacities adapted to the
timing requirements. There is also a broad range of negative experiences, for example stereotypical
projects not tailored to the needs of the community. Cooperation with external consultants can have
positive effects if the following requirements are observed:
    •    Limit the role of the consultant at planning stage. The development vision, and subsequent
         planning of project goals and activities are not the responsibility of the consultant, they
         remain the exclusive responsibility of the local government and local community. In this
         phase, therefor, the consultants’ role should be very limited to providing advice and
         feedback on technical aspects such as targeting, developing relevant indicators, facilitating
         community needs assessments, etc.
    •    Identifying relevant opportunities for proposals is also primarily the local government's
         responsibility. It is of course impossible to follow all opportunities (the number of which may
         run up to several hundred at any given time), but it is better to rely on professional
         relationships than asking consultants for help. The reason for preferring professional service
         providers is that they may find it easier to advise based on local needs while consultants may
         be more biased by other considerations such as the potential amount of the grant.
    •    Get the right profile for the specific TA needs that need to be covered by the consultant.
         The municipality should proactively search for Consultants with the right profile, instead of
         passively accepting candidates who “volunteer” for the task. If possible, consultants
         specializing in local equal opportunity projects, with significant project references and
         (ideally) with recommendations by other municipalities or organizations should be sought.
         Specialized consultants are not only able to help in technical issues related to calls (for
         example, completing forms) but also in sharing professional experience from other projects
         and recommending professional partners.
    •    Establish long-term relationships with the consultants. The better a consultant knows a
         community, the more he or she will be able to get a thorough understanding of the
         municipality’s needs, capacity, resources, social dynamics etc. All of which are important
         factors that the consultant will need to take into consideration to carry out his work. It is
         therefore preferable to invest in long-term relationships with consultants, encompassing
         several projects, with a view to form a common vision and shared sense of direction. This will
         moreover contribute to a better coordination across activities with a view to generate a
         maximum of synergies.
    •    Maintain a client-contractor relationship. Boundaries between the responsibility of the local
         government and that of the local consultant should not be blurred. For that, local
         governments must retain the role of the client who actively instructs, and supervises the
         consultant. The consultant must retain the role of a “contractor” delivering on a specific task
         based on well-defined Terms of References. Experiences have shown that particularly in
         smaller communities with limited capacities blurring the boundaries between the
         responsibilities of the local government and the consultant i.e. cases where the local
         government had de facto "handed over the reins" to the consultants can set the local social
         inclusion agenda on the wrong footing and produce potentially damaging consequences.

Guidance Note 4: Participatory Monitoring
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is critical for results on social inclusion – particularly at the local
level. Attention to the design and implementation of M&E are essential for adequate performance
measurement of inclusion interventions. This in turn will help enhance transparency and
accountability of service providers. Participation is increasingly being recognized as being integral to
the M&E process, since it offers new ways of assessing and learning from change that are more
inclusive, and more responsive to the needs and aspirations of those most directly affected. This
tendency has led to the development of Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation (PM&E), a process
through which stakeholders at various levels – including community members and in particular
members of the target groups - engage in monitoring or evaluating a particular project, program or
policy, share control over the content, the process and the results of the M&E activity, and engage in
taking or identifying corrective actions. PM&E is geared towards not only measuring the
effectiveness of a project, but also towards improved communication, building ownership and
empowering beneficiaries; building accountability and transparency; and taking corrective actions to
improve performance and outcomes. Core principles of PM&E are:
     •   primary stakeholders are active participants – not just sources of information
     •   building capacity of local people to analyze, reflect and take action
     •   joint learning of stakeholders at various levels
     •   enables continuous and ongoing feedback
     •   catalyzes commitment to taking corrective actions
Key steps for conducting PM&E include:
1.          Call a general meeting to ask who would be interested in participating in the monitoring
            exercise. It is important to check if community members actually have the time for this
            activity.
2.          Once the community decides who wishes to join, the facilitator meets with the group at a
            time convenient to them.
3.          The facilitator builds consensus on the purpose of the exercise, clarifies his/her role,
            expectations, and reviews the schedule.
4.          Community members then identify the M&E questions they want answered related to the
            project activity.Questions come solely from the community; there are no predetermined
            questions or forms from thefacilitators. The group then brainstorms ways to collect the
            data and who should be responsible for data
            collection.
5.          Once the data is gathered, the group meets again to analyze it and reach consensus on
            findings, conclusions,
            and recommendations.
6.          The group then reports to the larger community and together they prepare a plan of
            action to improve
            performance if needed.

A range of instruments exist for carrying out specific participatory monitoring and evaluation. The
relevance and applicability of these tools depends on the context, depending on “who leads and who
follows” PM&E, what is the purpose of PM&E, and at which level (inputs, activities, outputs,
outcomes and/or impacts) is PM&E conducted.
Two key instruments of PM&E 4 that can be particularly relevant for the local level in Hungary in the
context of locally implemented social inclusion interventions are (i) Citizen Report Cards; and (ii)
Community Scorecards. Citizen Report Cards are participatory surveys that provide quantative
feedback on user perceptions on the quality, adequacy and efficiency of public services. They go
beyond just being a data collection exercise to being an instrument to exact public accountability
through the extensive media coverage and civil society advocacy that accompanies the process.
Community Scorecards are qualitative monitoring tools that are used for local level monitoring and
performance evaluation of services, projects and even government administrative units by the
communities themselves. Like the citizen report card, the CSC process is an instrument to exact social
and public accountability and responsiveness from service providers. However, by including
an interface meeting between service providers and the community that allows for immediate
feedback, the process is also a strong instrument for empowerment.

    Guidance Note 5: Problem-solving trees as a tool to unbundle
    complex social inclusion challenges
This module elaborates how the complex problems revealed in LEPs (or other strategic documents)
can be broken down into individual elements, and which of these elements can be best addressed at
the local level. Three life situations are introduced below. As an introduction, we will describe the
extent and social “roots” of the problem, and then the corresponding chapters of the LEPs where the
local government is supposed to address these or related issues. Then we list the steps leading to
planning the relevant measures, the most critical questions for handling life situations, and the
specific answers and interventions that are possible in response to the latter. Finally, a list of
targeted resource links is attached to each problem tree.
Our examples are as follows:
    1. Problem-solving Tree #1: Children growing up in single-earner families with poorly educated
       parents (the role of transfers is significant in household economies) who may be affected by
       early school leaving and are difficult to involve in program for children.
    2. Problem-solving Tree #2: Low-skilled Roma women with children who have been excluded
       from the labor market,
    3. Problem-solving Tree #3: The elderly and people with disabilities who live isolated from the
       community and do not have access to public services.
These examples have been selected through stakeholder consultations that had revealed them to be
among the most pressing challenges municipalities face. Furthermore, these challenges demonstrate
complex individual situations that – by the nature of their complexity – require comprehensive and
targeted solutions by the municipality. The work process elaborated in the following problem-solving
trees can of course be adapted and applied to other, including less complex challenges.

Problem-solving Tree #1: Children growing up in single-earner families
    with poorly educated parents (the role of transfers is significant in
    household economies) who may be affected by early school leaving and
    are difficult to mobilize to participate in targeted programs for
    children
    1. Introduction: the root of social problems and management aims.


Early school leaving
In Hungary, early school leaving affects children in disadvantaged families with poorly educated
parents more than anyone else. The drop-out rate of Roma students is especially significant. Young
Roma students are 25% more likely to drop out of the full-time school system as opposed to non-
Roma children from similarly disadvantaged backgrounds. As a result, there is a significant difference
between the Roma and non-Roma population. The extent of early school leaving in Hungary has
exceeded 11 percent. The ratio of children from poorly educated families (where parents' education
levels are no higher than eight grades) is as high as 15 percent among primary school pupils.


Employment opportunities
One of the most pressing problems in Hungarian is the high inactivity of those with low education
levels. Employment difficulties mostly affect those with poor qualifications and living in
disadvantaged regions. They are among the most vulnerable group on the labor market since the
labor market demand for people with little to no qualifications is progressively declining. In Hungary,
the ratio of those with only primary school education is extremely low even by international
standards. However, whereas in the European Union, within the 20-64 age group, more than half of
poorly educated persons are working, in Hungary, this figure is just over one third. Thus, the
prospects for people leaving school after primary education are much less favorable for people
Hungary than for those in other countries. This is particularly the case for young people. In today’s
Hungary, early school leavers will inevitable become unemployed.


Reducing inherited social disadvantage
Early tracking in the Hungarian education system poses a particular challenge as it reinforces already
existing disadvantages stemming from family circumstances. Which means that it essentially
produces a cycle of poverty, and thus, social inequality. To tackle this issue, addressing the causes of
early school leaving is particularly important. Handling the problems of early school leaving and
increasing the employment chances of low-skilled workers go hand in hand, because the
unemployment rate cannot be significantly reduced on the long term without investments into
education.


    2. Steps of identifying the problems in the LEP.


The outline of Local Equal Opportunity Plans, as it is defined in the regulations, has a separate
chapter which summarizes the situation and opportunities of Roma and those living in extreme
poverty. This section analyzes their income and financial circumstances, as well as employment
status. In later chapters, a separate section is devoted to the employment of low-skilled persons.
The subsequent sections of the LEP are designed to explore, among other things, the number of the
employed, the unemployed and the long-term unemployed, the mobility, level of information and

                                                  21
other factors of access to employment (e. g. transport, potential job opportunities, planned
investment projects, potential enterprise areas, local/regional employment programs, etc.) as well as
programs facilitating employment of young people and transition from education to the labor
market including the access of young people to education and continuous training.
The LEP addresses in yet another chapter the situation and equal opportunities of children. The
chapter discusses separately the general characteristics of the situation of children, the situation of
children living in segregated, slum-like environments, the access to services for children with
disabilities and those from severely disadvantaged backgrounds. Finally this chapter also reviews
the public education opportunities and equal opportunities for children/students requiring special
attention or living with disabilities.
For this problem-solving tree, the complexity of the defined problem as the “situation of children
with low-educated parents growing up in single-earner families, who may be affected by early school
leaving, and who are difficult to mobilize to participate in targeted programs for children” means that
other subchapters of the LEP may also be relevant in terms of the situation analysis (e. g. the chapter
describing the situation of slums and segregated communities).
Thus, LEPs are making an effort to tackle the problems from various angles in an attempt to support
communities with the identification of the needs and the related necessary measures in a well
thought through manner. However, in practice, both the relevant statements and the proposal for
action remain at the level of generalities. We can see in many places that communities cite statistics
related to disadvantaged children, but they fail to add the other problems that may occur in the
specific family environments, and the specific remedies that are possible in those circumstances.
    3. Planning specific measures for the LEP
When completing the LEP action table, the needs arising from the problem analysis should be used as
a starting point to identify existing local capacities to address these challenges.
                 The first step for the local government is to assess the number and situation of
                 single-earner families with poorly educated parents. For this purpose, they should
                 consult the educational sector (information that kindergarten teachers and school
teachers can provide on school-aged children whose academic advancement is questionable due to
family circumstances), the social sector (family support and child welfare professionals - information
on critical situations and endangered children is available here). Data related to the disadvantaged
status and extremely disadvantaged status should be collated with this information (even the data
sets prior to the regulatory changes in 2013) to help determine the number of persons belonging to
this category and where they live in the community (e. g. some of them may be segregated) and
whether their number increases, decreases or is stagnant (at least for 2-3 years ahead). Important
information can be obtained from minority representations, civil groups engaged in social integration
and religious organizations, as well. The creation of a target group-specific community working
groups can be a useful initiative, as well (in which Roma are also involved in, see also the section on
mediation and social work in Guidance Note 2)


In order to break the inter-generational poverty cycle, it is necessary that children from
disadvantaged backgrounds and where parents have low levels of education get adequately
supported in accessing learning opportunities. The earlier this happens, the better. Experiences
have shown that investing in early-childhood education is one of the most successful ways in
addressing inequalities. While early childhood education is one focus area, adequate support will
need to be provided to children and their families to ensure education gets completed. This
includes intensive family support work and a focus on targeted second-chance education and
training programs to increase the parents’ labor market opportunities. Focusing simultaneously on


                                                  22
parents and children will make it possible that poverty is no longer passed on from parents to
children.


                The second step is to thoroughly think through the challenges and opportunities
                that families face in these circumstances.



Four fundamental questions need to be considered:


 1.   Is sufficient capacity available for early childhood education?
 2.   Are there any second chance education or other training options available for parents?
 3.   Are there any jobs available?
 4.   Are there any extra-curricular activities available for disadvantaged children?



Within the scope of the community working group and with the help of institutional and civil society
actors, it should be explored for which family members additional support and services will be
needed, how these services and support structures will be organized, and what resources will be
needed to cover for those services over the next 2-3 years. These issues are discussed in detail
below.




                  1. Is sufficient capacity available for early childhood education?

                                                   YES
Comparisons of the demographic data with the capacities of the institutions revealed that there is
sufficient capacity for the 0-3 kindergarten age children in the existing municipality-run institutions.
This includes taking into account other service providers’ capacities (e.g. family day-care, employer-
run day care, foundation-run or religious institutions). In addition to the capacities to accommodate
all children, the researchers also assessed the institutional capacities to provide additional more
targeted early childhood development services, such as physiotherapists, speech therapists,
development teachers, and whether the offer is sufficient to cover the needs of the entire
population within the locality (i.e. taking not only into account those children that are already
enrolled but also those that are currently not yet participating in the early childhood development
services).
If relevant capacities ensuring sufficient early childhood education are available, it is very important
to facilitate the access of disadvantaged children to relevant services (e. g. by campaigns, subsidized
meals, etc.) and to inform parents on early development and access opportunities to the latter (and
their potential yields). For that a sufficient number of social workers need to be available to reach
out to and work with families who have particularly high needs for mobilization.


Examples:
   - Early childhood development (0-5 years of age): guiding parents into the children's house
      where development takes place together with parents, typically in the morning hours,

                                                   23
           support for nursery enrollment / making available family day care by subsidizing
           compensation fees.
    -      Making other additional services available: local pedagogical services, speech therapy
           developments, psychological counseling and therapy, local mother-baby and children's
           clubs, sports associations (e. g. supported by local foundations) cooperation with primary
           art institutions and volunteers.
    -      getting parents interested: launching gymnastics clubs/cooking clubs/training courses
           (childcare, for example, with the help of volunteers); supporting the organization of self-
           help groups; mediation between health care providers and the family (e. g. dentistry,
           internal medicine and screening)



                     1. Is sufficient capacity available for early childhood education?

                                                    NO

Comparison of the demographic data and the capacities of the institutions revealed that there is
currently not sufficient capacity for the 0-3 kindergarten age children inside the municipality-run
institutions, even if other service provider capacities are being taken into consideration (e.g. family
day-care, employer-run, foundation-run or religious institutions). In addition to the accommodation
capacities, the researchers also assessed the development capacities available in the institutions,
such as physiotherapist, speech therapist, development teachers, and also to what extent these
capacities answer the service needs of the entire population in the age group (that is not only the
needs of the children provided for in the institutions). If the above have been assessed and it is
ascertained that there is not sufficient early childhood development capacity available, it is
necessary to explore the potential solutions, such as convincing key players in other settlements, at
district or county level that investing in additional capacities is a priority.
In addition to raising funds to fill the capacity gap for early childhood development services, it will
be important to sensitize and train local community council and specialist staff in the various
municipal institutions on the importance of early childhood development.


Examples:
   - Launching early childhood development programs (e. g. Sure Start Children's House - Biztos
      Kezdet Gyerekház). In an optimal scenario, apart from facilitating children's development,
      programs for early childhood development activities would support their families as well.
      The most successful interventions are those that simultaneously address the children's
      education needs, social competencies and the quality of family interactions. Apart from the
      development of children, cooperation with the parents is an important element for the
      relevant programs. The aim of the relationship established with the latter is providing
      training for parents, improving their positions in the labor market, improving parent-child
      relationships and developing child-rearing skills.


        2. Are there any second chance education or other training options available for parents?

                                                    YES

Having assessed the size and composition of the parent group with low education level and skills for

                                                     24
which there is little or no demand in the labor market, the sectors, in cooperation with the
employment service provider and the local training organizations established that sufficient and
attractive training opportunities are available locally or within easy reach.
If second-chance type and other training programs are available, it is to be found out whether the
parents with low education know these opportunities and know how to access them. If the affected
parents fail to make use of these training opportunities, it is necessary to identify the obstacles that
prevent them from doing so (e.g. lack of motivation, no childminding capacity, no money for the
commuting, black work of such schedule that prevents them to attend the training) and to provide
intensive social work/family care to address the issues and mobilize parents to participate in the
training programs.

Examples:
   - Continuous communication of the available training possibilities for the parents with low
      education. The organization of community programs which enable informal discussion of
      the benefits of such training could help increase their motivation.
   - Support or organize the commute of the participants to the training (if it cannot be solved
      with public transport, a village bus can also be used).
   - If necessary, provision of child-care service for the duration of the training classes. This
      service can also be provided on a voluntary basis, with the involvement of parents who do
      not attend the training.




                                                   25
     2. Are there any second chance education or other training options available for parents?

                                                 NO

Having assessed the size and composition of the parent group with low education level and skills for
which there is little or no demand on the labor market, the sectors, in cooperation with the
employment service provider and the local training organizations established that not sufficient and
attractive training opportunities are available locally or within easy reach. In this case the local
decision makers have the following options:
    - organize commute to more remote training points and motivate the training institutions and
         the trainee (e.g. with scholarships) to participate
    - Bring the training programs to the locality, e.g. second chance type programs for the
         younger people and other adult training programs for the older ones.

Examples:
   - Launch of second chance-type training program: explore EU funds and partners, develop
      capacities necessary to launch the program.
              - Give more information to relevant employers about the problems and the
                   solution possibilities (learn the experiences of already operating programs even
                   in the framework of a joint study trip, see some examples below)
              - Explore potential resources, partners. The different types of organizations
                   (budget-run institutions, civil organizations, religious organizations etc.) may
                   have access to different types of funds, so these should be mapped jointly.
              - Make preparations for accessing the resources (e.g. develop/increase
                   management capacities needed to write EU applications, identify potential
                   partners)
   - For the training programs designed for parents with low education level or skills for which
      there is little or no demand in the labor market, continuous support including through
      social workers is crucial. This can radically reduce the risk of participants dropping out.
   - When developing the frameworks for the training programs, it is necessary to keep the life
      situation of the trainings’ target group in mind. E.g. seasonal work has to be taken into
      consideration when timing the start of the training program. If necessary, child-minding
      services have to be provided for the duration of the classes. If possible, the program should
      be organized locally, if this is not possible, it is necessary to facilitate the participants’
      commute to the place of the training.




                                                 26
                                   3. Are there any jobs available?

                                                 YES
Having assessed the size and composition of the parent group with low education level and skills for
which there is little or no demand in the labor market, the sectors, in cooperation with the
employment service provider and the local training organizations established that sufficient and
free employment opportunities are available locally or within easy reach. In this case it is important
to explore the obstacles to getting into these jobs.


Examples:
   - Promoting a dialog between parents and employment services, if necessary facilitate
      through/accompanied by social workers
   - Introduction of alternative forms of employment in own institutions (e.g. part-time work)
   - Organization of access to workplaces (public transport or subsidies for employer)


                                   3. Are there any jobs available?

                                                  NO


Having assessed the size and composition of the parent group with low education level and skills for
which there is little or no demand in the labor market, the sectors, in cooperation with the
employment service provider and the local training organizations established that insufficient
employment opportunities are available locally or within easy reach.
Examples:
- Develop longer-term job creation strategy:
        - To develop the strategy it is necessary to build a strong relationship with the employers and
businesses within easy reach of the settlement
        - It is necessary to take into account the possibilities offered by the social economy (e.g. map
families that are able and willing to engage in some business activities with the support of a micro-
loan or those activities that could combine public work programs with value-creating activities but
need additional support and resources for that). These possibilities have to be communicated to the
target group with the involvement of mediators, social workers, employment services officials, etc.
- Promote employment in another settlement e.g. through the organization and support of the
commute


         4. Are there any extra-curricular programs available for disadvantaged children?

                                                  YES
The sectors, in cooperation with the families, reviewed the extra-curricular programs and come to
the conclusion that they are attractive and available also to the disadvantaged children. They also
identified reasons why those who do not attend these programs stay away (e.g. lack of awareness,
shame, rejection, difficulty to reach, parents do not trust the organizers or the service providers).
In these cases the municipality informs the parents through the institutions and the family helpers
of the available services, makes publicity for the services /programs and links the service providers

                                                  27
and the children in order to facilitate their involvement in the given programs. It encourages and
holds the organizers and service providers accountable to give priority access to disadvantaged
children to relevant services and program and thus enhance their participation in the local
community and develop new relationships. The municipality furthermore promotes the expansion
and availability of these activities e.g. by opening school facilities for the programs or providing
other suitable venues.

Examples:
   - Organization of open days and open activities so that awareness about programs already
      underway is increased
   - Support for travelling to programs/transportation and if necessary, (financial) support of
      participation
   - Presentation of those administering extra-curricular programs in various local events (or for
      instance at schools), promotion of services.
   - Mobilization of participants from disadvantaged backgrounds through social workers who
      also help to build trust between service providers and the families of disadvantaged
      children


         4. Are there any extra-curricular programs available for disadvantaged children?

                                                  NO

If the situation analysis reveals that although there are certain extra-curricular programs,
disadvantaged children do not or not sufficiently participate, it is necessary to explore and handle the
causes preventing such participation (e. g. the organization of transport, providing food, building
trust with parents by involving parents).
In the case that extra-curricular programs are currently not successful, various formal and informal
activities should be organized depending on available resources (e. g. study halls, programs based
making use of companies’ social responsibility programs or through volunteering). It is important that
these programs are as attractive and easily accessible as possible, traveling to the program sites
should not cause a problem. Carefully choosing the timing for the activities and the provider is also
very important (e. g. for study hall type problems, it is not favorable if the sessions are being held by
the same teachers with whom students are constantly together during the day). It is important to
encourage as much as possible that children from various and different backgrounds participate in
these programs to avoid the stigmatization of the programs (e.g. only non-Roma children attend
certain programs in the community house, while other clubs only have Roma patrons).

Examples:
- Organizing learning support programs (e.g. launching study hall programs) for primary and
secondary school students. These programs can be financed by making use of available EU grant
resources, but it is important to underline that study hall type activities can easily with minimum
budget resources through volunteering (e.g. involving peer helpers, university students, high school
students involved in community services).
- Organization of sport programs or clubs (free or easily affordable with financial support options)
which can rely on professional coaches or volunteers, even seasonally.



                                                   28
- Organization of play houses e.g. with the involvement of volunteers which will also create valuable
opportunity for the local pedagogical service and the teachers to learn more about the
disadvantaged families and their challenges.
- Cultural clubs – e.g. drama, music, dance, and language groups which can attract young people
from a broad circle
- Organization of leisure spaces, e.g. with the provision of computers (and games) and internet
access where the children can spend their free time in a safe and supervised environment

Problem-solving Tree #2: Low-skilled Roma women with children who have
    been excluded from the labor market
        1. Introduction: the root of social challenges and objectives
Reasons for labor market exclusion among low-skilled women with young children
In Hungary, the labor market disadvantages of low-skilled women with children exceedsthose of
childless single women multiple times. While in younger age groups, four-fifths of single women
without children are employed, only one in every third mother with two and one in every tenth
mother with three children is active. With the increase in the number of children (and the presence
of a partner), the relevant opportunities are reduced further since the available places in nurseries
(or in kindergartens in many places) are insufficient, the number of flexible or part-time positions is
low, so family responsibilities and workplace requirements are difficult to reconcile. Furthermore,
benefits related to child-rearing, which to some extent compensate for the absence of available day
care spots, xiv provide additional incentives for spending longer periods at home. xv


Low-skilled women and family responsibilities
In places where there are no jobs for low skilled women, childbearing may substitute for labor
market activity. xvi At the same time, women in general take greater responsibility in fulfilling
domestic and household-related tasks, and this is even more so when they are not employed and
mostly perform tasks related to raising children. While an average European woman works 2-3
hours more in the household than her husband, this excess has reached 4-5 hours in Hungary. Due to
traditional gender norms, a large share of Roma women from traditional communities are typically
required to carry out the lion share these household tasks which makes it particularly difficult for
them to find any form of second-chance education, skills development, training or employment
opportunities that compatible with their responsibilities at home. xvii


Preventing self-perpetuating cycles of poverty
The employment rate of Roma women is only 10%, compared to the nearly 60% ratio of the female
population. xviii Nearly three-quarter of Roma families live in poverty, which is passed on from one
generation to the next. xix In order to prevent a legacy of social disadvantages in a family, it is
especially important to handle the causes of workplace exclusion of low-skilled Roma women, and
to ensure that mothers with children become activated as soon as possible. This will have several
short-, medium- and long-term benefits: immediately the families will have more disposable income,
a greater focus would be put on investing into the education of their children and parents (and in
particular mothers who are known to be particularly important in this context) can serve as role
models for their children. All of the above would increase the chances of children to complete their
education and enter the labor market xx.


        2. Steps for identifying the problems in the LEP
The LEP summarizes in one distinct chapter the situation of women, their equal opportunities,
addressing their employment status, participation in training, and devoting a special section to the
employment opportunities of women of low educational attainment. Another section of the LEP is
intended to assess the scope of services facilitating the reconciliation of labor market and family
responsibilities (e. g. availability of nursery, family day care, kindergarten places; shortage of places,
in public institutions flex time, family-friendly workplace solutions, etc.), the operation of institutions
related to family planning as well as maternal and child health care. In this same chapter, the LEP
addresses the topic of violence against women, domestic violence and lists the services available in a

                                                    30
crisis. It encourages communities to explore women's role in local public life and finally, to
demonstrate the social problems increasingly affecting women at the local level and the specific
initiatives taken to eradicate these problems. This section of the LEP is concluded by a problem and
as a response, a table presenting the given development opportunities.
Since in our case, the problem has not "only" been defined as women's situation but specifically that
of low-skilled Roma women, other subsections of LEP may also be relevant with regard to situational
analysis (chapters regarding Roma, people living in poverty).
Often it is not clear from LEPs to what extent those in need utilize services that are available i.e. are
expected to be accessed in other communities. This is largely due to the fact that the LEP structure
itself and the resources and templates that are made available for the planning procedures do not
record or reflect this dimension. At the same time, horizontal connections are often missing, e.g. for
the planning of concrete labor market activation measures for low-skilled mothers, it must also be
explored where and at what costs the necessary childcare services available and how many of the
local children would need such services - only available elsewhere - and how many of them are
unable to reach this service because they do not know about it or they have not realized their need,
or the location or date of the service is simply unavailable, etc. When planning the LEP, this
information must be explored, as well in order to program concrete steps and organize them into
relevant actions.
Thus, in theory, the LEP is trying to grasp from a various angles the problems related to the situation
of low-skilled Roma women, and as a function of the thoroughness of the problem analysis,
communities will be able to identify and prepare more systematically those measures which aim to
tackle these multi-dimensional challenges. In practice, however, it appears that both the analysis
and the proposals for actions remain at the general i.e. superficial level (e. g. “we do not know the
severity of the acute problem” or the direction of local processes and the range of interventions is
rarely more specific than statement such as "expanding employment", "create extra services"). On
their way to identifying and implementing specific steps, local governments need more precise
guidance and access to tried and tested approaches.




                                                   31
        3. Planning specific measures of LEP
When completing the LEP action table, the needs arising due to the given social problems should be
used as a starting consideration and opportunities on local capacities as a basis. However, it is a
general experience that low-skilled Roma mothers without access to the labor market as a target
group are not defined, so we have no more precise information on either its magnitude or the
internal composition.
                Therefore, the first step is that the local government should consult the health care
                sector (nurses and paediatricians who have an accurate view of the families), the
                social sector (family support and child welfare professionals - information is available
here on critical situations and vulnerable children) and the educational sector (information of
kindergarten teachers and school teachers on children of school age whose academic advancement
is questionable due to family circumstances. They can help determine the number of persons
belonging to this category and where they live in the community (e. g. some of them may be
segregated) and whether their number increases, decreases or is stagnant (at least for 2-3 years
ahead). Important information can be obtained from minority representations, civil groups engaged
in social integration and religious organizations, as well. The creation of a target group-specific
community working groups would be useful as well (for that please also refer to the section
on mediation and development also in Guidance Note 2)
The objective of reviewing the existing services, support structures, capacities and available
resources is threefold (i) to support the activation of low-skilled Roma mothers into regular jobs ;
(ii) to provide these women and their families with the necessary support to be able to reconcile
work with domestic and child-case chores; and (iii) to provide mothers with resources that allow
them to proactively support their children’s education to ensure that they successfully complete
their education. These three objectives will help to break the cycle of poverty and ensure it will not
continue to be passed on from one generation to the next.


               The second step is a thorough analysis of the difficulties and opportunities of
               families in this situation.



Three fundamental questions need to be considered:


    1. Has the social/healthcare/education sector data revealed the entire set of needs?
    2. Has the family recognized that their children's education is important and do they know
       how they can be supported?
    3. Are the families forced out of the local community life?



With the help of institutional and civil society actors, it should be explored within the scope of the
working group for what part of the families involved there are further tasks to be fulfilled, what
development needs arise and how it is best to organize them and what their resource need is for 2-3
years.     The       above       issues       are      discussed       on     the      next      page.




                                                  32
    1. Has the intersectoral working group revealed the whole set of needs or have they been
                                        revealed before?


                                                 YES


That is: a table/description including numbers, ratios, and trends is available and the relevant
actors/institutions can see the group of people whose problems they have to tackle.




   Have they contacted relevant support services capable of handling the given problems and
                                   other service providers?


                       YES                                                  NO
                                                           The local government should promote
                                                       cooperation and case management work (e. g.
       Have they prepared individual case
                                                         through donation, additional allocation to
              management plans?
                                                         participating institutions e. g. using tender
                                                                  money/own foundation).
 Have they determined what actor monitors the       Steps:
   family and the effectiveness of supporting
                                                        STRENGTHENING OF CASE MANAGEMENT:
         work/services and how often?

                                                         for internet use e. g in club sessions with

                                                         creating a foundation capable of providing
                                                          resources to manage complex problems


                                                  33
    1. Has the intersectoral working group revealed the whole set of needs or have they been
                                        revealed before?
                                                  NO


We need to know the following:
-    How many families are there with low-skilled Roma women with small children who are
     unemployed or only have very uncertain opportunities on the labor market (e. g. they can only
     take part in public works).
-    Where do they live (in segregated communities, private rented apartments, social housing,
     etc.)?
-    What kind of problems are they facing? E.g.:
            o daily existential problems,
            o indebtedness,
            o illness in the family,
            o overcrowded housing conditions
            o malnutrition,
            o high level of school absence in the family,
            o children at risk,
            o exhaustion/isolation,
            o deviance (drug, alcohol, crime),
            o domestic violence,
            o Conflict with service providers/school, etc.


In order to map these problems, it is important to consult with the following stakeholders:
-    families (with whom the child support center already has a relationship, for example)
-    public utilities and municipal asset management
-    enforcement agents, financial institutions, NET (Nemzeti Eszközkezelő, National Asset
     Management), tax department
-    district nurses
-    social (assistance) department, family support center, other assistants, child welfare service,
     guardianship
-    schools (KLIK), kindergartens, nurseries
-    police
-    religious organizations

Steps:
Problems can be mapped within the framework of organized thematic working groups, personal
visits/preparing environmental studies, or, e. g. by sending short questionnaires to institutions. It is
important to find out the proportion of families for which certain types of problems have
accumulated.
It is necessary to include the results of problem analysis in a table/description containing numbers,
ratios and trends so that the relevant actors/institutions can see the range of people whose
problems they have to handle today, next year and in 2-3 years.




                                                   34
  2. Has the family recognized that their children's education is important and do they know how
                                      they can be supported?
                                                  YES


In the course of social assistance work and communication with the relevant institutional system, it
has become clear that the family realizes the steps that should be taken to make their children's
school career more successful.


At the same time the family lacks the relevant knowledge/tools regarding where and how and with
what organizations to cooperate or they do not have the relevant capacity at the time to obtain or
pay for the necessary services.


Such services may include: speech therapy development, movement therapy/physiotherapy,
regular exercise/sports, tutoring/study hall, day care, participation in study groups, (self) support
groups, e.g. for children with MBT/SEN, etc.


It is also important for parents to recognize and utilize the tools of their own development apart
from their children's needs. Thus, case managers/family helpers also need to help
parents'/mothers' job search, guidance towards training, access to healthcare services, or for
example their contacts with successful families having experienced similar situations.


Steps:
    •    Early childhood development (0-5 years of age): Opening Sure Start Children's House /
         guiding parents into the children's house where development takes place together with
         parents, typically in the morning hours, support for nursery enrolment / making available
         family day care by supporting compensation fees.
    •    Making additional investments available: local pedagogical services, speech therapy
         developments, psychological counselling and therapy, local mother-baby and children's
         clubs, sports associations (e. g. supported by local foundations) cooperation with primary
         art institutions and volunteers.
    •    development of school-aged children and their inclusion in relevant programs, local
         pedagogical services, speech therapy development, psychological counselling and therapies,
         cooperation with primary artistic institutions and volunteers, encouragement for day care
         centers/study rooms (making available extracurricular programs, playrooms/play clubs)
    •    Making parents interested: launching gymnastics clubs/cooking clubs/training courses
         (childcare, for example, with the help of volunteers), helping the organization of self-help
         groups, mediation between health care and the family (e. g. dentistry, internal medicine
         and screening).

 2. Has the family recognized that their children's education is important and do they know how
                                     they can be supported?
                                                  NO


Some of the families have no long-term plan with regard to their children's school careers,
moreover, by their children's early adolescent age, many "refrain" from kindling or strengthening
their children's further education motivation (this is often caused by poor feedback mechanisms).
Therefore, both the children and parents should be sensitized to the benefits and options. In
addition, specific mediation and strengthening of educational institutions are important tasks.
In this case, social workers must perform coordinated, intensive work, relying on institutions which
children and parents frequent or should frequent (for this purpose, the local government should
provide extra resources, e. g. employing additional part-time social workers, setting aside minor
resources for incentives/programs).


Steps:
    •    Media campaigns, i. e. sensitization of parents and children for the importance of
         training/education in institutions, local publications/media.
    •    Sensitization of trainers/educators towards the target group (difficulties, opportunities) e. g
         by intercultural mediation.
    •    Promoting coordination between the family - employment services - employers (including
         the local government's own institutions), e. g. preparation of career choice.
    •    Information on scholarship programs and making them available
    •    Involve parents in extracurricular activities to raise their awareness and capacity to provide
         the required additional support/assistance needed by the children (at home) to successfully
         progress their education.
    •    Keep educational institutions open during the afternoon hours – and use this time to
         provide with organized activities, family visits, activities organized by volunteers)
    •    Launch clubs to provide opportunities for nonformal education and learning in the form of
         useful pastime activities– and create public spaces for learning and “playing”.

   With the help of the above, families can be guided towards those services offering specifically
                     tailored developments and trainings - see on the left side.

                      3. Are the families forced out of the local community life?
                                                     YES


During situation analysis, it has become clear that families are isolated, it is difficult to address them
and they do not participate in the lives of local communities, school or neighborhood life. To
remedy this, local community development work should be launched and supported, e. g. by the
inclusion of professional organizations micro-projects and cooperation between institutions.


Steps:
Organization of easily accessible (free, at nearby locations), brief community programs held
repeatedly and at predictable (and possibly unconventional) times e. g by launching fitness groups,
organizing fairs, gastronomic events, screenings.
Once these step yield results, the role of families in community life can be further developed, see
examples below for further guidance.


                     3. Are the families forced out of the local community life??
                                                     NO
By continuation and diversifying existing activities, it can be ensured that the enthusiasm of families
will not decrease - (see examples below).


Steps:
By planning micro-projects (e. g. events with budgets up to 50-100 thousand HUF) participation can
be enhanced (e. g. determination of public space function/decoration, film screenings, concerts,
cooking together/gastro-cultural events, etc.)

Problem-solving Tree #3: The elderly and people with disabilities who live
    isolated from the community and do not have access to public services
    1. Introduction: the root of social challenges and objectives.


Situation of elderly and disabled people
There are nearly half a million people living with disabilities in Hungary, half of them are older than
60 years. In addition, there are nearly 1.7 million chronically ill persons - out of this latter group,
there are 1 million women and nearly one million people aged over 60 years. xxi Based on this data, it
is fair to say that there are large overlaps between the groups of the elderly, the disabled and the
chronically ill. Particularly in the case of the disabled, it is clear that they are faced with specific
challenges in their daily lives – the degree and extent of this depend on the type and level of
disability (intellectual capacity, movement, vision, hearing, etc.). Despite the fact that after 2000, the
situation of the disabled has gradually improved (e. g. more people could get involved in the
education system and employment e. g. due to increased accessibility and targeted subsidies), the
employment and education indicators of people with disabilities lag behind the average levels: their
group includes nearly one and a half times as many unskilled and only half as many higher
education graduates than in the general population. In many cases, families having to take care of
disabled and chronically ill children are facing particular challenges, as parents who have to take care
of their disabled children have to give up work. This leads to higher poverty outcomes for families
with disabled children, and a disproportionally large share of this group is geographically located in
deprived areas and villages. xxii


The phenomenon of social isolation
Isolation of the elderly and people with disabilities is due to several factors. For most of the group,
participation in public life is hampered by physical barriers, e. g. due to lack of barrier free
accessibility of facilities. In addition, isolation is further spurred by a lack of integration into
mainstream society due to lack of access to education and unemployment. In case of the elderly,
the narrowing of social relations is also typical due to a lack of day-to-day interactions with the
community, loosening relationships and family ties. The level of inclusion of the non-disabled
environment is also important, people with disabilities often encounter "moral obstacles" because
their environment - in the absence of knowledge and guided by fears - is unable to cooperate or
communicate with people with disabilities or accept them as colleagues and peers and reduce them
to their special needs. However, statistics show that only a quarter of people with disabilities
experience their disabilities as being manifest in learning and workplace obstacles. xxiii This is a
warning sign that a great majority of those belonging to this group have a need for more intensive
participation in the life of society.


Services for elderly and disabled people
The range of healthcare, social, training and social services depends on the size of the community,
but organizing home care and catering is required everywhere. The related benefits (e. g. public
health care, nursing allowance) are provided and determined at the district level, and local
governments can also provide other support at the expense of their CSFs. Thus, the availability of
special i.e. specialized services e. g. rehabilitation, is uneven in the country, thus those in small
communities are facing the worst situations. Therefore, numerous professional and non-
governmental organizations play an important niche role to fill this gap. xxiv

    2. Steps for identifying the problems in the LEP.
The Local Equal Opportunity Plan has a separate chapter which summarizes the situation and equal
opportunities of people with disabilities, addressing their employment situations and institutions
supporting independent living. Further sections of the LEP explore the range of available benefits as
well as the opportunities of accessing public services, public transport, information and community
life, disabled access and benefits compensating for disadvantages. As a conclusion of the relevant
chapter, local governments should demonstrate the specific social problems increasingly affecting
people with disabilities at the local level and the specific initiatives taken to eradicate these
problems. This section of the LEP is concluded by a problem and as a response, a table presenting
the given development opportunities. The section in LEPs analysing the situation of the elderly
follows a similar structure, but devotes particular attention to participation of the elderly in the labor
market. Problems identified in other subsections of the LEP can also be relevant to the situation
analysis, e. g. chapters on Roma people and those living in extreme poverty if they point out the
connections between poverty, old age and disabilities.
Within these sections, special attention needs to be paid to three issues: (i) which services are
needed for the local community of elderly and disabled; (ii) where are these services available (inside
the community at district level); and (iii) how can they be accessed by the target group in view of
physical and other limitations.
    3. Planning specific measures for the LEP
When completing the LEP action table, the needs arising due to the identified problems in relation to
availability of and access to services should be used as a starting consideration. Since the relevant
needs are very heterogeneous regarding this target group, implementation of the "nothing about
them without them" principle is especially true here. This means that it is essential to involve equal
opportunity target groups in the preparation of local equal opportunity plans. In order to explore real
needs, involvement of the relevant target group (organizations of the elderly, those with young
children and injured people) should take place even during situation analysis. With their help, the
local government can learn for example that a given ramp for the entrance of a local grocery store
has been built but a turnstile placed at the entrance prevents access with strollers, wheelchairs or
walkers and traffic between the aisles is not suitable, either. An equal opportunity plan can become
complex, integrated and feasible if the maximum number of perspectives and ideas are identified
and for this purpose, several meetings between the government and stakeholders will need to take
place. Experiences have shown that in this process, innovative ideas have emerged, the stakeholders
will become more committed and potential conflicts can be prevented (for further guidance on this
see also the section on mediation and community development also in Guidance Note 2).


                 Therefore, the first step is that the local government should consult with the sectors
                 concerned - e. g. health care sector, social sector, job center and the relevant district
                 in order to get a more accurate picture of how many persons belong to this group and
where they live within the communities (whether their environments and nearby service providers
are accessible). It is important to get a picture of the family environment of the elderly and the
disabled as well as supporting family members and neighbors (this could be known for example by
home care staff and doctors) and the specific needs that are likely to arise within the next three
years. Important information can be obtained from civilians and religious organizations otherwise in
contact with rehabilitation and the target group (e. g. those organizing clubs and events for the
elderly) As in the other cases, the creation of a target group-specific community working groups has
proven to be particularly useful in this context, where the active involvement of the members of the
target group is encouraged and facilitated. (For further guidance on this see also the section on
mediation and the role of social workers in Guidance Note 2).


                                                   39
People over the age of 60 and those with disabilities make up about one fifth of the local
population on the average. The objective of reviewing their special care and service needs is to
improve their quality of life and social participation. This is based on the requirement to help them
access quality services available locally and in other communities, and reduce their social isolation.


                The second step is to consider the difficulties and opportunities of a typical person
                and their family in this life situation.



Three fundamental questions need to be considered:


    1. Has the social/health/education sector addressed the complete set of needs that were
       identified, including through the active involvement of the target group, and are these
       services available to the target group either locally or in other communities?

    2. Are there any community forums, events, or spaces specifically for these groups?


    3. Is the local community sensitive and inclusive regarding the target group (i.e. is support for
       "moral accessibility" needed)?



With the help of institutional and civil society actors, it should be explored within the scope of the
community working group to which the target group receives the appropriate support and services
and for which issues additional assistance and services need to be developed, how those services
would need to be organized and what are the resources that will be needed for this over the next 3
years. The above issues are discussed below.


  1.       Has the social/health/education sector addressed the complete set of needs that were
            identified and are these services available locally or in other communities?


                                                YES


That is: a table i.e. comprehensive description containing numbers, ratios, trends has been drawn
up which allow the relevant actors/institutions to get a clear understanding of (i) the number of
people from the target group who currently do not access services; (ii) to what extent these
members of the target group can rely on family i.e. community in a broader sense; (iii) what services
can be provide on location vs. which can only be provided in other communities; and (iv) how can
they access the services in other communities




       Have they contacted relevant support services and other professional service providers
          capable of handling the given problems either locally or in other communities?



                                                 40
                      YES                                                     NO
                                                            The local government should promote
                                                          cooperation on the service provider's side,
Have they determined the person in charge of

 interconnecting elderly people/families and
                                                         management, as well as support services for
service providers and the person following up
                                                        caregivers (mostly family members), etc. (e. g.

                                                          participating institutions e. g. using tender

    1. . Has the social/health/education sector addressed the complete set of needs that were
            identified and are these services available locally or in other communities?
                                                 NO


We need to know the following:
-    how many families with elderly or disabled members are there where the necessary services
     are not received or they lead solitary, isolated lives,
-    Where do this families/elderly people live (e. g. in locations that are difficult to access, homes
     are not accessible for the disabled, far away from their families, etc.)
-    What kind of problems are they facing? E.g.:
            o Problems in the context of living their day-to-day lives,
            o exclusion from the labor market
            o indebtedness,
            o other illness in the family,
            o overcrowded, inadequate housing conditions (e. g. many stairs, narrow doors),
            o school attendance is not solved for children with disabilities
            o exhaustion/isolation,
            o lack of mobility
            o substance abuse (e. g. alcohol, drugs)
            o domestic violence,
            o conflicts with service providers etc.


In order to map these problems, it is important to consult with the following stakeholders:
-    families (with whom colleagues working in home care are already in contact, for example)
-    social (assistance) department, family support center
-    educational institutions
-    general practitioners
-    labor office
-    professional services (e. g. in other communities)
-    other helpers, civilians, religious organizations

Steps:
Problems can be mapped within the framework of organized thematic working groups, personal
visits/preparing environmental studies, or e.g. by sending short questionnaires to
institutions/service providers/districts. It is important to find out the proportion of families for
which certain types of problems have accumulated.
It is worth including the results of problem analysis in a table/description containing numbers,
ratios and trends so that the relevant actors/institutions can see the range of people whose
problems they have to handle today, next year and in 2-3 years.

     2.        Are there any community forums, events, or spaces specifically for these groups?
                                                 YES


There are suitable forums and events attractive to disables and their families as well as the elderly,
which allow them to be an active part of community life


Steps:
Organization of easily accessible (barrier-free, held nearby, free-of charge), community
activities/events/programs held repeatedly and at predictable times (possibly unconventional, e. g.
health screenings play/drama/music therapies, fairs, tours. It is important that these events do not
only address the target group, thereby sensitizing the population not encountering the same
problems.
In local decision-making/governments individual rapporteurs can ensure continuous flow of
information.




          2. Are there any community forums, events, or spaces specifically for these groups?
                                                  NO


In the course of situation analysis, it has become clear that some of the elderly and people with
disabilities are isolated, difficult to interact with i.e. mobilize. To remedy this, local community
development work should be launched and supported, e. g. by more intensive communication about
the targeted programs, organization of clubs, micro-projects and cooperation between institutions.


By ensuring existing activities are being provided on a continuous basis and being diversified as
needed, it can be ensured that the enthusiasm of families will not decrease - see examples below


Steps:
Often times, accessing relevant programs/events and physical approach represent critical question -
therefore, they should be organized in a barrier-free manner (even through relevant media) It is
worth recommending such micro-projects for groups in the process of forming which are capable of
addressing a larger group of people (e. g. accessibility of public space, providing community venues
for those with similar disabilities, covering material costs of clubs etc.)

            3. Is the local community sensitive and inclusive regarding the target group?
                                                    YES


People with disabilities and elderly people are accepted and respected members of the local
community and they are not exposed to discrimination in education, employment and in everyday
life in general. Their points of view are taken into consideration in local decision-making processes,
as well.


Steps:
In the local decision-making process/local government a dedicated and knowledgeable rapporteur
(ideally recruited from the target group) can continually serve the purpose of feedback in relevant
matters, and at the same time, they make function as communication channels towards the target
groups, as well.


            3. Is the local community sensitive and inclusive regarding the target group?
                                                    NO


Local communities are not familiar with and do not understand the situation of the elderly and
those with disabilities, they reject these people. There is little specific knowledge available regarding
specific live situation so there is no basis for dialog or developing mutual trust.


Steps:
Organization of sensitizing campaigns and programs, and above all teaching the younger generation
to exercise tolerance, acceptance, assistance (including by organizing voluntary work). Some other
barrier-free programs teaching the importance of accessibility can also help (e. g. disability parks). It
is important for public service workers to understand these local needs and the daily challenges
faced by these people every day - sensitizing training courses previously developed can be used for
this purpose. Ensuring comprehensive accessibility of the public institutions services will make an
important difference as members of the target group will become more and more visible in the
public space which will allow for more regular interactions and exchange. This will contribute
towards the breaking down of stereotypes, fears and the step-by-step integration of the target
group into community life.

        Guidance Note 6: The initial step - Guidance on prioritizing and
        sequencing interventions stemming from the problem trees
        analysis
In the previous chapter, we demonstrated those critical life situations for the solution of which
several types of intervention should be considered. It is possible that the local government gave a
negative answer to all questions listed on the previous pages. This means that the needs of these
groups have so far not received sufficient attention and a lot of work lies ahead of the local
government. This can be intimidating and discouraging. What should be the priority, the sequence of
activities? What should be the first step?
As noted in Guidance Note 2, it is essential for a local government to develop the ground so to speak
for interventions and to invest in a foundation for targeted interventions. This would include the
strengthening of relevant knowledge of problems and opportunities inside the community, exploring
and starting to use own resources hitherto untapped, and investing in communication and
interaction with the community members to mobilize them for supporting and participating in
interventions,.
The initial step should always be aimed at the need to resolve local conflicts and encourage various
stakeholders to cooperate. To do this, useful advice is listed in Guidance Note 2.
As a next step, a framework for substantive dialogue (both intra-community as well as between
the community and the local government) would need to be created as this will ensure that
mobilization and accountability mechanisms are established to alleviate basic problems.
Potential frameworks for community dialogue
There are various frameworks and formats to involve the local community members in a dialogue
with decision-makers and service providers. Local governments should ensure they choose
formats that are most conducive to the community’s capacity. Potential formats include:
    •   Public feedback through comments
    •   Interviews
    •   Workshops
    •   Community gatherings or town hall meetings
    •   E-discussions
    •   Continuous communication through community social workers
Participation increases community ownership and the ability of residents to maintain and operate
an intervention, thus increasing the chances that it will be sustained over time. Such an active role
for disadvantaged Roma communities also contributes to their social inclusion. At the same time,
the participation of non-Roma communities is also critical to gain their support for the
intervention, avoid stigmatization of Roma, and foster interaction and cooperation between Roma
and non-Roma on the basis of mutual interests.
                    Source: Handbook for Improving the Living Conditions of Roma, Word Bank, 2015
In parallel to all this, a thorough status survey should be prepared along with the exploration of
potential resources. Status surveys should be designed for example by applying the methodology of
the LEPs and extending it to cover missing topics like access to services offered outside the
municipality. Hints for exploring potential resources are described in Guidance Note 3.

1.1.2   Barrier free access xxv


Pénzintézeteknél,    ügyfélszolgálatokon     szükség   van   a     sorszámosztó     berendezések
akadálymentesítésére, pl. hogy a cédulán a sorszám nagy méretben legyen olvasható, a sorszám el is
hangozzon és az ügyfelek segítséget kapjanak a megfelelő ablakhoz való eljutásban, az ott kapott
tájékoztatók elolvasásában (legyen kéznél egy nagyító) vagy a nyomtatványok kitöltésében is. A
hallássérült embereknek a tájékozódással általában kevesebb problémájuk van, komoly akadályt
jelent viszont számukra az ügyintézés során történő kommunikáció, amiben szájról olvasás esetén az
ügyintéző megfelelő megvilágítása nagy segítség lehet. A jelnyelvet anyanyelvként használóknak

                                                 46
jelnyelvi tolmács lehet segítségükre, erről tájékoztatni kell a lakosságot, hogy pl. bírósági
tárgyaláshoz, hivatalos ügyeinek intézéséhez kérheti a jeltolmács biztosítását a legközelebbi
jeltolmács szolgáltatástól. Az értelmi fogyatékos vagy autizmussal élő emberek is képesek lehetnek
önálló ügyintézésre, az ő tájékozódásukat piktogramok elhelyezése (pl. a boltok polcain),
információhoz jutásukat a tájékoztatók könnyen érthető megszövegezése segíti.
Az a tüdőszűrő központ, ahová be lehet ugyan menni rámpán és pl. van lift is az épületben, nem
akadálymentes, ha a vizsgálatra szolgáló berendezésbe egy kerekesszékkel közlekedő személy nem
képes bejutni és így őt nem lehet megvizsgálni. A fogyatékos emberek számára kialakított speciális
információhordozók, pl. egy nagybetűs vagy könnyen érthető nyelvezettel megfogalmazott
nyomtatvány, az idősek számára is nagy könnyebbséget jelenthet. A helyi ABC-ben a termékek
árának feltüntetése mindenki számára jól olvashatóan segíti az önálló életvitelt. Apróbb
településeken, kisvárosokban előforduló jelenség, hogy egy, esetleg két lámpás gyalogos átkelő
található a legforgalmasabb utak mentén. Míg nagyvárosokban gyakori a hangjelzéssel ellátott
átkelő, addig a kisebb településeken rendre hiányzik ez a látássérültek közlekedését segítő
berendezés. A helyi közútkezelő, vagy éppen az önkormányzat figyelmét fel kell hívni a hiányosságra.

1.1.4 Sensitisation of the community xxvi
Különös tekintettel a turisztikai célpontokra a turisztikai fejlesztések esélyegyenlőségi szempontú
tervezése (kerékpár kölcsönzőben legyen tandem kerékpár a látássérültek élményszerzésének
biztosításához, terepjáró túra autó, mint turisztikai szolgáltatás, ami a mozgássérültek eljutását segíti
olyan objektumokhoz, ahová gyalogosan nem tud eljutni) akár egy új fizetőképes kereslet
megjelenését eredményezheti. Kihangsúlyozva, hogy pusztán a tárgyi fejlesztés mit sem ér, ha a
személyzet nem rendelkezik azzal a tudással, amivel megfelelő kommunikációs helyzetet tud
kialakítani a fogyatékos személyekkel. Példák: esélyegyenlőségi tudásbázis kialakítása, működtetése
települési, járási szinten (ki, mit, hol érhet el), esélyegyenlőséget segítő programelemek megjelenése
a települési, iskolai rendezvényeken: pl: kerekes székes akadályverseny mobil akadálypályán- az
akadálypályákkal a „GURULÓ Műhelyek” is rendelkeznek, tárgyfelismerés bekötött szemmel, szépírás
verseny bekötött szemmel, író kerettel.

1.1.5   Micro projects organised by the community xxvii


Kültéri illemhelyek
A GlaxoSmithKlein gyógyszergyár támogatásával a Partners Hungary Alapítvány egy három éves
interkulturális mediációs programot bonyolított le hat település bevonásával. A kiválasztott
mediátorok 2x3 napos képzésen vettek részt, és a folyamat szakmai támogatása 1 vagy 2 évig tartott
az egyes településeken. A mikroprojekt megvalósításához 300.000Ft állt a települések
rendelkezésére. Az egyik településen a közösségi akciócsoport a helyi, egészségüggyel kapcsolatos
problémák között megfogalmazta a roma telepen élők házaiban az illemhelyek hiányát. A csoport úgy
döntött, hogy a rendelkezésre álló forrásból ezen a területen szeretne előre lépni. A közösségi
tervező folyamat során dolgozták ki a megvalósíts kereteit, szabályait: hogyan készülnek el, illetve ki,
hogyan kaphat az elkészülő kültéri illemhelyekből. A rendelkezésre álló forrást a nyersanyagok
megvásárlására költötték. A telepen élő romák közösen, saját szerszámaikkal építették meg a WC-
ket, az Önkormányzat biztosította a helyszínt illetve a szállítást. Egy hétvége alatt a közösség 38
illemhelyet épített és helyezett el a telepen élők udvarán. Egy évvel később az összes illemhely
megvolt még.


Szemétszállítás
Az Európa Tanács ROMED programjában az egyik településen egy korábbi programra építve folytatta
a munkáját az interkulturális mediátor. A közösségi akciócsoport néhány ülés után úgy döntött, hogy
szeretné ha megoldódna a hulladék elszállítását a roma telepen, ami abban az időben nem volt
megoldott, valamint szeretné a közelben lévő illegális hulladéklerakók felszámolását. Ez a probléma
már korábban is felmerült az önkormányzat és a roma közösség együttműködő programjai során. Az
önkormányzat többek között a KACS munkájának eredményeként úgy döntött, hogy komoly
lépéseket tesz a megoldás irányába, és ehhez kéri a KACS tagjainak a segítségét is. Az önkormányzat
felszámolta az illegális lerakókat és megszervezte a heti rendszeres zsákos szemétszállítást a telepen
lakók házainál, és a szemétszállítás költségét is alacsonyabban állapították meg, mint a kukával
rendelkező háztartások esetében. A KACS a közösség informálásával, szórólapozással illetve egy
lakossági fórum megszervezésével segítette az Önkormányzat munkáját. A szervezési feladatokat a
KACS a mediátor vezetésével, a külső szakmai támogató minimális részvételével oldotta meg.



                                                   48
A hulladék elszállítása elindult. A program külső forrásokat nem vett igénybe. Az időközben felmerülő
újabb nehézségek megoldására az Önkormányzat és a mediátor vezette KACS továbbra is
együttműködik egymással.
Az együttműködés ezen a településen jelenleg más helyi problémák megoldására fókuszál, a közös
munka folytatódik.

Activities

The municipality officials and the mayor of the settlement first heard about the Safe Start Children’s
Houses when planning the development program of the most disadvantaged micro-regions, and it

was also then that they came into contact with the Autonomy Foundation. With its program
launched in 2009 the Foundation helpedxxxlocal municipalities and civil organisations start such Roma
integration projects financed from EU funds which indeed focus on genuine local needs. The
Porcsalma application for the establishment of a children’s house was the result of a joint
development process. The Foundation gave assistance to the elaboration of the application in the
framework of a multi-round local planning discussion. Teachers, district nurses, family consultants of
the child welfare service and on some occasions also the mayor took part in the planning process.
The would-be employees of the children’s house were also involved already in the planning phase.
Identifying the problem at the start of the process did not pose any special challenge: the local
officials had already experienced for years that many children started with a handicap already the
kindergarten, which then also impacted their school studies later on. Many children come to the
institutions from a very poor physical environment, almost all Gypsy children live on the edge of the
village in a segregated settlement. This segregated settlement can be accessed on paved road and
most of the public utilities are available, but in reality few homes have running water and the
majority of the inhabitants take water from the public well.
The activity of the children’s houses had to be built up on a rather strict and carefully elaborated
methodology. So in the planning process it was of paramount importance that everyone embrace the
spirit of the application, and precisely understand what will happen in the children’s house.
The delegates’ assembly and the kindergarten also supported the development idea. It was also
achieved that one of the helpers was a Roma woman. In order to prevent that the number of
children provided for in the kindergarten decrease after the opening of the house, instead of the 0-5
age group proposed in the application, primarily the 0-3 age group and their families were targeted
with the services.
In the end the municipality received 47,363,506 HUF support to the implementation of the project
entitled “For you, with you but not instead of you” Safe Start for Strengthening Social Integration in
Porcsalma” (In Hungarian: "Érted, veled, de nem helyetted" Biztos Kezdet a Társadalmi Integráció
Erősítéséért Porcsalmán”). The children’s house opened in January 2010 in the former crèche
building, roughly halfway between the centre of the village and the segregated settlement. Since the
investment budget was rather tight, the village only purchased the building materials and the
renovation works themselves were carried out by local public workers, some of them from the
segregated settlement.
The philosophy of the children’s house was new both to the employees and the families. At variance
with a crèche, instead of providing passive day care to the children, the Safe Start Children’s House
focuses on the development of their abilities, in cooperation with the parents. The first real results of
the operation were visible when the parents enrolled in the kindergarten those children who
formerly attended the children’s house. These children were more confident and assured, made
contact with the other children more easily and felt comfortable in the institution; the kindergarten
teachers gave a lot of positive feedback.
For the newly opening children’s houses one of the biggest challenges is the involvement of the
parents. This house was not different in this respect. After the start of the program the employees of
the children’s house personally visited the families and explained to them what services would be
available in the house. They also personally handed out the invitations to the opening ceremony and
this proved to be a successful contact-building technique. But the most successful tool was the
fortnightly cooking club. In the garden of the house they planted vegetables which they used in the
cooking classes. Comparison of the visit figures of the other operating Safe Start Children’s houses
(first three years) showed that there was clearly smaller fluctuation in the number of visits in the
Porcsalma house than elsewhere and there were no big seasonal differences either, use was rather
balanced, which is to be thanked to the thorough preparation. However, despite the continuous
efforts the involvement of the neediest families and the non-Roma parents is still a problem.
At present some 10-12 children visit the house daily (about one tenth of the 0-3 year-old children of
the settlement), a four-member staff work with them, two of them Roma.

Results

One of the most important results is that - even though with a smaller professional staff and a
scarcer service package - five years after its start the children’s house is still working. This is by far not
an evident thing for projects financed from EU funds. The children’s houses are in a privileged
situation because normative support can be requested to their operation, but this is no guarantee for
their survival. In addition to the availability of the necessary financial resources, it can also be said for
Porcsalma that the Safe Start Children’s House has integrated into the life of the settlement and
become part of the local institution system. The local decision makers and teachers have gained first-
hand experience in the past years that with consistent work tangible results can be reached in the
field of integration. The feedback of the kindergartens about the children who attend the children’s
house programs is very positive, and their supportive attitude of the house, which has been present
since the very start, has only strengthened.
At the same time, getting the poorest and most needy non-Roma families attend the house presents
continuous challenge. In the past five years of the operation the management has failed to persuade
Roma and non-Roma families to use the house together and despite repeated attempts the
activation and involvement of the poorest families remain a problem.
It can also be considered an important achievement for the settlement that the implementation of
the Safe Start project has opened the way for other human development programs. In the past years
a civil organisation launched a study hall program with ESF funding, and in the neighbourhood of the
Roma settlement a community house was opened under a child opportunity program.

Experiences

The children’s house has created a new type of relationship between the hard-to-reach families and
the public education institutions. Everyone recognizes its achievements, no one questions the
necessity of keeping the house going. The involvement of the neediest families presents constant
difficulty, this situation can hopefully be helped by the practice of these houses that there must be
such lay helper in the professional team who comes from the target group.
Planning and preparation play key role in the acceptance and integration of a new institution. The
meaning of the longer than usual planning work has gained confirmation for the mayor and the local
professionals. In the course of the implementation everybody realised that minute preparation,
thorough consideration of the phases built on one another were absolutely necessary for such a
program to work well. These steps cannot be spared, but the municipality would not have had
sufficient capacity to manage all this. It is important that the external experts involved in the
preparation did not prompt what should be written into the application, their presence was rather of
facilitating nature, they coordinated and kept on track the entire process.

Activity(ies)
In 2004 the headmaster initiated the shutting down of the school for children with special
educational needs. The ratio of Roma students in this school was about 75 percent. The majority of
the children were gradually integrated in the Gárdonyi Géza Primary School, the town's largest
school where a two-teacher model was introduced in the junior years and the pupils are assisted by a
child development teacher and a speech therapist. The transition was supported by the Roma
Education Fund. The number of students in the 2012/13 school year equalled 575 (against the
backdrop of a declining number of children), 102 of them were underprivileged and 49 came from a
family with multiple disadvantages (according to the definition applicable in 2012/13).
When the SEN school was shut down the headmaster took care to distribute the children across the
different classes evenly and that children who needed such assistance would get appropriate SEN
support during classes. He also took steps to ensure that children whose home conditions could not
allow for a relaxed learning environment are taught all day at school so that they would not have to
study at home. Teachers assigned to the new integrated classes were given a pay rise of HUF 15,000.
Parents were engaged in constant dialogue and as the teachers were also motivated (some 60
percent of them backed the transformation process) the performance of children did not deteriorate
and talent nurturing continued.
Enlarging the scope of vocational school training was another innovative move. In 2005, yet as
headmaster, the Mayor saw that young people tended to drop out of VET unless it offered specific
prospects and was in the close vicinity (the VET school was 30 km away). Therefore he mapped up
the demands of local employers and arranged for a site in Ács where printing technology training was
provided. Mentoring was financed from funds offered by the Soros Foundation. This site had to be
closed in 2008/9 due to the lack of funds, but until then it helped 20 young people find employment.
This model is not eligible for funding from central programmes.

Currently, primary education is delivered at two sites – one building houses only junior-year pupils
(appr. 60 pupils of whom 13 percent, i.e. 8 pupils are faced with multiple disadvantages), and in the
large school building both junior and senior-year students are taught (appr. 510 students of whom 8
percent, i.e. 41 students have multiple disadvantages). Altogether, there are 49 students with
multiple disadvantages (data of 2012/13) in the town. The town could thus manage to distribute
children with multiple disadvantages evenly in a way that the two Roma settlements (Vaspuszta and
Jegespuszta) are covered by the school district of the smaller school. Camps and grants continue to
be available to children with the support of the local government.
This integrated education system implemented in the local primary schools persisted even after the
school had been handed over to the Klebelsberg Institution Maintenance Centre (KLIK) – although it
is still run by the local government – owing to the fact that the Mayor and the school district cultivate
very good relations and they recognise the benefits of integration. In 2009 the ratio of children

Activities
In half a decade, labor-intensive agricultural production has grown from saving opportunities for a
debt-ridden local government to form a local economic development program.
The local economic development program was built in the following steps:
2011.
    • Following the results of the "Sorsfordító-Sorsformáló" ("Shaping and Transforming
         Destinies") program, the sub-region got involved in the initial pilot public works program.
         Participation of the sub-region (Dombóvár sub-region) was initiated by the community
         leadership. In subsequent years, more and more people were involved in public works out of
         which labor-intensive agricultural production provides employment for about 30 people. The
         area used for growing vegetables gradually increased to 15 hectares.
    • Gyulaj joined a project managed by the Maltese Charity Service linking developments in 8
         different segregated communities, under the support of the Open Society Institute of
         Budapest. This made possible diverse exchanges of experience. xxxiii
2012.
    • Subregional ESF project by combining the instruments of social work, community
         development and regional development (SROP 5.1.3) xxxiv The participation of a subregion
         (with the communities of Tamási sub-region) was initiated by the community's leadership in
         2009, when the tender was announced.
    • Farmyard animal husbandry was started by breeding rabbits, under the support of the
         Ministry for Rural Development (Vidékfejlesztési Minisztérium) and the Ministry of National
         Economy (Nemzetgazdasági Minisztérium)("Nyúl-unk a munkáért" - "Grabbing work") xxxv
2013.
    • As part of a public works program, relevant tools were acquired with which the collected
         food could be chopped and utilized for heating in municipal buildings, thus saving costs.
    • Farmyard animal husbandry was complemented with pig farming.
    • An ESF project was launched with complex educational, employment, health and community
         development activities (SROP 5.3.6). xxxvi Within the scope of the project, continuous social
         work could be provided, along with the establishment of a community center and a service
         point.
    • The state took over the local government's debt by which the community was freed from a
         heavy burden and the opportunities for development had increased.
2014.
    • A new targeted ESF project was launched to develop employment (SROP 1.4.3). xxxvii The local
         government, along with specialists related to the community and the Maltese Charity Service
         established a social cooperative (Hetedhét Határ (Boundless) Social Cooperative).
    • One co-worker of the Maltese Charity Service has moved to Gyulaj. The latter manages ESF
         projects, and the community center along with social work, as well.
2015.
    • Within the scope of an employment ESF project, a pig farming plant was built along with a
         meat plant and meat shop and a pickling plant, taking over farmyard processing activities
         processing so far. xxxviii Thus, the opportunity was created on the one hand to increase the
         level of processing and thereby reduce seasonality and on the other hand, to perform sales

                                                 60
        not only for the local kitchen but for external markets, as well. According to this concept,
        public works and farmyard animal husbandry can ensure the production of raw materials and
        the relevant social cooperative performs processing.
    •   The Maltese Charity Service has taken over the operation of the school and the
        kindergarten. In essence, these decisions were delegated back to Gyulaj and technical and
        financial management was returned to the hands of an organization committed to social
        aspects.

Results
At the peak activity level, nearly 100 people were involved in public works per year, partly in
agricultural production and partly in other activities (e. g. maintenance of public spaces). By means of
rotation, the number of those receiving income from public works for at least one period is more
than half of the village population.
The labor-intensive agricultural production provides employment for about 30 people.
All programs and projects included permanent elements and institutions (public works program:
instruments, ESF project for 2013: community center and service point; ESF project for 2014: pig
breeding farm meat plant, pickling plant) which make one-time project intervention sustainable.
Due to the efforts of social cooperatives and social work, farmyard animal husbandry and plant
production increased, which is an important option for supplementing income. The emphasis of
social work could be gradually transferred from handling crisis situations to prevention.
Utilization of vegetables, meat and wood chips produced makes possible the savings of nearly 9
million HUF for the local government. Thus, nearly 10% of the public work costs are utilized twice.

Experiences
Appropriate capacities are necessary for determining the direction of and launching local economic
developments as well as continuous innovations. In Gyulaj, this was primarily ensured by a mayor
with proper husbandry skills and professionals working as volunteers on account of the Gyulajért
Alapítvány (Foundation for Gyulaj). The widespread network of relationships brought by the Maltese
Charity Service was also important.
The role of continuous social work ("presence") goes far beyond the handling of individual and
family crises. It reinforces constant communication with people, guarantees basic prerequisites of
developments, builds trust and encourages long-term thinking. It helps to identify problems and
opportunities for improvement. It helps utilize income support opportunities related to the
developments (e. g. farmyard animal husbandry and plant production expansion)
The sustainability of developments mostly based on projects can only be guaranteed by highly
careful and conscious project planning. The first requirement is that continuous operation of earlier
developments must be taken into account in all projects. The second is that the creation of
permanent elements and institutions should be considered (e. g. tools, community center and
service point, pig breeding farm, meat plant and pickling plant). But only such developments can be
launched which specifically reduce the expenditures of local governments instead of increasing them,
either by the opportunity to access normative budgetary support or by production of value (e. g.
utilization of vegetables and meat or woods chips produced). Even during the planning state, it is
important to think through and determine the expected owner of permanent elements and
institutions created.
The different objectives (see reduction of extreme poverty, social inclusion of Roma people,
stabilization of the financial management of the relevant local government) and developments
should be handled in a single system in professional and financial terms. Each development should
rely on its own instruments to contribute to all objectives. People and organizations participating in
developments must work together on a daily basis.

The Szabolcs cucumber growing program started         suitable for farming (of at least 600 sq. m each)

                                                      Közhasznú Nonprofit Zrt.

Activities
The provision of group micro-loans aimed to promote self-employment under the Kiútprogram, and
the connected services (training, consulting, mentoring) started in 2010 in the framework of an EU-

                                                  62
financed pilot program. Under the two-year program that rested on intensive field work the
development and support of various enterprising activities were implemented in a disadvantaged
environment, mainly in the Eastern region of the country. Besides several less successful attempts,
cucumber growing in Szabolcs county was clearly a success story of that period. After closing the
pilot, the program now works with national private resources and has exclusively cucumber growing
clients.

Cucumber growing is performed in an integrator system: the integrator provides the plants and the
chemicals the price of which it gradually deducts from the price of the cucumbers. Growing can be
started in an average size kitchen garden but to start with the grower needs a support and watering
system, a drilled well, pump and spraying apparatus.
In 2012 the Kiútprogram joined this integrated production process. The aim was also to involve in the
production such disadvantaged families, which earlier were not able to purchase the necessary tools
and seeds with their own resources or were not considered creditworthy by the integrators. In the
framework of the program:
     - the families involved were granted easy-term micro-loan (of 150 000 - 200 000 HUF on
         average), which enabled them to purchase the necessary equipment
     - Kiút mediated between the families wishing to engage in farming and the integrators in the
         conclusion of the contracts (in many cases the presence of Kiút was required to persuade an
         integrator even to enter into contract with a would-be farmer).
     - Kiút provided the accountant and the contributions payable by the enterprises, and the local
         officers of the program continuously helped the growers in the performance of their
         administrative tasks.
The most important experience of the first three years was that the growers were far too much
dependent on the integrators. In many cases they only received the necessary spraying chemicals
with delay or the expert provided by the integrator came too late to diagnose what disease attacked
the plants (cucumber is a rather vulnerable plant, belated spraying may destroy a plantation already
at the start of the season). It was a further problem that the growers did not receive any money for
their produce until the full price of the materials granted on loan was not deducted from its price.
In 2015, in an effort to reduce the dependence of the growers, Kiútprogram Nonprofit Zrt. as a social
enterprise joined the program in the capacity of integrator. From this year Kiútprogram itself
provides for the contracted families the tools and the materials necessary for starting the production,
and it also purchases the cucumbers. The organization does not lend money, only equipment: the
growers get two years to repay the growing equipment and the price of the cucumber farming
materials will be deducted from the price of the ready produce, but at a much slower pace than
earlier (at a time maximum half the amount due to the growers for the delivered cucumbers will be
retained as repayment of the loan). In ten settlements the take-over points of the cucumbers have
been set up in the courtyards of the families involved in the program. Five local mentors are in
charge of the procurement of the farming equipment, the administration of the purchase, the
payments and other farming administration matters. A plant protection expert helps the growers
with advice.
This year 73 families in 12 settlements grew cucumbers in the Kiút integrator system, altogether on
nearly fifty thousand linear metres (minimum 300 linear metres per family) and the value of the
cucumber produced reached 40 million HUF. 53 growers never grew cucumbers earlier. In all 10.5
million HUF worth of equipment was loaned for two years, while the value of the growing materials
(plants, chemicals, etc.) exceeded 18 million HUF (the growers have already repaid 80% of the
amount). The long-term commodity loan means 5 000 - 10 000 forint expenditure monthly for the
growers.
According to the evaluation of the technical leader of the program, the integrator role of Kiút was
clearly a success and thanks to the new system the program participants made more income than in
the previous years.


                                                  63
There are, however, also such obstacles which the program is not able to manage. Cucumber
growing is a labour-intensive activity, its season lasts from April till September. During the season
every hand is needed on the family plantation, so this activity can hardly be done alongside other
activities. In several settlements the municipalities organise public work, which is practically the only
work opportunity, with as much consideration of the family farming activities as possible. However,
in one of the settlements of the Kiút program exactly the opposite happened: the public work
program organised by the municipality actually put an end to the Kiút program activities of the
families. In this settlement so small families took part in the program in general that the remaining
members were unable to make up for the work of the family members lost to the public work
program.

Results

In the past three years some 200 disadvantaged, mainly Roma families took part in the cucumber
growing program. According to the calculations of the Kiútprogram, if a family already has the
fundamental growing equipment, with 500 HUF / linear metre additional investment they can reach
1000-5000 HUF income. Essentially two factors determine the size of the income: the weather and
the skills. According to the experiences, there can be as much as 500 HUF per linear metre difference
between the incomes of the families farming under similar conditions, to the advantage of the more
experienced farmers with better skills.
Some 40 per cent of the families growing cucumbers under the Kiútprogram in 2015 had an income
of under 200 000 HUF, slightly over 30 per cent had 200-250 000 HUF and 16 per cent above 500 000
HUF. It is important to note, however, that more than half of the families involved this year never
engaged in cucumber farming earlier. The income figures could be slightly higher than given above,
these only show the cucumbers sold under the program, but it follows from their magnitude that for
those families that only farmed in their own garden not involving any extra labour outside the family
members cucumber growing was an important source of income though, it failed to provide for the
entire subsistence of the family. For the disadvantaged families the income concentrating for the end
of summer is sufficient for the start-of-school spending and to survive the winter. It is rare even in
the case of those families that farm a bigger area and have bigger income that they are able to build
reserves for the next farming season, so the integrator loans them the plants and the chemicals from
year to year.
Besides the incomes we should also discuss the repayment rate of the loans, even though this is not
the primary success criterion of the program. In the first year of the program the repayment rate of
the loans reached 80 per cent, but in the subsequent two years it barely exceeded 30 per cent. There
are several reasons underlying the significant difference (bad weather, more inexperienced growers),
but the most important is that the one-year term of the loans was reduced by half in the second and
the third years on the request of the lending institution.

In addition to the quantifiable results, it is clearly a success of the program that the prestige of the
cucumber growing families and their judgement by the non-Roma citizens, after the initial doubts,
improved considerably in their own settlement. The field workers of the program report that the
confidence of the successful grower families significantly increased and the “world opened up for
them”. The successfully farming families serve as examples for the others, which is also shown by
the fact that interest in the program is growing from year to year. xlii

Experiences

One of the most important experiences of the program is that with appropriate technical and
financial assistance the families living in deep poverty are able to pursue independent farming
activity, with which they can earn rather good income. The money that can be produced in a kitchen
garden-size area is important income supplement, but cucumber growing in such dimensions cannot

                                                    64
provide for the entire subsistence of a family and cannot replace regular employment.
Because of its relatively high profitability rate, cucumber growing is becoming more and more
attractive to the local municipalities as well. Several settlements have already started to grow
cucumbers in the framework of the public work program, with the involvement of the integrators.
However, cucumbers grown by public workers on municipality land are pushing down purchase
prices, which clearly worsens the positions of the family farmers and the larger enterprises.

The full adaptation of the Kiútprogram model would obviously run into many obstacles (lack of loans,
marketable farm produce). Income-generating programs of similar structure could be organized in
capital-poor environments, basically for the production of highly labour-intensive products, but
becoming an independent business enterprise - despite the continuously provided support services -
is still not a self-evident option. The success of this type of programs is essentially determined by the
selection of the participants, the quality of the support services and naturally the marketability of the
products.

The detailed and ambitious local equal opportunity
program prepared in 2013 identifies the situation of
segregated communities as the primary problem in
the field of equal opportunities for those in extreme
poverty and Roma and housing integration as a
development opportunity.

Activities
Housing integration activities started in 2012, encouraged by the fact that by amendment of an EU
regulation, using EU funds for housing had been made possible. A single social urban rehabilitation
program consisting of several projects was implemented. xlvi
The municipality developed a multifaceted cooperation involving the Pécs group of the Maltese
Charity Service as well as the Khetanipe Association for Roma Cooperation and the university's
sociology department and launched a systematic project preparation process. They concluded a
cooperation agreement with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to moderate the
process and provide methodology support. Competent "coaches" started to work at the relevant
sites to mobilize local communities, strengthening their problem solving capabilities and for example,
by local volunteer work, they cleaned up littered public areas overgrown by bushes and by programs
organized for children and families, they "reoccupied" Hősök tere (Heroes Square) which was
formerly characterized by prostitution and drug trafficking. Coaches played an important role in
determining development needs which may be even implemented without extra resources and in
mediating towards local governments. A good example for the latter is where children walking to the
nearest bus stop had to run across the busy Route 66, which had no pedestrian crossing, which
understandably bothered parents; and when the local government and the transport company
understood this problem, they moved the bus stop to make possible for the bus to stop even before
turning to the main road. The resources required for project preparation was provided by the
Budapest Open Society Institute.
In the spring of 2012, a relevant tender opportunity with ESF resources opened up to improve the
education, employment and health status of those living in segregated communities and for
community development. xlvii A project aimed at the György-telep (George Colony) has been

                                                     66
developed, because the presence of the Maltese Charity Service at this location has provided ample
basis for this. A year later, a related tender opportunity with ERDF resource opened up to
complement the previous tender with investment elements e. g. refurbishment of housing. xlviii
Desegregation was possible but not required. A related project was developed targeting the same
area, undertaking the renovation of 24 housing units and moving 5 families to an integrated
environment.
In the autumn of 2013, another relevant tender opportunity opened up with ERDF resources (only
for the South Transdanubia region) to develop housing integration models xlix Specific desegregation
requirements were imposed: for each project, the relocation of 30 to 36 persons to an integrated
environment had to be undertaken. Three projects were developed, targeting at this time Pécsbánya,
Hősök tere (Heroes Square), the Somogy-bánya (Somogy Mine) and the Rücker-akna (Rücker Mine)
pair (the István-akna (Stephen mine) would have required longer preparation) undertaking the
relocation of 30 families altogether to an integrated environment and the renovation of 44 housing
units. In accordance with the staging principle, families moving out typically left apartments in better
condition and they subsequently accommodated families in worse apartment living conditions, while
the latter were accommodated with families living in homes with the worst living conditions and the
latter homes were eliminated.
During implementation of the projects, perhaps the most serious risk was that due to delays in
tender evaluation, project launch coincided with the campaign period of local government elections
in the autumn of 2014. On the one hand, public sentiment in the country was increasingly reluctant
to accept efforts aimed at Roma integration and many leaders noticeable displayed the fear of losing
electoral support and the resulting risk aversion. On the other hand, local associations formed in the
previous term by the coalition of the governing party and major NGO organization ended up
dissolving and non-governmental organizations working in these projects became opposed to the
government party. The city leadership consistently communicated about the project as social urban
rehabilitation, highlighting supporting social work and did not back out of the projects l

Results
Each project had elements affecting the entire population of a given site. This included for instance at
the György-telep (George Colony) renovation of the stairs representing a main traffic route as well as
the community center, development of a playground and basketball court at Hősök tere (Heroes
Square) and a covered waiting facility at the bus stop, etc.
The housing situation improved for a total of 127 families, i. e. more than 400 persons. 35 families
moved into an integrated environment. 68 families' apartments were renovated within the colony.
Further 24 families moved to better (albeit not renovated) apartments within the colony. 34
apartments were eliminated by merger or demolition.
Renovations, mergers and demolitions within the colony were also focused on those parts where the
situation was the most severe. In the Kórház utca (Hospital Street) in Pécsbánya, the homes in the
worst condition ceased to exist, others were renovated, e. g by installing bathrooms. By mergers
performed in the crowded György-telep (George Colony), which was in bad condition, the number of
homes was reduced by one-sixth and each apartment was renovated. Buildings of the closed Rücker-
akna (Rücker Mine) were demolished.
Renovation, merger and demolition affected public rental apartments owned by the local
government, as well. In addition, minor renovation tasks could be performed by organizing the
practical part of construction training and employment programs, handyman clubs in private homes
in the colony, as well.
As a result of social works, arrears could be reduced. For this, emerging work opportunities and
income support options were consciously used.
Communities living in the colonies were strengthened and organized relevant programs (from
cleaning up public spaces to leisure, sports and cultural events). Strengthening of the community was
the most spectacular in Hősök tere (Heroes Square) where residents formed their own association, as
well.

                                                  67
Despite the risks, no major conflicts developed due to the relocations and due to proper preparation,
those moving to an integrated environments could also gain their new neighbors' trust. Local
government elections showed that electoral support had not decreased significantly.

Experiences
The most important experience is that with appropriate preparation, housing segregation can be
effectively reduced in cities. If city leadership is determined and well-prepared, housing integration -
on the one hand, improvement of the situation of those living in slums and on the other hand,
moving families to an integrated environment - can be archived without serious conflicts and loss of
voter support. The importance of this experience is highlighted by the fact that only a small part of
communities is engaged in effort aimed at housing integration. Despite the fact that it is apparent in
a number of communities that failure to make these efforts will result in situations that are
increasingly difficult to handle.
Another important experience is that investments involving large sums must be prepared and
accompanied by several years of social and community development work. The "presence"
("jelenlét") program of the Maltese Charity Service provides a complete methodology for preparatory
and accompanying social and community development work, which goes beyond the handling of
individual and family crisis situation to reinforce constant communication with people, provide the
basic prerequisites of developments, build trust and encourage long-term thinking. It helps to
identify problems and opportunities for improvement, including those that can be implemented
without large amounts of investment (see remediation of public places, "reoccupation" of space,
relocation of bus stops). It helps to exploit potentials related to developments (e. g. the community
should feel attached to and maintain completed investments . see the stairs at György-telep (George
Colony), the most vulnerable are included in job opportunities opening up who move to an
integrated environment and able to get the trust of their new neighbors).
This methodology can also be completely improved. In Pécs for example, this was done by
incorporating the UNDP "coaching" practice. As regards the role of coaches, it is important to
mobilize the community apart from helping and gradually move back, while passing on the relevant
initiative to the community. li It is also important that coaches keep in contact not only with the
beneficiaries of developments but also those who are understandably concerned about changes
brought about by the relevant development, e. g. moving disadvantaged families into the
neighborhood. By personal or small-group contacts, the mistrust arising from the lack of information
and the spread of misinformation and the resulting conflict can and should be prevented.
The Pécs example of housing integration offers useful experience to several cities where segregated
communities had developed.
All of the following are required to implement the relevant experience:
     • dedicated and skilled leadership;
     • within the municipal office, a sensitive an efficient manager sensitive to social problems;
     • long-term social and community development work and "presence" in segregated
         communities,
     • at least one or two years to prepare investments,
     • resources for the implementation of investments.

Experiences of the implementation of the Local Equal
Opportunity Program in the city of Békéscsaba
Background
Békéscsaba, a city with county rights and a regional
centre, has about 61 000 inhabitants and good railway
and road communication with Budapest and also with
Romania. The unemployment rate is around 8% (2012)
with half of the unemployed - some 2,000 people -            Békéscsaba - City Hall
being out of work for a long time. According to the
estimate of the Roma Local Government, some 2,000-
2,500 people of the local inhabitants are of Roma            Main data

annual budget of the city is approximately 14 billion
HUF.)

Activities - motto: (K)Érted – Neked (You asked for it - For you)

The leaders of the settlement realized quite soon that the city in itself will not be able to solve all the
problems arising from its statutory obligations or indicated by the citizens, however justified and
legitimate they may be. So it opened towards the civil sphere in several areas. It supports the

realisation of their objectives and helps their operation. The initial ad hoc form of subsidization has
been eliminated. By now, the supports granted to the organisations have become structured and
systematic, and are granted by the same criteria and for the same period of time. In the field of
personal care the municipality has made agreements with six civil organisations for 3 years, and this
ensures that all compulsory tasks of the municipality are seen to. In addition to this, other civil
organisations promote the implementation of the LEOP or are members of the LEOP Forum. The
activities of these organisations are directly linked to a target group (e.g. City Seniors’ Association).
Several such civil organisations present here which are county-reach organisations and have their
seat in Békéscsaba, and they also wield considerable lobbying power, they are very good at “making
their voice heard” (e.g. Békés County Association of the Blind, Békés County Association of the Deaf
and Hearing Impaired, Békés County Women’s Association).

Experiences - Motto: (M)Érted - teszed (For you - you do it)

The Local Equal Opportunity Program of Békéscsaba City of County Rights essentially rests on two
pillars.

1. In the Local Equal Opportunity Program we put the emphasis on the “local” term and tried to
   explore those possible areas of intervention which have zero budget involvement. A zero-HUF
   project does not require any European Union funding and does not involve any budget spending
   on the part of the municipality either for the term of the implementation of the LEOP. It rather
   relies on the skills and knowledge of the local craftsmen, experts, involves the players of the
   local civil sphere, its human resource requirement is big. In the brainstorming group we studied
   what we ourselves could do - in addition to the existing and well operating systems - for equal
   opportunity, for its innovative, non-typical yet efficient improvement.
   The majority of our LEOP projects are zero-HUF. Still, implementation is running enthusiastically
   and smoothly. Each and every participant can feel that we are giving something different,
   something extra to the beneficiaries, which simultaneously poses professional challenge in the
   everyday monotony and rather quickly measurable result and feedback for those involved in the
   implementation. Such are, for example, the editing and distribution of the information and
   awareness raising publications (e.g. in the fields of abuse, disabled care), the organisation of
   various courses (e.g. lifestyle counselling, housekeeping assistance for people living in deep
   poverty). In the field of child protection, information and professional dialogue about issues of
   threat and abuse have helped better access to care. The improvement of ante-natal care also
   serves the aim of reducing the number of births with permanent defect. The 60+ information
   clubs help combat the isolation of the elderly.

2. The second group includes such developments which require funding. In May 2015 the
   Municipality Assembly of the City of Békéscsaba with Country Rights adopted the document
   called “Integrated Area Program of the City of Békéscsaba with Country Rights 2014-2020”. This
   contributes to the development of better quality of life in the city and to the increase of the
   attractive and population retention powers of the city. The investments help better availability
   of the services, the increase of social security and the development of a more health-conscious
   society. The investments aimed at increasing the capacities and improving the quality of the
   crèches and kindergartens have strong priority also because of their impact on the increase of
   employment. The social and healthcare services fill the most acute gaps within the given
   frameworks.
   The complex development of the city’s public services can be financed from the TOP, HROP and
   sectoral operational programmes which can help the implementation of a modern and high
   quality public services system that will meet the expectations of the age. Making public buildings
   wheelchair accessible is an important condition of realizing a more integrating society. Before
   making any alterations for disabled access, we follow the established practice of consulting the

                                                   70
     local members of the affected target group, as well, consultation with them is continuous.
     In the past years only some of the social housing facilities were renovated in the framework of
     public work and since this activity can be pursued regardless of the weather and requires and
     deepens professional skills, these projects also help the participants find employment in the
     primary labour market and continue the trade for regular pay.

Experiences Motto: Érted - veled (For you - with you)

        In the course of the implementation of the actions, proposals in the LEOP all stakeholders -
the citizens of Békéscsaba, the Municipality, the people working in the institutions and in the Office
focusing on the affected target group - could again experience and realize the importance of the
dialogue. The good decisions can become even better if the opinion, proposals of the group affected
by the problem is also articulated.
        Joint implementation resting on communication and dialogue helped reach those citizens
who know well the difficulties of one or the other specific social group, have good lobbying power
and with their active and helpful attitude are able to contribute to the solution of certain problems.
        The LEOP programs promote social integration, support participation in the public affairs,
help the improvement of the conditions of spending one’s leisure time with quality activities or
arouse the need for it. The connection network of the participants will expand, isolation and solitude
can decrease, and so can the feeling of uselessness. Everyday life filled with quality content can make
the life of the citizens more meaningful and help them create a positive image of the future.
        Bonding with the city will increase in the implementation of the programs, loyalty will
deepen which, as indirect result, can increase the population retention power of the city and even
reduce migration.
        Attention focussed on the issues raised in the LEOP will stimulate discussion about them,
shape people’s views and may even change their attitude to a given issue, and enhance sensitivity
and focus at the level of the entire society.
        In the implementation of the LEOP the local society becomes stronger and more united,
solidarity grows and the equal treatment of the disadvantaged groups and equal opportunity access
of the public services will be realised.
        The opinion of all stakeholders involved in the implementation of the LEOP about the issue of
equal opportunity changed in a positive direction (we did not have “why do we need this at all?” type
disputes).
        Harmonised cooperation prevails in the complex activity matrix of the different disciplines
with observance of the principle of subsidiarity.

Activity(ies)
The town is clearly divided into a lower and an upper end. The eastern quarter includes the segregated areas of
the town. In 2001 primary school was the highest completed level of education for 55 percent of the residents
in this quarter, and this figure was 36 percent in 2011. Of the two segregated areas one is located at Szegfű
Street and has a longer history than the other (according to the 2011 Census 215 people live here), the other
area is situated at Bajza Street and developed concurrently with the gradual settlement of residents (according
to 2011 data 113 people live here). The latter is typically the home of Wallachian Gipsies, while Hungarian or
so-called musician Gipsies live in the older area. According to CSO data of 2011, a total of 445 Roma live in the
town. In contrast, estimates suggest a much larger population: the number of the Roma is estimated at 1100 to
1200, and within that the number of Wallachian Gipsies at around 300.

The complex settlement programme was designed to address the multiple problems the segregated areas are
confronted with by raising the level of education and improving the chances for employment accompanied by
programme elements related to healthcare, social and community development. Needs were identified
basically in two ways: (1) a summary of municipal development concepts, human development concepts and
the experiences gained so far, for example, to create a community space capable of operating as a
multifunctional scene also in the future, that is, during the maintenance period; to organise training courses
not delivered recently which are expected to help the target group find employment. (2) assessment of target
group needs using focus group interviews where the main needs, training subjects and everyday employment
experiences were mapped up.

The development programme is target group-oriented: Its programmes sought to reach each member of the
family providing an opportunity to exchange experiences between the various programme elements.

Difficulties and how they were addressed
The implementation of subactivities needed rescheduling. One reason for this is that more than a year had
passed between planning and the start of implementation and that there were problems due to other
engagements that emerged in the meantime and overlaps with other programmes. It became clear during
implementation that children living in the segregated areas would not be able to attend the summer camps
and that summer activities had to be arranged. The programme period covered two summer seasons, by
redesigning and compressing the programmes children could be under supervision from morning till evening
for two periods of one month and engage in playful skills and community development sessions.
After the launch of the programme it became ever more evident that the indicators set for the programme
could not be achieved if target group members participated in other central programmes, so the families
concerned had to be consulted on an ongoing basis to find out which solutions suited them and were the most
beneficial for the programme.
Several minor and petty problems emerged during implementation, but these were considered to be naturally
inherent and handled accordingly by colleagues and the management. One area to be highlighted is the
facilitation of training attendance and the minimisation of drop-out. To this end, a 'call tree' was set up to
enable the almost instant discovery of absentees, the notification of training providers and to ensure the
documentation necessary for continued training attendance.
The fluctuation of social workers represented another problem. Social workers were at all times present during
the programme, nonetheless, staff fluctuation was a real possibility to reckon with, so we devised three
mechanisms to cope with this problem. First, we concluded a cooperation agreement with the local Care
Centre that had appropriately qualified experts at its disposal who fulfilled the requirements set out in the
Application Guide. Second, we re-interviewed experts who had previously applied for the vacancies posted
whenever a social worker could not continue participating in the programme. Third, in addition to the social
workers, the specialists of the Teahouse are also gathering information about target group members to avoid
any hitches in the individual development process when a social worker is replaced.



                                                      73
Results
The programme was successful as we managed to engage the entire target group with more than 60 people
attending the training courses and 28 finding employment (some of them municipal communal work).
Besides the mandatory indicators of the programme, the community development work undertaken, the result
of which would be difficult to quantify, is also of great significance. The stereotypical prejudices of the non-
Roma society (the Roma do not study, they do not like to work, etc.) were one by one broken down during the
programme as one of the most important activities was to promote employment in cooperation with the
competent officials of the local government. The programmes of the Teahouse were accessible to all residents
of the town, and as it turned out many residents not belonging to the target group were also happy to use
these services (e.g. learning useful skills during the IT Club, job search, writing a CV, etc.). The behaviour of
children have visibly changed, the friendly community space, the presence of young and devoted colleagues
strengthened ties and shaped the patterns of everyday behaviour.
We managed to involve a number of local young Roma in implementation who contributed either as a
volunteer or a colleague and can hopefully continue their activity in the maintenance period as well.
Local government capacities have definitely improved during the programme with municipal services becoming
available that are helpful for families, local kindergarten teachers and school teachers alike (e.g. SEN
consultations, prevention programmes). The equipment purchased and the community house created will
remain available for future use and can help realise the human development concepts of the town. The work
that became 'institutionalised' under the Teahouse programme will expectedly bring about a positive change in
the attitude of local workers. In many cases market actors seek to recruit employees by contacting the local
government and the Teahouse, and the activities undertaken in the Teahouse are regularly covered in the local
paper Mi újság Fényszarun (What news from Fényszaru). Feedback from local teachers suggests that
professionals involved in implementation acquired new expertise and a new attitude that help them with their
work. Young people engaged in the programme could join other EU and Hungarian-American programmes.
Despite a strong focus on the community development related goals of the programme, there is not yet an
active community within the target group which could constantly formulate and communicate the needs
towards decision-makers.

The programme was met with mixed reactions. The target group was naturally enthusiastic that a programme
to ease their life was to be implemented, but the originally favourable reception of the town has gradually
abated, and the programme and the community house were soon labelled 'Gipsy programme' and Gipsy
house', respectively. Continuous information could trigger a change in this attitude as there were several
programmes that were attended by many outside of the target group and left them feeling good.
̏"We cannot give you bread, but we can give you advice" – once a Csángó from Gyimes said when asked about
 the success of the evolving Gyimes community and what piece of advice he would give others on how to do it.
 We do believe that this is exactly what makes these programmes important: to offer opportunities and
 alternatives that, besides providing basic services, can create active communities of citizens.

Initially, the inclusion of the development Mrs. Halmai Gáborné, technical leader
resources was the job of the young and
ambitious mayor Dicső László but later, when 2-3
projects were launched and 50-100 million HUF
development funds were received every year, a
team was set up to manage the projects.
The village also needed substantial loans for the
co-financing and the non-eligible costs, so it
amassed rather big debt. In 2012 the state took
over that debt also from Alsómocsolád.
The utilization of the project management
capacity for the benefit of the micro-region
became possible and also necessary in 2008 in
the framework of the program for the most
disadvantaged micro-regions.
Activities
In 2008 the program designed for the most disadvantaged micro-regions (in Hungarian: LHH) made it
possible for the Sásd micro-region to determine their most important development objectives using
a total budget of nearly 2 billion HUF. The planning process highlighted striking differences between

                                                 75
the planning and implementation capacities of Alsómocsolád and the other settlements of the
region.
So it was decided that a small part, about 2.5% of the fund, be allocated for the establishment of a
project office in Alsómocsolád that will provide management services for the other settlements of
the region, and promote the integration of the disadvantaged groups through building partnership,
generating and preparing projects. The project office promoted both the implementation of the
projects selected under the LHH program and the involvement of additional resources. The LHH
program (SROP /in Hungarian: TÁMOP/ 5.1.1, 46.2 million HUF) financed the operation of the project
office from early 2010 till the end of 2011. The office still operates, at present with a staff of 2
employees and 5 trainees.
For the involvement of additional resources answering the objectives of the project office, the
“Community inclusion for the integration of people living in deep poverty” application program
offered excellent possibility. This program combined social work with community development and
regional development. The program financed the project called “Establishment of a regional family-
centred community network (Köz-Tér-Háló)” from early 2012 till the end of 2014 (SROP 5.1.3, 164.4
million HUF).
The project covered 10 settlements of the a Sásd micro-region (Alsómocsolád, Ág, Bikal, Gerényes,
Kisvaszar, Mekényes, Nagyhajmás, Szágy, Tormás, Varga) and one settlement of the neighbouring
Dombóvár micro-region (Döbrököz). The total population of these 11 settlements is around 5 000.
The primary aim of the project was to help the families living in deep poverty and deprivation. It
helped reduce the dependence of the families and enabled them to have longer-term vision.
The main activities of the project were the following:
• establishment of 4 “houses of practical skills”, organisation of community events and provision of
     everyday life helping services (e.g. washing, ironing);
• organisation of competence development training to develop the basic competences of
     housekeeping, gardening and joint practising of the skills learned (e.g. house renovation,
     production of cake coal for heating);
• establishment and operation of a new-type social service, the family mentor;
• preparation of the specialists and the village leaders to understand and ease the situation of the
     families living in poverty (workshops, clubs).

Results
The first among the results to be mentioned is the preparation and implementation of the project,
which the region could not have accomplished without the project management capacity of
Alsómocsolád. They not only implemented the project but implemented it in a way that they also
ensured the thorough local knowledge and the professional skills of the mentors and connection with
the other activities going on in the region. With this the implementation of this project stood out
among the other projects supported under the program that used external management capacities
(application writing companies).
Some 150 families benefited regularly from the services of the project. But the number of those who
received ad-hoc assistance was more than three times higher. Some of the families became capable
of formulating and following longer-term objectives.
More than 30 professionals and village leaders took part regularly in the training activities. The
number of the ad-hoc participants was three times that figure.

Experiences
The example of Alsómocsolád proves that once we succeed in starting to involve development
resources the projects will make it possible to gradually build up a team which will provide targeted
assistance to people living in deep poverty and to the other settlements of the region. With the
internal project management capacity not only more development resources can be procured, but
the funds can also be used more efficiently.

     Annex II. RAS Implementation Roadmap – Consultations and Field
     Visits

On April 13, the team participated at a technical workshop led by with the Ministry of Human
Capacities (MHC) team for government agencies involved in the implementation framework of the
National Social Inclusion Strategy (NSIS): MHC, Türr István Training and Research Institute (TKKI), the
Hungarian Central Statistical Office (HCSO), Ministry for National Economy (MfNE), Ministry of
Interior (MoI) and Lechner Lajos Knowledge Center (LLTK)., and has conducted further follow-up
discussions with MHC, MoI, LLTK and TKKI counterparts on April 14 and 16. The discussions covered
collaboration and knowledge sharing arrangements under the various RAS activities, and synergies
between existing institutional and procedural arrangements and information system architecture
and RAS deliverables.
On April 15, the team visited local social inclusion projects in Pécs and Gyulaj, and conducted
discussions with municipal and civil society stakeholders on the key lessons learned in project
development, implementation and follow-up. In summary, lessons indicated that key factors to
project implementation are (i) sequencing project activities (soft measures need to be implemented
first, with a view to enable the community to participate in project planning), (ii) clear delineation of
responsibilities among local-level actors; (iii) leveraging local civil society partnerships; and (iv) need
for well-structured follow-up activities with the community following project closing. On April 17, the
team conducted further discussions with the MHC and MfNE teams, and identified the lack of
involvement by the Prime Minister’s Office (which houses data and information about European
projects and has not attended the opening workshop) as a high risk to successful project
implementation.
Between May 26 and May 30, the team conducted further technical discussions with MHC, TKKI and
HCSO to further refine the scope and content of the deliverables under this activity. The World Bank
team also visited the municipalities of Békéscsaba, Győr and Jászfényszaru, as well as the Roma
mission of the Hungarian Pentecostal Church in Békés. During the visits the team held discussions
with a broad set of local stakeholders regarding their experiences with the planning and
implementation of social inclusion interventions. The meetings focused in particular on the local
social inclusion planning framework i.e. the development of Local Equality of Opportunities Plans
(LEPs). Additionally, the team led a workshop in Sárkeresztúr which brought together mayors,
managers and beneficiaries of social inclusion projects from 12 rural municipalities in Hungary. The
focus of the workshop was to exchange views on challenges and opportunities with the development
and implementation of social inclusion interventions targeting the most marginalized groups of
Hungarian society.
At these meetings and during the workshop discussion, a number of key challenges were identified,
in particular: (i) the structure, process, budgetary and implementation framework that have been
developed for the planning and implementation of the LEPs are currently not sufficient to enable
municipalities to effectively deliver relevant social inclusion activities; (ii) municipalities face
particular challenges in adequately addressing the multi-dimensional exclusion challenges by the
most marginalized groups; (iii) public works programs are widely used in lieu of more targeted
activation programs, and often substitute for local basic services - hence not only do they fail to
create pathways for the integration of the unemployed into the first labor market, but they also lead
to municipalities’ dependency on such programs; (iv) budget sources (mostly EU funding) are usually
allocated on a project basis, therefore municipalities struggle with medium-to long-term planning,
implementation and monitoring and evaluation of social inclusion measures; and (iv) even though
lack of adequate budget resources is a key concern for most municipalities, the implementation of
the LEPs and Operational Programs for EU funding are currently not sufficiently linked.


                                                    78
In response to the issues identified during the field visits, the team agreed with MHC and TKKI that
the deliverables will focus on effective support for the implementation and monitoring of the LEPs. A
particular emphasis of the deliverables will be on practicality, i.e. to provide “step by step” guidance
for stakeholders who are planning and developing projects that can address the challenges faced by
the most marginalized groups. The World Bank team has prepared annotated outlines of the relevant
deliverables and shared those with your teams for their feedback and inputs.
On June 3 the team joined a dissemination workshop on the Handbook for Improving the Living
Conditions of Roma held at the office of the European Commission in Budapest, with a view to take
advantage of inputs from approximately 40 participants who attended the event, including
representatives from local authorities, civil society organizations, and relevant institutions of the
national government. During the event, the objectives and a summary of key elements of the
Handbook were presented. Representatives from MHC and TKKI provided remarks on the relevance
and applicability of the Handbook in the Hungarian context. MfNE has also given a presentation on
funding opportunities under the 2014-2020 EU Programming period. This was followed by a
discussion with all participants on the Handbook’s applicability and presentations of relevant
experiences by some local authorities.
On June 15, the team conducted discussions with DG Employment, DG Justice and DG Regio to
introduce the scope of the ongoing activities and gather feedback. Comments focused on (i) the need
for close alignment of the planning and implementation framework with the upcoming structural
changes in OP implementation (in particular, the Territorial Integration OP organized at the level of
counties and cities with county rights); (ii) discussions facilitated by the European Commission, its
outcomes and related resources on the role of social economy in activation and social inclusion of
poor and disadvantaged groups; (iii) joint opportunities to disseminate the findings of this RAS to
further EC audiences and country experts.
On July 21, the Country Manager for Hungary and the RAS team conducted another field visit to Pécs
so as to carry out consultations with the deputy mayor, the municipality social policy expert, the
managing director of the Maltese Charity and the local staffs of TKKI. The discussion focused on the
city’s experience in developing and implementing social rehabilitation projects in the 2007-2013
period to address poverty and marginalization in 8 segregated communities located in Pécs’ Eastern
District that are broadly considered to be successful (EU-funded) local social inclusion initiatives. The
most important takeaways from these projects are as follows: (i) local partnerships are key, such
complex interventions require a strong, committed and well-coordinated team of the municipality,
local civil society and TKKI; (ii) sequencing of activities is also essential in that infrastructure
development need to be preceded by intensive family-level social work and community
development; (iii) cross-cutting efforts: the project should be leveraged towards reaching the
community through a multi-pronged approach ranging from skills and employability (for example,
utilizing training opportunities offered by TKKI and public works funds) to education and health (for
example, enabling local actors to provide after-school activities and information seminars on
maternal and child health in the local community center); (iv) follow-up and tracking of clients: it is
very important that, as a follow-up to resettlement interventions, client families continue receiving
social work so as to assist them and their neighbors in adjusting to the new environment. The
municipality has expressed committed to continuing the social rehabilitation projects during the
2014-2020 period and has earmarked approximately HUF 600 million (approximately 1.95 million
EUR) to this end. The city’s most prominent challenge in this forthcoming period is the social
rehabilitation of the István-akna settlement of approximately 250 poor and marginalized (and heavily
indebted) individuals that had recently relocated to the margin of the city creating an extremely poor
and unsafe neighborhood: any investments in this settlement will likely require a lengthy period of
intensive social work and community mobilization. Following these discussions the team has visited
the project locations where the social rehabilitation projects are about to close (György-telep, Hősök-
tere) or ongoing (Pécsbánya, Somogybánya) and conduct discussions with field workers and project

                                                   79
beneficiaries about their experience. The team has also visited a daycare center of adults with mental
disabilities run by the Maltese Charity.
On July 22 the Country Manager led consultations with the Deputy State Secretary for Social
Inclusion at the Ministry of Human Resources. Following an update on the status of RAS deliverables,
the deputy state secretary informed the team about forthcoming priorities under the National Social
Inclusion Strategy’s Implementation Plan (fostering entrepreneurship of Roma professionals,
facilitating after-school programs in marginalized communities, enhancing the labor market
integration of young Roma females) as well as further upcoming initiatives in education supported by
the state secretariat (for example involving corporate actors in developing innovative education
approaches to support skills acquisition of marginalized children).
On July 22 the team has also conducted consultations at a technical workshop with civil society social
inclusion experts in Budapest. The workshop discussed opportunities to improve the national and
local institutional setting for developing social inclusion projects at the local level. Workshop
participants have called for improving the alignment of relevant sectoral strategies with the strategic
framework for equal opportunity, and raised concerns on budgetary incentives at the level of the
local municipalities. The workshop has also identified concrete inputs and contributions for one of
the RAS deliverables, a handbook of social inclusion programs developed for local-level. The team
has also discussed possibilities to develop monitoring and evaluation of social inclusion interventions
at the microregional and local level.
In the course of August, the team has conducted further field visits in rural localities in Alsómocsolád,
Ács, Porcsalma and Szatmárcseke, as well as in the town of Tatabánya, and consulted with local
municipality and civil society stakeholders to learn from local implementation experience (the
lessons of these visits are captured by the case studies developed as part of this study). The team has
continued the technical dialogue with MHC and MfNE counterparts throughout August and
September. The team is planning to conduct further consultations with group of mayors to “test” and
collect feedback on the accompanying Handbook.

governments was prepared by a workgroup at the University of Pécs (Pécsi Tudományegyetem) in
December 2012, commissioned by the István Türr Training and Research Institute within the scope of the
project titled "Guaranteeing the capacity for an equal opportunity-based development policy" with an
identification number of ÁROP-1.1.16.-2012-2012-0001 .

v For example in 2015 the Hungarian Helsinki Committee represents two victims of hate crime and police

inaction before the domestic authorities in a criminal and a police complaint procedure. The two clients of
the HHC were at their relatives’ house when far-right, extremist groups held a demonstration in the town
of Devecser. The crowd marched along the streets mainly inhabited by Roma people, stopped at a house
and threw stones at it and the approximately 12 people – including children – staying in the courtyard,
injuring one person. The police failed to dissolve the demonstration and speeches incited hatred against
Roma citizens, leading to subsequent serious crimes committed by the leaders of the event. Moreover,
when participants both verbally and physically insulted the Roma that were present, the police failed to
intervene. The case is currently pending before the National Police Chief and it will eventually be brought
before the domestic courts and the European Court of Human Rights.
