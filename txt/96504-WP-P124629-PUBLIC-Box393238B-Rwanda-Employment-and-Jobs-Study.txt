                                       Executive Summary

Fast growth in Rwanda since the turn of the century has been accompanied by solid poverty
reduction. Between 2000 and 2013, GDP grew at eight percent per year, resulting in a 170 percent
increase in real GDP. Factoring in population growth, GDP per capita almost doubled. Growth
was accompanied by solid poverty reduction, from 59 percent in 2000 to 57 percent in 2005 and
45 percent in 2010. As the poor almost uniquely depend on labor to generate income, the strong
reduction in poverty suggests tangible improvements in employment outcomes over this period.
This jobs and employment study focuses on the recent dynamics in Rwanda’s jobs’
landscape. Using data from a variety of sources, mainly the three Integrated Households Living
Conditions Surveys (EICV1, EICV2 and EICV3) and the 2011 Establishment Census, the report
looks at what workers in Rwanda are doing and what they are making, and how this has changed
over the past ten to fifteen years. Most of the report focuses on the five years between 2006 and
2011, although at times, we will also look at the evolution since 2001. The report concludes with
a number of ideas to address Rwanda’s jobs challenge in the near future.
    1. A Snapshot of employment
Agriculture and informality define Rwanda’s jobs landscape
As in many low-income countries, unemployment in Rwanda is low. In 2011, about two percent
of the labor force was unemployed, in the sense that they were available for work and actively
looking for employment. Underemployment however is rampant: The median worker worked less
than 26 hours per week in 2011 (in all jobs), despite almost two-thirds of workers having several
jobs. The rate of time-related underemployment was 36 percent, meaning that 36 percent of
workers work less than 35 hours a week but would like to work more.
Despite positive trends (see next section), employment in Rwanda remains characterized by
agriculture, informality and low earnings. In 2011, about 70 percent of workers had their main
job in agriculture, with the remaining 30 percent engaging in a myriad of nonfarm activities1. Farm
self-employment, people working on their own on their family’s farm, accounts for almost 60
percent of employment, followed by farm wage employment (12 percent – see Figure 1). In the
non-farm sector, self-employment in small enterprises dominates, closely followed by wage
employment in the informal sector. The private formal sector provides employment to four percent
of working Rwandans, while the public sector absorbs three percent of workers (Figure 1). Taken
together, the modern wage sector accounts for seven percent of total employment.
For the majority of the population earnings are low (though-as argued later-they have
increased substantially in recent years). In 2011, median monthly earnings from all jobs
amounted to Rwf 18,175 (in 2011 prices), meaning that half of workers earn Rwf 18,175 per month
or less (this amounted to $31 using the official exchange rate and $54 using the purchasing power
parity-adjusted exchange rate)2. Half of workers earned between Rwf 9,400 and Rwf 33,300 per
month3, and 90 percent of workers earn less than Rwf 65,000 per month - Figure 2. Less than six
percent of employed Rwandans earned Rwf 100,000 per month or more (approximately $300 in

labor earnings are lower than the national poverty line.

Low earnings reflect in large part the unskilled nature of the labor force. In 2011, almost 70
percent of the labor force did not complete primary education, and only five percent completed
secondary or more (Figure 3). Younger workers are increasingly being better educated, reflected
by the lower proportion that never went to school and the higher proportions that are progressing
towards incomplete secondary and beyond. The figures for the youth are underestimated, as 29
percent of youth were still in school at the time of the 2011 survey. In any case, the labor force
will remain relatively low-skilled in the near future.

Firms are small and informal and account for a small share of overall employment
Given the dominance of agriculture, only a small fraction of Rwanda’s workforce is
employed in formal or informal business establishments. The 2011 Establishment Census
enumerated 128,000 businesses, providing employment to 280,000 workers, only six percent of
Rwanda’s workforce. Indeed, most establishments are micro, often employing only a single
person, and medium and large firms account for a mere 0.5 percent of establishments (Figure 4).
Medium and large firms are however important in terms of employment, accounting for over 24
percent of employment in establishments (Figure 4). Micro-firms, although they make up more
than 90 percent of firms in Rwanda, provide employment to about half of establishment workers.
Almost 95 percent of firms are informal, accounting for 71 percent of employment in
establishments (Figure 5).

Services dominate both firms and jobs, and most of these are in wholesale and retail trade
and in hotels, restaurant and bars. Over half of firms (51 percent) are in wholesale or retail
trade. Services account for a higher share of establishments than jobs, owing to the small size of
service establishments (Figure 6). Agriculture and manufacturing make up a significant share of
jobs in establishments (17 percent), despite only accounting for 5 percent (manufacturing 4
percent) of firms. Almost one third of all jobs in agriculture and manufacturing (and half of the
jobs in medium and large establishments in these two sectors) are in the Western Province, in
coffee and tea growing cooperatives and in factories.
Within the small formal sector, the most important sectors for waged jobs are retail and
wholesale trade, manufacturing and agriculture (ignoring health and education services).
Retail and wholesale trade and hotels and restaurants account for the bulk of permanent
employment in the formal sector, while tradables (agriculture and manufacturing) and construction
tend to provide temporary employment. At the 4-digit product level, just ten products account for
half of employment in formal established firms (Figure 7). Growing of beverage crops (tea and
coffee), at 13 percent of jobs in formal establishments, is easily the most important formal job-
creating activity, followed by “manufacturing of other food products” which includes tea and
coffee processing (8 percent).

Firms tend to be located in urban areas, along main roads, and in the Western Province
Jobs in establishments in Rwanda are concentrated around the main urban agglomerations
and in the Western province. Employment density is highest in the sectors in Kigali, Rubavu,
Musanze and Rusizi, and, to a lesser extent, Byumba, Huye and Muhanga (Figure 8). Employment,

especially in services, is clearly concentrated along the main national roads: the further away from
a national road, the lower the employment density. Employment in establishments is also relatively
dense in the Western Province along the shoreline of Lake Kivu, owing to the overrepresentation
of firms producing tradables: The Western Province accounts for 24 percent of population and 22
percent of all jobs in establishment, but for 36 percent of jobs in tradables.

    2. The recent jobs dynamics: Firmly positive
A move towards nonfarm employment and agricultural wage employment, driven by the youth
The recent employment trends have been firmly positive. Workers have increasingly
diversified their jobs portfolio by taking up employment in more productive sectors, earnings have
increased substantially from a low base, more foreign and formal firms are being established and,
related, employment in the formal private sector has doubled from a low base (between 2006 and
2011). Moreover, increases in labor productivity have been the driving force behind the increase
in GDP per capita, explaining over 90 percent of per capita GDP growth between 2006 and 2011.
The move towards nonfarm occupations has been one of the most salient evolutions in
Rwanda’s jobs landscape. In 2011, 30 percent of employed Rwandans had their main job outside
agriculture, up from 23 percent in 2006 (and 11 percent in 2001 - Figure 10). The move towards
non-farm occupations as main employment understates the true extent of the shift: Considering all
jobs, regardless of whether it is the primary or secondary occupation, the share of workers with an
occupation outside agriculture increased from 30 percent in 2006 to 45 percent in 2011 (Figure
11). Farmers are increasingly taking up non-agricultural secondary jobs next to their main
occupation on the land.

The move to non-farm occupations has been driven by the youth, in particular young men.
The share of young men with a job in agriculture sharply dropped between 2001 (starting point of
each of the lines in Figure 12), 2006 (middle point of the lines) and 2011 (last point of each line),
indicating that more and more young men are abandoning agriculture altogether. Middle-aged and
older men do not abandon agriculture, but are increasingly likely to have their main occupation
outside farming (while keeping secondary occupations in agriculture). The shift to non-farm
employment as primary occupation (as shown in Figure 10) is thus the result of two complimentary
dynamics: First, young people are abandoning agriculture altogether and moving to non-farm
occupations, while older workers increasingly shift their main occupation outside farming but keep
a strong foot on the farm (as secondary occupation).
Within agriculture, the employment structure is changing too. The share of workers employed
as unpaid labor on the family farm dropped from 38 percent in 2006 to 29 percent in 2011, while
the share of wage farmers increased (Figure 13). The move to wage farming is also driven by the
youth, and in particular by young women. Although there are no panel data, the net job additions
in agriculture between 2006 and 2011 are indicative of young women (16-30) moving from unpaid
farming (on the family farm) to paid farming (on somebody else’s farm - Figure 14). The
employment transitions are substantially gendered: While young men tended to move out of
agriculture towards non-farm occupations, young women have shifted employment within
agriculture.

Rwandan workers have increasingly taken up additional jobs since 2006. In 2011, two thirds
of workers had several jobs, up from 40 percent in 2006. The increase has especially been salient
among workers with a main job in agriculture: 63 percent of agricultural workers had several jobs

                                                                                                                                           xiv
in 2011, up from 37 percent in 2006. For farmers, the uptake of additional jobs amounted in large
part to a diversification into nonfarm activities (Figure 11). Despite the uptake of additional jobs,
the median worker in 2011 worked fewer hours than in 2006 and was more likely to be
underemployed: Median hours worked per week in all jobs decreased from 29 in 2006 to 26 in
2011, and the time-related underemployment rate modestly increased from 34 percent to 36
percent.
An increase in earnings, correlated with diversification and the uptake of additional jobs
Individual labor earnings increased substantially since 2006. Median earnings from all jobs
increased by 66 percent between 2006 and 2011, and the share of workers with earnings below the
poverty line decreased from 54 percent to 33 percent. Agriculture led the earnings increase:
Earnings of independent farmers almost doubled while those of wage farmers and unpaid farm
workers increased by half. As a result, the low earnings rate in agriculture dropped from 59 percent
in 2006 to 37 percent in 2011. This is in line with the agriculture-driven poverty reduction as
documented by the Rwanda Poverty Assessment.
Low earnings are increasingly a consequence of underemployment. While the low earnings
rate has dropped, the share of low earners who have low earnings due to short hours
(underemployment) increased between 2006 and 2011. In fact, of all low earners in 2011, 58
percent would not be low earners if they could increase hours worked. Low earnings are
increasingly a consequence of underemployment rather than insufficient remuneration per unit of
time: The share of workers who earn below the poverty line despite working long hours dropped
from 12 percent in 2006 to nine percent in 2011, and the share who only manage to escape low
earnings by working long hours decreased from seven percent to three percent.
Diversification into non-farm occupations has been most closely correlated with the increase
in earnings. In a decomposition framework, 12 percent of the increase in median earnings can be
accounted for by the higher share of workers with an occupation outside farming (Figure 15)4.
There are a number of interesting differences in the correlates of earnings growth between lower-
and higher-earning workers. Taking up additional jobs has been particularly important for earnings
growth of low-earners, while diversification into non-farm occupations, both as main and
secondary occupations, explain the largest part of the earnings increase for the higher earners
(Figure 15). Poor workers have increased earnings by working more jobs, while better-off workers
have boosted their earnings by progressively moving to non-farm activities.

 Given the short time frame between the surveys (five years), changes in workforce characteristics explain only a
small fraction (22 percent) of the change in earnings.

Solid growth of the formal private sector, from a low base
Though the formal private sector in Rwanda remains small, employment has more than
doubled between 2006 and 2011. In 2011, the formal private sector provided (main) employment
to 200,000 workers (4 percent of overall employment), up from about 90,000 in 2006. Between
2006 and 2011, a substantial number of formal firms have started operations in Rwanda, generating
additional formal sector employment: According to the 2011 Establishment Census, 35 percent of
total employment in formal firms was added in the five years between 2006 and 2011.

    3. Going forward: The employment outlook for Rwanda
Rwanda’s economy is projected to grow at rates above 7 percent on average through 2020.
The potential growth rate of the economy-the growth rate that could be obtained if all production
factors are used efficiently-is estimated at 7.6 percent for the 2015-20 period, almost similar to the
growth rate observed between 2000 and 2013 (7.9 percent per annum). Further increases in labor
productivity and the demographic dividend-the increasing share of working-age adults in total
population-are expected to drive growth (Figure 17).

The shift from farm to nonfarm occupations is projected to continue and will be the main
driver of productivity increases over the coming five years. Under a baseline scenario of 7.8
percent GDP growth during between 2011 and 2020 and the same productivity increases as during
2006-11, the share of agriculture in employment will drop to almost half (56 percent) of total
employment by 2020, down from about 70 percent in 2011 (Figure 5)5. Overall employment is
projected to grow by 2.2 million between 2011 and 2020, with most of the employment to be
absorbed by the tertiary and secondary sector (Figure 19). Employment in agriculture is projected
to grow much slower, pushing down its share in overall employment.

Going forward, Rwanda, as indeed many African countries, is faced with a substantial jobs
challenge. Between now (2015) and 2020, the working age population will grow by 220,000 every
year, outpacing the rate of job growth between 2006 and 2011 (126,000 jobs per year). The
EDPRS-2 aims for the creation of 200,000 off-farm jobs every year, double the rate of non-farm
job creation between 2006 and 2011. The modern wage sector (public and private formal) added
28,000 jobs per year between 2006 and 2011, which means, naively extrapolating, that the bulk of
labor market entrants over the coming five years will need to seek employment in the informal
nonfarm sector or in agriculture. According to the projections however, reaching the off-farm jobs
target is feasible: the secondary and tertiary sectors are projected to add 1.8 million workers
between 2011 and 2020 (Figure 19), which comes down to an annual off-farm jobs growth of
200,000.

 The projections are based on a forward-looking Shapley decomposition presented in Annex 6. The projections
assume that GDP will grow at 7.8 percent between 2011 and 2010, that sectoral growth will be the same as in
2006-2011, and the population will grow according to projections by the World Population Prospects.

Rwanda is faced with the twin challenge of (1) creating sufficient jobs to accommodate the
growing labor force and (2) improving earnings for workers in precarious occupations,
mainly in subsistence agriculture and the informal non-farm sector. Although far from a
comprehensive strategy, promoting urbanization, improving connectivity to domestic and regional
markets-especially in the Western province-and further increasing agricultural productivity could
help address those challenges in the medium run.

First, Rwanda’s nonfarm jobs, especially in the service sector, are concentrated in urban
agglomerations (Figure 8). Developing the urban agglomerations, as the Government is currently
planning for six secondary cities, and making creating better conditions for the towns to grow is
likely to be associated with increased service activity and increased demand for labor in nonfarm
service enterprises. Since the service enterprises in secondary cities mainly serve local demand,
increased nonfarm activity and jobs in these cities will require higher agricultural production or
development of activities in the secondary sector in these cities (to stimulate local demand from
surrounding areas), or better linkages to neighboring countries (to stimulate external demand).
Currently, the six secondary towns are service centers, with over three quarters of employment in
trade. Based on descriptive data from the Establishment Census, there is scope for tradable firms
to expand investment in the towns, in particular in Musanze and Rubavu.

Second, there appear to be substantial growth opportunities in the Western Province. The
Western Province accounts for the largest share of firms and employment in tradables related to
agribusiness, and also for the bulk of jobs in exports. The Western Province however has poor
domestic market accessibility, in particular in the southwest around Rusizi and between Rusuzi
and Karongi. Figure 20 suggests that improving transport accessibility along Lake Kivu, and
electrification around Rubavu and Rusizi may be necessary to stimulate productivity gains for
tradable production in the Western Province. In addition, night-time lights show that, apart from
Kigali, there is not a single town in Rwanda that matches the economic density of Bukavu and
Goma. Rusizi and Rubavu are exceptionally well-placed to exploit the urban demand coming from
these cities and could specialize in supplying the urban centers of Eastern DRC.

Finally, and this cannot be overemphasized, further increases in agricultural productivity
will be required to continue the structural employment transitions. As argued by the 2013
World Development Report, virtually every episode of mass poverty reduction in modern history
has begun with sharp increases in agricultural productivity. A further increase in agricultural
productivity remains the main avenue to improving earnings and living standards for the bulk of
Rwandan workers. Productivity gains in agriculture will also facilitate a labor reallocation from
rural to urban areas, and from farming to non-farming, which has is in its turn been an important
driver of poverty reduction in Rwanda over the past decade.

    1. Trends in GDP Growth, Population, Poverty and Employment
GDP and Population
Rwanda achieved rapid growth since 2000, resulting in a 170 percent increase in GDP
between 2000 and 2013. Prudent macroeconomic policy has enabled the country to achieve high
economic growth, poverty reduction and macroeconomic stability. Fiscal and monetary policies
geared towards maintaining macroeconomic stability, coupled with an emphasis on building
institutional capacity, on promoting good governance, and on creating a business-friendly
environment, contributed to low inflation and average annual economic growth of eight percent
(between 2000 and 2013). From a regional perspective, Rwanda’s macroeconomic performance
has generally outperformed its peers and earned the country a spot on the list of the 10 fastest-
growing economies in the world (Figure 22).

Growth in Rwanda has been driven by the non-tradable sector while the contribution from
the tradable sector (export crops, manufacturing, and mining) has been limited (Figure 23).
This is reflected in the high-service sector contribution (58 percent) to the overall growth followed
by agriculture (24 percent) and industry (18 percent) as well as in growth decomposition by
expenditure items (Figure 24). While consumption was the main driver of growth, investment
(especially non-construction) only had a limited contribution (Figure 25).

Foreign aid and effective use of it have played a critical role in growth and macroeconomic
stability.6 Net official development assistance (ODA) as a share of GDP remained high at 20
percent in 2011 or 93 percent of gross fixed capital formation, though it declined from over 150

percent in the early 2000s. Aid flows into Rwanda have been redistributed through public
expenditures. In the past decade, foreign aid (accounting for 30-40 percent of the budget) has
supplemented low domestic tax collections and created fiscal space. While the direct impact of
public expenditures has been relatively small (public service contributed 10 percent to the increase
in GDP between 2006 and 2013 as illustrated in Figure 25), public expenditures stimulated private
services such as trade and real estate. Foreign exchange inflows through aid have also financed the
negative current account balance (excluding official transfers) and made the overall balance of
payments positive in the past decade.

Public investment financed by aid accounted for more than 50 percent of total investment.
The share of investment increased from 16 percent in 2006 to 25 percent in 2013, mainly due to
investment in construction, whereas investment in capital goods increased only marginally.
Although the share of exports increased to 17 percent in 2013, there has been little progress toward
export diversification. Traditional products (coffee, tea, and minerals) accounted for almost 60
percent of exports in 2013.

Rwanda’s growth accounting exercise measures the contributions of different factors such
as capital stock, labor, quality of labor (measured by average year of schooling) and total
factor productivity (TFP). The exercise shows that physical capital and total factor productivity
were the main drivers of growth. Although the investment rate as a share of GDP remains low,
stocks of physical capital have accumulated from a low base (Figure 26).

Rwanda is the most densely populated country on the continent and population growth
remains high. Population grew at an annual rate of 2.6 percent over the past decade, translating
into an increase in real per capita GDP of 87 percent between 2000 and 2013 (as opposed to a 170
percent increase in GDP). Overall, per capita GDP grew at an annual rate of almost five percent

Poverty
Rwanda’s growth was accompanied by solid poverty reduction. The share of the population
living below the national poverty line decreased from 59 percent in 2001 to 57 percent in 2006 and
45 percent in 2011 (Figure 31). Poverty reduction over the past decade has mainly been driven by
increases in agricultural production and productivity and progressive diversification towards non-
farm activities. From a decomposition perspective, the increase in household-level agricultural
production accounted for 35 percent of poverty reduction over the past decade, while the move to
non-farm economic activities accounted for another 16 percent (Figure 32).
Though aggregate growth was high throughout the last decade, the pace of poverty reduction
only picked up since 2006. Despite average growth of 8 percent per year between 2000 and 2006,
poverty only decreased by a disappointing two percentage points (Figure 31). Between 2006 and
2011 however, poverty decreased by 12 percentage points, also with an aggregate growth rate of
8 percent. In the early years of the 2000s household consumption growth was concentrated in
Kigali City and benefited the better-off more than the poor (Figure 29). The experience in the
second half of the decade was the exact mirror-image: Growth was stronger in rural areas than in
Kigali City and benefited the poor more than the non-poor (Figure 30).

       2. Employment and Productivity Trends
Rwanda’s rapid growth has been accompanied by substantial job creation. Between 2006 and
20118, employment, rose by 15.4 percent, marginally faster than the rapid increase of the working
age population. While agriculture added jobs since 2006 (Figure 33), it lost in relative importance
as the sector has been adding workers at a much slower rate than the non-farm sectors of the
economy. Compared with 2006, the share of agricultural workers has decreased by seven
percentage points whereas the share of workers in the services sector has increased by 4 percentage
points, of which half are in trade services sector (Figure 35). Industry sharply increased its
employment share from a low base. More than 70 percent of the population continues however to
be employed in agriculture (Box).

As in many low-income countries, the employment rate in Rwanda is high. Out of a working-
age population of 5.9 million (during the last nationally representative household survey with
information on employment, in 2011), 4.7 million were employed (in the week preceding the
survey), resulting in an employment to working-age population ratio of 81 percent. The
employment rate is down marginally from 82 percent in 2006, largely due to an increase in
inactivity rates9 (Table 2). The increase in the inactivity rate is driven by the higher proportion of
young people staying in school.

Formal unemployment in Rwanda is low. In the week preceding the EICV3 survey, 2.4 percent
of the labor force was unemployed, in the sense that they were available for work and actively
looking for employment. Unemployment is down from 4.6 percent in 2006 (Table 2). Considered
on a yearly basis, 0.9 percent of the labor force was unemployed in 2011 (not having worked for
12 months preceding the survey), down from 1.9 percent in 2006. Unemployment is higher in
urban areas (8.8 percent vs 1.2 percent in rural areas), among the youth (3.5 percent vs 1.4 percent
for 30+), and among the better-off (5.1 percent in the top consumption quintile vs 1.5 percent in
the bottom four quintiles).
Unemployment is an indicator of limited usefulness in low-income agrarian settings. As most
people cannot afford to be unemployed, official unemployment rates are low but underemployment
and low quality employment are rampant. The same is true for Rwanda: Almost 70 percent of
employed persons work less than 35 hours a week and 36 percent work 20 hours or less. A
substantial fraction of workers, particularly youth and women, are employed as unpaid labor on
family farms or in non-farm family enterprises. The 19th Conference on Labor Statisticians does
no longer consider unpaid household workers as part of the labor force, which, if applied to the
EICV3 data, would result in an employment-to-working-age-population ratio of 58 percent rather
than the 81 percent listed in Table 110.
Labor productivity has been the main driver of GDP per capita growth between 2006 and
2011. Output per worker rose by 24.2 percent over this period, explaining 93 percent of the growth
in per capita value-added (Table 3). The increase in productivity is linked to aid and public
expenditures: A significant share of aid has gone into financing public investment, which has
raised productivity. Changes in employment rates and the demographic composition of the
population only had marginal effects.

    Inactive are those who are of working age but are neither working nor actively seeking employment.

     This calculation considers all unpaid household workers as out of the labor force (and hence not employed).

While labor productivity increased overall, some of the non-farm subsectors experienced a
net decrease in productivity between 2006 and 2011. Output per worker declined in the industry
sector, most notably in mining and quarrying, and in hotels in restaurants (
Figure 36). The hotels and restaurants subsector experienced the sharpest productivity decline, as
the 150 percent increase in the number of employees resulted in a mere 15 percent increase in
value added. Productivity however increased in the other services subsectors. The agriculture
sector, where the bulk of workers are employed, maintained a trend of rising productivity, with
output per worker increasing by 21 percent. Productivity in agriculture remains however a lot
lower than productivity in non-farm sectors (
Figure 36). Productivity in the second main employment-generating sector, trade, also increased.

Consistent with the above trends, the overall increase in productivity in the economy was a
result of the inter-sectoral shift from agriculture to non-farm sectors and an increase in
productivity within agriculture. The inter-sectoral shift in workers had by far the biggest
contribution to the growth of output per worker between 2006 and 2011 (contributed for 66 percent
of the overall increase in output per worker), indicating migration of workers from less to more
productive sectors. Within sectors, productivity in agriculture (contribution of 33 percent) and
trade (7 percent) also had a positive contribution. On the other hand, mining and hospitality sectors
were the biggest drag on overall labor productivity.

    3. Conclusions
Rwanda’s solid growth has been accompanied by sizable changes in the economic activity of
the population. The fraction of workers with a main occupation in agriculture is decreasing, and
more and more workers, especially the youth (see next chapter) have their main job in non-farm
activities. The intersectoral shift from agriculture towards non-agricultural occupations has
boosted productivity: Output per worker increased by 24 percent between 2006 and 2011, two-
thirds of which was accounted for by the intersectoral shifts. The increase in productivity within
agriculture also boosted overall labor productivity, while the secondary sector, in particular mining
and manufacturing, were among the biggest drag on overall productivity. Growth in labor

While the focus of this chapter is firmly on the recent employment and earnings dynamics, we
kick-off this chapter by briefly describing the current jobs and employment situation in Rwanda
in three stylized facts. The remainder of the chapter focuses on the dynamics between 2006 and
2011, using the two latest integrated household living conditions surveys (the EICV2 in 2005/6
and EICV3 in 2010/11)11. In some cases, we will also present the longer-term changes between
2000/1 and 2010/11 (using the EICV1 in 2000/1).

Fact 1: A young and low-skilled labor force
The labor force in Rwanda is young and low-skilled. Half of the labor force is between 16 and
32 years of age, and only 20 percent is 50 or older. Despite recent improvements, in particular
among the youth, education of the labor force remains low: Almost 70 percent of the labor force
did not complete primary education and only five percent completed secondary school or more
(Figure 38). One in five labor force participants never entered school to begin with.

Fact 2: Employment dominated by agriculture and informality
Agriculture provides employment to the bulk of working Rwandans. Independent family
farming (people cultivating their own or their family’s land without a wage) represents the main

employment for 2.9 million working-age Rwandans, accounting for almost 60 percent of overall
employment (Figure 39 and Figure 40). Wage farming (people cultivating other people’s land for
a wage) provides employment to another 0.6 million people (12 percent of total employment).
Taken together, 70 percent of workers have their main occupation in agriculture (the sum of the
shares of independent farming, unpaid family farming, and wage farming in Figure 39).

The non-farm sector is characterized by wage employment and informality. Approximately
0.9 million Rwandans have their main job in non-farm wage employment, accounting for 19
percent of total employment, while 0.6 million (12 percent) are engaged in independent non-farm
business activities (grouping the categories “non-farm self-employment”, “employer”, and
“unpaid household enterprise workers in Figure 39). The bulk of employment in the non-farm
sector is informal: 60 percent of wage work and 90 percent of independent employment in the non-
farm sector is informal.
The modern wage sector-providing what many would consider “good jobs”-is small. About
0.15 million workers have their main employment in the public sector, while the formal private
sector accounts for another 0.2 million workers (Figure 40). Taken together, the modern wage
sector provides employment to approximately six percent of the working-age population. The
formal private sector remains marginal in terms of employment, accounting for three percent of
the working-age population.

The bulk of jobs in Rwanda do not involve any labor exchange, blurring the distinction
between demand and supply and productivity and wages. Most workers are self-employed in
agriculture or in small, mainly one-person, enterprises in the non-farm sector. In 2011, wage
employment (where people exchange labor in return for a wage) accounted for about 30 of workers
(Figure 39). The remaining 70 percent of workers were self-employed in subsistence agriculture
or in non-farm businesses.

Fact 3: Low earnings and widespread underemployment
For the majority of the population earnings are low (though they have increased
considerably since 2006). In 2011, median monthly earnings from all jobs amounted to Rwf
18,175, meaning that half of workers earn Rwf 18,175 per month or less (this amounts to $ using
the official exchange rate and $54 using the purchasing power parity-adjusted exchange rate)12.
Half of workers earn between Rwf 113,000 and Rwf 400,000 per year (between 9,400 and 33,300
per month13) and 90 percent of workers earn less than Rwf 780,000 per year (Rwf 65,000 per
month - Figure 41). Less than six percent of employed Rwandans earn Rwf 100,000 per month or
more (approximately $300 in PPP terms).

More than 30 percent of workers are engaged in so-called “low-earnings jobs”, jobs that earn
less than the official poverty line14. This rises to 45 percent for workers in the bottom 40 percent
(Box 2). Low earnings are mainly a consequence of underemployment: 76 percent of workers with
low earnings earn below the poverty line because of the short hours they work (Table 4). Almost
40 percent of workers in Rwanda are underemployed, meaning that they work less than 35 hours
a week and would like to work more.

Workers in agriculture earn significantly less than non-farm workers. Median monthly
earnings (from all jobs) of an agricultural worker amounted to Rwf 16,000 in 2011 (PPP $48),
substantially lower than for workers with a main job outside farming (Rwf 30,000 – PPP $89).
Within sectors there are important differences too: In farming, wage famers are the worst-off with
over 40 percent of them earning below the poverty line (Table 5). Independent farmers are,
relatively speaking, best-off. In the non-farm sector, median earnings are highest for employers
and lowest among the self-employed (those working alone in a one-person business).

              Female, rural, and heavily dependent on agriculture
              The characteristics of the bottom 40 percent are unsurprising
Workers in the bottom 40 percent remain overly dependent on agriculture and, by consequence, the vicissitudes of
unpredictable weather patterns. In 2011, over 80 percent of the bottom 40 had their main job in agriculture, compared to 70
percent for the overall population and 62 percent of workers in the top 60. Within agriculture, the bottom 40 percent are also
overrepresented in the worst types of jobs: Over 50 percent have their main job in wage farming or unpaid family farming,
compared to 40 percent of the overall population (Figure 42). Though the bottom 40 workers are more likely to work several
jobs, they are less likely to have a secondary job outside agriculture: 36 percent of the bottom 40 has a secondary job outside
agriculture, compared to 44 percent of the general population.

  Earnings of the bottom 40 are low. 45 percent of workers in the bottom 40 earn below the poverty line, compared to
  32 percent of the general population. In 2011, half of the bottom 40 workers earned Rwf 13,400 per month or less (PPP
  US$ 40). Workers in the bottom 40 are on average somewhat older (median age of 35 compared to 32 overall), more
  likely to be female (58 percent of the bottom 40 is female), and overwhelmingly rural (94 percent live in rural areas).
  Despite poor earnings, growth in earnings between 2006 and 2011 has been pro-poor, with especially the bottom 40
  experiencing a strong earnings increase from a low base (see further).

In non-farm wage employment, the modern sector provides the highest earnings. Median
earnings in the public sector amounted to approximately Rwf 50,000 per month in 2011 (PPP
$150), compared to Rwf 41,600 (PPP $124) in the formal private sector and Rwf 22,100 (PPP $66)
in the informal private sector (Figure 43). Working in the non-farm sector seems uniformly better
than farming: Even the least attractive non-farm activity (wage employment in the informal private
sector) is associated with higher earnings than any of the agricultural types of employment (Table
5).

Public sector workers’ higher earnings are largely a result of their better endowments. Using
the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, we find that 80 percent of the earnings differential between
the public and the formal private sector is due to differences in workers’ characteristics, in
particular public sector workers’ higher educational attainment and older age (see Annex 2). There
are no discernible differences in returns to characteristics between the public and private formal
sector (that is, public sector workers do not appear to get paid more for similar characteristics).
Different returns to characteristics do however explain a significant part (38 percent) of earnings
differences between the private formal and informal sectors. In particular, returns to education are
significantly higher in the formal than in the informal sector (Annex 2).
The stylized facts paint a bleak picture of the employment situation in Rwanda,
characterized by agriculture, informality, and low earnings. Nevertheless, the employment
situation has markedly improved since 2006 and there have been a number of firmly positive
evolutions, most notably a diversification into non-farm occupations and a strong increase in
earnings. The following sections focus on these dynamics and highlight the role played by young
workers as an engine of change.

       2. What workers do and the way they do it are changing
       2.1      A move from agriculture to non-farm occupations
One of the most salient evolutions over the past decade is the progressive move towards non-
farm occupations. In 2011, 30 percent of employed Rwandans had their main job outside
agriculture, up from 23 percent in 2006 and 11 percent in 2001 -Figure 4415. The move to non-
farm occupations happened both for wage and self-employment: The share of workers with a main
job in non-farm wage employment increased from 13 percent in 2006 to 18 percent in 2011
(coming from a mere eight percent in 2001), while the share of non-farm self-employment
increased from 10 percent to 12 percent (but increased significantly from the five percent in 2001).
The decline in agricultural employment is mainly due to a big drop in unpaid family farm workers:
29 percent of workers had their main job in unpaid family farming in 2011, down from 38 percent
in 2006 (Table 6).

As most workers in Rwanda are engaged in multiple jobs, focusing on the main job only (as
Figure 44 does) can be misleading. In the case of Rwanda, the move out of agriculture is not
contradicted when considering all jobs instead of just the primary job: the proportion of farm jobs
in the total number of jobs in Rwanda decreased from 86 percent in 2001 to 68.4 percent in 2011,
a reduction of 17.6 percentage points. On the contrary, farm jobs increased their share in secondary
employment by three percentage points between 2001 and 2011 (Figure 47). While the absolute
number of people working in agriculture as main employment is largely flat over the past decade,
the number of jobs in farming has increased substantially (Figure 48). The overall picture is

  Main employment is defined as the job in which the person worked most hours in the 12 months preceding the
survey. Defining the main job as the job that procures the biggest share of income does not result in any
qualitative changes.

 indicative of a transformation occurring in the country with an increasing number of secondary
 jobs being taken up in agriculture by workers whose primary job is progressively shifting towards
 non-agricultural sectors.
                               A Transition on Steroids
         Box 1                 At the start of the millennium, agriculture’s employment share was far above
                               the regional low-income average; it has quickly converged since
The share of workers employed in agriculture has decreased sharply since the turn of the century (Figure 44). This transition has
not been limited to Rwanda. Indeed, Africa’s decade of strong growth has been accompanied by a reallocation of labor from
agriculture to on average more productive non-farm sectors. The transition has however been particularly fast in Rwanda: In 2000,
the employment share of agriculture was substantially higher in Rwanda (89 percent) than in other low-income African countries
(77 percent on average for countries with data)16. By 2010, Rwanda still had a higher share of employment in agriculture (72 percent
vs 69 percent as the low-income average), but the gap had substantially narrowed (Figure 45). By 2010, the employment structure
in Rwanda looked similar to that of other low-income countries in Africa, though the share of services in total employment was a
little lower (Figure 46).

The non-farm sector accounted for the bulk of new employment since 2006. There were
approximately 0.6 million new workers working in 2011 (compared to 2006), 73 percent of whom
took up employment in the non-farm sector (Figure 50). Non-farm wage employment accounted
half of new workers (51 percent), with especially the private sector absorbing many new workers:
The informal private sector added 300,000 wage workers (a three-fold increase since 2006), while
the formal private sector added 100,000 (a doubling since 2006). Considering both the public and
the formal private sector, modern wage employment grew by 67 percent between 2006 and 2011.

              What are Rwanda’s non-farm wage workers doing?
              Government, construction, and domestic services
What does non-farm wage employment look like in Rwanda? The public sector dominates wage employment in the non-farm
sector, accounting for 20 percent of overall non-farm wage employment, followed by construction (19 percent) and domestic
services (17 percent). The remaining share of wage employment in the non-farm sector is scattered over a large variety of
sectors and occupations, mainly retail trade (five percent), transport (five percent), and mining and quarrying (four percent).
Government (66,000 new workers), construction (100,000 new workers) and domestic services (55,000 new workers) also
accounted for the bulk of wage job additions in non-farm sector since 2006 (Figure 49).

the tertiary sector, compared to 183,000 for the secondary sector and 172,000 in the primary sector
(Figure 11).

The move to non-farm employment was particularly important for men. The share of male
workers with a main occupation outside farming increased from 33 percent in 2006 to 42 percent
in 2011, while the share for women remained low at 19 percent, up from 15 percent in 2006 (Table
7). Male workers transitioned mainly to wage employment in the non-farm sector, whose share in
total employment increased by eight percentage points. Though women also increasingly had their
main occupation in non-farming, the main change for women happened within the agricultural
sector, with unpaid work on the family farm losing importance to independent farming and wage
farming (Table 7)18.

Young men spearheaded the move to non-farm employment. Figure 53 shows, for each cohort,
the proportion of workers with their main job in agriculture in 2001, 2005, and 2011. Each line in
Figure 53 follows the same cohort through time: the starting point of each line shows the proportion
of the cohort with a main job in agriculture in 2001, while the middle and ending points of the
same line shows the proportion of this same cohort who still had their main job in agriculture by
2006 and 2011, respectively. For the youngest cohort for example (the first line in Figure 53), who
were 16 years of age in 2001, 95 percent had a main job in farming in 2001. This dropped to about
70 percent in 2006 (when the cohort was now 21 years old) and 50 percent by 2011 (when they
were 26 years old). While main employment in agriculture decreased for all cohorts (except for
the oldest cohort), the decrease was far more salient for the young19. While women also
increasingly had their main employment outside farming, the magnitude of the shift was a lot
smaller (see in Annex 3).

Looking at all jobs rather than just the main job, the principal finding is that agriculture is
being abandoned by young cohorts of Rwandans. The share of workers with a job in agriculture,
regardless whether it is as a primary or secondary occupation, dropped off sharply since 2001 for
the younger cohorts (Figure 12). The middle-aged cohorts however do not abandon agriculture but
rather modify their engagement with the farm: While middle-aged workers (in their 40s and 50s)
are substantially less likely than before to have their main job in farming (Figure 53), the share
that does not work in agriculture at all only diminished modestly (Figure 12). The shift to non-
farm employment as primary occupation is thus the result of two complimentary dynamics: First,
young people are abandoning agriculture altogether and moving to non-farm occupations, while
older workers increasingly shift their main occupation outside farming but keep a strong foot on
the farm (as secondary occupation).

Education and location are the main cohort characteristics correlated with the shift out of
agriculture. Higher educated cohorts are more likely to be in nonfarm jobs (see Annex 4).
Estimates of a pseudo-panel regression show that a higher educational level (relative to cohorts
with no schooling at all) is correlated with a larger ratio of nonfarm to farm jobs. The impact of
education increases monotonically with the level of education and reaches a peak at secondary or
higher education. Urbanization matters too: the larger the fraction of individuals living in urban
areas in each cohort the higher the share of nonfarm jobs relative to farm jobs in that cohort. The
lag of the proportion of nonfarm to farm jobs in each cohort has a positive effect indicating some
degree of persistence. The larger the share of nonfarm to farm jobs in each cohort in year t, the
larger that proportion is in year t+1. The move to nonfarm activities hence is likely to continue.

    2.2              A changing employment structure within agriculture
Another salient evolution in Rwanda’s jobs scene is the move towards wage employment in
agriculture. While unpaid family farming (household members working on the household farm
without remuneration) dropped as a share of employment, from 38 percent in 2006 to 29 percent
in 2011, the share of wage farming increased (Table 6). In absolute terms, independent family
farming shed workers since 2006 (there were about 18,000 fewer workers in farm self-employment
in 2001 than in 2006 - Figure 50), while wage farming recorded a strong increase (there were
190,000 more wage farmers in 2011 than in 2006).
The agricultural dynamics differed between women and men. For women, the declining share
of unpaid family labor was to some extent compensated by the increasing share in independent
farming and wage farming (Figure 55). For men, the declining share in unpaid family farming was
accompanied by a decline in independent farming and a modest increase in wage farming (Figure
56). While the picture for men points towards a progressive diversification out of agriculture
towards non-farm activities, women rather tended to shift occupations within agriculture.

The move to wage employment in agriculture is mainly driven by female youth. For the
younger cohorts, the share of women with a main job in farm wage employment increased
substantially between 2001 and 2011 (steeply sloped lines in Figure 57). To illustrate, only about
two percent of women in the cohort born in 1982/3 (second line in Figure 57) had their main job
in farm wage employment in 2001. By 2011, this had increased to 12 percent20. For older cohorts,
the lines are flatter, indicating a slower move towards farm wage employment for older women.
While men also were more and more likely to engage in farm wage employment, the trend was
less outspoken than for women and appears to have lost momentum with the second half of the
decade (Annex 5).

Whether the move to farm wage employment has been positive or negative depends largely
on where the young women were coming from (what they were doing before). Looking at job
dynamics between 2006 and 2011, there was a net decrease in young women working as unpaid
farm labor and a net increase in young women working as independent farmers and agricultural
employees (Figure 1). Although there are no panel data, this is consistent with female youth
moving from unpaid family labor to paid farm labor (and to a somewhat lesser extent, independent
farming). Given that unpaid family farmers are heavily underemployed on the family farm (see
next section) and do not actually earn an income, the move to wage farming may have been
important in pushing up aggregate household incomes.

The increase in farm wage employment seems to suggest a move towards a more commercial
or market-oriented mode of agricultural production. At the household level, the share of
harvests that are sold on markets has increased steadily over the past decade, from 13 percent in
2001 to 21 percent in 2011. Also-although hard data on this are not available-the rollout of the
policy of agricultural land use consolidation and regionalization since 2007/8 is believed to have
increased the demand for farm wage labor due to drastically bigger harvests. Under the policy,
called the Crop Intensification Program (CIP), farmers consolidate the use of their lands (to bring
production to scale) and grow one single crop based on prevailing agro-ecological conditions.
According to MINAGRI data, production of priority crops increased substantially following the
rollout of the CIP21: Production of maize increased five-fold, that of wheat and cassava three-fold
and production of beans and Irish potatoes doubled. Increased production may have increased
demand for farm wage labor, which may have been a more attractive option for young women
previously working as unpaid labor on the family farm.

The move to wage employment was not confined to the farm sector. The reduction in nonwage
employment occurred across the board, with workers progressively embracing wage employment
in both the farm and nonfarm sector. In terms of jobs, the shift has occurred gradually between
2001 and 2011 (Figure 60), whereas in terms of workers it was concentrated in the first half of the
decade (Figure 59). Workers first moved to a wage job in their main activity and then gradually
shifted to a wage type of relationship in non-primary activities. Though women also transitioned
out of nonwage employment, the move to nonwage employment was larger among males and
among youth (see Annex 5).

  The figures so far hint at a disadvantaged employment position of women. Looking at Table
  7, women are four times more likely than men to have their main job in unpaid farming, and almost
  four times less likely to engage in non-farm wage employment as main occupation. Women are
  also less likely to be self-employed in the non-farm sector or to be employers. As a result, median
  earnings of women are almost 20 percent lower than those of men. The bulk of the earnings gap
  between men and women (77 percent) is unexplained by differences in characteristics. Rather,
  women have substantially lower returns to education and experience (age) than men do (that is,
  for similar age and education, women earn significantly less than men).



      Box 3
                         Education, discrimination, or cultural self-selection?
                         Whatever the reason, women’s position in the labor market is not enviable
Women in Rwanda are overrepresented in the lower-quality job categories. 81 percent of women have their main job in agriculture,
a comparatively low-productivity and low-earnings sector, compared to 58 percent of men. Within agriculture, women are more than
four times more likely than men to be involved in unpaid family labor as main occupation. Overall, considering both the farm and the
non-farm sector, 30 percent of workers in Rwanda have a main job as unpaid family worker. 84 percent of them are women.
There is an obvious reason why women are underrepresented in better jobs: Education Women are significantly less educated than
men, which explains in part the underrepresentation in better job categories. However, focusing on the two youngest cohorts (16-25
years-old), young women still are worse off despite education levels similar to those as young men. Young women are 20 percentage
points more likely than young men to have their main job in agriculture and are almost twice as likely to be engaged in unpaid family
labor as main occupation (Figure 61). Controlling for the effect of education, young men are more than twice as likely to engage in non-
farm wage employment compared to women. The underrepresentation of women in non-farm wage employment is especially salient
in the formal private sector, where young women account for only 28 percent of jobs (Figure 62).

For the young cohorts, the worse labor market position of women is not due to education. Rather, it is possible that young women,
for cultural reasons, self-select in agriculture or non-farm self-employment or face particular barriers in pursuing wage employment
opportunities in the private sector. This can however not be tested with the available data.


       2.3       Despite a take-up of additional jobs, underemployment is on the rise
  In 2011, 64 percent of workers in Rwanda had multiple jobs, up from 40 percent in 2006.
  The increase in the share of workers with multiple jobs has particularly been salient for workers
  with a main job in agriculture. In 2006, workers with a main job in agriculture were a lot less likely
  to have several jobs than non-agricultural workers. By 2011, 63 percent of agricultural workers
  had multiple jobs, similar to non-agricultural workers (Table 8). Both men and women took up
  additional jobs between 2006 and 2011.
  Agricultural workers’ uptake of additional jobs amounted in large part to a diversification
  into non-farm income-earning activities. In 2006, only nine percent of workers with a main
  occupation in agriculture had a secondary occupation outside agriculture. By 2011, this had more
  than doubled to 22 percent. The move to non-farm occupations as a main job as documented in
  section 2.1 understates the true extent of the diversification into non-farm activities: Between 2006
  and 2011, the share of workers with a job outside agriculture (regardless of whether this is a main
  or a secondary job) increased from 30 percent to 45 percent.

     (Share of farmers with secondary job outside agriculture and share

  The uptake of additional jobs appears linked to the decline of working hours in the main job.
  In 2006, the median worker worked 1,299 hours per year in his/her main job (25 hours a week
  based on 52 weeks a year). By 2011, this had declined to 18 hours a week (Table 8). Workers in
  occupations where hours worked in the main job decreased most were also most likely to take up
  additional activities: For agricultural workers, the median number of hours worked per week (in
  the main occupation only) decreased by 33 percent, and these workers were most likely to take up
  additional jobs (the share with multiple jobs increased by 26 percentage points - Table 8). Workers
  in non-farm occupations experienced a smaller decline in hours worked in the main job (19

                                                                                                                             33
percent), and were also less likely to take up additional activities. Based on the available data, it is
not possible to determine whether the uptake of additional jobs among agricultural workers is due
to push (shortage of land) or pull (increased availability of more lucrative non-farm employment
opportunities) factors. However, given that non-farm occupations are typically higher-earning and
more attractive than agriculture, the uptake of additional jobs outside agriculture likely reflects an
increasing availability of non-farm opportunities22.

Focusing on all jobs rather than on the main job only, overall hours worked decreased
between 2006 and 2011. The median number of hours worked in all jobs amounted to almost 26
hours a week in 2011, down from 29 hours in 2006 (Table 9)23. Workers with a main job in the
non-farm sector work on average 16 hours a week more than agricultural workers. Non-farm
employers and people with a wage job in the non-farm sector work the most hours, while
independent farmers and unpaid family farmers only work 23 hours a week in all jobs together.
The uptake of additional jobs has helped to compensate for the loss of hours in the main job, but
not fully: Hours worked in the main job dropped by 28 percent between 2006 and 2011, while total
hours worked dropped by 12 percent.
     Table 9: Weekly hours worked is substantially higher in the non-farm sector
     (Median hours per week worked in all jobs, by main employment)

   The recently concluded Rwanda Poverty Assessment identified the diversification into non-farm activities as a
main driver of poverty reduction over the past decade, which adds credibility to the pull hypothesis.
23
   Differences in questionnaire design between the EICV2 and EICV3 may overstate the extent of the decline in
working hours. In 2006, the respondents were asked for each month separately (over a 12-month period) whether
or not they worked that month. In 2011, respondents were simply asked how many months (over a 12-month
period, split by season) they had worked. Focusing only on the 7 days preceding the survey (a question that was
comparable in EICV2 and EICV3), median hours worked amounted to 26 for EICV2 and 25 for EICV3. So while there
has been a decrease in hours worked since 2006, the annual figures may overstate the magnitude of the decline.

Underemployment is a key feature of the labor market in Rwanda, and has worsened since
2006. Next to the decrease in hours worked, and despite the uptake of additional jobs, time-related
underemployment increased24: The fraction of employed persons who work less than 35 hours and
wish to work more went from 34 percent in 2006 to 36 percent in 2011 (Table 10). The
underemployment rate increased for all job categories. 42 percent of agricultural workers are
underemployed, double the share of non-farm workers.

more likely to be underemployed, and this effect increases to 12 percentage points when excluding
youths who are still in school. Workers with a main job outside agriculture are significantly less
likely (20 percentage points) to be underemployed. For agricultural workers, taking up secondary
jobs outside agriculture reduces the likelihood of being underemployment by five percentage
points. Workers in rural areas are at higher risk of underemployment than workers in urban areas,
in particular in the Northern and Western Provinces: All else equal, workers in the Northern
(Western) Province are nine (seven) percentage points more likely to be underemployed than
workers in Kigali. Women are somewhat less likely to be underemployed than men, and, relative
to uneducated workers, workers who either completed post-primary education or secondary school
are significantly more likely to be underemployed.

The high underemployment rate means that a substantial part of available labor is currently
left idle. The 36 percent of workers that were underemployed in 2011 worked a median of 20
hours per week. According to the EICV3 survey, they would like to work an extra 21 hours per
week. This means that underemployed workers wish to double the hours they currently work.
Considering all workers, including those who are not underemployed, the average worker in
Rwanda would like to work nine extra working hours per week, which would add 30 percent to
current aggregate hours worked. The high underemployment rate precludes Rwanda from realizing
its full output potential.
    3. An increase in earnings from a low base
    3.1       Earnings increase across the board, though most in agriculture and for
              unskilled workers
Individual labor earnings increased substantially since 2006. Median earnings from all jobs
increased by 66 percent between 2006 and 2011, and the share of workers with earnings below the
poverty line (the low-earnings rate) decreased from 54 percent to 33 percent (Table 11). The
increase in earnings happened despite the reduction in hours worked (as shown in Table 9, the
median number of hours worked decreased from 29 in 2006 to 26 in 2011). As a result, hourly
earnings increased sharply since 2006 (Table 11).

Low earnings are increasingly a consequence of underemployment. While the low earnings
rate has dropped, the share of low earners who have low earnings due to short hours
(underemployment) increased between 2006 and 2011 (Table 11). In fact, of all low earners in
2011, 58 percent would not be low earners if they could increase hours worked. Low earnings are
increasingly a consequence of underemployment rather than insufficient remuneration per unit of
time: The share of workers who earn below the poverty line despite working long hours dropped


                                                                                                              37
from 12 percent in 2006 to nine percent in 2011, and the share who only manage to escape low
earnings by working long hours decreased from seven percent to three percent.
Earnings increased across the board but most in agriculture. Median earnings increased by 95
percent for independent farmers and by 50 percent for unpaid family farm workers and wage
farmers (Table 12). The low earnings rate in agriculture dropped from 59 percent in 2006 to 37
percent in 2011. This is in line with the agriculture-driven poverty reduction as documented by the
Rwanda Poverty Assessment. Earnings in the non-farm sector increased too: By 39 percent for
wage employees and by 27 percent for the self-employed. Total earnings decreased for non-farm
employers, due to the decrease in hours worked (earnings per hour actually increased). Overall,
median hourly earnings doubled in agriculture and increased by half in the non-farm sector.
Earnings remain however much higher in the non-farm sector than in farming (almost double).
The increase in earnings may seem at odds with the high and increasing levels of
underemployment, particularly in agriculture. This apparent contradiction is explained by the
strong increase in agricultural productivity since 2007/8 (see section 2.2) coupled with an
increasing labor surplus in agriculture. The spike in agriculture productivity has increased
household-level production and earnings, but the fact that employment in agriculture still grew in
absolute terms put pressure on working hours and drove up underemployment. Given the scarcity
of land, agriculture is increasingly unable to provide full-time employment to agricultural workers.
Earnings from the main job increased by less than total earnings from all jobs. Median
earnings from the main job increased by 50 percent between 2006 and 2011, compared to 66
percent for total earnings (Figure 65). This suggests that the take-up of additional jobs observed
between 2006 and 2011 has been important in in boosting earnings and reducing the low earnings
rate. While working several jobs is important to top up incomes, especially for low earners, its
effectiveness as a strategy is nevertheless limited: Of all workers who are low earners based on the
main occupation alone, 25 percent are no longer low earners when earnings from secondary jobs
are taken into account. 75 percent of them however remain low earners.

The gap in earnings between men and women increased between 2006 and 2011. Though
earnings increased for women as well as for men, the increase was stronger for men, pushing up
the earnings gap (Figure 66). The increasing earnings gap is consistent with women’s relatively
slower transition to better-paying non-farm occupations documented in section 2.1.

Unskilled and low-skilled workers experienced the strongest increase in earnings. Median
earnings of uneducated workers increased by 80 percent while those of workers who completed
primary education increased by half (Table 13). In contrast, earnings of workers with complete

secondary education decreased, albeit modestly. This is consistent with the earlier finding that
earnings increased most in agriculture, where the low-skilled persons are likely to work. Education
however continues to pay off: People who completed secondary earned twice as much (in 2011)
than people who only completed primary, and people with higher education (completed or not)
earned ten times as much as people who never entered school (Table 13)25.

Defining workers with at least post-primary education as “skilled” workers, the skills
premium decreased between 2006 and 2011. The skills premium-the ratio of skilled to unskilled
earnings, which can be considered as the relative price of skills-fell from 2.9 to 2.0. This means
that the median skilled worker earned twice as much as the median unskilled worker in 2011,
whereas in 2006, the median skilled worker would earn three times as much. The decrease in the
skills premium is however not due to decreasing returns to higher levels of education, though rather
to the sharp increase in earnings among unskilled workers: Median earnings for unskilled workers
increased by 67 percent between 2006 and 2011, and skilled earnings increased by 18 percent. The
latter point is important: Though the supply of skills increased (the share of skilled workers
increased by 20 percent), the price of skills increased too, pointing towards a lack of skills in the
economy and sustained high demand for skilled workers, outpacing its supply.
To examine in more detail the earnings dynamics of skilled and unskilled workers, Figure 67
and Figure 68 plot the net skilled and unskilled job additions (actually: worker additions)
across the earnings spectrum. In the unskilled sector (Figure 67), there was a net loss of low-
earning jobs (workers) between 2006 and 2011 and a net increase in jobs earnings above the 2006
unskilled median (red line depicts 2006 median earnings for unskilled workers). In the skilled
sector, the picture is more nuanced (Figure 68): While most of the skilled workers added since
2006 earn above the 2006 skilled median (explaining the overall increase in earnings for skilled

   This is consistent with the findings of Montenegro and Patrinos (2014), who find that returns to education in
Rwanda are the highest among the 139 countries in their study (Montenegro, C. and Patrinos, H. (2014).
“Comparable Estimates of Returns to Schooling Around the World.” Policy Research Working Paper 7020.
Washington DC: The World Bank). Based on Mincer regressions, World Bank (2013) also finds high returns to
education in Rwanda, especially at the senior secondary and tertiary level. Controlling for age, location and
education, there are high returns to being male, and controlling for education, sex and age, urban workers earn
significantly more than rural workers (World Bank. (2013). Post-Basic Education and Training in Rwanda. Skills

Most of the skilled job additions below the 2006 skilled median however still earn above the 2006

  Figure 68 suggests a high demand for skills. Skilled employment grew by 50 percent
  between 2006 and 2011 (compared to 11 percent for unskilled employment) and the
  number of high-paying skilled jobs (towards the right-hand-side of Figure 68) continued
  to grow. This is suggestive evidence that demand for highly-paid skilled labor is
  continuing to grow, that there is a lack of skills in the economy, and that the decline in
  the skills premium is driven by the sharp decrease in low-earning unskilled workers. The
  shortage of skills in the economy is expected to ease in the short to medium run as the
  recent expansion in education will start paying off.

       3.2       Diversification and take-up of additional jobs important for the
                 earnings increase
Although an in-depth analysis of what determines earnings in Rwanda is outside the scope
of this report, it is nevertheless informative to briefly touch upon the correlates of the growth
in earnings. Here, we use a number of decomposition approaches to get a better idea of the
mechanism behind the observed increase in earnings. At the outset, it is important to keep in mind
that the following decompositions are descriptive and do not necessarily represent causal effects.
Given the short time frame between the surveys (five years), it is not surprising that changes
in the characteristics of the workforce and the jobs they are doing explain only a small part
of the increase in earnings. Using an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, we find that the changes in
the characteristics of the workforce and the jobs they are doing explain only a minor part (about
22 percent) of the increase in median earnings26. The workforce characteristic that has been most
strongly correlated with the increase in median earnings is the increasing share of workers with a
job outside agriculture: The share of workers with a job outside agriculture (regardless of whether

  This means that most of the increase in earnings remains “unexplained”, or due to changes in returns
(coefficients).

or not this is the main job) increased from 30 percent in 2006 to 45 percent in 2011, explaining
about 12 percent of the growth in median earnings (Figure 69). The modest increase in education
of the workforce and the higher share of workers working several jobs only had a small positive
impact on earnings.
There are a number of interesting differences in the correlates of earnings growth between
lower- and higher-earning workers. Taking up additional jobs has been particularly important
for earnings growth of low-earners: Taking on additional jobs explains 17 percent of growth in
earnings at the 10th percentile and 11 percent at the 25th percentile, but was only of marginal
importance at the median and even negatively correlated with earnings growth of higher-earners
(Figure 69). Though low-earners also diversified into non-farm activities, this has not been
associated with growth in their earnings. In contrast, diversification accounts for the bulk of
earnings growth at the higher end of the distribution: The higher share of workers with a non-farm
occupation explains 27 percent of earnings growth at the 90th percentile and 22 percent at the 75th
percentile. The increase in education between 2006 and 2011 contributed significantly to earnings
growth for the higher earners (15 percent at the 90th percentile and 8 percent at the 75th percentile),
but was only marginal at the lower half of the earnings distribution (Figure 69)27. As a footnote,
growth in earnings has been pro-poor between 2006 and 2011: Earnings increased by 65 percent
at the 10th percentile and 57 percent at the 25th percentile, compared to 43 percent at the 75th and
90th percentiles.

  Repeating the analysis with the move to non-farm occupations split into two variables depending on the status
of the non-farm occupation (primary job or secondary job) broadly gives the same results: The move to non-farm
occupations as a main job is the main correlate of earnings growth at the higher end of the distribution, while the
take up of non-farm secondary occupations was more important at the lower end of the distribution (where the
uptake of additional jobs in general remains the main driver of earnings growth).

Although diversification into non-farm occupations has contributed to the observed growth
in earnings, most of the decrease in the low earnings rate can be accounted for by increased
earnings within sector. Considering the broad agricultural vs non-agricultural dichotomy, 89
percent of the decrease in the low earnings rate between 2006 and 2011 can be accounted for by
increased earnings within sectors, in particular in agriculture. An additional 17 percent can be
explained by the uptake of non-agricultural jobs (regardless of the status of that job-primary or
secondary). The interaction effect is negative: workers took up jobs in the sector where earnings
increased least (the non-farm sector). The decrease in the low-earnings rate is predominantly due
to increased earnings within agriculture, related to the increase in agricultural production and
productivity since 2007/8.
    4. Conclusions
The past decade has witnessed a substantial transformation of the jobs landscape in Rwanda.
Workers are increasingly moving to nonfarm activities, with the share of agriculture as main
employment falling from 90 percent in 2001 to about 70 percent in 2011. Within agriculture, the
structure of employment has changed, with farm wage employment becoming more important and
independent farming and unpaid family farming losing employment share. The move to wage
employment is not confined to the farm sector: Overall, wage employment increased from 22
percent in 2006 to about 30 percent 2011, up from a mere 11 percent in 2001. In line with this,
non-waged employment, although still the dominant form of employment in Rwanda, is
decreasing.
Youths have been the engine of change in Rwanda’s employment landscape. Youth, and
especially young men, are leading the move to non-farm employment, while young women in
particular are abandoning unpaid family farming to move into wage farming. The nature of the
move to nonfarm employment differs for youth and adults. While more and more youth abandon

                                                                                                                                                                45
agriculture altogether, older workers are changing their engagement with agriculture, shifting their
primary employment to the non-farm sector but retaining a strong foot in agriculture as secondary
occupations. The move to nonfarm employment is likely to continue: As secondary education and
urbanization are the main drivers of the move to nonfarm employment, the move can be expected
to pick up given the expanding access to education in Rwanda and the Government’s plans to spur
urbanization.
The jobs transitions over the past decade have been accompanied by a steep increase in
earnings from a low base. The proportion of workers earning below the poverty line dropped
from 54 percent in 2006 to 33 percent in 2011, with particularly sharp drops in agriculture. The
uptake of additional jobs has been an important driver of the earnings increase for low earners,
while the move to nonfarm occupations has particularly been important at the upper half of the
earnings distribution. While the uptake of nonfarm jobs has certainly been important for the
earnings increase, most of the increase was driven by improvements within sectors, notable
agriculture. This again underscores the crucial importance of agricultural productivity
improvements for poverty reduction.
Despite the positive evolutions, steep challenges persist. Earnings remain low, with 50 percent
of workers earning Rwf 18,175 per month or less and one third of workers earning below the
poverty line. Underemployment, already pervasive in 2006, has become even more widespread,
up to the point that 36 percent of Rwandan workers are in time-related underemployment. The
emerging picture is one of a labor market gradually evolving towards a more modern labor market,
but increasingly unable to provide full time employment to the rapidly expanding labor force.

           Chapter 3. The profile of nonfarm enterprises and jobs


     1. Introduction
The previous chapter looked at the employment profile and earnings of workers in Rwanda
using the EICV household surveys. In this chapter, we use data from the 2011 Establishment
Census (henceforth EC), which provides information on 127,662 formal and informal firms in
Rwanda. We start by looking at where the off-farm jobs are located in Rwanda, the characteristics
of the firms that create them and at the education, gender and nationality of the workers employed.
The chapter then uses enterprise28 age data to provide insights into recent jobs dynamics, looking
at which firms are creating jobs where. Important questions include whether the investment climate
encourages or discourages entry and expansion of particular firms, and whether the recent pattern
of hiring in terms of skills demand matches the improvement in education amongst the new
entrants to the workforce. Finally using spatial data and maps, we investigate whether the
dynamics and spatial and product patterns of business entry and job creation suggest particular
priorities for public investments.
At the outset of this chapter, it is important to note a number of caveats. First, the analysis is
based on one singly cross section of establishments (the 2011 census), which means that the
analysis cannot address the dynamics of firm or job survival and destruction or growth of firms
over time29. As a result, the analysis in this chapter is rather descriptive. Second, employment in
established firms is only small fraction of overall employment in Rwanda. According to the EICV3
survey, 4.9 million people in Rwanda were employed in 2011 (see in Chapter 2). The 127,662
firms included in the establishment census provide employment to only 280,000 persons,
underscoring the small size of the non-farm private sector. This means that the analysis in this
chapter only covers six percent of the employed workforce in Rwanda30.
     2. The profile of non-farm work in enterprises in Rwanda
The vast majority of workers31 in established firms in Rwanda are employed in recently-
created micro enterprises. Micro enterprises, defined as establishments with at most three


28
   The analytic report uses as standard definition of enterprises: “Enterprises are defined broadly to refer to units
employing hired labour or those operating with single individuals or with the help of unpaid family members.
Economic activity may occur inside or outside the enterprise owner’s home, at identifiable or unidentifiable
premises, or without a fixed location (ILO, 2004)”.
29
   In 2008, the Private Sector Federation conducted a census of 72,994 firms in Rwanda. Unfortunately, the raw
data have been lost.
30
   In contrast to the EICV surveys, the Establishment Census did not cover the smallest most informal household
enterprises that are “hidden” within the household (have no premises). Also, the Establishment Census did not
include street vendors, taxis and motor drivers, roads and buildings construction sites, and temporary booths. This
explains the difference between non-farm workers according to the EICV and non-farm workers according to the
establishment census.
31
   3 percent of firms in Rwanda’s Establishment Census did not report the number of their employees. Most of
these firms are recorded in the census as ‘closed permanently’ and given the sector code “activities of extra-
territorial units”. For the purpose of this chapter’s analysis, these firms are excluded. A further 7,000 firms did not
report their age. They are included in employment analysis but excluded from the analysis of enterprise age.

                                                                                                                    47
workers, represent 92.6 percent of firms and 51.6 percent of jobs32 (Table 14). Women, although
a smaller share of the workforce, are slightly more likely to work in larger firms on average, with
48 percent of women working in micro firms compared with 53 percent of men (Table 14). Most
establishments in Rwanda are young: 79 percent of established firms in the 2011 census started
operating after 2006, with half of Rwanda’s established firms starting in the last two years (Figure
70)33.

Given that the majority of firms are young, the bulk of jobs in establishments was created in
recent years. The lion’s share of jobs was created by micro-firms between 2007 and 2011 (Figure
72). Job creation through new firm entry was however not restricted to micro firms. Further
scrutiny shows that new Rwandan-owned large and medium firms were established in `growing
of beverage crops’ (tea and coffee), the manufacture of building materials, and in a variety of other
manufacturing products. Firms in these traded goods accounted for half of all new jobs in large


32
  These size categories take Rwanda’s definitions based on employment, not international definitions.
33
  In the absence of panel data, the youthfulness of Rwanda’s firms can be interpreted in several ways: Either the
business and economic climate has improved so much in recent years that many firms have opened shop, or
longevity of firms is low, creating a bias towards young firms. Just before the establishment census, in 2009,
Rwanda established a one-stop shop for business registration, resulting in a sharp increase in the number of
businesses registered (http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/evaluating-regulatory-reforms-using-the-
synthetic-control-method.). This may explain the spike in 2009.

                                                                                                                48
and medium sized firms. So whereas most firms and jobs are in small and micro enterprises, a
good share of the jobs created in larger and medium sized firms were in traded goods.

The informal sector dominates. In Rwanda’s census, to be classified as “formal”, an
establishment must: (a) be registered with Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) and, for smaller
companies with fewer than five employees, maintain regular operational accounts. By this
definition, 95 percent of all firms operating in Rwanda are informal, and this rises to 97 percent
for the micro firms. Informality is however not restricted to micro-firms: 28 percent of large firms
and 39 percent of medium firms in Rwanda are informal according to the official definition.
Overall, 72 percent of workers in enterprises in Rwanda are working in informal firms (Table 15),
with the remaining 28 percent working in formal sector establishments.

The bulk of firms and jobs are in the service sector. Over half of firms (51 percent) are in
wholesale or retail trade, and 26 percent are in hotels and restaurants (Figure 73). Services account
for a higher share of establishments than jobs, owing to the smaller size of service establishments
(for instance, wholesale and retail account for 51 percent of firms but only 33 percent of jobs).
Agriculture and manufacturing make up a significant share of jobs (17 percent), despite only

accounting for 5 percent of firms. Almost one third of all jobs in agriculture and manufacturing
are in the Western Province, in coffee and tea growing cooperatives and in factories.

Few firms, in particular among micro and small firms, hire temporary employees.
Temporary work is however a significantly higher share of work in large private limited companies
in specific products categories. Only 9 percent of informal firms hire temporary workers, whereas
one third of formal firms’ employees are reported as temporary workers. Amongst large firms,
temporary work is most common in mining (86 percent of employees are temporary), agriculture
(77 percent), and construction (67 percent). Temporary work is most common for women, and
one third of all temporary work is in the 4-digit ISIC4 category 0127 `growing of beverage crops’
(mainly women plucking tea and coffee). Other common temporary jobs are in restaurant and food
serving, and in bars and beverage vendors, whilst sugar manufacturing is another significant source
of temporary work.

The size categories in Table 14 might suggest a `missing middle’ in the medium firm size
category. There is however no evidence that either formal or informal firms are bunched around
a size threshold. This is an important point because, as noted by Tsieh and Olken (2014)34, if the
tax code, regulatory environment, or the risk of exposure to corruption was a severe constraint to
business expansion, firms would cluster at sizes below the threshold that these negative investment
climate factors kick-in. Detailed scrutiny of the size distribution of firms (Figure 75 and Figure
76) shows that there is no obvious bunching of firms or employment around a particular size
threshold of firms. That is, there does not appear to be any particular advantage to maintaining a
small operating size.

Within the formal sector, ignoring health and education services, the most important sectors
for waged jobs are retail and wholesale trade, manufacturing and agriculture. Waged
employment in the formal sector (though small) is quite broadly spread across sectors (Figure 77).
Tradeables tend to offer more temporary work, while permanent work is more likely in smaller
firms in service sectors (trade, hotels and restaurants). Together the six sectors in Figure 77
account for 71 percent of waged jobs in formal sector enterprises. At the 4-digit product level, just
10 products account for half of employment in formal established firms (Figure 7). Growing of
beverage crops (tea and coffee), at 13 percent of jobs in formal establishments, is the most
important formal job-creating activity, followed by “manufacturing of other food products” which
includes tea and coffee processing (8 percent). Other financial intermediation and secondary
education come next with 5 percent each.

Manufacturing and agriculture account for about half of jobs in the formal sector, though
most of these jobs are temporary. Manufacturing and agriculture account for 48 percent of all
formal sector jobs, though only 30 percent of permanent jobs. Overall, permanent employment in
medium and large formal sector firms is small, owing to the fact many of the large and medium
formal firms are cooperatives operating in tea and coffee growing and processing, which mainly
provide temporary employment.

Foreign owned firms are few and account for a small share of total jobs. In 2011, there were
only 915 foreign establishments operating in Rwanda, representing less than 1 percent of all firms
and 4.5 percent of total employment. Foreign or jointly foreign and Rwandan firms to be larger
(Figure 79), older, and twice as likely to be located around Kigali. 56 percent of foreign firms are

manufacturing, compared with 315 in the retail sector.

Foreign owned firms are more likely to hire temporary staff and more likely to hire skilled
workers. Over one third of foreign owned companies hire temporary staff compared with less
than one-seventh of Rwandan firms. In terms of skills, foreign firms hire more tertiary graduates
as a share of their workforce. On average, 37 percent of foreign firms hire workers with a minimum
of secondary education, compared with 23 percent of Rwandan firms. Adjusting for size, large

foreign firms are twice as likely to hire a worker with post-primary education as a Rwandan owned
firm.
Reflecting the overall pattern of youthfulness, formal and foreign firms are also mostly
young in Rwanda. Employment in formal and foreign firms however is less concentrated in young
firms (Figure 80 and Figure 81), hinting at greater longevity of these firms compared to informal
ones. Formal firms, in particular small firms, added a substantial number of jobs since 2006 (Figure
80), confirming the figures from Chapter 2 on the rapid expansion of the formal private sector
(from a low base). Foreign firms too created jobs in the four years preceding the census, but in
absolute numbers employment in these firms remains low (Figure 81).

    3. Mapping Jobs in Establishments
Nonfarm jobs in establishments are concentrated around the main urban agglomerations
and in the Western province. Employment density is highest in the sectors in Kigali, Rubavu,
Musanze and Rusizi, and, to a lesser extent, Byumba, Huye and Muhanga (Figure 82).
Employment is clearly concentrated along the main national roads: the further away from a
national road, the lower the employment density. Employment in establishments is also relatively
dense in the Western Province along the shoreline of Lake Kivu.
Digging deeper, firms and jobs in services are concentrated in the main urban centers,
whereas agriculture and commodity-based jobs in establishments that produce tradeables
are located in the Western Province (Figure 83 and Figure 84). Figure 85 brings out the
regional shares of population and jobs in establishment more vividly. Kigali houses 11 percent of
the population of Rwanda, but accounts for 29 percent of all jobs and 31 percent of all non-
tradeable jobs. The Western Province has 24 percent of the population, 22 percent of jobs in
establishments, but 36 percent of jobs in establishments producing tradeables. The Western and
Northern Province together account for almost 60 percent of employment in tradables.

estates), which does not require much skilled labor.

Figures 84, 85, and 86 suggest that the location of nonfarm establishments is related to
agglomeration effects (urban centers), transport connectivity, and production centers of tea
and coffee. A more formal investigation confirms this. In a 2014 study, World Bank staffs find
that enterprise location in Rwanda is determined by35:
       1. Agglomeration effects: Firms tend to locate where there is already a substantial density of
          firms-mainly in urban areas;
       2. Domestic connectivity: Firms tend to settle in Districts with better access to domestic
          markets, defined as transportation cost to a city of a certain minimum population;
       3. External connectivity: Transportation costs to a seaport matter, but is not robust across
          specifications (that is, evidence of impact of external connectivity on firm location in
          Rwanda is mixed);
       4. Agricultural production centers: Agribusiness firms tend to locate in rural areas close to
          their production centers-explaining the overrepresentation of establishments producing
          tradables in the West;
       5. Electricity: Firms’ location decision is crucially dependent on local electricity
          accessibility;

       3.1      A closer look at the Western Province
The Western Province is the unlikely champion of nonfarm job creation. With an adult literacy
rate the lowest in the country (65.3 percent36) and one of the highest poverty rates (48 percent),
the Western Province accounted nonetheless for the highest share of non-farm job additions
between 2006 and 2011: over this period, the number of nonfarm workers in Rwanda increased by
about 0.6 million, the single biggest part of which (27 percent) was accounted for by the Western
Province. Rubavu and Rusizi District each added more than 30,000 nonfarm workers between
2006 and 2011, while Rutsiro, Ngororero and Nyamasheke each added well over 20,000 (Figure
87).

Although the west and southwest of the country are the main tradable-producing regions
and added most of the nonfarm workers, they are also the most isolated. Figure 88 suggests
that market accessibility is worst in the area around Rusizi and between Rusizi and Karongi, where
a fair share of the tradable firms is located37. This areas is also the poorest of the country (Figure
89). In addition, external connectivity of the Western Province is poor too: the cost of transporting
goods from the Western Province to the Mombasa seaport exceeds $200 per ton and is the highest
in the country (Figure 90). Though more detailed spatial analysis and better data on enterprise
productivity would be required, it seems that improving connectivity-both domestic and external-
in the Lake Kivu region, in particular between Rusuzi and Karongi, may be necessary to stimulate
productivity gains for tradeable production and increase earnings for nonfarm workers. While the
data do not allow to estimate the potential for infrastructure enhancements to stimulate more and
better jobs in these areas, it is certain that the areas in Rwanda where tradables are being produced
suffer the largest infrastructure gaps.

  The market accessibility index is defined as the population-weighted travel time to a town of more than 50,000
people. Keeping town size fixed, the longer the travel time to reach the town, the lower the market accessibility.
Keeping travel time fixed, the smaller the town, the lower the market accessibility.

The Western Province, and in particular the towns of Rubavu and Rusizi, are well placed to
exploit the big markets in Eastern DRC. Figure 92 depicts the intensity of night lights as
measured from space, which is increasingly being used as an indicator of economic activity. The
map shows that in Rwanda, economic activity is strong only in Kigali. On the DRC side of the
border though, the night time lights imagery points to strong economic density in the cities of
Goma and Bukavu across the border in DRC along the shores of Lake Kivu. While connectivity
to Goma appears good (at least until the border), coming from Kigali, Musanze and Muhanga,
connectivity to Bukavu seems a lot worse (Figure 91 shows low road density in the southwest,
where the border crossing to Bukavu is located). More work would be needed to understand the
potential for infrastructure improvements to boost trade with these two urban centers in DRC, but
in principle, the potential seems strong for trade to drive growth, job creation and urbanization in
Western Rwanda.

Related to its location as a gateway into DRC, a significant number jobs in traditional and
non-traditional exports are in the Western Province. Traditionals are products which Rwanda
traditionally exports, and has a significant volume of exports. For Rwanda these are tea and coffee
and their processing, and mining (of tin and non-ferrous ores). “Non-traditional” exports are
products in which Rwanda has a revealed comparative advantage in 2010 and has recently started
to export values exceeding US$1 million, but which a decade earlier were not significant exports.
These include cut flowers, horticulture, processed fruits and vegetables, grain mill products, tanned
leather, quarrying products, and the manufacture of knitted and crotched products. The Western
Province has most employment in firms producing exports, and has also added most employment
in exports over the past three years (the years preceding the 2011 census-Figure 94).

    3.2      A closer look at the six secondary cities
Rwanda’s medium term development plan, the EDPRS-2, plans for the proactive
urbanization of six secondary cities to act as local poles of growth and off-farm job creation.
For now the six secondary cities (Rubavu, Rusizi, Huye, Muhanga, Musanze and Nyagatare) are
mostly service centers. Over three quarters of employment in the secondary towns is in trade:
wholesale & retail and in restaurants, bars and hotels. Figure 94 shows the dominance of services
in both establishments and employment in the 22 geographical sectors which make up the six
secondary cities. Significant employment in the Western Region around Rubavu comes from tea
& coffee and mining cooperatives, as well as hotels and restaurants. The sector of Nyundo in
Rubavu seems to do especially well in employment in coffee and tea distributors. Huye’s economy
runs around Ngoma, where several cooperatives function in grain growing and milling (including
rice), and manufacturing and processing of foods and metal products. Muhanga is comprised of a
lot of small producers, mostly in retail in the sector of Nyamabuye. Musanze has an economy
built around hotels for gorilla tours, cement and building materials and agro-chemicals production.
Finally, like Muhanga, Nyagatare has a small economy with mostly micro firms. Of the proposed
secondary cities, Rubavu and Musanze arguably have the highest potential for more job creation
and higher labor productivity, given their more diversified products and the presence of tradables
production.

The Government of Rwanda may wish to consider how to stimulate investment by tradeable
firms in developing the six secondary cities chosen as growth poles. The six cities together
account for 13 percent of both established firms and employment in established firms (Table 16).
Yet only 5 percent of these firms (just 809 establishments), and 11 percent of the employment, is
in tradeables production. Large and medium scale establishments in these cities are rarer still –
there were just 34 of them in the 2011 Census, with 4 of these in manufacturing and 8 in tradeables
production. Of the six secondary cities, Muhoza sector in Musanze stands out for tradeable
production, with its cement factory, building materials and agro-chemical plants. Rusizi and
Rubavu should both have the potential for trade with the much bigger cities of Goma and Bukavu
in DRC, but development of these areas will require better transport accessibility, and improved
border crossing into and out of DRC. Recent experience in Zambia suggests that there is scope for
building materials producers and distributors, and supermarket outlets to open up in Rubavu and
Rusizi to supply cities in Eastern DRC.

    4. Conclusions
Establishments in Rwanda provide employment to only a tiny share of working-age
population. The roughly 128,000 enterprises enumerated during the 2011 Establishment Census
account for less than six percent of overall employment, underscoring the nature of establishments:
Micro, often employing only one person – the owner, informal, and operating in the service sector.
93 percent of firms are micro, 95 percent are informal, and 95 percent are active in the service
sector. The formal sector, though growing rapidly since 2006, is small and will remain so for the
near future, and specializes in tea and coffee growing and processing and food product
manufacturing.
Employment in establishments in concentrated in the main urban centers, along the main
roads, and in the Western Province. Services are located in urban areas and along roads, while
employment in tradables and exports is mainly located in the Western Province. The Western
Province accounted for the biggest increase in nonfarm workers between 2006 and 2011, but is
isolated and underserved in terms of infrastructure: Market accessibility is lowest in the Western
Province, in particular around Rusizi and between Rusizi and Karongi. Unlocking this part of the
country may be important to improve access to markets and boost productivity in tradables. In
addition, the strategic position of the Western Province’s main cities-Rusizi and Rubavu-as
gateways to the bigger cities in Eastern DRC suggests that the Western Province holds substantial
job-creating potential over the short-to medium term.

               Chapter 4: Employment outlook and perspectives


     1. Introduction
Past employment trends in Rwanda have been firmly positive. The share of the labor force
employed in agriculture has fallen fast, earnings have increased substantially and employment in
the formal private sector has doubled (between 2006 and 2011). Wage employment is increasing
while non-wage employment is becoming less frequent, signaling the start of a move from non-
wage self-employment to a proper “labor market” where people sell their time and skills in return
for a wage-although this move is only in its infancy. Youths have been the engine of change,
spearheading the move to nonfarm activities and wage employment and increasingly abandoning
agriculture altogether. In this concluding chapter, we sketch the medium-term outlook for growth
and employment in Rwanda and discuss the implications, both in terms of policy and future
research, of the findings of the analysis.
     2. Medium Term Outlook
Favorable population dynamics
Over the coming decades, Rwanda will have a unique opportunity for accelerated growth
through the so-called demographic dividend38. Driven by a sharp decrease in fertility since 2005
(the total fertility rate dropped from 6.1 in 2005 to 4.6 in 2010 and 4.0 in 201039), the proportion
of working-age adults in total population is expected to increase from 57 percent in 2014 to 60
percent in 2020 and 65 percent in 2032 (the final year of the 2012 census population projections)40.
Concurrently, the youth dependency ratio, a measure of the dependency burden in the economy,
is projected to decrease from 74 (children per 100 working-age adults) in 2014 to 67 in 2020 and
55 in 2032. A higher proportion of workers in the population and a lower dependency rate offer
the opportunity to substantially raise economic output41.

   See World Bank (2013). “Rwanda Economic Update 5: Seizing Opportunities for Growth, with a Special Focus on
the Demographic Dividend”.
39
   The 2005 and 2010 fertility rates come from the 2005 and 2010 Rwanda Demographic and Health Surveys
(RDHS). The 2012 fertility rate is estimated based on the 2012 Population and Housing Census and may not be fully
comparable with the DHS estimates.

Next to the age-structure of the population, the geographic structure is projected to change
too. In 2012, only 16.5 percent of the Rwandan population lived in urban areas42. This is projected
to increase to 22 percent by 2020 and 30 percent by 2032. This urbanization process could be an
important catalyst for creating the conditions for reaping the demographic dividend. Urbanization,
if well-managed, has many advantages, several of which are conducive for realizing the dividend.
For similar levels of education and wealth, urban women tend to have fewer children than rural
women, which means urbanization would speed up the fertility drop and lead to a sharper
demographic transition. A sharper transition would lead to larger potential income gains. Urban
children are also likely to achieve higher levels of schooling, equipping them with the skills they
need to participate in the formal workforce. Urbanization is also associated with higher economic
growth rates and the creation of nonfarm jobs, which Rwanda will sorely need in light of increasing
pressure on arable land. In addition, urbanization to secondary towns, a key element the EDPRS 2
transformation agenda, is linked to accelerated poverty reduction.43

estimated at 7.8 percent for the 2012-20 period, similar to the growth rate observed between 2000
and 2011 (about 8 percent per annum). Physical capital will make the largest contribution to GDP
growth (3.2 percentage points), followed by total factor productivity (2.7 percentage points) and
human capital–adjusted labor (1.9 percentage points)45.
Over the coming five years, increases in labor productivity and in the share of working age
population are expected to the main drivers of growth in output per capita. During the 2006-
11 period, more than 90 percent of the increase in output (value added) per capita was attributed
to higher productivity, while the share of the labor force, participation rate, and the employment
rate were relatively stable. Going forward, labor productivity is expected to continue to drive
output per capita, but the demographic shifts (the increased share of the working age adults in total
population - see previous section) will increasingly gain importance as a driver of aggregate
growth46. Overall, productivity improvements are expected to account for 77 percent of the
increase in per capita value-added between 2011 and 2020, down from 93 percent during 2006-
2011, while the demographic changes –reaping the demographic dividend- will account for 26
percent (Figure 96). The projected decrease in the participation rate- a result of increased
enrollment in secondary and tertiary education- is expected to have a small negative effect on
growth in per capita value-added.

A sustained farm to non-farm transition driving overall productivity growth
If Rwanda maintains its growth momentum until 2020, the shift from agriculture to non-
farming will accelerate47. Under a baseline scenario of 7.8 percent GDP growth between 2011
and 2020 and the same productivity increases as during 2006-11, the share of agriculture in
employment will drop to almost half (56 percent) of total employment by 202048, down from about
70 percent in 2011 (Figure 98)49. Agriculture will continue to add workers, but job creation will
be much faster in industry –particularly construction- and services (Figure 97). If the economy
grows even faster, closer to the desired 10.5 percent per annum, the shift towards non-farm
employment would be even greater.
In the baseline scenario, employment by 2020 will grow by 2.2 million people, 1.8 million of
whom will be employed outside agriculture. This means that in the baseline scenario Rwanda’s
target of creating 200,000 off-farm jobs per year (as articulated in the National Employment
Programme) would be reached50. Mining and construction are projected to create employment at
a fast pace between 2011 and 2020. Employment in mining is projected to increase almost six-
fold, while construction employment will increase by a factor of four (Figure 99). Wholesale and
retail will expand substantially too. Manufacturing employment will somewhat increase but will
remain low.

In the baseline scenario, Rwanda’s structural transformation is projected to continue, albeit
at a modest pace. Agriculture’s share in output is projected to decline to 28 percent by 2020, down
from 35 percent in 2014 and 201151. Services are projected to rise to 54 percent of GDP, up from
in 50 percent in 2014 (Figure 100). The share of industry is projected to grow from 15 percent in
2014 to 19 percent in 2020. Construction is expected to achieve the fastest growth, its share in
GDP reaching 8.6 percent by 2020.

Overall, the progressive shift to non-farm employment will be the biggest contributor to per
capita GDP growth. The bulk of the projected increase in GDP per capita between 2011 and 2020
will be accounted for by the move of workers from agriculture to non-farming (Figure 101).
Productivity improvements in agriculture are expected to have the second most important
contribution, followed by services’ productivity, while industry will continue to make a negative
impact. These findings support the Government’s plans for accelerated urbanization of the country
as this would magnify both the impact of services (increased labor and productivity) and
agriculture (decreasing labor but increasing productivity). The findings also highlight the
importance of getting the fundamentals right for the industry sector: Improved electricity supply
at lower costs and improved regional integration and transport infrastructure to facilitate trade.
Otherwise, industry is likely to continue to be a drag on productivity growth.

    3. Extrapolating the analysis: how will near-term job creation look like and
       what are the main questions for policy?
Given the results of this study, what can Rwanda do to improve the employment outcomes
of its population? As indicated by the Government’s National Employment Programme, almost
all of the jobs to be created in the near future will need to come from the private sector, particularly
MSME’s and the informal sector. Indeed, the informal nonfarm sector absorbed most of the new
workers since 2006. Of the about 0.6 million new workers between 2006 and 2011, 70 percent
were absorbed by the informal nonfarm sector-48 percent in wage employment and 22 percent in
self-employment. The informal nonfarm sector is particularly important for the youth: average age
in the informal nonfarm sector (31 years) is significantly lower than in farming (38 years) and the
rest of the nonfarm sector (34 years).
While the formal private sector is growing fast, the low base means that the share of working-
age population employed in this sector is projected to stay low in the foreseeable future.
Assuming that employment in the formal private sector keeps on growing rapidly (at 16.5 percent
per year-the growth observed between 2006 and 2011), it would still only account for 11 percent
of the working-age population by 2020 (Figure 102). This means that at least until 2020, the bulk
of the increase in the labor force will need to be accommodated by either the informal nonfarm
sector or agriculture.

Given that the bulk of young labor market entrants are likely to enter the informal non-farm
sector, a key question for policy is how the environment for MSMEs in this sector can be
improved. Though the data available for this study do not say much about the constraints and
opportunities in this sector, both our analysis and other existing research shows that nonfarm firms
tend to settle in places with agglomeration effects (urban areas), with decent domestic connectivity

                                                                                                     72
and electricity access. In this regard, the Government’s strategy to develop six secondary cities is
likely to boost the creation of small firms and jobs in those firms. A key question is how the
urbanization of the secondary cities can be planned and managed so as to maximize its impact on
employment growth, both within the cities and in the bordering rural communities. Currently, the
six secondary cities are fairly similar in terms of economic activities, specializing in small services
and trade firms, but local economic development studies are currently underway to examine
whether the cities have revealed comparative advantages that could boost employment and firm
creation.
Substantial nonfarm activity in Rwanda is still related to agriculture. The growing and
processing of beverage crops (coffee and tea) is the main job-creating activity in the formal sector.
Agribusiness and agro-industry is a key sector in the NEP, and holds the potential-still according
to the NEP-to create thousands of off farm jobs for relatively low-skilled workers. The analysis in
Chapter 3 however showed that the region where most of these tradables and exports are produced
is also the most isolated region, suffering from poor domestic and external connectivity. Although
more research and more detailed spatial data would be needed to examine the links in more detail,
it is possible that enhancing transport connectivity-both domestic and external with DRC- and
market accessibility in this region could help this sector to lower production and transportation
costs and expand employment.
Rwanda’s small domestic market means that Rwanda should look outside its borders for
growth opportunities. Most of the secondary cities are located on or close to land borders with
other countries, potentially facilitating cross-border trade. The towns of Rubavu and Rusizi in
particular are ideally located as gateways into the much bigger cities of Goma and Bukavu in
neighboring DRC. A key question for policy is how cross-border trade, especially between the
Western Province and DRC but also with other countries, can be facilitated and stimulated to boost
employment growth.
Though the share of workers with a main job in agriculture is decreasing, our projections
suggest that at least until 2020 more than half of Rwanda’s workforce will be employed in
agriculture. This means that the most direct way to increase earnings for the bulk of the workers,
and often the most vulnerable ones, is to further increase productivity and earnings in agriculture.
While agricultural productivity has increased steadily since 2007, yield of most crops are still far
below potential. Yields of cassava, one of the main staples, are estimated at only six percent of
optimum potential. Other crops hardly do better: Yields of cooking bananas are estimated at 18-
24 percent of potential, Irish potatoes at 24-27 percent, maize at 34-37 percent, and beans at 40
percent52, highlighting the ample room to increase productivity in agriculture. Consolidating and
increasing the gains in agricultural productivity will also be important in sustaining the recent
employment transitions.
In sum, Rwanda appears to need a two-pronged employment strategy in the medium term.
On the one hand, the unskilled nature of the bulk of the labor force requires further increases in
agricultural productivity and job creation in industries related to agriculture (agribusiness, agro-
industry) to further improve employment outcomes for the most vulnerable group of workers. On
the other hand, the rapid expansion in education means that the new labor force entrants will be
increasingly educated, which will require the creation of more skilled and semi-skilled jobs.
Expansion of economic activity in the secondary cities will be important in this regard, as will be

connectivity of the economy.
     4. Further research and knowledge gaps
The analysis conducted for this study has produced a number of findings warranting further
research and identified several knowledge gaps. First is the disadvantaged employment position
of women. Women are overrepresented in the least desirable job categories and earn substantially
less than men even accounting for observable differences (such as education, age and location).
This pattern persists among young cohorts, despite young women being no less educated than
young men. Possibly, women face particular barriers in accessing better wage jobs in the non-farm
sector, which explain their underrepresentation in non-farm wage employment.
Second is the pattern of urbanization. Although the Urbanization and Rural Settlements sector
strategy states that urban population in Rwanda is growing fast, this is not supported by the data-
even to the contrary. Urban population share in the 2002 census was 16.9 percent, marginally
higher than the population share in the 2012 census (16.5 percent). Similarly, the share of the
working-age population living in urban areas decreased from 17.7 percent in 2006 (EICV2) to 16
percent in 2011 (EICV3). In addition, little is known about the size and growth of the secondary
cities53. To study the link between urbanization, the growth of non-farm employment, and poverty
reduction, more detailed and consistent data about urban settlements would be needed.
Third is the potential for external links and cross-border trade to stimulate employment.
While Rwanda is constrained by its small domestic market and its distance from major ports, it is
well-positioned as a gateway into the larger DRC market. More research would be needed to gauge
the extent to which targeted infrastructure investments close to borders (not only with DRC, but
also with other neighbors) can facilitate or add value to cross-border trade and spur local economic
development in the border communities.
A final issue is related to data. Currently, most of the sources of data on employment and living
standards (the EICV surveys, the population and housing census, the establishment census) do not
allow identifying the secondary cities. While combining the “urban” and “district” identifiers in
the data can allow an analyst to guess whether the data actually refers to a secondary city, more
detailed city identifiers would need to be included in the data to facilitate any examination of the
link between growth of cities, employment growth, and improved living standards. In addition,
despite its importance for job creation, there is a dearth of data on the informal non-farm sector.
More and better data on this sector would be needed to examine its potential for accelerated job
creation and to identify the principal constraints to productivity improvements in this sector.

  To illustrate, many of the geographical sectors that Rwanda Housing Authority (RHA) considers as being part of
the secondary cities have in fact zero urban population according to the 2012 Population and Housing Census.

                             on the context, earnings include only primary job earnings or the
                             sum of earnings in all reported jobs. In this study earnings are

Wage earnings
Earnings of the self-        Earnings are calculated in the following manner: First, net
employed, employers,         revenues are constructed at the enterprise level. (Note: the family
household enterprise         farm, and all of its varied crop/livestock activities, is considered
workers, and unpaid family   one enterprise while there may be multiple non-agricultural
farmers                      enterprises per household.) Next, these net revenues are distributed
                             across all household members engaged in that enterprise. Since
                             individuals report the hours s/he worked on each enterprise, each
                             individual received a share of net revenues from the enterprise
                             equal to his/her share of total hours worked in that enterprise.
                             Revenues are allocated to contributing individuals regardless of
                             their self-reported employment classification. That is, persons
                             reporting to be unpaid family farmers also get allocated revenues
                             proportionally to their hours worked on the farm.

Annex 2: Comparability of the data sources
The analysis in Chapter 2 is largely based on the comparison of the EICV2 (2006) and EICV3
(2011) surveys. As such, it is important to assess the comparability of the surveys to make sure the
observed trends are real rather than due to differences in survey and questionnaire design.
On sampling, the EICV2 and EICV3 used the same sampling frame (provided by the 2002 census)
and the same methodology to select the primary sampling units (PSU) and the households. The
key difference between EICV2 and EICV3 relates to the size of the sample and the urban-rural
classification. The EICV2 survey was designed to be representative at the level of the 12 old
provinces (sample size of 6,900), while the EICV3 was representative at the level of the 30 new
Districts (sample size of 14,308). The EICV3 also updated the rural-urban status of enumeration
areas to account for the changes since the 2002 census. Since the analysis in this report does not
stratify by urban-rural location, this does not affect the results.
The questionnaires used for EICV2 and EICV3 were largely similar. The main difference in the
employment modules is the way in which the time worked during the 12 months preceding the
survey is captured. In EICV2, the respondents were asked on a month-by-month basis whether or
not they worked that particular month (for every job). For the months worked, we however do not
know the number of days worked. The EICV3 is more precise: in EICV3, the respondent is asked
the number of months s/he worked in the preceding 12 months (not on a month-by-month basis),
split by high and low season (in case of seasonality), and also the number of days worked per
month (in the high and low season). This is a potential cause for concern: since we do not have
data on the number of days worked per month in the EICV2 survey, we are likely to overestimate
the days worked in EICV2 and hence the decrease in working hours we document in the study may
just be due to differences in questionnaire design. Other data however corroborate the decline in
working hours. The EICV2 and EICV3 use the exact same question to ask for the number of hours
worked in the past 7 days (on a day-to-day basis), and median hours worked decreased from 26 in
EICV2 to 24 in EICV3.

Annex 3: Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition of earnings differentials
To examine whether differences in earnings between two groups (for instance, men vs women or
formal vs informal) are due to differences in characteristics across groups or rather different returns
to characteristics, we use the traditional Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method. The Oaxaca-
Blinder method decomposes the differences in earnings (in our case) between two group into a
part that can be explained by differences in characteristics (the explained part) and a part that
cannot be explained by those differences (the “unexplained” part or the part due to differences in
coefficients). In a stylized fashion:
  (‫ܧ‬௜) − ln൫‫ܧ‬௝ ൯ = ൣ∝ (ܺ௜ )−∝ ൫ܺ௝ ൯൧ߚ௣௢௢௟௘ௗ	 	 + 	ߙ(ܺ௜ )(ߚ௜ି ߚ௣௢௢௟௘ௗ ) + ߙ(ܺ௝ )(ߚ௣௢௢௟௘ௗ − ߚ௃ )
ln	


Where ln	 (‫ܧ‬௜) − ln൫‫ܧ‬௝ ൯ is the difference in log earnings between group i and group j. The first term
in the equation, ൣ∝ (ܺ௜ )−∝ ൫ܺ௝ ൯൧ߚ௣௢௢௟௘ௗ	 , is the part of the difference that is due to differences in
characteristics (the X’s) between groups (the explained part). The second term,
(ܺ௜ )(ߚ௜ି ߚ௣௢௢௟௘ௗ ) + ߙ(ܺ௝ )(ߚ௣௢௢௟௘ௗ − ߚ௃ ), is the part that is due to differences in returns the
characteristics between groups (the unexplained part). Related to the labor market, a big
unexplained part means that two otherwise identical workers get remunerated differently based on
the group or sector they belong too, which is indicative of labor market segmentation.
The first earnings decomposition compares the earnings of the public and the formal private sector.
Employment in these sectors is considered good “modern” wage employment, the kind of
employment most Governments aim to stimulate. Earnings in the public sector are higher than
those in the formal private sector, and the bulk of the difference can be explained by public sector
employees’ better skills. 80 percent of the earnings differential between the public and private
formal sector is explained by differences in characteristics, mainly the higher educational
attainment and older age (experience) of public sector workers54. In contrast, the unexplained part
is small and not statistically significant.

Different returns to characteristics do however explain a significant part (38 percent) of the
earnings differential between the formal and informal private sector. In particular, workers in the
informal sector have significantly lower returns to education.
Earnings differences between men and women are largely unexplained. Close to 80 percent of the
earnings differential between men and women are not due to their different characteristics (for
instance, the higher educational attainment of men), but due do different returns on those
characteristics. This can largely be explained by women’s overrepresentation in subsistence
agriculture and self-employment, and their large underrepresentation in wage employment in the
nonfarm sector.

Annex 5: Pseudo-panel estimation
The lack of panel data has led to the development of so-called pseudo-panel techniques, initiated
by Deaton (1985). A pseudo-panel is formed by creating synthetic observations by averaging real
individual observations with similar characteristics (birth-year, sex, etc.) in a sequence of repeated
cross-sectional data. Thus, the synthetic units of observations can be followed over time. Pseudo
panels do not suffer from sample attrition because the samples are renewed every period.
Averaging over individual observations eliminates individual heterogeneity and reduces issue of
measurement errors.

The main drawback of pseudo-panels relates to the choice of clustering individual observations
that carries with it an important trade-off between the number of cohorts and the number of
observations in each cohort. The larger the number of cohorts, the smaller the number of
observations in each cohort, thus questioning the representativeness of the aggregation exercise
and its capacity to provide good estimates of the population cohort means. On the other hand,
having a larger number of cohorts is definitely a big advantage so that the estimates based on the
synthetic observation suffer less from small sample problems.

In the case at hand, the synthetic observations are created by combining year of birth and gender
of the individuals observed in the three cross-sections (EICV 1, EICV 2, and EICV3). This choice
provides 40 synthetic observations for each cross-section (120 observations overall), and each
synthetic observation is based on a sufficiently large number of individual observations (between
100 to 700 observations).

Since the number of observations per cell varies substantially, the error term is heteroskedastic
leading to biased standard errors. Heteroskedasticity is corrected by using weighted least squares
estimation, i.e. by weighting each cell with the square root of the number of observations in each
cell.

The estimated equation is the following:

                                 ܻ௖௧ = ߚܻ௖,௧ିଵ + ߛܺ௖௧ + ߙ௖௧ + ߳௖௧


ߙ௖௧ is the average of the fixed effects for the individuals in cohort c in survey year t. Therefore,
ߙ௖௧ is not constant over time because the samples are collected individually at different times. As
a consequence ߙ௖௧ might be correlated with ܻ௖,௧ିଵ. However, it can be treated as the true cohort
effect (ߙ௖௧ ≈ ߙ௖ ) if the sample size in each cohort is sufficiently large. Verbeek and Nijman (1992,
1993) find that cell sizes greater than 100 observations per cell are sufficient to nearly eliminate
the bias.

Annex Table 2 shows the estimation of the pseudo-panel regression based on cohorts formed by
year-of-birth and gender. Due to the small sample size, only two explanatory variables have a
statistically significant effect on the ratio of non-farm to farm jobs: education at the complete
secondary level or beyond and the lagged ratio of nonfarm to farm jobs. Education of a cohort is
positively related to a higher share of nonfarm jobs in that cohort, with the effect becoming
stronger for each successive level of education. The significant positive effect of the lagged ratio
                                                                                                   81
indicates that the move to non-farm jobs is persistent: The higher the share of a cohort that is
employed outside agriculture in year t, the higher the share of that cohort employed outside
agriculture in year t+1. Unsurprisingly, being located in urban areas is positively associated with
having a non-farm job. The estimated cohort effect (ߙ௖௧ ) indeed indicate that youths are leading
the move to nonfarm employment: the ratio of nonfarm to farm jobs increases with each age cohort,
both for men and women (Annex Figure 2).

Annex 7: Forward-looking Shapley Decomposition
The Shapley method decomposes per capita output growth into four components - contributions
of productivity growth, employment growth, labor force growth, and change in working age
population. The aim of the analysis is to understand the roles of productivity and employment
growth in driving a country's overall growth. The method also calculates different sectors'
contributions to aggregate productivity and employment growth.

While the Shapley decomposition is typically conducted on historical data-in order to better
understand past output growth-it can also be applied in a forward-looking fashion to get projected
insights into the composition of future per capita output growth. To enable the forward-looking
decomposition, projections and assumptions must be made about (i) overall economic growth, (ii)
sectoral growth, and (iii) population growth and age-structure. In the baseline scenario presented
in chapter 4, following assumptions are made:
   i.   Economic growth: The economy will grow at its average potential growth rate of 7.8
        percent per year between 2011 and 2020;
  ii.   Sectoral growth:
 iii. Population growth and age-structure: We use the population projections of the UN’s World
        Population Prospects (medium fertility scenario);
 iv.    Sectoral growth: Agriculture is projected to grow at 5.1 percent per year, industry at 10.4
        percent and services at 8.5 percent.
  v.    Constant productivity growth (same productivity growth as in 2006-2011);

The model than projects employment based on the underlying assumptions. In the baseline
scenario, employment in industry and services would increase substantially while employment in
agriculture would grow modestly (in absolute terms – see Annex Table 3). Productivity would
grow in agriculture, manufacturing, and most services, but would decline in mining and
construction, two sectors that are expected to grow rapidly in terms of employment.
