         Consumption remained resilient, while investment weakened, and manufactures exports
         boosted growth                                                                                               6
          Supply-side developments in the smaller economies                                                           7
          Inflation remained generally subdued, reflecting weak commodity prices                                      8
          Most countries made further progress in deficit reduction, including by rationalizing fuel
          subsidies, but public debt remains a concern                                                              10
          Central banks responded to inflationary pressures in mid-2014, but have since refocused on
          growth concerns                                                                                           12
          Credit growth decelerated throughout the region in 2014, on tighter monetary policy in some
          countries, and slower growth in others                                                                    13
          Current account balances broadly improved, reflecting a combination of strong exports, weak
          demand compressing imports, and robust remittances                                                        15
          FDI remained robust                                                                                       16
          Portfolio inflows helped lift stock and bond markets                                                      17
          Regional currencies broadly appreciated in real, trade-weighted terms in 2014                             18
          Reserve coverage of imports and short-term debt remains adequate in the large economies,
          even as reserve accumulation has moderated                                                                20

   I.B.	 Outlook and Risks                                                                                          22
         Regional growth will ease slightly                                                                         22
         The region will consolidate its gains in poverty reduction                                                 25
         Several downside risks threaten the positive outlook                                                       25

         Bolstering fiscal revenue and rationalizing expenditure remains a short-term priority        37
         Low world fuel prices create an opportunity to both eliminate fuel subsidies and raise energy
         taxes39
          Monetary policy should remain accommodative across much of the region                                     41
          Developing human capital and physical infrastructure is a key medium-term priority                        42
          Over the longer term, the region needs to address aging-related fiscal challenges, improve the
          investment climate, and promote further integration                                                       43

                                          EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


In the six months since the previous East Asia and Pacific Economic Update, the regional economic
landscape has been dominated by two key developments in the global economy. First, there has been a
sustained decline in world oil prices. This is already exerting, and will likely continue to exert, a differential
impact on the performance and prospects of countries, depending on whether they are fuel importers or
exporters. Second, there has been a rapid dollar appreciation against the euro and the yen. Most regional
currencies have depreciated to only a limited extent against the dollar, implying significant appreciations
in real, trade-weighted terms.

Growth in developing East Asia and Pacific moderated from 7.2 percent in 2013 to 6.9 percent in 2014,
reflecting slowdowns in China and some ASEAN-4 economies. Nonetheless, the region still accounted
for more than one-third of global growth, twice the combined contribution of all other developing regions.
In China, growth decelerated by 0.3 percentage points, as attempts to contain credit growth and reduce
overcapacity were partly offset by measures to avoid a sharp slowdown. In the rest of the region, growth fell
by 0.6 percentage points. Within the ASEAN-4, growth dropped most sharply in Thailand, to 0.7 percent, as a
result of prolonged political turmoil; the economy began to recover only in late 2014. Indonesia was affected
by weakness in its terms of trade and commodity exports, and by the continued impact of policy tightening
aimed at addressing external financing constraints. Growth remained generally robust in the region’s smaller
economies, including Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar.

Most countries continued to rebuild the fiscal buffers eroded by stimulus spending in the wake of the
global financial crisis, but challenges remain. Fiscal balances broadly continued to improve, particularly in
Malaysia and the Philippines. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam further rationalized fuel subsidies or
raised fuel taxes. However, in Mongolia and to a lesser extent Lao PDR, both deficit and debt levels remain
elevated; in Myanmar, a sizable deficit has emerged; in Vietnam, public debt continues to rise; and Malaysia’s
public debt remains high.

Central banks responded to inflationary pressures in mid-2014, but have since refocused on growth
concerns. Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines raised policy rates in mid- to late-2014. Since then, China,
Indonesia, and Thailand have eased monetary policy. Falling world oil and food prices helped reduce headline
inflation in most regional economies; core inflation remained broadly stable.

Most regional currencies appreciated in trade-weighted terms in 2014. They depreciated against the U.S.
dollar, but appreciated against the euro and yen. Malaysia was the only country to experience real, trade-
weighted depreciation. The strengthening U.S. dollar poses particular challenges to trade competitiveness in
the region’s most dollarized economies, Cambodia and Timor-Leste. FDI inflows remained generally robust,
rising in all countries except Malaysia and Mongolia.

Looking ahead, global growth is expected to pick up moderately, from an average 2.5 percent in 2012–14
to 3.1 percent in 2015–17. Growth in high-income economies will continue to increase, from 1.7 percent in 2014
to an average 2.2 percent in 2015–17 . In the United States, growth will rise to an average 3 percent in 2015–
16, returning to near-potential growth of about 2.5 percent in 2017. The recovery will be led by consumption,
assisted by improved housing and labor market conditions, although the strong U.S. dollar will dampen net
exports. In the euro area, low energy prices, a weak euro, and favorable financing conditions will support the

recovery, although the legacies of the financial crisis (impaired balance sheets, high unemployment, and debt
overhang) will continue to weigh on medium-term prospects. Growth will strengthen to an average 1.6 percent
in 2015–16. In Japan, low oil prices, a weak yen, and a range of product and labor market reforms announced
since June 2014 will help raise growth to an average 1.4 percent in 2015–16, following stagnation in 2014.

These projections assume that world fuel prices will remain low for a considerable period. Oil prices
are projected to be 45 percent lower on average in 2015, and to rise only moderately through 2017     , reflecting
the impact of unconventional oil supplies and OPEC’s attempts to maintain market share. Relatedly, prices of
liquefied natural gas for delivery in Japan are projected to be 30 percent lower in 2015, and to remain constant
thereafter.

The gradual strengthening of activity in high-income economies, combined with the sustained fuel price
decline, will help developing East Asia and Pacific (EAP) maintain its growth performance. Growth in the
region as a whole will ease slightly in 2015, from 6.9 percent to 6.7 percent, and then stabilize. In developing
EAP excluding China, growth will rise by half a percentage point in 2015, and a further 0.3 percentage points by
2017, driven by the large ASEAN economies.

In China, growth will moderate further, to 7.1 percent in 2015 and 6.9 percent in 2017, reflecting continued
policy efforts to address financial vulnerabilities and gradually shift the economy to a more sustainable
growth path. Continued measures to contain local government debt, contain shadow banking, reduce excess
capacity, curb energy demand, and control pollution will reduce investment and manufacturing growth. However,
targeted stimulus is expected to continue to mitigate the impact on short-term growth, should this show signs
of slowing considerably below the government’s indicative target of about 7 percent.

In the rest of developing EAP       , growth will pick up, reflecting a recovery in both investment and
consumption, partly driven by lower fuel prices, although export growth will be constrained by the
ongoing real appreciations. Low fuel prices will benefit developing EAP as a whole, but their impact will vary
across countries, reflecting the magnitude of net fuel imports, energy intensity in production, and the share of
oil and gas in total energy consumption. Cambodia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, Thailand, and the Pacific Island
Countries will all gain significantly. Conversely, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea will experience small GDP
losses. In Indonesia, the net impact will hinge on the extent to which the prices of coal and gas exports track
oil prices.

Given the uncertainties facing the global economy, the outlook for developing EAP is subject to
significant risks. A downturn in the euro area and Japan would weaken global trade, and impair the region’s
export performance. Higher U.S. interest rates and an appreciating U.S. dollar, associated with monetary policy
divergence across the advanced economies, may raise borrowing costs, generate financial volatility, and reduce
capital inflows more sharply than anticipated. A significant slowdown in China, though unlikely, would exert
significant spillovers, particularly on commodity exporters.

Addressing fiscal challenges, and basing public budgets on prudent medium-term fiscal plans, will help
manage the risks associated with an uncertain global outlook. In most large economies, some combination
of bolstering revenue and rationalizing expenditure will help create fiscal space for both productivity-enhancing
investments and targeted social protection and insurance programs. In the major fuel exporters, lower fuel
prices will erode fiscal revenues over time, creating a need for consolidation. Among the smaller economies,
fiscal consolidation is urgently required to rebuild fiscal buffers in Mongolia, and to a lesser extent Lao PDR and

Myanmar; in addition, fiscal institutions need to be strengthened. The Pacific Island Countries continue to face
significant short- and medium-term fiscal sustainability issues.

The prospect of low world fuel prices means there is a unique opportunity to both remove fuel subsidies
and raise energy taxes more broadly; this will reduce inefficiencies and help address fiscal challenges.
Fuel subsidies and related tax expenditures have strained public finances and weakened current accounts in
many fuel exporters and importers in the region. Recent steps to reduce these distortions have established a
positive momentum, which now needs to be sustained.

China faces a delicate balancing act; reforms to restructure the economy and reduce local government
debt need to be sustained, but the likelihood of sharp contractions minimized. Efforts to cut excess
capacity in heavy industry, reduce supply mismatches in residential property, dampen unproductive risk taking
in shadow banking, and harden budget constraints on local governments will help make investment more
efficient and realign growth over the medium term. However, such reforms will depress activity in the short
term. It is critical that any offsetting stimulus measures be designed so as not to undermine restructuring
efforts; in particular, any fiscal stimulus program will need to avoid unsustainable increases in local government
debt.

Over the medium term, developing human capital and physical infrastructure is a key priority, including
in fuel exporters striving for diversification. In fuel importers, lower fuel prices boost growth and relax
fiscal constraints to expanding productivity-enhancing investments, including in education, health care, and
infrastructure. In fuel exporters, the decline in fuel prices underscores the need to remove barriers to economic
diversification, including by developing fiscal and monetary institutions to better manage volatility in natural-
resource rents; providing high-quality education and appropriate infrastructure; and creating a competition
regime that levels the playing field for enterprises.

Countries in the region—both low- and middle-income—face significant long-term fiscal challenges, as
demographic trends and social pressures lead to rising social security expenditure. EAP is aging faster
than any region in history, driven primarily by a rapid decline in fertility, but also increased longevity. This will
affect growth prospects. Combined with growing pressures to expand pension coverage, it will also raise the
costs of pensions. The policy response should be twofold, first, sustaining productivity growth, boosting the
labor-force participation of women and older urban people, and in some cases increasing immigration; and
second, reforming social security financing so as to expand the revenue base.

In a similar vein, demographic trends and social pressures will lead to sharp increases in health
expenditures. The fiscal costs of health care and long-term care will be affected by both rapid aging, and
pressures to expand health care coverage through universal enrollment, a greater degree of financial protection,
and access to higher-quality health services. These welcome expansions in coverage need to be accomplished
in a fiscally sustainable manner. The revenue base for health care should therefore be expanded. In addition,
costs must be contained, including by reforming the mechanisms for paying health-care providers, purchasing
pharmaceuticals, and adopting new health care technologies.

Whether lower-income economies in developing EAP benefit from China’s move into higher value-added
sectors depends partly on the extent to which Chinese labor-intensive manufacturing relocates within
China. As China’s economy matures, its labor-intensive manufacturing will face pressures to move to lower-
cost economies across the region. However, such international relocation has so far proved limited. Rather, as

costs have risen in China’s manufacturing hub on the eastern coast, industry has moved to lower-cost areas
within the country, both within the eastern coastal region, and in other regions in China. Underlying factors
include China’s significant advantages in terms of labor productivity, a favorable investment climate, robust
logistics, and superior infrastructure. For developing EAP, making progress in these areas will prove critical to
developing their industrial sectors.

Increasing competitiveness in services through further regional integration will be necessary for ASEAN
economies to sustain growth in the long run. Services such as finance, education, health care, transportation,
and telecommunications are critical to modern economies, including as key drivers of productivity in high value-
added manufacturing. Recognizing this, the ASEAN members have committed to liberalizing and integrating
their services markets, in the context of the formation of the ASEAN Economic Community at end-2015.
However, de facto progress has been modest so far, and ASEAN remains among the most restrictive regions
in the world with respect to trade in services. Correcting this will require a focus on promoting regulatory
cooperation and coordination through harmonization or mutual recognition, together with the development of
regulatory capacity.

I.A.	 Recent Developments


In the six months since the previous East Asia and Pacific Economic Update, the regional economic
landscape has been dominated by two key developments in the global economy. First, there has been a
sustained decline in world oil prices. This is already exerting, and will likely continue to exert, a differential
impact on the performance and prospects of countries, depending on whether they are fuel importers or
exporters. Second, there has been a rapid dollar appreciation against the euro and the yen. Most regional
currencies have depreciated to only a limited extent against the dollar, implying significant appreciations
in real, trade-weighted terms.

Growth in developing East Asia and Pacific (EAP) moderated from 7.2 percent in 2013 to 6.9 percent
in 2014, reflecting slowdowns in China and some ASEAN-4 economies. In China, growth decelerated
by 0.3 percentage points, to 7   .4 percent, as attempts to contain credit growth and reduce overcapacity were
partly offset by measures to avoid a sharp slowdown (figure I.A.1). In the rest of the region, growth fell by
0.6 percentage points, to 4.6 percent. Within the ASEAN-4, growth dropped most sharply in Thailand, to
0.7 percent, as a result of prolonged political turmoil; the economy began to recover only in late 2014. Indonesia
was affected by weakness in its terms of trade and commodity exports, and by the continued impact of policy
tightening aimed at addressing external financing constraints. Growth also fell in the Philippines, as public
expenditure decelerated. In contrast, growth accelerated in Malaysia, reflecting a pickup in exports and private
consumption. Buoyant manufacturing exports and investment also boosted growth in Vietnam.

Growth remained generally robust in the region’s smaller economies, including Cambodia, Lao PDR, and
Myanmar. In Cambodia, garment exports, construction, and finance underpinned the expansion. In Lao PDR,
FDI remains buoyant, particularly in the power sector, which is benefiting from sustained regional demand.
In Myanmar, economic activity continues to rebound after a long period of isolation, as reforms encourage
domestic and foreign investment. In Mongolia, growth fell sharply; the mining slowdown and previous highly
expansive policies have resulted in large fiscal, financial, and external imbalances. Most Pacific Island Countries

saw moderate growth, driven by stimulus from donor-financed aid projects and recovery from recent natural
disasters.

Growth in both China and the rest of the region was the weakest since the recovery from the global
financial crisis began in 2010. Nonetheless, in the context of a slow global recovery (box I.A.1), the region
still accounted for almost two-fifths of global growth, twice the combined contribution of all other developing
regions, and approximately the same share as in 2012 and 2013 (figure I.A.2).

Oil prices fell by 40 percent between June and December 2014, the sharpest decline in six years, with
differential effects on the external and fiscal accounts of fuel importers versus exporters (       box I.B.2).
Indonesia reduced fuel subsidies in November, and Malaysia eliminated blanket gasoline subsidies in December.
Lower world oil prices cushioned the impact of these decisions on domestic prices and consumers. Continued
low fuel prices, however, will adversely affect the budgets in both countries, since they rely heavily on fuel-
related fiscal revenues.

The region faced more volatile exchange rates toward the end of 2014, as monetary policy increasingly
diverged among the world’s major central banks; most regional currencies experienced significant
trade-weighted appreciation. Commitments by central banks in the euro area and Japan to more aggressive
stimulus measures, and expectations of movements in the opposite direction by central banks in the United
States and the United Kingdom, led to significant appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the

yen, and currency volatility. Most regional currencies depreciated only slightly against the dollar, resulting in
significant appreciation in real, trade-weighted terms.

Taking a longer-term view, the region has seen a continuous and substantial decline in poverty over
the last decade—a trend that will likely be sustained with favorable economic prospects. Between 2002
and 2014, the regional extreme poverty rate (defined as the share of the population living on less than $1.25
a day PPP) fell from 27 percent to 5.1 percent (figure I.A.3).1 If a higher poverty line ($2.00 a day PPP) is
used, the poverty rate fell from 51 percent to 18 percent. Even excluding China, the rate was halved, to
25 percent. Nevertheless, there are still 360 million poor in the region. Further, large shares of the population
remain vulnerable to being pushed into poverty by shocks, including economic downturns, natural calamities,
or increases in the cost of living.2




     Box I.A.1. Recent Global Developments

     Global growth is still weak. Global growth in Q4 2014 is estimated at 2.6 percent (annualized quarter-on-
     quarter), down from 3.5 percent in Q3 2014 (figure I.A.1.1). This largely reflects developments in several
     large economies, including a leveling off in the United States, an ongoing slowdown in China, a deepening
     recession in Russia, and contraction in Brazil. Since the start of 2015, the impact of sharply lower oil prices on
     the global economy has been increasingly visible, with a significant pickup in retail sales and falling inflation
     across major oil-importing economies (including many high-income economies, China, and India), increasing
     headwinds facing oil exporters (including Nigeria and Russia), and heightened volatility in bond and equity
     markets.

     Growth in high-income countries has seen some broadening. In the United States, growth decelerated to
     2.2 percent in Q4 2014, after an exceptionally strong third quarter. Consumption picked up sharply, reflecting
     tailwinds from declining oil prices and strong labor market conditions. In contrast, dollar appreciation has led
     to a significant slowdown in exports. In the euro area, growth picked up to a still modest 1.4 percent in Q4
     2014. The expansion was led by Germany, and benefited from a significant contribution from consumption
     and net exports. In Japan, a technical recession ended in the fourth quarter, with growth bouncing back to
     1.5 percent, supported by a recovery in both consumption and exports. However, the strength of the rebound
     disappointed, and investment continued to stagnate. In Australia, growth rose to 2.7 percent for 2014 as a
     whole, but has decelerated sharply since Q1 2014. Declining prices for key export commodities, including
     mineral fuels and iron ore, have depressed mining investment.

     Oil prices are low and stable. Crude oil prices fell by 56 percent between July 2014 and January 2015, reaching
     a six-year low. They have since stabilized, reflecting prospects of capacity adjustments in U.S. oil supply (the
     number of oil rigs, a measure of future crude oil supplies, halved between October 2014 and March 2015), the
     announcement of sharp cutbacks in investment plans by major oil companies, some pressure from members
     of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for the cartel to reconsider its November
     2014 decision not to curtail production, and the recent escalation of geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East.

    Monetary policy reflects different stances. The euro area, concerned that deflationary pressures could
    be aggravated by falling oil prices, aggressively moved to ease monetary policy. The U.S. Federal Reserve,
    however, is still expected to gradually start tightening in the second half of the year.3 Among large oil-importing
    developing countries, the combined effect of inflation moving toward policy targets, declining current account
    deficits, and soft growth has allowed several central banks to cut interest rates since the start of the year,
    including in Egypt, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Turkey. In oil-exporting countries, however, central banks
    must balance the need to support growth against maintaining stable inflation and investor confidence in the
    face of currency pressures, and in several cases have raised interest rates.

    Emerging market currencies are volatile and under pressure. Divergence in monetary policy between the
    major reserve currencies, together with sharply lower oil prices, has induced greater volatility in emerging
    market currencies, and in several cases intensified pressures. Since mid–2014, depreciation against the
    U.S. dollar has been pronounced and broad-based. In trade-weighted terms, most emerging market currencies
    have proved more stable. However, in both oil exporters, and countries with a particularly significant foreign
    investor presence, real effective exchange rates have fallen below long-term averages.

    Capital flows to emerging markets are still robust. Gross capital flows (including international bond
    issuance, equity placements, and cross-border syndicated bank loans) to developing countries in the first
    two months of 2015, at US$84 billion, were 12 percent higher than in the same period the previous year
    (figure I.A.1.2). In particular, international bond issuance and equity flows remained buoyant, especially in Asia.
    This reflects the continued demand for high-yield debt; issuer interest in taking advantage of historically low
    bond yields, including in the euro area;4 and a number of large public offerings in China and other East Asian
    countries. In contrast, bank lending has declined sharply relative to Q4 2014.



    3	       It indicated on March 18, 2015, that “an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate remains unlikely at the April FOMC [Federal Open Market
             Committee] meeting. [It] anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement
             in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.    ”
    4	       Chinese companies already issued US$2.9 billion in euro-denominated debt in January and February 2015, compared with US$3.3 billion for the whole
             of 2014.

Consumption remained resilient, while investment weakened,
and manufactures exports boosted growth


In 2014, domestic demand, and in particular consumption, was the main driver of growth in most of the
region’s major economies. China started to gradually rebalance toward a more consumption- and services-
oriented growth model. Consumption contributed more than investment to growth (figure I.A.4); relatedly,
growth in the services sector proved particularly robust. In Indonesia, private consumption also remained
the main driver of growth, supported by election-related spending. In Malaysia, buoyant private consumption
was supported by stable employment and growing household income, despite the implementation of
macroprudential measures aimed at reining in household debt (over 87 percent of GDP at end-2014). In the
Philippines, private consumption was supported by stronger job creation (unemployment fell to 6 percent in
October 2014, its lowest level in 10 years) and sustained growth in remittances. In contrast, in Thailand, private
consumption softened, weighed down by tighter credit conditions and high household debt (84 percent of GDP
at end-2014 Q2).

Investment provided a significantly smaller boost to growth in 2014 than in 2013, particularly in the
ASEAN-4. In China, investment accounted for less than half of total growth, owing to overcapacity in key
heavy industries, policy tightening in energy-intensive sectors, a slump in real estate sales and construction,
regulatory curbs on shadow banking, and central government restraints on local government debt. In Indonesia,
investment remained relatively subdued in the face of weak commodity terms of trade. In Malaysia, public
investment slumped, reflecting slower disbursements from the development budget, and the near completion
or deferral of major projects by public enterprises. Private investment in machinery and equipment contracted,5
although private construction expanded. In the Philippines, private fixed investment was supported by a
significant increase in FDI. However, public infrastructure investment fell sharply, owing to bottlenecks in budget
execution, slow disbursements for reconstruction from typhoon Yolanda, and the negative effects of a Supreme
Court decision finding provisions of the government’s Disbursement Acceleration Program unconstitutional. In
Thailand, private investment was hampered by political uncertainty, weak external demand, and low capacity
utilization. The large planned public-transport infrastructure investments are still in the preparatory stages.


5	        This partly reflects a slowdown in equipment-intensive oil and gas investments, some of which are nearing completion or have been delayed owing to the fuel-
          price decline.

Manufactures exports grew rapidly in China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam in 2014               (figure
I.A.5). China also incurred a significant deficit in services trade. Malaysia saw 9 percent real export growth,
despite the sharp decline in oil prices; the highly diversified manufacturing sector accounts for 60 percent of
total gross exports. In the Philippines, electronics exports (47 percent of total exports) grew robustly, as did
exports of labor-intensive manufactures, including garments and textiles, and capital-intensive manufactures,
including machinery and transport equipment. However, manufacturing output fell in the second half of the
year, as shipments of raw materials were delayed by port and road congestion. In Vietnam, real exports grew
by 14 percent, and real imports grew even more vigorously.

In Indonesia and Thailand, exports and imports proved stagnant or contracted. In Indonesia, real exports
grew by only 1 percent. Falling world commodity prices, together with policy restrictions on exports of raw
commodities early in 2014, discouraged commodity exports, which account for 63 percent of total exports. In
Thailand, where exports stagnated, imports contracted sharply, in line with the steep drop in growth (figure
I.A.6).




Supply-side developments in the smaller economies


In 2014, construction remained generally upbeat in most small economies. In Cambodia, construction was
helped by the restoration of domestic political stability and the revival of investor confidence. In Lao PDR, the
real estate sector continued to expand, although less rapidly than in the last few years. In most Pacific Island
Countries, construction contributed strongly to growth, led by reconstruction from recent cyclones in Samoa
and Tonga, and the implementation of donor-funded airport and road upgrading projects in Tuvalu. In Micronesia,
however, construction ceased to be a source of growth, since U.S.-funded airport improvement projects were
completed, but other donor-funded infrastructure projects were delayed.




ADJUSTING TO A CHANGING WORLD

Agriculture also proved robust in most small economies. In Lao PDR, non-rice crops and forestry benefited
from demand from China. In Mongolia, favorable weather led to 14 percent growth in agriculture. Micronesia
and the Marshall Islands reported increased fishery output. In Samoa, agriculture has gradually recovered from
the effects of cyclone Evan in 2012. In Tonga, harvests remained robust in the islands not affected by cyclone
Ian. In Vanuatu, coconut production rose, as competitors in the Philippines were affected by typhoon Haiyan.
In contrast, in Cambodia, agriculture remained sluggish, owing to slow yield improvements and depressed
agricultural commodity prices.

In many small economies, tourism is a critical service sector, but its contribution to growth varied
widely. In Vanuatu, cruise tourism fell by 15 percent and air arrivals by 2 percent. In Cambodia, growth in tourist
arrivals slowed from 18 percent in 2013 to 6.9 percent in 2014. Palau, particularly reliant on tourism, reported
an unexpected rise in arrivals from China.

Mining sector performance was mixed. In Mongolia, overall mining production rose 24 percent.6 Coal
production, however, fell by 16 percent, owing to weakening demand and increased competition from China. In
Lao PDR, lower gold prices and depleted reserves in an important mine slowed gold production.




Inflation remained generally subdued, reflecting weak commodity prices


Falling world oil and food prices helped reduce headline inflation in most regional economies, both
large and small. In China, inflation fell to 2 percent in 2014, well below the 3.5 percent upper limit of the
inflation target (figure I.A.7). In the Philippines, inflation started moderating in September, reflecting also
a stabilization of the rice supply and tightening monetary policy. In Thailand, inflation fell to a five-year low
of 1.3 percent in November 2014, reflecting also weak domestic demand, government price controls, and
consumer subsidies. In Vietnam, inflation stabilized in 2014 at 4.1 percent, the lowest level since 2003 (figure
I.A.8). In Cambodia, inflation fell to 1.2 percent at end-2014. In Mongolia, inflation peaked at 15 percent last July,
but monetary tightening has since reduced it to 9.3 percent in February. In Lao PDR, inflation decreased more
than 2 percentage points in 2014, to 4.2 percent, again also reflecting some policy tightening.

In Indonesia and Malaysia, cuts in fuel subsidies led to temporary spikes in inflation. In Indonesia, inflation
rose to 8.4 percent last December, after the fuel subsidy cuts, but has since decelerated to 7 percent in
January. Likewise, in Malaysia, inflation rose to 3 percent last October, after the second round of fuel subsidy
cuts, but has since dropped to 1 percent in January.

In the Pacific Island Countries, weak commodity prices also kept inflation subdued. In Tonga, lower energy
costs, and the induced decrease in transport prices, kept inflation at 0.8 percent in September. In Samoa,
consumer prices fell by 0.4 percent in 2014, reflecting a reversal in the cyclone-related spike in food and
beverage prices. In Timor-Leste, the collapse in inflation, from 12 percent in Q4 2013 to an average 0.4 percent
in 2014, largely reflects measurement issues (the weight of food in the CPI basket was increased to 64 percent).



6	   Copper concentrate production increased 34 percent, as the new Oyu Tolgoi mine entered its first full year of production. Crude oil production rose 44 percent,
     and gold production 29 percent.

Kiribati represented an exception: inflation increased from -1.5 percent in 2013 to 3.4 percent in 2014, owing to
a new value-added tax and depreciation against the Australian dollar.

Moderate regional food prices reflected falling world prices, but also abundant regional crops and lower
energy prices. Ample crop supplies encouraged greater intraregional imports; lower oil prices reduced the
cost of energy-intensive agricultural production. In Malaysia, domestic food prices decelerated through 2014,
in line with declining global prices (figure I.A.9). In the Philippines, food prices started decelerating in October,
as the largest rice imports in four years helped stabilize domestic rice prices. In Indonesia, food price inflation
declined significantly between January and August 2014; the subsequent rise mainly reflects a likely transitory
tripling in the price of chilies. Rice imports again helped stabilize rice prices, which had increased owing to the
dry conditions caused by El Nino.

July has had a limited impact on consumer prices so far (figure I.A.10). In Malaysia, core inflation increased only
slightly in the first 10 months of 2014. In the Philippines, core inflation decelerated from a peak last September.
In Thailand, the only country in the region to target core inflation, this remained stable. In China, producer prices
declined for the third consecutive year, reflecting both falling world commodity prices, in particular for coal and
oil, and persistent overcapacity in several heavy industries, including steel, cement, and plate glass.




Most countries made further progress in deficit reduction, including
by rationalizing fuel subsidies, but public debt remains a concern


Fiscal balances broadly continued to improve, particularly in Malaysia and the Philippines; however,
Malaysia’s public debt remains high. Most of the larger countries continued to rebuild the fiscal buffers
eroded by stimulus spending in the wake of the global financial crisis (figure I.A.11). In Malaysia, the deficit
has steadily declined from 6.7 percent of GDP in 2009 to 3.5 percent in 2014. Last year, corporate income tax
collections, including dividends from the national oil company, proved buoyant. In addition to the cuts in fuel
subsidies, current expenditures, including emoluments, pensions, and gratuities, were compressed. However,
public debt remains high compared to other large EAP economies (figure I.A.13). In the Philippines, the
deficit has narrowed from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2009 to 0.6 percent in 2014. Customs revenues increased by
18 percent and internal revenues by 11 percent yoy through Q3 2014, reflecting economic growth and improved
tax administration. In addition, public expenditure decelerated sharply; growth in government consumption fell
to 2.6 percent, and infrastructure spending decreased by 1.5 percent.

In Vietnam, public debt continues to rise; Thailand recently approved a significant stimulus package. In
Vietnam, the fiscal deficit stands at an elevated 5.3 percent of GDP , reflecting poor revenue collections and high
recurrent spending. Public debt has increased to 61 percent of GDP      , from 47 percent in 2009, with short-term
domestic debt rising particularly rapidly. In Thailand, the fiscal deficit was roughly unchanged, at 2.2 percent

of GDP . Public debt has progressively increased since the global financial crisis, reflecting stimulus spending
in 2009; reconstruction spending in response to the devastating floods of 2011; and slow growth since early
2013, as manufacturing output fell, exports weakened, and tourist arrivals slowed. A fiscal stimulus package
of 2.8 percent of GDP was approved last October, focused on the renovation of roads, schools, hospitals,
and administrative buildings, with some support to rice farmers adversely affected by low commodity prices;
implementation of the investment plans has been slow.

In Indonesia, the deficit rose slightly. Revenue growth remained weak, even though nominal depreciation
boosted exchange-rate-sensitive revenues.7 Current expenditures increased, but capital expenditures declined
by 18 percent, reflecting the substantial midyear budget tightening, land acquisition problems, and the transition
to a new government.

Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam further rationalized fuel subsidies or raised fuel taxes. In
Indonesia, gasoline and diesel prices were raised by 34 percent last November; in January, gasoline subsidies
were eliminated, and diesel subsidies were capped at a low level. Malaysia abolished subsidies for midgrade
gasoline and diesel last December, and introduced a managed float mechanism linking retail prices to world
prices. Thailand ended its seven-year subsidy for liquefied petroleum gas last December. It also revised the
domestic fuel-pricing mechanism last August, raising taxes on diesel but reducing them on gasoline. Vietnam
tripled the environmental tax on fuel consumption, effective May 2015. It also raised tariffs on fuel imports from
18 percent (in May 2013) to 27 percent (in December 2014) and 35 percent (in January 2015).

China’s overall fiscal position remains solid. The fiscal deficit stands at just 1 percent of GDP; the slowdown
in real estate translated into slower revenue growth, but expenditures increased in line with budget plans.
Public debt remains moderate at 56 percent of GDP , although it has grown by 20 percentage points since 2008.

In Mongolia, and to a lesser extent Lao PDR, both deficit and debt levels remain elevated; in Myanmar,
a sizable deficit has emerged; Cambodia is making progress with fiscal consolidation, despite dwindling


7	       On average, a 10 percent depreciation leads to a 16 percent increase in oil- and gas-related revenues, which currently account for 20 percent of total fiscal
         revenues. Import duties also respond, but are relatively small.

grants. In Mongolia, in the face of revenue shortfalls, the Ministry of Finance has tried to control expenditures;
however, substantial spending remains outside the budget.8 In 2014, the consolidated fiscal deficit, including
off-budget expenditures, stood at 11 percent of GDP (figure I.A.12), and public debt at 77 percent of GDP         ,
compared to 32 percent in 2011 (figure I.A.14). In Lao PDR, the fiscal deficit narrowed to a still high 4.3 percent
of GDP , as higher value-added and excise taxes and import duties compensated for lower mining revenues and
grants. In Cambodia, the deficit fell slightly to 2.5 percent of GDP; improved revenue collection and increased
efficiency of spending, reflecting a public financial management reform program, were largely offset by lower
grants. The government raised its deposit balance by US$400 million in 2014, to help increase its financial
buffers against shocks. In Myanmar, a sizable deficit has emerged (4.5 percent of GDP in 2014), reflecting both
a significant increase in spending, particularly on social programs, and the historically narrow tax base.

In the Pacific Island Countries, fiscal positions generally improved. Kiribati, the Federated States of
Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands posted fiscal surpluses, reflecting strong revenues from fishing licenses.
Palau benefited from taxes on tourism, and Tonga and Tuvalu from donor grants to fund infrastructure projects.




Central banks responded to inflationary pressures in mid-2014,
but have since refocused on growth concerns


Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia tightened monetary policy in mid- to late-2014 to contain
inflationary pressures and expectations. Malaysia tightened monetary policy for the first time in three years
last July, raising the overnight policy rate by 25 basis points, citing the need to mitigate financial imbalances.
The Philippines raised its overnight reverse repo rate by 25 basis points in both July and September 2014, and
lowered its inflation target to 3 to 4 percent in January. Indonesia raised its policy rate by 25 basis points last
November, as the cut in fuel subsidies led to a spike in headline inflation, although the deposit facility interest
rate was not changed.

Since then, China, Indonesia, and Thailand have eased monetary policy on concerns over growth.
Indonesia in February reversed its earlier rate increase, in the face of limited inflationary pressures (figure
I.A.15). China cut the prime lending rate by 40 basis points last November, after growth slipped to 7.3 percent
yoy in Q3 2014, the slowest pace since Q1 2009; a further 25-basis-point cut followed in March. Also, in
February, the required reserve ratio was reduced by 50 basis points across the board (figure I.A.16). Previous
efforts to ease reserve requirements had been more narrowly targeted, including the 25-basis-point reduction
last June for lending to small enterprises and rural businesses. Thailand cut the benchmark interest rate in
March by 25 basis points, to 1.75 percent.




8	   The Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM) has been using funds raised through government and government-guaranteed borrowing to finance mainly budgetary
     projects implemented by government agencies, as well as some commercial projects. All such projects should be treated as off-budget public expenditures;
     financing to budgetary projects is to be repaid by the budget, and in any case, DBM financing almost fully relies on public guarantees.

Credit growth decelerated throughout the region in 2014, on tighter monetary
policy in some countries, and slower growth in others


Domestic credit funds a large portion of the region’s financing needs. Bank and nonbank credit accounts
for 60 percent of financing needs in China, and 35 to 40 percent in ASEAN countries (figure I.A.17). As a result,
slower domestic credit growth, reflecting tighter monetary policy, significantly affects economic activity.

households and corporates.

Credit growth also moderated in China. Total social financing (TSF), the country’s broadest measure of credit,
amounted to RMB 1.6 trillion in new credits in 2014, slightly less than in 2013 (figure I.A.19). New shadow-
banking credits contracted by a quarter, as the government tightened trust and interbank asset regulations, and
investors gained greater awareness of risks in nonbank products. But new bank loans rose by 7 percent, as the
central bank eased liquidity conditions using an array of policy tools, including relending facilities, open market
operations, foreign exchange market intervention, targeted required reserve ratio cuts, and a benchmark rate
reduction.

Bank lending similarly slowed in 2014 in the smaller economies, except Cambodia. In Mongolia, credit
growth more than halved, to 23 percent, as the central bank phased out some of its quasi-fiscal lending
programs. In Lao PDR, credit growth slowed to 14 percent last December, from 35 percent a year earlier, as
limits on lending in foreign exchange were enforced more strictly, and restrictions were introduced on financing
public investment projects. In Timor-Leste, credit growth contracted in Q2 2014 and Q3 2014. In Cambodia,
credit growth decelerated in the first half of 2014, but recovered in the second half, supported by record foreign
currency deposits.

Funding conditions also tightened in the region’s capital markets in 2014. Issuance of local currency bonds
declined in practically all countries (figure I.A.20). An exception was Vietnam, where, however, the volume
remains comparatively small. Particularly in China, issuance of foreign currency bonds helped compensate for
tighter domestic conditions (figure I.A.21).




Current account balances broadly improved, reflecting a combination of strong
exports, weak demand compressing imports, and robust remittances


The large economies, except for Indonesia, posted current account surpluses in 2014. In China, the surplus
stabilized at 2.2 percent of GDP (figure I.A.22). Thailand moved into surplus, as imports contracted sharply,
owing to depressed domestic demand and lower oil prices. Malaysia’s surplus increased slightly, as the goods
trade surplus offset both a deficit in services trade, stemming from weak construction and insurance exports,
and large income payments on inbound FDI. The Philippines continued running a current account surplus,
supported by remittance inflows of about a 10th of GDP; so did Vietnam, amid buoyant exports and robust
remittance inflows.

Indonesia ran a current account deficit for the third consecutive year. Exports were dragged down by weak
international prices for key commodity exports, including coal, natural gas, palm oil, rubber, copper, and nickel
(figure I.A.24). Imports were reduced by subdued domestic demand and falling oil prices; the country is a net
oil importer. Overall, the terms of trade have deteriorated by 15 percent since before the crisis (figure I.A.25).

Among the smaller economies, Mongolia, Cambodia, and Lao PDR ran large current account deficits.
Mongolia’s deficit narrowed to 8.2 percent of GDP     , from 25 percent in 2013 (figure I.A.23). The country ran a
large trade surplus; exports rose 35 percent, as rising copper concentrate and crude oil exports offset lower coal
exports, and imports fell 15 percent, reflecting lower industrial machinery and transport equipment imports. In
Cambodia, the current account deficit widened to 12 percent of GDP (excluding official transfers). Both exports
and imports were weak. In Lao PDR, the current account deficit fell marginally, to 11 percent of GDP      . Lower

FDI remained robust


FDI inflows remained generally robust in 2014. The region received almost one-third of all FDI to developing
regions in 2013, up from one-quarter in 2007    . Last year, FDI inflows rose in all countries except Malaysia and
Mongolia (figure I.A.26). In Indonesia, FDI inflows amounted to US$15 billion (2.9 percent of GDP), the highest
level since the global financial crisis. The Philippines also recorded its highest FDI inflows in decades, both
in dollar terms and relative to GDP; however, it still lags behind the rest of the ASEAN-5. Vietnam enjoyed
sustained FDI inflows, mostly directed at labor-intensive manufacturing, although the share of technology-
intensive sectors has been rising quickly. In Cambodia, FDI remains concentrated in construction, garment
manufacturing, and tourism; in Lao PDR, in hydropower projects.

FDI flows to Mongolia fell sharply. FDI into the mining sector, which averaged less than 9 percent of GDP
before 2009, ballooned to around 50 percent of GDP in 2011–12, at the height of Mongolia’s mining boom.
Since then, it has dropped eightfold. This reflects both the completion of initial investments in new copper
and gold mines, and weakening investor sentiment amidst uncertainty over major mining projects and the
investment regime.

China and Malaysia engaged in significant outward FDI. In China, FDI outflows averaged 5 percent of
GDP during 2012–14 (figure I.A.27), and have exceeded FDI inflows since 2008. China has emerged as the
world’s third-largest source of FDI, after the United States and Japan. Over four-fifths of its outbound FDI
involves energy and metals projects in Sub-Saharan Africa, Australia, East Asia, and Central Asia (China Global
Investment Tracker dataset). In Malaysia, FDI outflows also recovered to 5 percent of GDP last year.

Portfolio flows to China, and to a lesser extent Indonesia, increased markedly in 2014 (           figure I.A.28).
Indonesia was viewed by foreign investors as a potential reform story. Conversely, portfolio flows to Malaysia
reversed, as foreign investors repatriated their capital. Meanwhile, Malaysian and Thai residents, active portfolio
investors overseas for the last several years, continued their purchases of foreign securities (figure I.A.29).

Portfolio inflows helped lift stock and bond markets


Portfolio flows into equities helped lift regional stock markets in 2014. Share prices gained the most in
China, rising more than 50 percent, although they still stand 40 percent lower than their precrisis valuation
(figure I.A.30). Stock valuations have become more conservative in recent years in China; the market price-
earnings (P/E) ratio averaged 11 in 2014, down from 52 in 2007, and lower than the historical average of 16 for

all emerging markets during 1997–2014 (figure I.A.31). Elsewhere in the region, share price gains were
comparatively more modest, and valuations stabilized around the historical average P/E ratio for all emerging
markets.

Regional currencies broadly appreciated in real, trade-weighted terms in 2014


Regional currencies depreciated against the U.S. dollar last year. The dollar gained against most global
currencies, as the U.S. economy strengthened, and U.S. monetary policy appeared set to tighten relative to
the euro area and Japan. Within the region, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, and Myanmar depreciated most
against the dollar, reflecting increased external vulnerabilities, either from difficult economic restructuring or
from lower commodity prices (figure I.A.33). Indeed, Malaysia’s currency reached its lowest level against the
U.S. dollar since early 2010, partly reflecting increased FDI and portfolio outflows by Malaysian residents, as
well as portfolio outflows by nonresidents.

Reserve coverage of imports and short-term debt remains adequate in the large
economies, even as reserve accumulation has moderated


The pace of reserve accumulation in the region has moderated in recent years. China added only
US$20 billion to reserves in 2014 (figure I.A.36). Reserves declined in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand
(figure I.A.37), amid net capital outflows. Meanwhile, reserves increased in Indonesia, which received large
capital inflows, and Vietnam, which ran a large current account surplus.

Regional reserve adequacy ratios are generally adequate, particularly for the large economies. Reserve
coverage has typically increased from the levels during the global financial crisis, in terms of both imports
and short-term debt (figure I.A.38 and figure I.A.39). Vietnam’s reserves rose to three months of imports at
end-2014, up from 2.4 months at end-2013, and to more than twice its short-term debt at end-2014 Q1. In
some smaller economies, however, reserve adequacy ratios are less encouraging. In Lao PDR, reserves have
increased, but still equal less than two months of imports, and only 28 percent of foreign currency deposits in

I.B.	 Outlook and Risks


Global growth is expected to pick up moderately, and world fuel prices to remain low for a considerable
period. This will help developing East Asia and Pacific sustain its growth performance. In China, growth will
moderate further, reflecting continued policy efforts to address financial vulnerabilities and gradually shift
the economy to a more sustainable growth path. In the rest of the region, growth will pick up, reflecting a
recovery in both investment and consumption, although export growth will be constrained by the ongoing
real appreciations. Given the uncertainties facing the global economy, the regional outlook is subject to
significant risks. The most significant of these include a downturn in the euro area, Japan, or China; and
the potential impact of higher U.S. interest rates and an appreciating U.S. dollar, associated with monetary
policy divergence across the advanced economies, on borrowing costs, financial volatility, and capital
inflows.




Regional growth will ease slightly


Growth in developing EAP is projected to ease slightly, from 6.9 percent in 2014 to 6.7 percent in 2015–
16. In China, further progress with structural reforms, aimed at transitioning to more sustainable growth, will
dampen investment and reduce short-term growth by half a percentage point, to 6.9 percent by 2017 (table
I.B.1). Excluding China, growth will pick up by half a percentage point in 2015, and a further 0.3 percentage
points by 2017 , driven by the large ASEAN economies.

These projections assume a moderate pickup in growth in high-income countries, along with a modest
tightening of global financial conditions (  box I.B.1). In particular, the global recovery will support some pickup
in international trade. Capital flows to emerging markets are assumed to moderate, but to do so smoothly over
the 2015–17 projection period.

The projections also assume that world fuel prices will remain low for a considerable period, with a
positive impact on growth in the region taken as a whole. Plentiful U.S. shale oil production, and OPEC’s
desire to maintain market share, are projected to result in low oil and gas prices through at least 2017         . The
region is a net fuel importer, is relatively energy intensive, and relies on oil and gas for a significant share of its
total energy consumption. As a result, the decline in fuel prices will likely raise regional output by 0.3 percent
in 2015 (box I.B.2). Nevertheless, future trends in oil prices and their impacts remain highly uncertain.

The impact of lower fuel prices will vary across countries, r     eflecting the magnitude of net fuel imports,
energy intensity in production, the share of oil and gas in total energy consumption, and the share of the oil
and gas sector in total output. The Pacific Island Countries, Cambodia, the Philippines, and Thailand, will all gain
significantly. Conversely, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea will experience small GDP losses. In Indonesia, the
net impact will hinge on the extent to which the prices of coal and gas exports track oil prices.

In China, engineering a gradual shift to a more sustainable growth path will continue to pose challenges
for policy makers, given real sector weaknesses and financial system vulnerabilities. Efforts to cut excess
capacity in heavy industry, reduce supply mismatches in residential property, dampen unproductive risk taking
in shadow banking, and harden budget constraints on local governments will help make investment more
efficient and realign growth over the medium term. However, such reforms will depress activity in the short term.
Conversely, stimulus measures aimed at supporting short-term growth may conflict with efforts to increase
the sustainability of medium-term growth. A narrowly targeted stimulus may ameliorate the tradeoff, but will
also prove more challenging to implement. The projected gradual deceleration assumes a firm commitment to
structural reforms and to reducing vulnerabilities; at the same time, targeted stimulus is expected to continue
to mitigate the impact on short-term growth,1 should this show signs of slowing considerably below the
government’s indicative target of about 7 percent.

Growth is expected to pick up in 2015 in most of the larger ASEAN economies, excluding Malaysia,
reflecting a recovery in both investment and consumption; export growth will be constrained by the
ongoing real appreciations. In Indonesia, growth will rise by 0.5 percentage points by 2016–17  , assuming
successful implementation of the new government’s ambitious capital spending plan (figure I.B.1). In the
Philippines, growth will rise by 0.4 percentage points in 2015–16, assuming implementation of the Typhoon
Yolanda reconstruction plan and other public spending plans, including public-private partnerships. Upbeat

consumer sentiment, falling oil prices, and higher incomes will support consumption in 2015, while election-
related spending and transfers will provide a transitory boost in 2016. In Thailand, growth will rebound to 3.5
percent in 2015 and 4.5 percent in 2017  . Greater political stability will encourage consumer spending (consumer
sentiment reached an 18-month high last December). Investment will recover as stalled infrastructure projects,
including from last October’s stimulus program, are restarted. In Vietnam, growth will stabilize at 6 percent,
reflecting continued strength in manufacturing, trade, and foreign investment. In contrast, in Malaysia, the
region’s largest oil-exporter, growth will fall by 1.3 percentage points in 2015. Low oil prices will affect capital
expenditures in the oil and gas sector, a key driver of the last three years’ investment boom; private consumption
will moderate as the government implements the goods and services tax (GST, a value-added tax) in April. After
2015, investment is projected to stabilize, and the impact of the GST to dissipate.

Growth will decelerate in several smaller economies. In Mongolia, weak world prices for copper and coal
will affect mining; many other sectors will remain under pressure from rising production costs and weakening
demand. The projections assume only limited policy tightening in the face of accumulated vulnerabilities,
including large balance-of-payment pressures. In Cambodia, growth will remain below 7 percent in 2015–17         .
Construction is vibrant, but agriculture will be affected by weak commodity prices and slow improvements in
crop yields; garment exports will be constrained by real appreciation and competition from new entrants; and a
return to rapid growth in tourism is far from certain. In Lao PDR, growth will drop by 1 percentage point in 2015,
with limited recovery thereafter. Flat mining output, a slowdown in wood exports from last year’s unusually high
levels, and a deceleration in credit growth will outweigh the impact of large power investments.

Growth in the Pacific Island Countries will be supported by rising trade, tourism, and remittances, and
generally positive country-specific developments. In Papua New Guinea, growth will temporarily spike to
16 percent in 2015, as liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, which began in May 2014, increase rapidly, more
than offsetting the completion of LNG-related construction work.2 In the Solomon Islands, reconstruction in
the wake of the April 2014 flooding will boost activity. However, in Timor-Leste, flat government spending is

The region will consolidate its gains in poverty reduction


Poverty in developing EAP is projected to continue decreasing. Between 2014 and 2017                     , the regional
extreme poverty rate (based on $1.25 a day PPP) will fall by more than a quarter, to 3.7 percent, or 4.3 percent
excluding China (table I.B.2). Similarly, if a higher poverty line ($2.00 a day PPP) is used, the poverty rate will fall
by more than one-sixth, to 14.8 percent, or 21 percent excluding China.4 That said, the pace of poverty reduction
for developing EAP as a whole will be slower than during 2012–14, and even slower than in the 2000s, largely
reflecting the expected slowing of China’s economic growth. And in 2017        , there will still be 75 million extreme
poor and more than 300 million poor in the region.

Several downside risks threaten the positive outlook


Given the uncertainties facing the global economy, the regional outlook is subject to significant risks. A
downturn in the euro area and Japan would weaken global trade and impair the region’s export performance.
Higher U.S. interest rates and an appreciating U.S. dollar, associated with monetary policy divergence across
the advanced economies, may raise borrowing costs, generate financial volatility, and reduce capital flows to




3	   Estimated and projected growth in 2014–16 has been revised downward significantly since October 2014, for two reasons: public expenditure is now expected to
     stabilize after the big increase in 2014; and there is renewed uncertainty surrounding private investment, for instance, in a cement plant and in the Tibar Bay Port.
4	   All these estimates depend critically on the estimated responsiveness of poverty to growth, particularly in China, Indonesia, and the Philippines, which together
     account for more than 90 percent of the total number of poor.

the region more sharply than anticipated. A significant slowdown in China, though unlikely, would exert large
spillovers, particularly on commodity exporters.



A downturn in the euro area and Japan would weaken global trade and impair the region’s export
performance

The euro area or Japan could slip into a prolonged recession  (box I.B.1). This could slow the global recovery
and weaken global trade, adversely affecting developing EAP’s export performance.

The region is particularly at risk from a global downturn, because it is highly open. Its economies are
deeply integrated into global supply chains and commodity markets, and are hence particularly sensitive to
global growth developments and prospects. The spillovers would be transmitted through trade (figure I.B.2 and
figure I.B.3), and potentially also investment channels.

Higher U.S. interest rates and an appreciating U.S. dollar, associated with monetary policy
divergence across the advanced economies, may raise borrowing costs, generate financial
volatility, and reduce capital inflows

Monetary policy is increasingly diverging across the advanced economies, and remains subject to
significant uncertainties. The United States is expected to begin raising interest rates in the second half of the
year, but both the timing and the pace of rate hikes remain uncertain. In contrast, the euro area has committed
to a relatively open-ended program of large-scale asset purchases (box I.A.1).

Yields, especially on dollar-denominated assets, may increase more abruptly than anticipated, raising
the borrowing costs of governments, corporates, and households. Debt has increased rapidly in the wake
of the global financial crisis, reflecting the unprecedented expansion of liquidity and credit, including through
the prolonged fixing of policy rates at close to zero. In particular, several EAP countries have accumulated
sizable amounts of dollar-denominated debt, benefiting from the prolonged compression in U.S. term- and

credit-risk premia (box I.B.3). In recent years, both cross-border dollar bank loans and especially international
dollar bond issuance have grown rapidly. As a result, the region would be sharply affected by rising U.S. rates.
Global yields more generally may also rise.

Continued U.S. dollar appreciation would further increase the cost of borrowing in dollar markets. The
rapid U.S. dollar appreciation against the euro and yen since mid-2014 may continue. As regional economies
seek to limit swings in their overall competitiveness, their currencies may continue depreciating against the U.S.
dollar. This would also increase the cost of servicing or rolling over dollar-denominated debt, which accounts for
a large majority of foreign-currency debt across the region (box I.B.3). Those sectors characterized by long-term
investments and limited hedging opportunities (including real estate, utilities and energy, and transport and
infrastructure) will be most affected.

Financial volatility may increase. Divergence in monetary policies and the associated uncertainties create
a potential for significant portfolio adjustments, asset repricing, volatility in capital flows, and increases in
risk premia. As investors try to shift substantial positions in shallow markets, there is also a risk of market
dislocation and asset-price spirals.

Structural developments in financial markets will compound these effects. Liquidity in secondary bond
markets has declined since the Global Financial Crisis, particularly in already less liquid markets and securities
(Fender and Lewrick 2015). As a result, less selling pressure is required to generate large price adjustments
and significant volatility. In addition, risks are shifting from the banking system to the nonbank sector, where
authorities have a less direct and complete set of tools to address risks (Financial Stability Board 2013; IMF
2014).

Increased debt burdens and financial volatility may also be associated with a sharp reduction or
even reversal of capital flows to emerging markets, including developing EAP                  . In turn, this would exert
considerable pressure on countries with vulnerable external positions. Of particular concern to several countries
in the region are (a) the reliance on portfolio flows and short-term borrowing to finance current account deficits
or debt rollovers (figure I.B.4), (b) a large external debt load (figure I.B.5), (c) a large share of local-currency debt
held abroad (figure I.B.6), and (d) elevated household debt (figure I.B.7).

A significant slowdown in China, though unlikely, would exert large spillovers,
particularly on commodity exporters

In China, a disorderly unwinding of real and financial vulnerabilities could trigger a sharp slowdown
in investment and output growth. A steep decline in property prices could force developers and banks to
deleverage quickly, leading to a sharp contraction in real estate investment. A disorderly unwinding of local
government financing could trigger a sharp slowdown in infrastructure investment. A wave of bankruptcies in
primary and heavy industries suffering from overcapacity could seriously derail fixed investment in otherwise
healthy industrial sectors. And excessive risk taking in the shadow-banking system could eventually force a
rapid cutback in liquidity and credit, deeply curtailing investment.

A slowdown of this order remains unlikely, given the substantial policy buffers available. As discussed in
the October 2014 East Asia and Pacific Economic Update, there are significant fiscal, institutional, and exchange-
rate buffers to prevent a disorderly unwinding of debt. Ample fiscal space is available to deploy targeted stimulus
or bail out debtors. The savings rate is 50 percent of GDP   , financial repression restricts savings outside the
banking system, the financial system is still predominantly state owned, and capital controls on bank lending
and portfolio investment prevent sharp outflows. Foreign reserves, at US$3.9 trillion, are by far the largest in
the world, and net international assets exceed US$2 trillion.

However, should a sharp slowdown materialize, it would exert large spillovers across the region. A one-
time 1-percentage-point decrease in China’s GDP growth relative to the baseline (stemming from a 2-percentage-
point decrease in investment growth) would reduce growth in the region by approximately 0.2 percentage
points (World Bank 2014). The impact would be relatively larger for commodity exporters, and for economies
more tightly integrated into regional supply chains (Ahuja and Nabar 2012). In addition, the significant negative
impact on Australia and New Zealand, among the world’s largest commodity suppliers, would lead to indirect
spillovers on the Pacific Island Countries, given their tight links through trade, investment, and aid.

    Box I.B.1. Global growth will pick up gradually, but downside risks prevail

    Global growth is expected to pick up moderately, from an average 2.5 percent in 2012–14 to 3.1 percent
    in 2015–17. This slow recovery will continue to be accompanied by relatively weak trade (figure I.B.1.1).

                                                                          (box I.B.2). This will:
    World oil prices are expected to remain low for a considerable period 

      •	 Support global activity in the medium term; however, this could be offset in the short term by sharp
         adjustments in oil exporters, and persistent headwinds facing some large oil importers (including tighter
         fiscal or macroprudential policies, weak bank balance sheets, political instability or policy uncertainty, a
         high debt burden, or infrastructure bottlenecks).

      •	 Shift real income from oil exporters to oil importers, improving current accounts in the latter and reducing
         their vulnerabilities.

      •	 Reduce nonenergy commodity (especially food) prices, and reduce global inflation by around 1 percentage
         point in 2015 (figure I.B.1.2), providing more room for expansionary monetary policies where country
         circumstances warrant.

    Global financial conditions will tighten gradually. As monetary policy begins to tighten in the United
    States, while remaining accommodative in other major economies, capital flows to developing countries
    are set to moderate. They will, however, slow unevenly across countries, with investors focusing more on
    country-specific vulnerabilities, policies, and growth prospects.

    Growth in high-income countries is projected to continue rising, from 1.7 percent in 2014 to an average

    in the euro area. In the United States, growth will rise to an average 3 percent in 2015–16, gradually returning
    to near-potential growth of about 2.5 percent. The recovery will be led by consumption, assisted by improved
    housing and labor market conditions, although the strong U.S. dollar will dampen net exports. A first interest

   rate hike is expected in the second half of 2015, followed by a gradual and protracted tightening cycle. In the
   euro area, growth will strengthen to an average 1.6 percent in 2015–16. Quantitative easing, a weak euro, and
   low energy prices will assist activity and lift asset prices. However, the legacies of the financial crisis (impaired
   balance sheets, high unemployment, debt overhang, and ongoing uncertainties surrounding Greece’s support
   program) will continue to limit the expansion. In Japan, low oil prices, a weak yen, the impacts of product
   and labor market reforms announced in June 2014, and the recent additional monetary stimulus will boost
   consumption and net exports, and raise growth to an average 1.4 percent in 2015–16.

   Growth in developing countries will strengthen to an average 5 percent in 2015–17. Developing countries
   will be helped by the recovery in high-income countries and by sustained low commodity prices. Prospects for
   large emerging markets are, however, mixed. Major reforms and greater investor confidence have improved
   growth prospects in India and Mexico. However, commodity exporters, particularly those who face capacity
   constraints and domestic headwinds, such as Argentina, Brazil, Kazakhstan, and Russia, will continue to
   experience weak growth, especially in 2015.

   There are significant downside risks to this global outlook; the short-term risks are related to oil prices,
   divergence in monetary policies across advanced economies, and geopolitical tensions. Persistently
   low oil prices could rapidly erode fiscal and external buffers in oil producers (Baffes et al. 2015). As buffers
   weaken, episodes of sharp currency depreciation and associated financial stress could intensify, triggering a
   reassessment of emerging market assets more broadly. In addition, as monetary policy increasingly diverges
   across major high-income economies, investors may reassess prospects and policies, and the exchange
   rates for the major currencies may swing abruptly. Although developing-country sovereigns have increasingly
   borrowed in local currency, corporates have issued significant amounts of foreign-currency–denominated debt.
   Exchange rate adjustments may cause financial-market strains in countries with large currency mismatches,
   for instance, between export earnings and corporate borrowing or external liabilities. Also, if geopolitical
   tensions intensify, they could exert deep economic and financial spillovers. The impact on investor confidence
   could exceed the actual disruptions to supply chains, trade, and travel, and could trigger a general repricing of
   emerging and frontier market assets.

   The main medium-term risks are associated with possible stagnation in the euro area and Japan.
   Should inflation expectations fall further below the European Central Bank’s target for an extended period,
   weak consumption, anemic investment, and low inflation could feed on each other in a deflationary spiral.
   This will be compounded by demographic and structural challenges in the euro area, such as rigidities in labor
   markets and a nonunified banking sector. Euro area stagnation would have global repercussions since the bloc
   accounts for one-quarter of world trade and cross-border banking system assets. There is also the risk that
   Japan could relapse into deflation and stagnation, should its fiscal stimulus and aggressive monetary easing
   fail to permanently lift inflation expectations and revive growth. Stagnation in Japan would damage growth
   prospects in East Asian trading partners, in particular.

   High levels of accumulated debt also pose risks. Government debt in many high-income economies
   has reached unprecedented highs since the crisis, while private sector debt in emerging markets is rising.
   Slower growth, combined with falling inflation and rising real interest rates, could weaken the debt repayment
   capacity of a number of countries. Concerns about debt sustainability would further weigh on growth and
   increase vulnerability in many emerging markets to stresses such as declining capital inflows.

    Box I.B.2. The impact of the decline in fuel prices on East Asia and Pacific5

    This box discusses the implications of the recent steep drop in world oil prices, and the projected
    significant decline in natural gas prices. These developments are expected to persist for an extended
    period, and will therefore have a material impact on the region’s prospects. Changes in the prices of other
    commodities, including coal, are expected to be comparatively minor.

    Oil prices have decreased by about 40 percent since June 2014, after four years of relative stability;
    natural gas prices have also declined, although by smaller amounts (       figure I.B.2.1). This reflects above all
    several years of significant expansion in unconventional oil supplies, together with a shift in OPEC policy away
    from price support and toward maintenance of market share (World Bank 2015b). Weakening global demand,
    the unwinding of some geopolitical risks, and U.S. dollar appreciation have played a smaller role.

    Oil prices are expected to remain low for a considerable period. In the baseline, oil prices will average
    US$53 per barrel in 2015, 45 percent lower than in 2014, with only a small recovery in 2016 (table I.B.2.1).
    This reflects the persistence of the above drivers, and assumes no further deterioration in the global
    macroeconomic environment, and no further changes to OPEC policy (Baffes et al. 2015).

    Weakness in oil prices will extend to other energy markets, especially natural gas in Asia and Europe.
    Most important for EAP   , the Japanese LNG price benchmark is projected to decline 30 percent in 2015. In
    contrast, coal prices are projected to remain relatively stable.

    The decline in fuel prices will affect economies through three key channels. It will lead to a significant
    real income shift from fuel exporters to fuel importers. In addition, as with any reduction in the cost of
    intermediate inputs, it will act as a positive productivity shock. Further, it will directly affect prospects for the

   oil and gas sector, and in particular discourage sectoral investment and reduce fiscal revenue from the sector.
   Overall, fuel importers are likely to benefit through faster growth and improved trade balances. Conversely, fuel
   exporters are likely to experience slower growth, an external and fiscal deterioration, currency depreciation
   and, potentially, financing pressures.

   A sustained fuel-price decline will benefit developing EAP as a whole. The region is a net fuel importer
   (for the equivalent of 3 percent of GDP   , or 1 percent of GDP excluding China), is relatively energy intensive,
   and relies on oil and gas for a significant share of its total energy consumption. As a result, the projected
   decrease in fuel prices will act to raise regional output by 0.3 percent (table I.B.2.2), boost the regional trade
   balance by more than 1 percent of GDP       , and reduce regional inflation by 1 percentage point in 2015. In the
   medium term, and assuming that the decline in fuel prices is sustained, the cumulative impact on output will
   be significantly larger (on the order of 0.7 to 0.9 percent). An alternative scenario, with a further decline in
   oil prices to US$30 per barrel in 2015, is also possible, although of low probability.6 Under this scenario, the
   above effects would be roughly doubled.

   The impact will vary across countries. The Pacific Island Countries, Thailand, the Philippines, Cambodia,
   and Lao PDR will all gain more than 0.5 percent of GDP under the baseline. Conversely, Malaysia, and Papua
   New Guinea will experience small GDP losses. These overall effects reflect the interplay of several factors:

        •	 Net fuel imports. Most countries are net fuel importers. Imports are highest, as a share of GDP      , in the
           Pacific Island Countries, Thailand, Cambodia, and the Philippines (figure I.B.2.2, panel D). The net fuel
           exporters are Timor-Leste, the largest exporter of crude oil; Malaysia, an exporter of petroleum products
           and gas; and Indonesia, a coal and gas exporter, although a net oil importer. Gas exports will also become
           increasingly important in Papua New Guinea.

        •	 Energy intensity of production. This is relatively high in China, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia (figure
           I.B.2.2, panel A). Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Pacific Island Countries lack comparable data, but they also
           rely relatively heavily on those sectors most dependent on oil consumption, including transportation,
           tourism, petrochemicals, and agriculture.




   6	     For instance, fuel producers that are heavily reliant on fuel-related fiscal revenue may further increase production to meet planned budget expenditures.
          Indeed, some analysts have argued that a further drop in oil prices to US$20 per barrel is possible (Citigroup, February 9, 2015). Relatedly, a survey of 86
          investment specialists found oil price projections for 2015 in the range of US$35 to US$80 per barrel (Bloomberg Intelligence). Again, during 1985–86,
          when conditions in the global oil market were similar to those prevailing today, oil prices declined (in current US$) from the previous peak of US$126 per
          barrel (November 1979) to US$61 per barrel at a time when OPEC still “managed” supplies (November 1985), and then to less than US$21 per barrel
          when OPEC abandoned supply management (July 1986).

    Notes: a. 2015 baseline refers to oil prices of US$53 per barrel, and Asia LNG prices of US$11 per millions of British Thermal Units (mmbtu). 2015 lower fuel price scenario refers to
    oil prices of US$30 per barrel, and Asia LNG prices of US$7       .2 per mmbtu. 2014 oil prices were US$96 per barrel, and Asia LNG prices were US$15.8 per mmbtu; b. In Timor-Leste,
    lower oil prices will significantly affect oil sector and total GDP  , and the trade balance. However, for Timor-Leste, growth projections, and the estimated impact of lower fuel prices,
    refer by convention to nonoil GDP    . In the short run, this will be relatively unaffected; the public sector accounts for almost 90 percent of nonoil GDP; and lower oil prices will not
    affect public spending in 2015, since the reduction in fiscal revenue is being offset by increased transfers from the country’s natural resource fund.




      •	 The share of oil and gas in total energy consumption. This is relatively high in Thailand, Malaysia,
         Indonesia, and the Philippines (figure I.B.2.2, panel B). Conversely, in China, coal accounts for 68 percent
         of energy consumption, whereas oil and gas account for less than 25 percent. Vietnam also relies
         relatively more on coal and hydroelectric power.

      •	 The share of the oil and gas sector in total output. This is relatively high in Vietnam, Malaysia, and
         Indonesia (figure I.B.2.2, panel C). Relatedly, these countries also rely significantly on the oil and gas
         sector for fiscal revenues.

    Some of the effects of lower oil prices have already materialized. In the last quarter of 2014, trade
    balances improved in net fuel importers, such as China, the Philippines, and Thailand, and deteriorated in net
    fuel exporters, such as Indonesia and Malaysia (figure I.B.2.3). Lower oil prices also acted to reduce inflation
    across the region (figure I.B.2.4). Indonesia was an exception: here, domestic fuel prices actually increased,
    but this reflected the reduction in fuel subsidies.

    All the above estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. For instance, in Indonesia, the impact on
    growth, and to a lesser extent the current account, will be significantly influenced also by how the prices of
    coal and gas exports evolve. For the Philippines, the overall impact on the current account will also depend
    on whether lower fuel prices translate into lower remittances for Filipino workers in oil-producing Middle
    East countries. If fuel exporters were to face acute fiscal and external stress, they might have to tighten
    policy significantly. Relatedly, the positive effects for fuel importers could take time to materialize, whereas
    the adverse effects for fuel exporters could arise more abruptly, especially if accentuated by financial market
    pressures.

    Box I.B.3. Higher U.S. interest rates and a stronger U.S. dollar could pose significant debt-
    servicing challenges for developing EAP7

    The cost of servicing dollar-denominated debt will likely increase over the coming years. The anticipated
    normalization of U.S. monetary policy beginning in 2015 is likely to increase interest rates on all dollar debt
    (figure I.B.3.1). In addition, the rapid U.S. dollar appreciation since mid-2014 may also continue, raising the
    debt service burden in local currency terms (figure I.B.3.2).

   Cross-border bank loans at end-Q3 2014 accounted for 15 percent of total outstanding bank loans in Indonesia,
   9 percent in the Philippines, 8 percent in Vietnam, and 4 percent in Thailand (figure I.B.3.4). In China, and also
   in Vietnam and Thailand, cross-border bank loans have grown much faster than domestic loans, both since
   2009 and more recently.9 In addition, in China, there are significant amounts of dollar-denominated domestic
   bank loans.

   Second, the issuance of dollar bonds by non-U.S. borrowers has grown even faster and more steadily
   in recent years than dollar bank credit, but the trend may not be sustainable. Between 2010 and 2013,
   emerging market issuers, mostly nonbanks, sold an unprecedented net US$1 trillion in international dollar
   bonds. Developing East Asia and Pacific issued US$80 billion, with Indonesia, the Philippines, China, and
   Malaysia accounting for the bulk (figure I.B.3.5). This expansion was partly the result of unconventional U.S.
   monetary policy and the resulting compression in the U.S. term premium (McCauley, McGuire, and Sushko
   2015). During this period, for instance, many lower-rated Indonesian firms actively sold 10-year dollar bonds.
   However, the market for dollar bonds issued by non-U.S. residents will deteriorate when U.S. short-term rates
   and the term premium rise.

   Finally, dollar credit, as a share of GDP   , has risen faster in economies with wider interest differentials
   relative to the United States; it may fall as U.S. interest rates increase. Wider policy rate differentials
   relative to the U.S. federal funds rate spur subsequent-quarter growth in dollar bank loans; analogously, wider
   10-year bond yield differentials relative to U.S. bond yields spur subsequent-quarter growth in dollar bonds
   outstanding (McCauley, McGuire, and Sushko 2015). These associations have strengthened since the global
   financial crisis.

            local borrowers.

I.C.	 Policy Considerations


In the short term, addressing fiscal challenges will help manage the risks associated with an uncertain
global outlook. Bolstering revenue and rationalizing expenditure is therefore a continued priority in most
large economies. And fiscal consolidation is needed in the major fuel exporters, Mongolia, and to a lesser
extent Lao PDR, Myanmar, and several Pacific Island Countries. In this context, low world fuel prices
generate a unique opportunity to both remove fuel subsidies and raise energy taxes more broadly. Over
the medium term, developing human capital and physical infrastructure is important, including in fuel
exporters striving for diversification. Over the longer term, the region needs to address aging-related fiscal
challenges, improve the investment climate, and promote further integration.




Bolstering fiscal revenue and rationalizing expenditure remains
a short-term priority


Across the region, it is critical to address fiscal challenges, and to base public budgets on prudent
medium-term fiscal plans, as a hedge against the uncertain global environment. Authorities should
expand their ability to respond to any global slowdown. In this context, both fuel exporters and fuel importers
need to approach both fiscal revenue and expenditure in terms of realistic and cautious medium-term targets
and scenarios. Fuel exporters should assume continued low world fuel prices; contingency plans should also be
drawn up in case of further price declines (box I.B.2). Fuel importers should assume that the boost from falling
world fuel prices will gradually die out, and indeed that these prices will partially recover.

In most large economies, some combination of bolstering revenue and rationalizing expenditure will
help create fiscal space for both productivity-enhancing investments and targeted social protection and
insurance programs, although the specific fiscal challenges vary. In Thailand, the significant fiscal stimulus
should be framed within a medium-term plan to strengthen the revenue base. Public investment projects need
to be well selected and effectively managed. In the Philippines, similarly, it is a priority to broaden the tax base
and rationalize income-tax incentives. In the short run, the targeted increase in the deficit, from 0.6 percent
to 2 percent of GDP  , will appropriately allow for post-typhoon reconstruction work and some infrastructure
upgrading, while keeping debt ratios moderate and fiscal buffers adequate. In Vietnam, the sizable deficit
and rising public debt need to be contained, including through improvements in tax administration and more
targeted social spending.

China faces a delicate balancing act; the pace of reform needs to be sustained, but the likelihood of
sharp contractions minimized. Strengthening local government finances is a key immediate challenge. This
will involve aligning local revenue with expenditure and improving the management and oversight of local
government borrowing, as envisaged in a new pilot framework. It is critical that any efforts to support growth
be designed so as not to undermine restructuring efforts; in particular, any fiscal stimulus program will need to
avoid unsustainable increases in local government debt.



ADJUSTING TO A CHANGING WORLD
38  |    PART I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK




In the major fuel exporters, lower fuel prices will erode fiscal revenues over time, offsetting any gains from
fuel subsidy reform, and creating a need for consolidation. In Malaysia, the oil and gas sector accounted
for 30 percent of fiscal revenues in 2014, a share that is projected to decline to just over one-fifth in 2015. As
a result, the government already raised its deficit target from 3 percent to 3.2 percent of GDP  , and undertook
a reprioritization of expenditures. Additional responses would be to reduce the number of exemptions to the
goods and services tax, and to introduce a new personal income-tax bracket for high earners. In Indonesia,
where the oil and gas sector accounts for 20 percent of fiscal revenues, it will prove challenging to achieve the
targeted 30 percent increase in tax revenues in 2015, and hence the targeted doubling of capital expenditure.
In Timor-Leste, the public sector is extremely dependent on petroleum revenues, which finance 85 percent of
the 2015 budget. The immediate impact of falling oil prices has been dampened by the country’s sizable natural-
resource fund,1 which negates short-term liquidity concerns. However, low oil prices reduce the country’s
prospective petroleum wealth, partly through uncertainty around the development of future oil fields, and
generate fiscal sustainability issues. In this context, the 11 percent increase in the recurrent budget in 20152
generates particular concerns.

Among the smaller economies, fiscal consolidation is urgently required to rebuild fiscal buffers
in Mongolia and to a lesser extent Lao PDR and Myanmar; in addition, fiscal institutions need to be
strengthened. Mongolia has the highest fiscal deficit and public debt in the region. It needs to unify authority
over all fiscal activity, and in particular bring under the budget the significant quasi-fiscal activities of the
Development Bank of Mongolia. The total deficit, including such quasi-fiscal spending, should be gradually
brought down to 2 percent of GDP      . In Lao PDR, fiscal consolidation, targeting a nonmining deficit of 5 percent
of GDP  , will help reduce fiscal vulnerability. In this context, it will be important to proceed with plans to increase
excises on vehicles, tobacco, and alcohol; improve tax administration; and control spending through reductions
in public hiring, a wage freeze, and a more selective, higher-quality public investment program. Myanmar
needs to strengthen its capacity to develop and implement policy; macroeconomic stability and continued
reforms remain a prerequisite for development. In particular, the deficit will need to be kept below 5 percent of
GDP; in this context, the rapid increase in the wage bill raises the urgency of broad pay and grading reform. In
Cambodia, donor grants are expected to continue declining. The government will need to rebuild deposits, its
only fiscal buffer; carefully manage contingent liabilities; and continue public financial management reforms to
increase accountability.

The Pacific Island Countries continue to face significant short- and medium-term fiscal sustainability
issues. Outside Timor-Leste and Papua New Guinea, oil- and gas-related issues are not critical. However,
Vanuatu, already under fiscal strain from planned infrastructure development programs, now faces additional
large reconstruction needs in the wake of Cyclone Pam. In the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall
Islands, and Palau, grants from the United States under the terms of the Compact of Free Association are set to
expire in 2023, requiring substantial fiscal adjustment. And in Samoa, public external debt has ballooned from
30 percent of GDP in 2008 to 52 percent in 2014.

Low world fuel prices create an opportunity to both eliminate fuel subsidies
and raise energy taxes


Low world fuel prices afford developing EAP a unique opportunity to both eliminate fuel subsidies
and raise energy taxes more broadly; this will reduce inefficiencies and help address fiscal challenges.
Countries should not pass through reduction in world fuel prices, but rather seize the chance to reform
energy pricing with only a muted impact on politically sensitive domestic consumer prices. Such measures
will discourage wasteful consumption, minimize resource misallocation in production, strengthen government
finances, and boost current accounts.

Fuel prices differ markedly across the region, and have historically been particularly low in Indonesia,
Malaysia, and more broadly the ASEAN-4. Even as of last December, domestic gasoline and diesel prices
in Indonesia and Malaysia were 40 percent lower than in Cambodia and Lao PDR (figure I.C.1 and figure I.C.2).
Prices were also low in the Philippines and Thailand, including when compared to advanced economies and
other emerging markets. Conversely, many Pacific Island Countries were characterized by relatively high fuel
prices, reflecting the impact of their remoteness on fuel shipping and distribution costs.

Fuel subsidies have strained public finances, particularly in fuel exporters. In Indonesia, fuel subsidies in
2013 amounted to 2.2 percent of GDP     , or almost 20 percent of central government total budget expenditure.
This amount was larger than the capital expenditure budget, and more than 1.5 times the health budget.
Electricity subsidies accounted for a further 1 percent of GDP (figure I.C.3). In Malaysia, fuel subsidies in 2013
amounted to 2.4 percent of GDP   , or the equivalent of half the education budget and more than 1.3 times the
health budget (figure I.C.4). These subsidies, in addition to draining government fiscal resources, have at
                             3

times also forced state-owned enterprises to divert resources away from investment spending. In Thailand,
fuel subsidies amounted to about 0.8 percent of GDP in 2012.4 There have also been smaller subsidies in the

4	        The subsidies were mostly targeted to LPG, electricity, and natural-gas vehicles (IISD 2013). Much of the expenditure was financed through transfers from the oil
          price stabilization mechanism (“Oil Fund”). This was established in 1979, and over extended periods has not just stabilized but also acted to reduce average energy
          prices, leading to periodic required injections of government funds.

Beyond explicit subsidies, fuel-related tax expenditures have also weakened fiscal balances, particularly
in fuel importers. China, the Philippines, and Thailand have all occasionally reduced various taxes to lower
fuel prices for end users (Kojima 2013). In the Philippines, the continued failure to adjust petroleum excises in
line with inflation cost 1 percent of GDP in foregone revenues in 2013 alone.6 In Thailand, diesel taxes were
largely eliminated during 2011–14, at an annual cost of 1 percent of GDP (IISD 2013). In Mongolia, taxation of
petroleum products has since 2008 been adjusted to stabilize domestic prices, which in practice has resulted
in a reduction in average fuel prices.

Such measures to reduce domestic fuel prices have weakened current account balances. They encourage
excess fuel consumption, and as a result discourage other key imports, including capital goods imports. To
obtain a sense of the potential magnitude, in Indonesia, the trade deficit in oil and gas accounted for a large
and rising share of the current account deficit in recent years.7 Relatedly, fuel imports amounted to 1.5 times
capital goods imports in 2013–14 (figure I.C.5). In Thailand, fuel imports in recent years have amounted to over
12 percent of GDP , and about 82 percent of capital goods imports (figure I.C.6).

Recent steps to reduce fuel subsidies and increase fuel taxation have established a positive momentum,
which now needs to be sustained; remaining fuel subsidies should be eliminated, and increases in
broader energy taxation should be considered. In Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, as discussed,
various fuel subsidies were reduced or eliminated. In Indonesia alone, these measures are projected to save
approximately 1.8 percent of GDP in 2015. In Vietnam, increases in fuel taxes are expected to offset the
reduction in fiscal revenue stemming from falling oil prices. But in these countries, as elsewhere in the region,


5	    Some of these subsidies have proved transitory. For instance, fuel for jeepney and tricycle drivers was subsidized in 2008, when oil prices peaked, and again in
      2011.

both subsidies and tax expenditures can be reduced further. In Indonesia, remaining fuel subsidies amount to
approximately 0.6 percent of GDP; kerosene and LPG prices are fixed at a subsidized level, and there is still a
limited diesel subsidy. In Malaysia, there remain substantial natural gas subsidies of over 1.25 percent of GDP      ,
and diesel subsidies for public transport and fishing. Thailand should consider raising electricity tariffs and LPG
prices. The Philippines should consider raising petroleum excises and linking them to world prices. And Timor-
Leste will need to act to contain electricity subsidies. In all cases, if and when fuel prices start increasing again,
the reforms to date will need to be defended. More broadly, higher energy taxes, whose specific form may
vary, should be considered to address objectives related to energy efficiency, pollution, and climate change,
particularly in large fuel consumers such as China and the Philippines.

Monetary policy should remain accommodative across much of the region


In most economies, there is no immediate need for monetary tightening, although authorities need to
remain cautious, because the disinflationary impact of lower world commodity prices may not persist.
Lower oil prices have helped reduce headline inflation across the region, including through lower food prices,
and there are no incipient inflationary pressures. The spike in headline inflation in Indonesia and Malaysia in
Q4 2014, following the cut in fuel subsidies, proved temporary. That said, as world commodity prices stabilize
and possibly recover, the downward trend in inflation will not continue, and may even be reversed.

In the ASEAN-4, the general tightening in 2014, and the limited loosening by Indonesia in February 2015,
has resulted in an appropriately accommodative monetary policy stance. Policy tightening in Indonesia,
Malaysia, and the Philippines in 2014 helped to end a period of very low or negative real policy rates (figure
I.C.7). If continued, this could have created financial stability risks, in particular by encouraging overborrowing,
while potentially eroding banks’ margins and capital. In Thailand, a further monetary easing might be appropriate
if the economic recovery is weaker than anticipated. The central bank’s plan to define its target in terms of
headline rather than core inflation may indeed present advantages in terms of easier communication with the
public.

In those economies, particularly Mongolia, where monetary policy has been extremely loose and credit
growth exceptionally rapid, further tightening remains imperative. In Mongolia, the central bank began
to phase out directed credit in 2014, and raised policy rates last July and in January 2015; nevertheless, the
outstanding stock of central-bank liquidity injections into quasi-fiscal lending programs remains at an elevated
10 percent of GDP    . In Cambodia and Lao PDR, slower credit growth would also help contain macrofinancial
vulnerabilities; in addition, improved financial sector regulation and supervision would help ensure early risk
detection and mitigation.

The real exchange rate should be monitored as an indicator of emerging competitiveness problems.
Most regional economies de facto attempt to limit swings in their bilateral dollar exchange rate. This is often
understandable, given their need to service dollar-denominated debt (see box I.B.3). However, as a result of the
rapid dollar appreciation against the euro and the yen, many countries in the region have experienced significant
appreciation in real, trade-weighted terms. That said, the main component of any strategy to reverse losses in
competitiveness will need to be a continued focus on medium-term structural reforms, several of which are
noted below.




Developing human capital and physical infrastructure
is a key medium-term priority


In fuel-importing countries, the decline in fuel prices creates an opportunity to increase investments
in education, health care, and infrastructure. Lower fuel prices boost growth and relax fiscal constraints to
expanding productivity-enhancing investments. For instance, much of developing EAP has made significant
progress in expanding access to education. But countries now need to focus on developing labor market
skills, including both cognitive and noncognitive skills. Primary and secondary education systems should
focus on quality and on learning outcomes, including by strengthening autonomy and accountability. And the
relevance of higher education, vocational education, and training needs to be improved by giving institutions


                                                                                                              WORLD BANK EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC ECONOMIC UPDATE APRIL 2015
                                                                                                                              I.C. Policy Considerations    |  43


the capacity, incentives, and information to both increase quality and meet labor market needs.8 In a similar
vein, infrastructural investments could yield significant returns. For instance, in the Philippines, characterized
by a large infrastructure deficit, the main island of Luzon faces serious threats of a power shortage,9 and road
congestion in the Metropolitan Manila region costs the economy 8 percent of GDP annually. That said, it will
be important for greater investment in human and physical capital to be accompanied by increases in the
efficiency of such expenditure. In turn, this points to the importance of strengthening institutions, including
through public financial management reforms.

In fuel-exporting countries, development strategies must focus on removing barriers to economic
transformation and diversification. The decline in fuel prices underscores the need to pursue a broad range
of complementary structural reforms, including developing fiscal and monetary institutions to better manage
volatility in natural-resource rents;10 again, providing high-quality education and appropriate infrastructure; and
creating a competition regime that levels the playing field for enterprises (Gill et al. 2014).




Over the longer term, the region needs to address aging-related fiscal challenges,
improve the investment climate, and promote further integration


Countries in the region—both low and middle income—face significant long-term fiscal challenges, as
demographic trends and social pressures lead to rising social security expenditure. EAP is aging faster
than any region in history, driven primarily by a rapid decline in fertility, but also increased longevity. This will
affect growth prospects. Combined with growing pressures to expand pension coverage, it will also raise the
costs of pensions. The policy response must be twofold (see Part II.A, “Healthy and Productive Aging in East
Asia and Pacific”): first, sustaining productivity growth, boosting the labor force participation of women and
older urban people, and in some cases increasing immigration; and second, reforming social security financing
so as to expand the revenue base.

In a similar vein, demographic trends and social pressures will lead to sharp increases in health
expenditures. The fiscal costs of health care and long-term care will be affected by both demographic aging,
and pressures to expand health care coverage through universal enrollment, a greater degree of financial
protection, and access to higher-quality health services. These welcome expansions in coverage need to be
accomplished in a fiscally sustainable manner. The revenue base for health care must therefore be expanded.
In addition, costs must be contained, including by reforming the mechanisms for paying health care providers,
purchasing pharmaceuticals, and adopting new health care technologies (see Part II.B, “Macro-fiscal Implications
of Achieving Universal Health Coverage in East Asia and Pacific”).

Will lower-income economies in developing EAP benefit from China’s move into higher value-added
sectors? The answer depends partly on the extent to which Chinese labor-intensive manufacturing relocates
within China rather than to other countries. As China’s economy matures, its labor-intensive manufacturing


                                                                                                                               ”

will face pressures to move to lower-cost economies across the region. However, such international relocation
has so far proved limited. Rather, as costs have risen in China’s manufacturing hub on the eastern coast,
industry has moved to lower-cost areas within the country, both within the eastern coastal region, and in
other regions in China (see Part II.C, “Manufacturing Relocation in China”). Underlying factors include China’s
significant advantages in terms of labor productivity, a favorable investment climate, robust logistics, and
superior infrastructure. For developing EAP, making progress in these areas will prove critical to developing
their industrial sectors.

Increasing competitiveness in services through further regional integration will be necessary for ASEAN
economies to sustain growth in the long run. Services such as finance, education, health care, transportation,
and telecommunications are critical to modern economies, including as key drivers of productivity in high-value-
added manufacturing. Recognizing this, the ASEAN members have committed to liberalizing and integrating
their services markets, in the context of the formation of the ASEAN Economic Community at end-2015.
However, little de facto progress has been made so far, and ASEAN remains among the most restrictive regions
in the world with respect to trade in services (see Part II.D, “ASEAN Integration in Services”). Correcting this
will require a focus on promoting regulatory cooperation and coordination through harmonization or mutual
recognition, together with the development of regulatory capacity.

II.A.	 Healthy and Productive Aging in East Asia and Pacific1


East Asia and Pacific (EAP) is aging faster than any region in history, though the stage and pace of
demographic transition exhibits significant diversity across countries. The richer countries in the region,
such as Japan and the Republic of Korea, are already dealing with shrinking labor forces and rising spending
on pensions, health, and long-term care. For middle income countries, including China, rapid aging has
started or is imminent, and will require urgent policy reform. For younger low income countries, it is
vital to make policy choices that take into account future aging. For all countries, rapid aging raises many
challenges and risks, but EAP is well positioned to manage the risks through appropriate policy reforms.
Many people in EAP already work until fairly old ages, save significant amounts throughout their lives, and
are living healthier longer. At the same time, much of the developing EAP is “growing old before growing
rich”, as income growth trails the pace of aging. Addressing the resulting fiscal risks requires a concerted
policy focus to sustain high productivity growth, boost the labor force participation of women and older
urban people, and in some cases increase immigration. In addition, balancing old-age financial protection
with broad coverage and fiscal sustainability will require fundamental changes in the financing of pension
and health systems, delivery of health services, and development of long-term care systems. The region
is at a crossroads, and sustaining its economic dynamism will require politically challenging policy choices
across the life cycle. In the face of such fundamental reforms, the nature of the social contract between
the state and citizens, between generations and genders, is likely to evolve quickly in the coming years.

Aging is a subject that has often generated dramatic predictions about its implications for the economic
future of EAP , but about which discourse is often oversimplified. Media and popular discourse in much of
the region are full of dire warnings about an “aging time bomb,                       ” and similar descriptions
                                                                   ” a “silver tsunami,
of the negative consequences of rapid aging for future prosperity. While rapid aging is a current or imminent
reality in much of the region, the “geriatric Malthusianism” that this sometimes triggers is frequently based on
selective reading of the evidence and the misplaced assumption that demographics will change but that policy
and behavior will not. This section summarizes key messages and evidence from a forthcoming World Bank
report on aging in EAP and implications for public policy.

Rapid aging raises many challenges and risks, but EAP is well positioned to manage the risks, provided
it makes sensible policy choices that promote appropriate behavioral change by households and
employers. Initial conditions also position EAP better than some regions to achieve healthy and productive
aging. It already has long working lives, high savings rates at all ages, and social security systems that to date
have fewer unsustainable legacy commitments. But the region is at a crossroad, and managing rapid societal
aging while sustaining EAP’s economic dynamism will require policy choices that are politically challenging and
that will require strong leadership and building of social consensus.

EAP is Undergoing a Rapid Demographic and Epidemiological Transition


EAP is aging faster than any region in history, driven primarily by a rapid decline in fertility, but also
increased longevity. Nearly all EAP countries outside the Pacific are in the midst of or will soon experience a
pace of aging that is unprecedented, transitioning from young to aged societies in 20 to 25 years—transitions
that took 50 to over 100 years in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries
(figure II.A.1). While the starting points vary, nearly all EAP countries move from aging to aged societies relatively
quickly once the aging threshold is reached (with exceptions such as the Philippines and Papua New Guinea).

The main driver of aging in EAP has been a sharp decline in fertility. Fertility rates in EAP declined
dramatically between 1960 and 2005, from 5.91 to 2.46 children per woman, significantly faster than the global
decline from 5.51 to 3.03 children per woman. Fertility rates in several East Asian countries are now among the
lowest in the world, with richer East Asian countries averaging only 1.28 children per woman in 2010, and major
middle-income countries such as China, Thailand, and Vietnam well below replacement fertility and continuing
to fall.

The picture on aging within EAP is diverse, with three groupings of countries evident. The demographic
diversity of countries in EAP suggests three groupings. Japan; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; and Hong
Kong SAR, China—the wealthiest countries and hereafter called the “Red countries”—are advanced agers,
with populations 65+ on average of 14 percent of the total populations in 2010 (figure II.A.2). China, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Mongolia, Thailand, and Vietnam represent a middle group, hereafter called the “Orange” countries,
which is currently aging very quickly. The third group—hereafter called the “Green” countries—consists
of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Timor-Leste, and the Pacific Island
Countries (not shown). These countries are still quite young—an average of 4 percent of the population was
65+ in 2010—but will begin to age quickly in coming decades.

Demographics drive divergent trends in working-age populations, with a number of EAP countries
projected to experience sharp declines in their labor forces    (figure II.A.3). Several countries will experience
substantial declines in the working-age share of their population between 2010 and 2040, of over 15 percent
in Korea and at or above 10 percent in Thailand, Japan, and China. In contrast, in Green and some Orange
countries, the working-age share of the population is not expected to shrink until after 2040. In absolute terms,
the Philippines and Indonesia will account for a large share of the regional increase.

Together with demographic transition, EAP is experiencing a rapid epidemiological transition toward
noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), in part driven by population aging. On a positive note, healthy life
expectancy (HALE) increased in EAP between 1990 and 2010, though slightly less than total life expectancy. At
the same time, the burden of disease due to NCDs has grown rapidly, with initial onset increasingly happening
in middle age. Cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes accounted for the bulk of disability-adjusted life
years (DALYs) among those aged 60+ in 2010. In low-income EAP       , communicable diseases still account for a
significant share of premature mortality and morbidity, creating a double burden of disease.




The Situation of Older People in EAP


The situation of older people in EAP is diverse across and within countries, in terms of their poverty
status, labor market behavior, and primary sources of support. In terms of living standards, older people
across developing EAP have shared in the significant falls in poverty. At the same time, poverty in a number of
East and Southeast Asian countries tends to rise with age after 45, before flattening or even declining at the
oldest ages. As with the general population, older people with high levels of education (and those who have
children with higher levels of education), access to a formal sector pension, and with better health status tend
to be better off than their peers. In contrast to the younger adult population, however, employment status has
a more complex relationship with elderly poverty, in part because many poorer, often rural, older people have
                       ”
to “work till they drop.

Co-residence of older people with adult children is significant in EAP    , though it varies considerably across
countries, and has declined significantly over time in some. Co-residence of older people with their children
is quite high, and generally increases between middle age and the mid-60s. For people aged 60+, co-residence
rates vary significantly across EAP countries (between 25 and 30 and over 80 percent), with notable variation by
gender and urban/rural location. They are particularly high in low-income countries, and, consistent with global
patterns, tend to be lower at higher-income levels within countries. Elderly co-residence with children has also
been declining rapidly in China, Korea, and Thailand. In China, the co-residence rate for those aged 65 to 70 fell
from close to two-thirds in the early 1980s to roughly 43 percent by 2011, while in Korea, co-residence of those
65+ was over 80 percent in 1980 but had fallen to well below 30 percent by 2010.

While older people in EAP often work until very old age, there are also significant differences between
urban and rural areas and by gender. There are very distinct urban and rural labor markets for older people
in EAP (figure II.A.4). While on average people work until late in life, many in urban areas withdraw from work
relatively early, and in cases like urban Chinese women, retirement occurs very early, with only around one-
third still working at age 60. Withdrawal of urban people from work is clearly correlated with access to a formal
sector pension, though caregiving responsibilities for grandchildren and older elderly also play a role in the early

52  |      PART II. MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT AGENDA




withdrawal of urban women from formal work. Nearly everywhere, urban women are the least likely to work
into old age, and gender gaps in participation are substantial. Among those who continue working into old age,
self-employment is the dominant form of work, with self-employment rates of 90 percent and higher common
in rural areas of EAP.

In addition to working until old ages by global standards, older people in East and Southeast Asia tend
to work hard, particularly in rural areas. For countries analyzed for the report, men who continue to work
beyond age 65 are working on average 40 hours or more per week, and women are working 30 to 45 hours
per week. The picture in rural areas is even more striking, with rural men who continue to work working 30 to
40 hours per week even at age 75, and women working between 20 and 35 hours per week. In addition to what
is formally counted as “work, ” older people in EAP are often undertaking significant caregiving roles, a social
and economic role that is not formally recognized in national accounts.

In terms of sources of support, developing EAP has a distinctive pattern in terms of the roles of the state,
families, and individuals in old-age support. Unlike regions such as Latin America and the Caribbean or
Europe and Central Asia, where the state has played an important role in old-age support through generous and
widespread pension systems, older people in EAP have relied more heavily on their own labor and the support
of their families, especially in rural areas. Labor income plays a critical role in old-age support in EAP, with work
income dominating other sources of support in nearly all countries for rural areas and in most for urban areas
(figure II.A.5). For most countries, private transfers to elderly people in rural areas are also more significant than
public transfers, and such familial support is even more pronounced once nonfinancial support is factored in.

While EAP has common cultural features with respect to sources of old-age support, there is also
growing diversity across and within countries rooted in initial conditions such as labor market formality,
urban/rural shares, and formal social security coverage. Differences are emerging within EAP          , with public
transfers playing an important role in, for instance, Mongolia and urban China, but a negligible role in Cambodia
and Indonesia, where informality is high and pension and social assistance systems are underdeveloped (figure
II.A.5). Even within China, the sharp differences between rural and urban areas are notable. All this points to
a rapidly changing landscape. While public transfers play a relatively modest role in old-age support to date in
most EAP countries, social expectations of the relative role of the state, families, and retirees themselves in
postretirement support are changing rapidly, with opinion surveys showing expectations of future state (rather
than familial) support rising sharply.

Aging, Growth, and the Fiscal Situation of EAP Countries


Developing EAP is an acute example of “getting old before getting rich,     ” with increased elderly dependency
kicking in at far lower income levels than in OECD and developed EAP countries. The Orange (largely
aging MICs) and Green (largely younger and poorer) countries have been aging—in some cases rapidly—at low
levels of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (figure II.A.6). Two things are clear in this regard. First, aging
increases the pressure to maximize productivity growth for developing EAP       . Second, both Orange and Green
countries will fail to reach the income levels of Red (richer and older) EAP countries, or OECD or middle-income
countries such as Mexico, at similar points of the demographic transition, even with sustained productivity
growth. Thailand provides a case in point; even with solid growth in recent decades, the pace of aging is
outstripping per capita income growth. It is following a path closer to that of Poland, which is now struggling
with fiscal pressures from aging. Mongolia provides a more dramatic example of stagnant GDP per capita in
the face of rapid aging. While developing EAP countries cannot avoid getting old before getting rich, they can
adopt productivity-enhancing reforms that result in elderly dependency/GDP trajectories more like that of Korea
than those of Thailand or Mongolia.

The demographic dividend has played a substantial role in EAP’s remarkable growth story over recent
decades, though younger EAP countries will need to deepen reforms if they are to realize the same
growth impacts as older EAP countries did at similar stages of demographic transition. Literature on

East Asia finds that around one-third of the high per capita income growth in East Asia from 1960 to the 1990s
can be attributed to the demographic dividend, with some estimates of the effect as high as 44 percent of
growth in per capita incomes from 1960 to 1990 (Bloom and Williamson 1998; Bloom, Canning, and Malaney
2000; Bloom, Canning, and Sevilla 2003; Kelly and Schmidt, 2005).2 In most East Asian countries, the pure
demographic effect was compounded by improvements in educational attainment, capital investment, and
other factors. For younger EAP countries now in the midst of their youth bulges, and for which rapid aging will
come only in future decades, the key is to make these productivity-enhancing reforms and investments now,
so that they both maximize the demographic dividend and are prepared for rapid aging when it comes.

The tailwind provided by demographics to growth in older EAP countries has raised fears of a headwind
as labor force size declines and aging accelerates, but these forces can be mitigated by policy and
behavioral responses. Overall, while the risks to future growth are real, even rapidly aging countries have
significant scope to mitigate the potentially negative labor force and growth impacts of aging. However, while
the channels for mitigating the potential impacts of aging on growth in EAP are significant, benign outcomes
cannot be taken for granted.

Managing the growth impacts of aging will require public policy action and wider behavioral change in
a range of areas, and it is important to keep in mind that “aging policy” is not just about old people but
must address issues across the life cycle. At the macro level, the balance of priorities is somewhat distinct
across the country groupings in EAP:

 yy For Red countries, slowing the structural labor force decline from aging will be the most critical challenge,
    since most are closer overall to the productivity frontier and, therefore, without easy options for major
    gains in labor productivity. An enhanced focus on increasing female labor force participation, extending
    productive working lives, and in some countries increasing immigration of younger workers from within the
    region, will be vital (see below).

 yy For Orange countries, the challenges of the demographic transition require sustaining high productivity
    growth. Even assuming this, they will enter the ranks of aged societies at much lower levels of income
    than the Red countries. At the same time, they will need to mitigate the labor supply and fiscal impacts
    of rapid aging through ongoing reforms of pension and health systems and labor policies to extend the
    working lives of their urban and formal sector workers as they undergo rapid urbanization and control the
    fiscal risks of entitlement programs. There are reasons for cautious optimism, because healthier and more
    educated cohorts will be better prepared for the prospect of longer working lives than previous generations.

 yy The younger Green countries will enjoy favorable demographics as the youth bulge continues to feed into
    the labor force for the next few decades, and the priorities are, first, to establish the conditions to realize
    maximum GDP growth from the demographic dividend (basically investments to raise productivity and
    maximize youth employment); and second, to avoid adopting policies in areas like pensions and health
    that are affordable now but would rapidly become unsustainable once aging accelerates. Their success in
    doing so will determine their readiness to manage aging when it accelerates over the coming two to three
    decades.

More specifically, deepening reforms in labor and financial markets, immigration policy, the education
sector, and other areas will be vital, but is also likely to prove challenging. With respect to labor force
decline, the channels for mitigating the effects of aging include extending productive working lives (through a
mixture of incentives and mandates, both within the labor market itself and in areas such as pension reform),
raising female labor force participation (with particular emphasis on making childcare available and affordable),
and increasing immigration (which will require proactive efforts in both sending and receiving countries). These
quantitative channels will be supplemented by improvements in labor force quality as a result of the impressive
achievements of EAP countries in expanding access to higher levels of education over recent decades and
ongoing efforts to improve educational quality. There is also likely to be capital deepening in response to labor
force decline, so that labor productivity could be expected to increase. More broadly, evidence from EAP
suggests that concerns about the impacts of aging on savings and capital formation may be overstated. First,
household and corporate savings rates are high in EAP and provide a more solid foundation than other regions.
Second, survey evidence points to flatter savings/age profiles in EAP than in other parts of the world, and to an
increase in savings rates at all ages in the region over recent decades. Third, there are significant inefficiencies
in financial markets in developing EAP that suggest there is large scope for more efficient mediation of savings
into capital formation and productivity.

deficits are expected to emerge in most developing
EAP defined benefit schemes in coming decades, with deficits ranging from 1.4 to 4.5 percent of GDP by 2040.
Health care spending projections also point to increasing public spending (though notably lower than increases
in pension spending). Aging accounts for around one-third of the projected increase in public health spending
in several developing EAP countries, though the affect is higher in China. Across pensions and health, a more
complex (and uncertain) picture of fiscal pressures from aging emerges if debt dynamics are incorporated into
fiscal projections. Where increased age-related spending drives up deficits and they are funded through debt,
the potential for an upward spiral in public spending is substantial.

Challenges for Pensions, Health, and Long-Term Care Systems with Aging


Across the key areas of pensions, health, and long-term care, there are some common reform challenges:3

 yy The first is that policy-driven coverage expansion (achieving universal health coverage in the case of health
    and wide coverage of pensions, plus exploration of a state role in long-term care) is being executed at
    the same time as rapid aging is taking place in most Orange and some Green countries. There is thus a
    growing commitment to shift some of the burden of old age financial support and health care costs from
    families and individuals to the state through pooling mechanisms of different forms. In that sense, there is
    a double challenge to navigate on the expenditure side.

 yy The second is that pension and health systems face challenges of balancing coverage, adequacy, and
    sustainability. To date, the emerging approach in developing EAP has been to prioritize coverage expansion,
    though often with shallow financial protection (as evidenced by the reliance on modest social pensions to
    expand coverage of pensions in countries such as China, Thailand, and several Pacific Island Countries; and
    the fact that even those with health insurance coverage have continued to have fairly high out-of-pocket
    spending in countries such as China, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam; see Part II.B, "Macrofiscal
    Implications of Achieving Universal Health Coverage in East Asia and Pacific" on universal health care).

In terms of pension system design, no region exhibits a greater heterogeneity than East Asia, and this is
reflected in the policy challenges faced by different groups of countries. The pension challenges facing EAP
countries vary not only because of their disparate demographic situations, but because of past policy choices
and the nature of their labor and capital markets. The richer (Red) countries have achieved wide coverage of
their systems with better financial sustainability than other rich countries, but they face challenges of pension
adequacy and hence old-age financial protection. The middle-income (largely Orange) countries are grappling
with the dual challenges of improving sustainability of their existing or legacy systems at the same time as
trying to expand coverage to large uncovered informal sectors, both challenges given urgency by the rapid
pace of aging. For the poorer and younger (Green) EAP countries, the key question is the appropriate model of
pension systems that can achieve significant coverage over time, and how to avoid overreliance on contributory
pension models that have proven ineffective in the rest of the world in expanding coverage sustainably.

Addressing the pension coverage gap in East Asia will require policies that move away from the reliance
solely on payroll taxes to finance pensions—that is, a paradigm shift in the way that pension systems
have been financed historically. This shift is motivated by the limitations of a traditional social insurance
approach. As in many developing countries, traditional contributory approaches risk “losing the race” between
pension coverage expansion and rapid societal aging. The good news is, however, that considerable innovation
is already happening within EAP  . There has been a rapid expansion of social pensions and budget-financed
matching contribution schemes for informal sector workers in response to the persistent failure of contributory
pension schemes in “closing the coverage gap.  ” This was the case in Korea in the 2004 reform, Chile in 2008,
China in 2011, Thailand in the 2000s, and Mexico in 2012.4 It also parallels the successful regional experience

in expanding health insurance coverage through heavily subsidized health insurance premiums. Meanwhile,
the use of consumption taxes in Japan and budget support for the contributory pension scheme in China is
partly driven by reluctance to raise payroll tax rates further. The trend is not uniform, however, as evidenced
by the introduction of a social insurance scheme in Lao PDR and legislation in Indonesia and Myanmar that
make these countries among the last in the world to have followed the Bismarckian path to pension provision.
The experience of dozens of countries that had once faced the same choice suggests that it may not be the
appropriate path.

A way forward in pension reform should be based on the premise that the redistributive element of the
pension system should be financed from general revenues and clearly distinguished from the insurance
or savings component. The latter should ideally be financed by individuals on an actuarially fair basis. The
simplest approach would be to eschew the mandated scheme altogether and instead have a social pension
with broad coverage (for example, universal or affluence-tested) complemented by a voluntary retirement
savings scheme. This is the approach in New Zealand, which features an opt-in default for a voluntary defined
contribution scheme that has led to relatively high participation rates. However, this option is not likely to be
realistic in countries that already have contributory mandates, even for those such as Myanmar and Timor-Leste,
which only recently passed legislation mandating contributions. Countries like these with nascent contributory
systems, along with Indonesia, which has yet to define its defined benefits scheme parameters, should aim for
actuarially fair and modest schemes and leave redistribution to be financed through general revenues, either
through social assistance or social pensions.

For the wider group of EAP countries with mature but low coverage mandated contributory systems, they
should also shift the balance of pension system financing toward general-revenue-financed redistribution
and modest target benefit levels, but in a way that does not compromise incentives to participate in the
contributory scheme. This requires strong coordination between social and contributory pension design and
implementation. The most feasible path for such countries is likely to mix residual mandatory contributory
systems with subsidized voluntary contributory approaches, and social pensions targeted to wider or narrower
populations depending on the level of coverage achieved through contributory mechanisms. Countries such as
China, Korea, and Thailand provide distinctive models of this approach. While for now the adequacy of pensions
for the majority is very modest, sustained growth should allow for deepening financial protection over time.

In the health sector, aging exacerbates systemic reform challenges for all EAP countries because the
increased incidence of chronic NCDs with age means both that the share of people living with these
conditions will increase, and there will be higher shares of people living with multiple chronic NCDs.
In this context, the consequences of a fragmented and acute care model of health service delivery are even
more pronounced in populations with rising shares of older people. The evidence in EAP indicates that health
system shortcomings and welfare consequences are notably more severe for older people. They are much
more likely to be admitted to inpatient care (often unnecessarily); are much more reliant on pharmaceuticals
than average, and hence are more affected by poor pharmaceutical purchasing and prescription practices; and
they experience substantially higher out-of-pocket spending and higher rates of catastrophic health spending.
They also have higher co-morbidity rates, which necessitate a more mixed set of services and more complex
management of movement between levels of the health system. And finally, older people experience functional
and cognitive decline, which engenders new demands on health systems such as dealing with dementia and
mobility challenges. Therefore, in an aging population, it is all the more imperative to implement a health
system where prevention and treatment are offered in a coordinated manner over a sustained period of time,



ADJUSTING TO A CHANGING WORLD

and in which individuals assume greater responsibility in managing their own care. Detailed recommendations
in this regard are provided in section II.B on universal health care in this Update.

Formal long-term care (LTC) systems in developing EAP remain nascent, but a growing number of aging
countries are grappling with the appropriate role of the state in an area that has traditionally been the
domain of families, communities, and the health system. Rapid aging and social change have exposed the
limitations of traditional informal modes of LTC for frail elderly people in EAP. Part of the response has been
default reliance on health systems for LTC, but this tends to be costly and complicates health reform efforts.
Proactive policy choices in the LTC domain are therefore important, but require careful planning with respect to
their interaction with informal care systems and formal health and welfare systems. The policy choices for LTC
in developing EAP remain for the most part open.




Overarching Challenges and Knowledge Gaps in Aging


One of the key challenges in shaping public policy responses to aging is its inherently multisectoral
nature. Aging—like areas such as early childhood—presents inherent challenges to the institutional and policy
setups of many governments due to the fact that it cuts across so many sectors and stages of life. Governments
are typically not well arranged to respond multisectorally. While a number of EAP countries have recognized this
challenge and have established national aging commissions to promote more holistic thinking on the subject,
they tend to be primarily advocacy agencies that to date lack the political and bureaucratic clout to drive whole-
of-government approaches. There are, however, examples from richer countries in the region that aim to bring
the wider view into sectoral policies, a good case being the periodic Inter-Generational Reports produced by the
Productivity Commission of Australia for the Treasury, which help set long-term expenditure and policy priorities
for age-related programs. Other countries such as Japan are better placed than some others institutionally,
with a consolidated health, labor, and welfare ministry that brings a critical mass of age-related policies and
programs under a single body.

A second overarching challenge is the political economy of reform and behavioral change. Many of the
policy reforms needed to promote healthy and productive aging are politically difficult and may challenge societal
norms. Extending working lives has proven politically challenging in many parts of the world, most notably on
efforts to raise retirement ages. Increasing female labor force participation involves deeply rooted cultural norms
and in some cases trade-offs, such as when retired middle-aged women provide the backbone of informal
childcare and aged care. Similarly, the track record on immigration from younger to older countries in the region
is mixed. Health system reform is also notoriously difficult, both with providers and the wider population, and
changing ingrained lifestyle habits that drive the NCD epidemic is a generational challenge. All these measures
will require patient building of social consensus. There is also a wider challenge of intergenerational equity and
political economy. Larger aged populations in other parts of the world have been successful at lobbying for their
interests, at times at the cost of younger generations. Experience from Red EAP countries suggests that they
have balanced the interests of different generations and shared the costs and benefits of an aging population
more equitably than other parts of the world, but the further evolution of the political economy dynamics
around aging will be interesting to watch.




                                                                   WORLD BANK EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC ECONOMIC UPDATE APRIL 2015

Another big picture question is the appropriate roles of public policy and market forces in shaping the
response to rapid aging. While proactive public policy will be required, it will not necessarily be the right
response to every challenge, and a careful balance of mandates, incentives, and reliance on market forces will
be required. The experience of Red EAP countries in the area of extending working lives provides a nice case
in point where supportive public policies are gaining more traction as the market forces of supply and demand
have increased the appeal of older workers. Equally, the most effective public policies will sometimes involve
a retreat from state direction in cases where policies like rigid seniority wages or unnecessary restrictions on
women’s work hinder the play of market forces that would be expected to increase the employment of older
people and women.

Finally, it is clear that there remains a huge amount that is unknown with respect to aging in EAP
and globally. While there is a growing body of work and policy innovation in EAP with respect to aging,
no country can be said to have “got it right,  ” and understanding of long-term trends and policy impacts is
often speculative. There are large remaining knowledge gaps—on the interaction of labor and savings market
behavior and rapid social security reforms; on societal and individual behavioral change in the face of rapid
growth, urbanization, and changing family structures; on how to reverse ultra-low fertility rates in richer EAP
countries; on the productivity of older workers and the cost-effectiveness of policies to extend working lives; on
the cross-country dimensions of aging in the region with respect to migration, capital flows, and other factors;
and more broadly on the respective roles of market forces and public policy in promoting health and productive
aging. Even the most fundamental question of the trajectory of fertility and aging has been shown in the past to
be consistently imperfect. Even where global experience offers useful lessons, the speed of aging in EAP and
its unique cultural and political economy context suggests that caution is needed in predicting future trends.

II.B.	 Macrofiscal Implications of Achieving Universal Health
       Coverage in East Asia and Pacific1

Many countries in East Asia and Pacific have made universal health coverage (UHC) an explicit public
policy goal in recent decades. Financing and implementing UHC programs in a fiscally sustainable manner
will be vital for the success of these policies. General revenue financing has played a crucial role to date,
and will continue to be important. Experience from across the world shows that delinking entitlement to
health coverage from employment and from users’ direct contributions is critical to ensuring that the poor,
near-poor, and informal sector workers are enrolled. To this end, it is necessary to fully subsidize coverage
through general revenues. Moreover, UHC implies not just universal enrollment, but also improving
financial protection and ensuring access to good-quality services. All this will put immense pressure
on public budgets, exacerbated by other cost drivers such as population aging and noncommunicable
diseases. To increase fiscal space, governments need to expand the revenue base for health. Potential
new revenue sources include excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco (“sin taxes”), and consumption taxes
such as value-added taxes and mobile phone taxes. In addition, costs urgently need to be contained, by
reforming mechanisms for paying health care providers, purchasing pharmaceuticals, and rationalizing
among new health care technologies.




Moving toward Universal Health Coverage


The East Asia and Pacific (EAP) region is diverse in terms of levels of health care coverage achieved
across countries and health systems features. Countries such as Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia,
and Thailand have achieved high levels of access to services and financial protection for the entire population.
In many of the low- and middle-income countries, health-related expenditure shocks caused by inadequate
coverage are a prominent source of impoverishment for millions of households every year. Health care is
financed predominantly through general revenues in Malaysia and Hong Kong SAR, China; mainly social health
insurance in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, China; and some combination of the two in most others. Service delivery
typically involves a mix of public and private services, but countries differ widely in the share of each.

Diverse as they are, most countries have made universal health coverage (UHC) an explicit public policy
goal in the last two decades, with support from the highest levels of government. Countries such as
China can claim to provide almost universal coverage. Other countries have set explicit target dates as a
way to mobilize political support: Indonesia in 2019, Vietnam in 2020, and Lao PDR in 2025. Such high-level
commitments are motivated by the need to address inequalities, strengthen social cohesion, and meet the
expectations of a growing middle class. They also reflect growing recognition that investments in the health
of the population are ultimately beneficial for economic growth. Recent estimates suggest that reductions
in mortality accounted for about 11 percent of recent economic growth in low- and middle-income countries
(Jamison et al. 2013).

Looking ahead, increasing fiscal space for health by expanding the revenue base and securing better
value from existing resources will be critical for the financial sustainability of efforts to achieve UHC. To
date, government health spending financed through general revenues has played a critical role in the progress
of EAP countries toward UHC. Several challenges remain, however. Large segments of the population remain
without any form of coverage. Benefit levels remain relatively shallow in many publicly funded programs,
while out-of-pocket spending is generally high. From a service delivery perspective, health systems in the
region are ill-prepared to cope with rising health care demand fueled by expanded entitlements, the rise in the
prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), and a rapidly aging population, all of which are significant
cost drivers. Further increases in the budgetary allocation for health will be important for meeting UHC goals.
However, mobilizing general revenues to finance all of the UHC policy commitments is not desirable from a
macrofiscal perspective. Addressing inefficiencies and securing better value from existing resources will be
just as important.

T
 his note examines the macrofiscal implications of the drive to achieve UHC in the region, and policy options
for dealing with them.



What exactly is UHC?

UHC has been defined as a system in which all people who need health services receive them, without
undue financial hardship (WHO 2010). This is an aspirational goal. Even where all people are protected from
financial hardship, there is always some gap between the need for services and the use of services, and quality
often falls short. To transform UHC from an aspirational goal into an achievable objective requires identifying the
specific goals embedded within the definition and orienting policy toward progress on these goals. Reframing
the goal as moving toward UHC, rather than achieving UHC, helps shift the focus toward taking actions to
reduce the gap between the need for and use of services, and improving financial protection (Kutzin, Cashin,
and Yip, forthcoming 2015).



Measuring Progress

In moving toward UHC, there are three interrelated goals to consider: (a) the full spectrum of quality
health services according to need, (b) financial protection from direct payment for health services when
consumed, and (c) coverage for the entire population (WHO 2013). The World Health Organization-World
Bank framework for monitoring progress toward UHC recommends two sets of targets for assessing progress
to UHC: at least 80 percent coverage of essential health services, regardless of level of wealth, place of
residence, or gender; and 100 percent financial protection from both catastrophic and impoverishing health
payments for the population as a whole, including for specified groups of the population such as the poorest
40 percent. Comparable data for all of these indicators are not yet available.

EAP countries have made progress in increasing population coverage of insurance and/or general-
revenue-funded programs. Indonesia and Vietnam have increased enrollment in health insurance to 40 to
60 percent of their populations with a combination of contributory and noncontributory tax-financed social
insurance programs. The ratios are 85 to 95 percent in the Philippines, China, and Mongolia. Coverage is
lower in poorer countries such as Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Papua New Guinea, but efforts have been made to

remove financial barriers for targeted subgroups such as the poor and/or specific services, such as maternal

UHC policy commitments have not always translated into affordable coverage and financial protection
for the population (Chakraborty 2013; Hanvoravongchai 2013; Harimurti et al. 2013; Liang and Langenbrunner
2013; Somanathan, Dao, and Tien 2013). The out-of-pocket (OOP) share of total expenditures (figure II.B.1), and
the incidence of catastrophic and impoverishing OOP payments remains high in most countries (figure II.B.2).
In Cambodia, China, and Vietnam, 10 to 20 percent of households incur OOP payments that are catastrophic,
defined as exceeding 25 percent of their monthly household budget in any one month.

The Political Economy of UHC


The political economy underpinnings of UHC are important for understanding their macrofiscal
implications for the region. UHC as a concept emerged after World War II, underpinned in many countries
by a broad value consensus on social cohesion (Kutzin, Cashin, and Yip, forthcoming 2015). In postwar Japan,
as the major political parties competed over the establishment of the welfare state with health insurance for
all as a popular and tangible goal, insurance coverage expanded quickly (Ikegami et al. 2011). Similarly, in EAP
today, the adoption of UHC as a national priority has been motivated by the need to mobilize political support
and increase social cohesion.

In many EAP countries, high-level policy commitments to attain UHC were preceded by major economic
and political transitions. In Indonesia, they followed the financial crisis in 1997 and democratization in the early
2000s. In China and Vietnam, the breakdown of the state-run health system following market-oriented reforms
in the 1990s, and its deleterious effects on health and welfare, led to gradual coverage expansion in the 2000s.
More recently, the political leadership in these two countries has prioritized the deepening and consolidation
of coverage as a means to enhance social cohesion. In Mongolia, following the collapse of the state-run health
system, the first democratically elected government stepped in to subsidize near-universal enrollment in social
health insurance in 1993. In Papua New Guinea, the removal of user fees for primary health care, an important
step in moving toward UHC, was a promise to voters that the newly elected government delivered on in 2013.

In other EAP countries, social movements were instrumental in putting UHC on the political agenda, and
holding governments accountable for those reforms. In Thailand, for instance, health care professionals
founded an organization called the Rural Doctors’ Society, which worked with grassroots partners in civil society
to make UHC an issue in the national elections in 2001. The movement remained engaged in the implementation
and governance of the new Universal Coverage Scheme (Harris 2013). In Malaysia, where universal coverage
was established in the 1950s, politics continues to play a role: health financing reforms were a major political
issue during the 2013 elections.

                                                   II.B. Macrofiscal Implications of Achieving Universal Health Coverage in EAP    |  65


The significant political momentum underlying EAP’s coverage expansion has two important macrofiscal
implications.

First, it means that governments choose to use general revenues to finance health. Before UHC as a
policy goal gathered momentum, many countries introduced contributory health insurance for formal sector
workers. The expectation was that such coverage programs would become self-sustaining, enabling public
subsidies for health services to be captured only by the poor. However, a commitment to UHC means covering
whole populations including the poor and the informal sector, who are less likely to contribute. It implies a
shift away from purely contributory funding mechanisms to general revenues to subsidize the health insurance
contributions of those who cannot afford to pay or whose contributions are administratively difficult to collect
(Kutzin, Cashin, and Yip, forthcoming 2015).

Second, the way in which coverage expanded has created entrenched political interests, leading to
inefficient financing arrangements and undermining cost-containment goals in the health sector. By
initiating explicit coverage with the formal sector, EAP governments provided privileged access to health care
to a group that is politically and economically influential. Those initially covered resisted extending the same
entitlements to the rest of the population, resulting in multiple insurance schemes being created with varying
levels of coverage. They also proved politically difficult to integrate, since any such measure would redistribute
resources across organized interest groups. Reforms aimed at moving toward UHC in Indonesia and Vietnam
led to the unification of different insurance schemes in principle, but with large variations in coverage in practice.
In Thailand, interest group politics have prevented the unification of schemes; civil servants maintain their own
scheme as do formal sector workers. Multiple risk pools are both inequitable and inefficient. Moreover, the
initial, fairly generous benefit levels provided to the formal sector stymie efforts to rationalize benefits packages
based on cost-effectiveness and other criteria. This is a serious threat to cost containment since coverage of
the same generous benefits package is extended to the whole population.




The Macrofiscal Implications of UHC



Government health spending: a critical component in the drive to achieve UHC

Health spending as a share of GDP has risen dramatically in the last two decades in EAP (            figure II.B.3).
Today, the EAP region is a relatively high spender on health compared to other regions (table II.B.1), but with a
lot of variation across countries in levels and composition of spending (figure II.B.4). Total health expenditures
per capita were under US$50 in Myanmar, and over US$900 in Palau in 2012.

The share of government expenditures devoted to health also rose dramatically during 1995–2005. It is
currently just under 13 percent, second only to the Latin America and the Caribbean region (figure II.B.5). All the
countries that achieved significant expansion in coverage during the late 1990s and early 2000s (China, Indonesia,
Mongolia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam) saw public health spending rise relative to GDP (figure II.B.6).
For instance, in Thailand, during its big national push toward UHC between 1998 and 2008, the share of the
national budget devoted to health increased by around 14 percentage points. Spending subsequently declined

slightly, but the health share remains among the highest in the region. Similarly, in Vietnam, as social health
insurance was introduced between 2006 and 2010, government health spending increased faster than GDP or
overall government spending.

Why has general revenue financing been so critical for progressing toward UHC?

Enrolling the poor and other vulnerable groups2 through contributory means, even if partially subsidized,
has proven difficult in many countries. Despite large reductions in the poverty rate, 18 percent of EAP’s
population continues to live on less than $2.00 a day PPP (see Part I). Not only does this mean that premiums
could be unaffordable for many, the process of having to enroll creates additional barriers to access for the
poor. Using general revenue financing to cover the poor avoids many of the challenges of contributions-based
enrollment. Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam have adopted this approach.

Enrolling the informal sector has proved even more challenging. Globally and historically, richer countries
tended to have lower levels of informality (figure II.B.7). Japan; Korea; and Taiwan, China saw dramatic reductions
in informality alongside income growth through the 1970s and 1980s, which enabled them to expand coverage
through contributory enrollment. In EAP     , informality has proved more persistent (figure II.B.8). Empirically,
partial subsides, even when combined with assistance in enrolling (for instance, information and reminders)
have proven less effective than thought in increasing enrollment in the informal sector (Capuno et al. 2014;
(Wagstaff et al. 2014). For informal workers, who are also often near-poor, the financial and transaction costs of
enrolling are binding constraints. Globally, the evidence is clear: absent full subsidies that reduce the financial
and transaction costs of enrolling to zero, it would be impossible to fully enroll the informal sector. The only
countries that have been successful in enrolling all or most of the informal sector are Thailand (100 percent
premium subsidy) and China (90 percent premium subsidy under the National Cooperative Medical Scheme).

The reliance of EAP countries on general revenues to finance coverage expansion is not unusual. Globally,
with the move toward UHC, entitlement to health coverage is being delinked from employment and direct
contributions from users generally. The share of the budget devoted to health typically increases substantially
during periods of rapid expansion, sometimes with a time lag after the policy commitment is made (figure
II.B.9).

fiscal sustainability in EAP. These are reasonable concerns given that the region faces numerous challenges
in containing health care costs due to population aging, the growing burden of NCDs, and inefficiencies in the
health systems. High-level policy commitments to expand coverage will only add to these fiscal pressures.

Rapid population aging implies simultaneously coping with rising health expenditures and a
diminishing revenue base.

EAP is one of the most rapidly aging regions of the world. The implications of this for government budgets,
on both the revenue and expenditure side, are discussed in Part II.A of the report, “Healthy and Productive
                              ”
Aging in East Asia and Pacific.



NCDs are now the biggest health challenge facing the EAP region and are expected to drive up
health care demand and expenditures.

NCDs (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and chronic respiratory conditions) caused 76 percent
of deaths in EAP in 2008, and this figure is expected to rise to 85 percent by 2030. NCDs are generally
diseases of slow progression and long duration. The initial onset of many NCDs occurs at increasingly younger
ages in EAP , implying longer years lived with chronic conditions and disability and greater demand for health
care. In older ages, NCDs are associated with co-morbidities that interact with each other and complicate
approaches to treatment and care.

Underlying these trends is growing exposure to risk factors, with the poor more vulnerable than others.
Between 1990 and 2010, premature death and disability owing to NCD-related risk factors such as high salt
intake, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and blood sugar increased everywhere in the world, but the increase
was relatively more in EAP . Key risk factors such as smoking are more prevalent among the poor. The poor are
also affected by their inability to access or afford preventive services and treatment. Late diagnosis owing to
delays in seeking care means more chronic illness and complications. The economic impact of ill health on
low-income households can be substantial, creating a vicious cycle that forces people deeper into poverty and
perpetuates illness.

EAP countries and their health systems are ill-equipped to respond to the rapid rise of the NCD challenge
in the region. Adequately responding to NCDs requires a life-course perspective to health care, which involves
reduction of behavioral risk factors at all ages and increased early detection and management of the disease.
Health system weaknesses are discussed in the next section. What makes the NCD challenge unique is that
compared to higher-income countries, lower- and middle-income EAP countries face higher levels of NCD at
earlier stages of their development and with relatively fewer resources at their disposal. The costs of treating
NCDs will be enormous for both governments and health care users. The poor are particularly vulnerable since
they are more likely to incur impoverishing OOP spending because of the higher cost and longer duration of
treatment for NCDs.



Most EAP countries are characterized by low-value, high-cost health systems that pose multiple
challenges to cost containment

EAP health systems are generally characterized by low-value, high-cost service delivery structures that
are hospital-centric, with preventive and primary care services ineffective and of poor quality (         figure
II.B.10 and figure II.B.11). Too often better health is incorrectly attributed to more consultations/admissions,
drugs, and procedures. Meanwhile, too little attention is paid to the prevention, early diagnosis, treatment,
and control of health conditions. As discussed above, this is particularly detrimental to the treatment and

control of NCDs. Once a diagnosis is made, care is rarely coordinated across provider levels, resulting in
service duplication and lack of continuity. Health care is often sought too late, leading to high-cost treatment in
expensive acute care hospitals. The lack of effective referrals, gatekeeping, and post-discharge care contributes
to costly (and avoidable) admissions. Moreover, incentives embedded in provider payment systems encourage
physicians to overprovide services or provide unnecessary care. Finally, there is a lack of effective quality
assurance mechanisms to ensure that health care provided is evidence-based, clinically effective, and also
cost-effective.

Together these factors result in overprovision of potentially clinically ineffective treatments at
inappropriate levels of care, which drive up costs not only for the government but also for households.
It is the main reason why out-of-pocket spending has continued to grow despite increases in health insurance
coverage, and why containing costs is proving difficult in many EAP countries.



More resources will be needed to deliver on UHC policy commitments.

Most countries face an unfinished agenda with regard to coverage for the informal sector. Given the
persistence of informality in labor markets, the challenges of enrolling and collecting contributions from
informal sector workers are likely to continue. Thus, there is no alternative to fully subsidizing enrollment by the
informal sector, as for the poor. The informal sector also includes the near-poor, who remain at risk for financial
catastrophe owing to health care costs, making it imperative to extend coverage to these groups.

Moreover, much of the emphasis to date has been on achieving universal enrollment in health insurance.
Increased enrollment coverage does not always imply a reduction in out-of-pocket costs (figure II.B.11). Nor
does enrollment mean effective access to needed, good quality health services. There are large variations
within countries in the level and quality of human resources and diagnostic and treatment capacity at health
facilities, with poor and/or rural regions worse off, as shown in figure II.B.12 for the treatment of NCDs in
Indonesia.

A transformation of the delivery system is needed in most countries if they are to make significant
progress toward UHC. This would be aimed at strengthening primary care services, shifting care away from
acute care hospitals, reducing overprovision, and improving coordination among providers. The quality of the
health workforce needs to be substantially improved. While these reforms will help contain costs in the long
term, in the medium term they will require additional budgetary spending.

Delivering on UHC commitments implies not just universal enrollment, but also improving financial
protection and ensuring access to good quality services. In Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, it
is estimated that additional government expenditures of at least 1 to 2 percent of GDP will be needed over
the next few years to significantly increase all dimensions of health care coverage. This includes the costs
of transforming the service delivery system to ensure that good quality, effective primary care services are
available to the entire population.

Delivering on the region’s UHC commitments will inevitably require more fiscal resources. However, cost
drivers inherent in the system could make the drive to UHC fiscally unsustainable. The next sections provide a
range of policy options for expanding the fiscal space for health, including through cost containment.




Policy Options to Increase Fiscal Space for UHC


There are two complementary approaches to generate fiscal space for health:      (a) increasing the budgetary
allocation through reprioritization of health within the budget and levying additional, potentially earmarked,
taxes; and (b) securing better value for money from existing resources through better cost containment.

                                                   New revenues for health

Excise tax revenues such as those on tobacco and alcohol (“sin taxes”) merit further exploration. In
the Philippines, a marked increase in tobacco and alcohol excise taxes, coupled with earmarking for UHC
(specifically, for the health insurance premiums of the poor), increased the national Department of Health’s
budget from US$1.3 billion to US$2.1 billion during 2013–15, and the number of families with government-
subsidized health insurance from 5.2 million to 14.7 million. The Philippines’ experience is notable for two
reasons: the very large share of revenues earmarked for health (around 85 percent of incremental revenues),
and revenues that are earmarked for the government’s UHC initiative rather than for broader health promotion
(as in Thailand, for instance). Besides tobacco and alcohol, consumption taxes are also levied on other unhealthy
food and drinks, for instance in Pacific Islands countries. Such “sin taxes” have the added attractiveness of
addressing unhealthy diets and behaviors.

Other consumption taxes used to finance health around the world, but not yet widely used in EAP                ,
include value-added tax (VAT) levies, taxes on mobile phone services, and financial transactions. Ghana
is well-known for the 2.5 percent VAT levy that is earmarked for the National Health Insurance Scheme: the levy
complements insurance premium payments and a top-up subsidy from government funds. Taxes on the mobile
phone industry are another potential source of revenue given the growth of mobile phone use in the region.
Gabon, for instance, funds a good share of the health insurance for the poor through a 10 percent tax on mobile
phone companies’ turnover (Humphreys 2013).

All of these examples involve earmarking revenues for health, which is controversial. Earmarking protects
financing for health and increases its apparent predictability. However, earmarking introduces rigidities into the
budgeting process, is limited in what it can raise, and the predictability of financing may be illusory. Since money

is fungible, even when excise taxes are earmarked for particular expenditures, the “additional” revenues may
simply replace general budgetary funding (Bird and Jun 2007). In the case of consumption taxes, revenues are
vulnerable to changes in consumption patterns. Still, tying increases in taxes to health benefits can help make
unpopular tax increases palatable and partially compensate for the presumed regressivity of consumption
taxes.



Securing better value for money

Mobilizing general revenues to finance all of the UHC policy commitments is not sustainable. Coverage
expansion, rise in NCDs, and population aging will drive up health care demand and expenditures in future.
Meanwhile, the current systems of financing and delivering health care are often inefficient. Funneling additional
public resources into inefficient health systems is clearly not fiscally sustainable. Three areas where significant
efficiency savings could be gained in the short to medium term are discussed below.



                                                Paying providers

Provider payment reforms are needed to move away from the perverse incentive structures that
encourage overprovision of services and overcharging for care in EAP           . The latter is a consequence of
having fee-for-service payment mechanisms without budget caps or other mechanisms to contain costs.
Provider payment systems need to be designed to address the specific policy issues and objectives inherent
in the health sector. Global experience with payment reforms points toward reimbursing hospitals on the basis
of expected costs for clinically defined episodes of care, and reimbursing primary care providers a “lump sum”
per patient regardless of how many services the patient receives.



                                         Purchasing pharmaceuticals

Inefficiencies in purchasing pharmaceuticals result in high prices being paid for drugs, driving up costs
for both the government and users. The price of common statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs critical for
pharmacological management of cardiovascular disease) varies significantly across countries (table II.B.2). For
the same common statins that are off-patent, Vietnam pays considerably more than Sri Lanka, Thailand, and
even New Zealand. The current procurement system in Vietnam is highly decentralized and complex, involving
more than 1,000 entities, resulting in wide differentials in the prices of medicines, often for the same type,
dosage, and formulation across hospitals and supplies. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health in Sri Lanka and the
National Health Security Office in Thailand have virtual monopsony power in procuring drugs because they buy
on behalf of a large number of hospitals in each case, and are able to secure exceptionally low prices.

The EAP region can learn from pharmaceutical purchasing strategies used in other countries to reduce
drug prices. These include risk-sharing arrangements for high-cost drugs, such as price-volume arrangements
where the manufacturer pays for any volume over the agreed threshold; sole-source tendering, where the
winning bidder is the sole supplier for a fixed term; and therapeutic reference pricing, where the purchasers
set fixed reimbursement levels for the price of drugs by referencing a base drug within that therapeutic class.

                                             Prioritizing among available interventions and technologies

Reining in the adoption and diffusion of new technologies is critical for controlling health expenditure
growth. The lack of appropriate measures to prioritize among new technologies has already resulted in rapid
growth in health technology spending in the EAP region. In China, for instance, the medical device market grew
from US$8 billion to US$20 billion during 2006–11, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.1 percent,
exceeding even the pace of total health expenditures (CAGR 18 percent) (Le Deu et al. 2012). In recent years,
new technologies have been dominated by costly product innovations in health care. In aging populations, this
can be a significant cost driver.

Many OECD countries have introduced explicit prioritization systems, through health technology
assessments (HTAs) that transparently assess the value for money of new technologies. HTAs constitute
a systematic and transparent appraisal and deliberation process to make decisions on the public reimbursement
of medical technologies, devices, and procedures. For instance, New Zealand's pharmaceutical management
agency has been highly successful at keeping costs down over a 12-year period by combining HTAs with
strengthened pharmaceutical procurement (figure II.B.14). Developing national capacity to undertake HTAs is
costly and takes years. Meanwhile, EAP countries could start off by instituting transparent and evidence-based
processes for prioritizing among new technologies and drugs, using the findings from more established HTA
agencies to inform prioritization.

Conclusion


If implemented effectively, UHC-motivated reforms can reduce a key source of vulnerability, preventing
millions from falling into poverty due to catastrophic health expenditure. This is particularly pertinent
in a region where large segments of the population remain vulnerable to impoverishment. UHC can help
reduce health-related inequalities and is a means for building human capital and sustaining future economic
growth. Lack of financial protection has also been an important reason for high rates of precautionary savings
by households, which are inefficient and welfare reducing. Having made the policy commitment to UHC, it is
important that UHC programs are financed and implemented in a financially sustainable and effective manner.
Otherwise, they risk becoming an excessive burden on future public finances, crowding out spending on other
important sectors, and threatening future growth prospects. Given the significant political momentum behind
them, UHC commitments could also become political liabilities, should popular expectations not be met.

What then must EAP countries do to ensure that UHC commitments do not turn into economic and
political liabilities? General revenue financing has played a critical role to date, and will continue to be important.
Experience from across the world shows that delinking entitlement to health coverage from employment and
users’ direct contributions generally is key to ensuring that the poor, near-poor, and informal sector workers are
enrolled. The only way to do this is to fully subsidize coverage through general revenues. Delivering on UHC
commitments implies not just universal enrollment, but also improving financial protection and ensuring access
to good quality services. All of this will put further pressure on public budgets, exacerbated by other cost drivers
such as population aging, NCDs, and inefficiencies in the health systems. To increase fiscal space for health and
ensure that the drive to UHC is fiscally sustainable, governments will not only have to expand the revenue base
for health, but also secure greater value from existing resources through better cost containment.

II.C.	 Manufacturing Relocation in China1


As China’s economy matures, it is bound to shed its global dominance in labor-intensive and low-technology
manufacturing in favor of the low- and other middle-income economies in the developing world. However,
international trade data show that the migration of low-end export production from China has not occurred
to the extent and with the speed that many expected. In part, China has responded to rising costs in
its manufacturing hub on the eastern coast by enabling industrial relocation both to other regions in the
country, and to other areas within the eastern coastal region, where costs are lower. Further, China retains
significant advantages in terms of labor productivity, a favorable investment climate, robust logistics,
superior infrastructure, and a relatively large domestic market. For developing EAP       , making progress in
these areas will prove critical to succeeding in the competition for industrial activity.

As China’s economy matures, the country has long been expected to shed its dominance of labor-
intensive and low-technology manufacturing. As excess labor from the rural and agricultural pool declines,
labor costs in the urban and industrial sector rise, and manufacturing firms upgrade and move up the industrial
value chain, traditional industrial sectors will come under increasing pressure and will relocate to the low- and
other middle-income economies in East Asia and Pacific (EAP) and elsewhere in the developing world.

And yet, international trade data show that the migration of low-end export production from China’s
industrial base in the eastern coastal region to developing EAP’s export processing zones has not
occurred to the extent and with the speed that many expected. China’s global market share in traditional
labor-intensive products—textiles, apparel, and footwear—remains high relative to the competition from

developing areas, despite recent gains by low- and middle-income countries in EAP (Vietnam and Indonesia),
as well as in South Asia (India and Bangladesh), and Europe and Central Asia (Turkey) (figure II.C.1).

Moreover, as China has moved up the value chain, it has significantly outpaced developing EAP in
the manufacture and export of high-technology products. This is particularly evident in computers,
telecommunications equipment, and electrical machinery, including their parts and components (figure II.C.2;
see also East Asia and Pacific Economic Update, April 2014). In electrical machinery, the greater competition
has recently come from EAP’s newly industrialized economies (principally the Republic of Korea; Singapore;
and Taiwan, China). Overall, a recent analysis of China’s global manufacturing value chain concludes that it has
increased in length, but in particular that imports have moved upstream, while exports on average have not
moved downstream (figure II.C.3; see also Chor 2014). This suggests that China may be performing some new
high value-added downstream activities, but is not necessarily shedding lower value-added upstream activities.

ADJUSTING TO A CHANGING WORLD
80  |      PART II. MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT AGENDA




China has sought to manage the challenges posed by rising labor costs, environmental damage, and
congestion in its manufacturing hub on the eastern coast by enabling industrial relocation both to other
regions in the country and to other areas within the eastern coastal region. There, costs are lower and
firms can profitably expand. As a result, manufacturing of labor-intensive, low-technology products has been
discouraged from migrating elsewhere to developing EAP   .

The eastern coastal region2 remains China’s economic and industrial center        (figure II.C.4). It accounted for
half of GDP and industrial production, two-fifths of fixed investment, more than half of foreign direct investment
(FDI), and more than four-fifths of merchandise exports in 2013. The region also accounted for two-fifths of the
(registered) working-age population and almost two- fifths of wage employment in 2013.

Underlying this has been the strong performance of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) economic zone in
Guangdong province. Its rapid growth began with the transformative “opening and reform” of the Chinese
economy in 1979. It was given further impetus by the integration of the PRD with Hong Kong SAR, China; the
emergence of Guangzhou as the country’s leading trade fair center; and the rise of Shenzhen, next to Hong
Kong SAR, China, as both a financial services and a global and regional sourcing center, with the fourth largest
container port in the world. The greater PRD economic zone (which includes Hong Kong) has been able to
leverage Hong Kong’s advantage in logistics, finance, and other producer services to propel it into the ranks
of the world’s largest economies (Chen and Unteroberdoerster 2008). Industry clusters in both labor-intensive
products3 and high-technology products4 have enabled the region to increase the degree of concentration and
specialization of both downstream and upstream industries.

The inland regions have also started making gains in the electrical and electronics industries      (figure

central, western, and northeastern regions now account for more than 25 percent of output, compared to about
15 percent in 2005. Industry clusters have emerged of late in household appliances in Hefei, in Anhui province
in the central region, and in measuring instruments in Dandong, in Liaoning province in the northeastern region.
Both have figured in lists of the country’s top 100 industrial centers.




...and Agglomeration


Even more significant than the relocation of industrial activity to the inland regions has been the movement
of firms within both regions and provinces,5 in support of industrial specialization and agglomeration
objectives. As China’s industries advance closer to the production possibility frontier, economic growth is
increasingly associated with the ability to take advantage of higher economic concentration (agglomeration),
greater economies of scale (specialization), and more efficient allocation of factors of production (mobility).

Industrial agglomeration has increased steadily in China,6 with a significant, positive impact on
productivity. Agglomeration has allowed firms to exploit economies of scale arising from being near other
producers of similar products (localization economies) and from being close to producers of a wide range
of products and services (urbanization economies). For instance, in the textile sector, increased spatial
concentration in the southeastern coastal region enabled firms to benefit from close proximity to large markets.7
More broadly, industrial agglomeration has led firms to increase their size and reap greater economies of scale,
and to co-locate with a number of larger firms, rather than simply clustering with a larger number of firms (Li,
Lu, and Wu 2012).

Economies of scale from agglomeration vary across industries and city sizes: smaller cities tend to
specialize in mature industries, larger cities in services and high-skill industries.8 Improved infrastructure
and transportation also allow firms to become more specialized and to exploit economies of scale not associated
with agglomeration. Such internal economies of scale arise as firms purchase intermediate inputs at volume
discounts, the fixed costs of operating a plant are spread over a larger volume of production, and managers learn
to operate a plant more efficiently. But as cities become larger, they benefit less from industrial agglomeration,
and can indeed face severe agglomeration diseconomies, since residents in bigger cities are burdened with
congestion and higher living costs for housing, food, and public services (Fujita and Ogagwa 1982; Henderson
2002; Muth 1969).

As a result, maturing industries, especially in manufacturing, have started to move out of the largest
cities in China over the last decade. Manufacturing has also started to shift out of prefecture-level cities and
into counties, where the share of national manufacturing employment grew from 41 percent to 50 percent
from 2000 to 2010. As a result, services account for a higher share of economic activity in the larger cities. In


5	   In particular, out of old core into new emerging economic zones, and out of first- and second-tier and into third- and fourth-tier prefecture-level cities and counties
     (cities are classified according to their socioeconomic importance; first-tier cities are the largest in terms of their economic importance and population size).
6	   As measured by the Ellison-Glaeser Index, using firm-level data from 1998–2005 (Lu and Tao 2009). However, it remains much lower than in leading advanced
     economies, such as the United States, France, and the United Kingdom.
7	   Based on an analysis of more than 22,000 textile firms from 2000 to 2005 (see Lin, Li, and Yang 2011).
8	   Evidence from other countries shows that geographic clustering is more pronounced in high-skill and high-technology industries (such as electronic computing
     machinery, process control instruments, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals) than in light industries (such as textiles or food) (see Glaeser 1995; and Henderson
     1997).

2011, services accounted for 66 percent of GDP in the largest cities (15 million or more people), but only about
33 percent in smaller cities (with fewer than 1 million people). Assembling integrated computers, which is
becoming a mature industry, has become less concentrated. Producing steel, which benefits from economies
of scale, remains fairly evenly dispersed across provinces. That is explained in part by a legacy of central
planning and state ownership. Before the 1980s, remote inland sites were favored for key sectors, such as iron
and steel production, and spatial clustering was discouraged (Fan and Scott 2003). The rising prices of land and
housing also influence the choice of location of industries (Fan and Shao 2011).

In the dominant eastern coastal region, new economic zones have emerged to promote industrialization
into higher-value-added manufacturing. The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) special economic zone, counting on
a vast heavily industrialized interior with advanced transport infrastructure facilities, including airports, ports,
expressways, and highways, specializes in more technology-intensive industries that rely on more skilled
production workers than the PRD, whose industrial activity relies on processing trades, such as logistics,
based on exports and on labor-intensive industries employing semiskilled and unskilled labor (Fang, Wang, and
Yue 2012).9 In addition, the Bohai Economic Rim (BER), in the northern end of the eastern coast, has emerged
as a third economic zone to rival the YRD and the PRD. The BER, traditionally involved in heavy industries, has
become a significant growth cluster for the automobile, electronics, and petrochemical sectors.10

Even within existing zones, agglomeration has been associated with significant relocation to smaller
cities. For instance, in Guangdong, the prefecture-level border cities Heyuan, in the northeast of the province,
and Qingyuan, in the northwest, have gained from further specialization in the core PRD cities (Zhang 2009).
In particular, nonmetal mining products and nonferrous metallurgy in Qingyuan, and electrical machinery and
electronics in Heyuan, expanded significantly as a result of their relocation from other PRD cities.




Drivers of Relocation


The changing industrial geography in China reflects the interplay of numerous factors that influence the
location decisions of industrial firms. Rising labor, land, energy, and environmental costs, particularly in the
eastern coastal region and in the hub prefecture-level cities of special economic zones, are giving industrial
firms reason to consider alternative locations (figure II.C.7). However, agglomeration economies, but also more
favorable investment climates, continue to wed industrial firms to their traditional strategic locations.




9	   For instance, Nanjing, in Jiangsu province in the YRD, is a hub for the automobile and electronics industries, and for the energy, and iron and steel industries.
     Suzhou, also in Jiangsu, is a strong manufacturing base for foreign firms in the electronics industry (in particular, circuit boards and information technology
     products). Ningbo, in Zhejiang province, also specializes in electronics (especially household electronic appliances). And Shanghai is dominant not only in finance,
     banking, and logistics, but also in automobiles.
10	 For instance, Tianjin is strong in aviation, logistics, and shipping. Beijing has strong petrochemical, education, and R&D industries. Shenyang, in Liaoning province,
    is a cluster for the automotive, aircraft, and software industries. Dalian, also in Liaoning province, attracts foreign investments in manufacturing. And Qingdao, in
    Shandong province, is strong in health services.

ADJUSTING TO A CHANGING WORLD
86  |     PART II. MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT AGENDA




Government Policy: Intervention and Distortion


Comparative intraregional costs are not the sole consideration affecting firm location decisions in China:
market signals are muted by a broad system of mandates, incentives, and subsidies offered by the
national and local governments to shape the country’s industrial geography. Since the onset of economic
reforms in 1979, and beginning with the creation of two special economic zones in Guangdong province in
the same year, the national government has been active not just in designating certain regions and zones
as preferred locations for particular industries and industrial clusters, but more importantly in developing the
requisite infrastructure, offering incentives, and extending subsidies (loans from development banks and tax
breaks) for foreign and domestic investment to locate in the preferred areas.

Efforts to direct industrial migration to, and support broader economic development in, the inland
regions is guided by framework plans which have since been adopted as national development strategies
beginning in the late 1990s.11 Twenty-nine destinations were designated by the Ministry of Commerce
(MOCOM) as industrial relocation sites in the central and western regions by 2008. With infrastructure
development a centerpiece of government efforts to spur economic activity in the inland regions, fixed asset
investment in the central and western regions accounted for half of the country’s total in 2013, compared to a
third in 1999 (figure II.C.8). Meanwhile, FDI into the inland regions accounted for almost half of all FDI into the
country in 2013, compared to a fourth in 1999.

Local governments have been no less active than the central government in enticing certain industries
and firms to locate in economic zones, industrial parks, science parks, and “urban agglomeration” and
“demonstration” areas within their jurisdictions, and conversely, in requiring enterprises that do not
fit into their regional industrial plans to migrate to other locations. For instance, Guangdong province
earmarked RMB 40 billion in spending over 2008–12 (1.1 percent of 2008 provincial GDP) for its “Double

Relocation Strategy. ”12 The funds were used to acquire land, develop industrial relocation parks, improve urban
transport infrastructure, and train labor in the destination areas, and to set up an “award fund” to encourage
relocation. Zhejiang province, also in the eastern coastal region, used firm screening and technological and
environmental standard setting to spur the relocation of low-end manufacturing, high energy-consuming, and
heavy pollution-emitting firms to alternative locations in the central and western regions of the country (Wei
and Bai 2014). Meanwhile, cities and provinces designated as preferred relocation destinations in the central
and western regions of the country are competing aggressively against each other to win over industrial firms
migrating from the eastern coastal region.13

Measures to upgrade infrastructure, improve government services, and enhance the investment climate
are all legitimate tools that local governments can employ to attract investment; in contrast, subsidies,
commonly in the form of concessional finance and tax breaks, are suboptimal and likely to prove
distortionary. In principle, the authorities should allow agglomeration economies and congestion costs to
more freely determine the location and relocation of industrial activity within China. Market forces should
enable manufacturing and export firms to find suitable locations that extend China’s comparative advantage in
labor-intensive and low-technology products.




Implications for Developing EAP


Unit labor costs have increased sharply in China in recent years, reducing its competitiveness vis-à-vis
the rest of developing EAP     (figure II.C.9). Indeed, average manufacturing wages are now higher than in the
rest of the region (figure II.C.10, left panel). However, so is average manufacturing productivity (figure II.C.10,

Labor costs are not the sole driver of location decisions. China has been able to compensate for higher
labor costs with a favorable investment climate, robust logistics, superior infrastructure, and a relatively large
domestic market.

China’s investment climate is relatively favorable, compared to potential alternative industrial locations.
For instance, regulatory quality is relatively high, particularly in the areas of registering property and enforcing
contracts, compared to other developing countries with the potential to develop labor-intensive, low-technology
manufacturing (table II.C.1).

Relatedly, China has invested heavily in infrastructure compared to the rest of developing EAP        . Container
port traffic by China was almost four times greater in 2012 than in 2000, and air transport traffic 53 times
greater (figure II.C.12). China increased its rail routes by 7,600 kilometers over the same period, while the rest
of developing EAP barely added to them. Paved roads accounted for 64 percent of all roads by 2011, up from
44 percent in 2000, and electric power consumption increased by 230 percent during this period.

T
investment climate will prove critical in the competition for that industrial activity that will increasingly come

II.D.	 ASEAN Integration in Services1


While the ASEAN economies grew rapidly over the last four decades primarily as manufacturing and
exporting powers, the role of the services sector and services trade has grown increasingly important over
the last decade. Since services (such as finance, transport, telecoms, professional services, education)
are key inputs in modern economies, increasing competitiveness in services through trade will be
necessary for ASEAN economies to sustain growth as they become mature, middle-income economies.
Services integration provides large potential for gains as well as challenges. Recognizing this, ASEAN
countries have committed to services integration, particularly through liberalization, as part of forming the
ASEAN Economic Community at the end of 2015. However, ASEAN countries currently fall well short in
implementation of these commitments, impeded by the uneven quality of regulations among the member
countries. Policy data suggest that ASEAN is still one of the most restrictive regions in the world with
respect to trade in services, and that despite commitments, actual policies provide modest preferential
treatment to ASEAN Member States. This note suggests that ASEAN’s services integration process
needs to be strengthened in several ways that would increase focus on implementation of commitments.
The key priority here will be promoting regulatory cooperation and coordination through harmonization
or mutual recognition, and the development of regulatory capacity, which includes cooperation among
regulatory bodies, the exchange of information for regulatory purposes, and sharing the experiences of
regulatory reforms.




The Importance of Services


While the economies of the Association for Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)2 grew rapidly over the
last four decades primarily as manufacturing and exporting powers, the role of the services sector and
services trade has expanded over the last decade. Services accounted for more than 40 percent of total
value added and employment in 2012 (figure II.D.1). Trade in services has more than doubled since 2005 (figure
II.D.2). Many of these services, such as finance, transportation, and communication, are backbone services
that feed into other production processes. Trade in and growth of these services can help firms gain access to
better quality and more diverse inputs at lower costs and thereby boost productivity across the economy.

The services growth and trade agenda will become even more important for ASEAN countries in the
future as they climb up the ranks of middle-income countries and confront what has been called the
“middle-income trap”   (Aiyar et al. 2013; Eichengreen, Park, and Shin 2013; Gill and Kharas 2007). Eight of
the 10 ASEAN countries are middle-income countries, and the two others are on the verge of becoming so.
But, worldwide, only 14 countries have managed to grow from middle-income to high-income countries since
1960. Research suggests that when countries reach per capita incomes of around purchasing power parity

(PPP) US$10,000 to US$11,000, or again between PPP US$15,000 to US$16,000, their growth slows markedly
(Eichengreen, Park, and Shin 2013). This failure to make the transition is because most middle-income countries
are unable to boost their productivity adequately to remain competitive as their wages increase. Most middle-
income countries are unable to innovate and diversify their economies to more productive manufacturing and
services. As a result, on one side, middle-income countries are outcompeted in traditional sectors by other
developing countries where wages are low. On the other side, the middle-income countries cannot compete
with high-income economies where productivity and technological sophistication are much higher. Increasing
the productivity and competitiveness of the services sector will be central because services—transport,
finance, health, education, research, and professional services—are essential inputs for increasing innovation
and productivity in all sectors of an economy.

The formation of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) at the end of 2015 also offers new opportunities
for developing services and services trade among ASEAN economies. Aware of the potential gains from
services, ASEAN economies have made integrating services a key part of the AEC. The services integration
agenda in the region was first institutionalized through the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services, signed as
early as 1995. The ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint (AEC Blueprint) adopted in 2007 went considerably
further by providing a bold vision of deep integration where goods, services, investment, and skilled labor
would move freely across the borders of ASEAN countries by 2015. The AEC will help create a single market
of more than 600 million people and US$2.3 trillion of gross domestic product (GDP) with free flow of trade in
goods and services. There is considerable potential for realizing gains from trade in services among ASEAN’s
members (Plummer and Yue 2009; ERIA 2012; ASEC and World Bank 2013). While the region generally tends
to underperform in services production and trade for their level of development, a few ASEAN economies have
already emerged as highly competitive suppliers and exporters of services, as discussed below. The potential
of the region in services is underscored by the foreign direct investment (FDI) the services sector has been able
to attract, which accounts for more than 50 percent of total ASEAN FDI.

This note discusses progress made in the services integration agenda and the challenges facing the
ASEAN countries. (ASEAN and World Bank, Forthcoming 2015). The note discusses the performance of ASEAN
economies in services output and trade; the impact of current policies on trade and integration in services; and
the challenges ASEAN economies face as they try to integrate services.

ASEAN Economies Underperform in the Services Sector


With a few exceptions, ASEAN countries' performance in services has run contrary to trends in most of
the world. Their share of services in GDP  , for instance, has remained unchanged or even declined, with the
exceptions of the Philippines, Singapore, and Lao PDR (figure II.D.3). Moreover, while most ASEAN countries
are quite open to goods trade, services trade lags behind. The East Asia and Pacific region (including China,
Mongolia, and Timor-Leste, in addition to the ASEAN countries) lags behind the other regions in services trade
openness compared to goods trade openness (figure II.D.4). Given the rapid pace of integration of ASEAN
economies into the global trading system and the intensifying pace of free trade agreement negotiations, it
would be timely now for ASEAN member countries to deepen and widen services integration both within the
region and with the rest of the world. Local services providers will be able to take advantage of new market
openings and to benefit from new ideas and processes arising out of the opening up of trade.

While trade in services has also grown rapidly in ASEAN countries, it did not exceed GDP growth, unlike
in other middle-income and emerging economies. As a result, the share of services exports in GDP did not
increase noticeably between 1996 and 2012, with the exception of Cambodia, the Philippines, and Singapore.
In addition, while services trade growth in the region is significant, it still lags behind other sectors. Further,
ASEAN members mainly export “traditional services” such as transportation, and travel and tourism services,
and have been less successful in tapping into new services opportunities such as information technology (IT)
and business-related services. The Philippines (in the business process outsourcing sector) and Singapore (in
professional services) are exceptions to this.

There is considerable heterogeneity, however, across countries at the subsectoral level of performance,
which suggests the potential for developing services trade and the gains from trade. Indonesia’s and
Thailand’s exports show significant increases of trade in traditional services sectors such as transport and
construction, along with some rise in professional services in recent years. Malaysia shows good performance
in computers, information services, and financial services. The Philippines shows a rise in other professional
services and insurance. Singapore shows the most diversified growth, dominated by financial services.

The participation of ASEAN countries in global value chains provides a good opportunity for developing
services through trade. These economies have traditionally been strong in contract manufacturing, particularly
for electronics, serving as vital export nodes for production. This experience in participating in manufacturing
global value chains (GVCs) provides a basis for sustaining growth and economic development through using the
GVC in services. The role of services in GVCs can thus be viewed from the perspective of creating or engaging
more deeply in GVCs for both goods and services including in the services components of goods GVCs. In
short, ASEAN economies could consider participation in services activities, particularly in high value added
services in GVCs, as a path to sustained development.

If well implemented, the liberalization measures that ASEAN countries have committed to under the
ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS) can assist in transforming the AEC into a global
services hub. There is already a concerted push for ASEAN economies to realize the goal of regional economic
integration and make the services sector within ASEAN more efficient. Under the Framework Agreement of
Priority Integration Sectors, signed in 2004, eleven priority sectors were identified for fast-tracking regional
integration, four of which are services-oriented: e-ASEAN, air travel, tourism and healthcare. Logistics was
added as the 12th priority sector two years later, in 2006. These sectors serve as strategic inputs to all other
sectors in the regional economy, both goods and services. To realize this potential gain from services, however,
ASEAN countries will have to undertake services trade policy reforms to address the high barriers to services
trade.




Liberalizing Highly Restrictive Services Trade Policies


A first glance at the data suggests that while the AFAS has made progress beyond the General Agreement
on Trade in Services (GATS) in terms of commitments made by countries to liberalize services trade, it
falls well short of the goals set out under the AEC. Liberalization commitments may be classified as “full,   ”
“partial,” or “unbound” (figure II.D.5). Full commitments reflect the number of services subsectors that have
been committed by ASEAN countries to not have any market access or national treatment discrimination or
restrictions against foreign suppliers. Unbound commitments refer to the number of subsectors that have no
commitments in either market access or national treatment. ASEAN Member States have almost doubled the
aggregate number of subsectors committed for opening—expanding it from 35 percent to about 65 percent
of covered subsectors. Almost 25 percent of subsectors have been fully opened within the region compared
to only 10 percent at the multilateral level. More important, however, the progress under the AFAS in the first
seven rounds of negotiations is far short of the goal of liberalization established under the AEC Blueprint.

Moreover, despite making progress in committing to liberalize services trade under ASEAN services
trade agreements, ASEAN countries still have generally more restrictive services policies than any other
region in the world except the Gulf States. A survey of actual service trade policies across ASEAN, measured
by the Services Trade Restrictions Index (STRI) carried out by the World Bank (ASEAN and World Bank 2013)
suggests ASEAN countries have more restrictive services policies in general than any other region in the world
except the Gulf States. The average STRI for the region is 60 percent higher than the global average (figure
II.D.6), but restrictiveness of applied policies varies widely across countries and income levels. Cambodia and
Singapore have the most open policies in the sectors covered. Myanmar and Vietnam are virtually open, with
few restrictions, and the rest (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand) have significant restrictions.

Also, despite commitments made under the World Trade Organization (WTO) and AFAS, actual
liberalization by ASEAN countries has been modest in the last four years. While there are some instances
of market opening, there are also instances of reversal of liberalization. For the six ASEAN Member States
for which the same surveys were conducted in 2008, there was little change in the overall policy regime from
2008 to 2012 (regional average STRI fell only about 16 percent from its high level). As a consequence, even
though actual openness is greater than that promised by current AFAS commitments, it is still not close to
the ambitious goals specified in the 2007 AEC Blueprint, especially in the case of Mode 3 trade, that is, in
liberalizing foreign investment (“commercial presence”) in services.

Nor have ASEAN countries made progress toward creating a more regionally integrated market. There
is little evidence that ASEAN economies are more open toward each other in services trade than toward non-
ASEAN countries. For the seven broad sectors (and relevant modes) covered by the STRI survey, this report
found little difference between policy treatment toward intra-ASEAN and extra-ASEAN trading partners. ASEAN
countries therefore received virtually the same treatment as non-preferential or most-favored-nation policies.

There are two areas, however, where there has been some progress in services integration. In air transport,
a priority integration sector, ASEAN countries have taken steps toward regional open skies, while in certain
professional services, mutual recognition agreements have been negotiated and concluded. These initiatives
suggest that regional effort may have had incremental value when focused on areas not being addressed
multilaterally. However, even in these areas, regional integration efforts are still on-going. In professional
services, domestic regulations are still in the process of being aligned with the ASEAN Mutual Recognition
Agreements or Arrangements (MRAs), while some MRAs need to be complemented with further bilateral
negotiations to make them operational. In air transport, further liberalization may be necessary to achieve a
truly integrated regional air market.

How Can the Services Integration Process Be Enhanced?


Going forward, completing the negotiations for achieving the AEC targets will be important, but the
key challenge will be to implement the commitments made under AFAS. This requires strengthening
of institutional and negotiation processes. For instance, one of the major shortcomings under the current
mechanism is the difficulty in monitoring and, where needed, ensuring the implementation of commitments in
services trade. To correct this, it will be critical to strengthen the foundation of the ASEAN services integration
process, AFAS, or any successor agreement. AFAS is closely related to the GATS and follows its main principles,
disciplines, and approach to liberalization, including provisions on market access and national treatment, and a
typology for scheduling commitments. Under these rules, market access commitments prohibit a number of
quantitative restrictions, and the national treatment obligations cover both de jure and de facto discrimination.
A number of measures can be taken to strengthen the services integration process:

 yy The legal scope of AFAS needs to be better clarified. AFAS is based on the rules (disciplines) of the GATS,
    but the extent to which GATS disciplines and their interpretations apply need to be clarified. For example,
    the terms of GATS provisions on market access and national treatment have been interpreted by WTO
    panels and the Appellate Body in several dispute settlement cases. These interpretations help clarify the
    meaning of these provisions in the WTO context. But it is not clear whether such interpretations have any
    significance under the AFAS.

 yy Limitations on market access need to be removed, and discriminatory measures, including caps on foreign
    equity, eliminated. In some cases, public order, safety of services, or prudential reasons in the financial
    sector may justify some restrictions.

 yy Establishing an Implementation Monitoring Mechanism for AFAS that goes beyond the current legal
    compliance monitoring of the AEC scorecard and improving the existing ASEAN dispute settlement
    mechanism will help achieve the full potential of the agreement.

A key task will be to foster regulatory cooperation among ASEAN countries. Regulatory cooperation is
important for integrating the services sector in general, and it is even more so for ASEAN countries because
of their uneven quality of regulations (figure II.D.7), which may impede regional trade and investment. While
trade negotiations and liberation commitments are important, services are provided and traded under domestic
regulations in each country. If the domestic regulatory quality is uneven across countries and if regulations are
not complemented by necessary reforms, services trade liberalization commitments cannot realize their full
potential.

Regulatory cooperation can take place at two different levels of regulation. First, cooperation at a
horizontal level would require establishing common general principles that would guide domestic regulation on
services trade and investment. To begin with, ASEAN Member States should recognize that domestic laws and
regulations should conform to certain principles of good regulation, such as transparency, consultations (both
public and interagency), due process, and efficiency. Even though they may work differently for each mode of
supply, common regulatory principles and harmonization of regulation are key steps for the realization of the
single market in all modes.

Second, more detailed regulatory principles for adoption should be developed on a sectoral basis,
in particular for heavily regulated services. This would follow the steps already taken in ASEAN in some
services, like air transport and some financial services. Other key service sectors that would benefit from
common regional rules may include land and water transport, telecommunications, and professional services.
Regulatory cooperation with regard to company law will facilitate cross-border mobility of services providers.
Following the European Union experience, ASEAN Members States may evaluate addressing basic requirements
for the establishment of companies, including areas like compulsory disclosure of information, and power of
representation of company organs. Requirements on disclosure, in particular, may include the harmonization of
information requirements and establishment of an official company register accessible by all Member States.

ASEAN can also take advantage of the need for regulatory cooperation as an opportunity to build optimal
regulatory areas for services. Such areas are composed of a set of countries whose welfare can potentially be
maximized by regulatory coordination and convergence (Mattoo and Sauvé 2011). While regulatory convergence
is overly ambitious for ASEAN at this point, the benefits of regulatory cooperation would emerge as a result
of creating truly integrated markets and institutional capacity. An optimal regulatory area would lead to the
adoption of similar regulatory principles to enhance regulatory quality. In the ASEAN context, the optimal
regulatory area would imply cooperation in three areas:

 yy Regulatory cooperation, through harmonization or mutual recognition

 yy Harmonization of regulatory principles, in particular regarding the design, adoption, and application of
    regulations

 yy Building of regulatory capacity, which includes cooperation among regulatory bodies, exchange of
    information for regulatory purposes and experiences on regulatory reforms, and identifying and adopting
    good regulatory practices in new areas.

In conclusion, services integration in ASEAN will now require taking a more comprehensive approach
centering on regulatory cooperation. ASEAN has been relatively successful in moving toward service
markets integration, by committing to remove the most significant impediments to trade. However, services

trade policies are embedded in regulations that affect services and foreign services providers. Since regulatory
quality is uneven, there is the potential to reap substantial additional benefits through regulatory cooperation.
Otherwise, while formal integration under AFAS may progress quickly because countries are committed to the
increased incorporation of sectors in their services schedules, the real integration that depends on regulatory
harmonization among ASEAN members will be held up. Overall, services integration in ASEAN will require a
more comprehensive approach that looks at other sectors and regulatory cooperation more broadly than is
currently offered under the AFAS.

these have become more exposed by the end of

transparent, consistent application of the new fuel

Challenges

The outlook is subject to both downside and
upward risks but is likely to be associated with
rising inequality. Further instability in Thailand, a
sharper correction in economic activity in China or
materializing risks in the fiscal and financial sectors
could hurt growth. Despite slowdown in credit
growth, systemic risks in the financial sector are
yet to be addressed. Furthermore, the low level of
reserves undermines the ability to mitigate adverse
shocks. On the other hand, lower oil prices and faster
coming on stream of some hydropower projects
could push growth rates upwards. Continuation of
the current growth pattern would create relatively
few productive jobs, increase inequality and fail
to address critical human development outcomes
where the country is lagging. This may dent further
gains in poverty reduction.

cuts to remain on a consolidation path, over a
fifth of revenues depend on oil, including a yearly
dividend from PETRONAS. If oil prices remain low,
PETRONAS will be hard-pressed to maintain this
dividend, especially if it is to continue its large
investment program. Other risks include weakness
in the global economy that would dampen export
demand, renewed volatility in capital flows, and
the realization of contingent liabilities, which have
increased since the global financial crisis.

Favorable economic prospects will support overall
household income growth. In the near term, falling
palm oil revenues (driven by oil prices and the floods
in late 2014) will pose a challenge to the livelihoods
of smallholders. While the introduction of GST may
impact low-income urban households, most goods
consumed by this group have been exempted or zero-
rated. Labor markets are expected to remain robust
but not buoyant, in line with economic performance.
Therefore, household income growth will remain
on an upward, if somewhat slower, trend, with the
share of the population earning less than US$ 4 per
day expected to decline further.



Challenges

To support long-term growth and boost shared
prosperity, productivity-enhancing reforms are
critical. These include: modernizing social policies
towards income-targeted programs focused on
equality of opportunities; reforming the education
system without increasing public spending;
enhancing competition in the economy and ensuring
the sustainability of public finances by reducing
dependence on energy revenues. Further gains in
reducing inequality and boosting incomes at the
bottom of the distribution hinge on speeding up
these reforms to close skills- and income-based
achievement gaps in education and the labor market.

on health care and the use value of assets, and on
alternative assumptions on adult equivalence scales
and spatial price deflators. Poverty in Myanmar is
largely a rural phenomenon, with at least 70 percent
of the country’s poor living in rural areas.



Challenges

Although growth is expected to remain relatively
strong over the medium-term on the back of
continued structural reforms, downside risks have
also increased. If government spending growth
continues along current trends, Myanmar may face
fiscal sustainability challenges. Although external
public debt is still within sustainability thresholds,
overall public debt sustainability is vulnerable to
lower real GDP growth and fiscal slippages.

This risk is heightened by recent international
commodity price developments. Although the
effects of these have not yet transmitted through to
Myanmar, there is a major risk that natural gas prices
will follow the same trend as oil prices. A sustained
downturn would adversely impact government
revenues and export earnings, and may negatively
affect future investments in the oil and gas sectors.

ADJUSTING TO A CHANGING WORLD

Challenges

Papua New Guinea faces four major macroeconomic
challenges in the near future: (i) improving the
fiscal balance, (ii) financing the budget deficit
and managing the composition of public debt, (iii)
improving the effectiveness of monetary policy, and
(iv) improving exchange rate management.

With the expected implementation of a sovereign
wealth fund in the coming year, a further challenge
for the GoPNG is to ensure that the fund is prudently
administered to maintain macroeconomic stability
and fiscal rectitude.

In the longer term PNG faces the following challenges:
(i) the further diversification of national assets by
investing in both high quality human and physical
capital, (ii) the acceleration of the development of
robust institutions, and (iii) continued integration
into the global economy by capitalizing on PNG’s
respective comparative advantages.

Over the medium to long-term, higher investments
in infrastructure, health, and education are key to
achieving inclusive growth. Overall, the country
has an investment gap (both physical and human
capital) of around 6.8 percent of GDP as of 2014.
Improvements in tax administration (i.e., efficiently
collecting existing taxes) can generate about
3.8 percent of GDP in fiscal space over the medium-
term to finance the investment gap. The balance of
3 percent needs to come from tax policy reforms for
a more equitable, efficient, and simpler tax system.
For example, tax incentives need to be more
targeted, transparent, performance-based, and
temporary. Tax rates and valuations which have not
kept up with inflation need to be adjusted to improve
the equity of the tax system. Reforms to improve
the transparency and accountability of government
spending and to strengthen tax administration are
also essential. Key reforms include passage of the
Freedom of Information Bill, institutionalization of
“open data,  ” which means making government
data publicly available in user-friendly forms, and
enhancing budget reporting to allow the public and
the government itself to track spending.

and regulatory framework conducive to mining,
as well as clear procedures for the acquisition of
land for the exploration and exploitation of natural
resources. Fisheries offer the potential to contribute
to growth and government revenue over the medium-
term if they are sustainably managed. Increasing
productivity in the agricultural sector (and in particular
cocoa and coconut products), which accounts for
16 percent of economic output and employs over
75 percent of the population, has strong potential
to improve living standards. Expected investments
in ICT infrastructure have been subject to delay, and
the impacts of improved ICT infrastructure on overall
growth are not well understood in small dispersed
island contexts such as Solomon Islands. Tourism,
which is projected to increase by 5–6 percent per
year in the Pacific region until 2020, could also
make an important contribution to broad-based
growth. Overall, an outlook involving lower levels
of investment and growth remains possible, with
the baseline reliant on a number of assumptions
regarding policy measures and factors beyond SIG
control. Further, should economic opportunities
remain concentrated in the capital, this may
exacerbate challenges associated with urbanization
and the growth of urban squatter settlements.

by the subdued business confidence. On the
external front, global growth remains sluggish and
