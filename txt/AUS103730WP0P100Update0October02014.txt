                                        Executive Summary
Growth rebounded significantly due to strong industrial recovery aided by growth in investment and
exports. Capital flows are back, signaling growing investor confidence, as inflation has moderated from
double digits, exchange rate has stabilized, and financial sector stress has plateaued. Monetary policy
continuity has been maintained and there has been some progress on fiscal consolidation. With the
economy still below potential and reform momentum picking up, growth is expected to strengthen over
the medium-term. Inflation is expected to decline with monetary policy switching to inflation targeting
while the current account deficit is expected to widen somewhat as import demand and capital inflows
rise. Fiscal consolidation is expected to continue through stronger revenue mobilization. Downside
domestic risks can be offset through accelerated structural reforms.

Supply chain delays and uncertainty are a
major, yet underappreciated, constraint to
manufacturing growth and competitiveness.
Regulatory impediments to the movement of
goods across state borders raise truck transit
times by as much as one quarter, and put Indian
manufacturing      firms    at    a     significant
disadvantage vis-à-vis international competitors.
State border check-points, tasked primarily for
carrying out compliance procedures for the
diverse sales and entry tax requirements of
different states, combine with other delays to
keep trucks from moving during 60 percent of
the entire transit time. Long transit times and
high variability and unpredictability in
shipments add to total logistics costs in the form
of higher-than-optimal buffer stocks and lost
sales, pushing logistics costs in India to two-
three times international benchmarks.

Implementation of the GST, combined with
dismantling of inter-state check-posts, is the
most crucial reform that could improve
competitiveness of India’s manufacturing
sector. The GST offers a unique opportunity to
rationalize and re-engineer logistics networks in
India, given the inherent inefficiencies with
taxes based on the crossing of administrative
boundaries. The GST will free up decisions on
warehousing and distribution from tax
considerations so that operational and logistics
efficiency determines the location and
movement of goods. Freight and logistics
networks will realign according to the location
of production and consumption activities,
creating the hub-and-spoke models that are
needed to improve freight and logistics
performance. Simply halving the delays due to
road blocks, tolls and other stoppages could cut
freight times by some 20-30 percent and
logistics costs by an even higher 30-40 percent.
This would be tantamount to a gain in
competitiveness of some 3-4 percent of net sales
for key manufacturing sectors, helping India
return to a path of high growth and enabling
large-scale job creation.

fastest pace in the past eight quarters, while on a
quarter-over-quarter seasonally adjusted annual

4.2 percent year-over-year after contracting for
two previous quarters and registering an average
growth of 0.7 percent year-over-year since Q1

  Box 1: Key recommendations of the Expert Committee to Revise and Strengthen the Monetary
                                              Policy Framework
The report of the Expert Committee to Revise and Strengthen the Monetary Policy Framework is organized
in four principal parts, each part dealing with the subject of the nominal anchor, the organizational structure
for taking monetary policy decisions, changes to the operating framework, and removing hurdles to monetary
policy transmission. The choice of the CPI (combined) as the nominal anchor is likely to enhance policy
communication and hence expected to more effectively affect inflation expectations and improve monetary
policy transmission. A committee based organizational structure, with enhanced research support, aims at
reducing discretionary policymaking. The operating framework recommendations strive to reduce volatility
and reduce the RBIs role in government financial management. Finally, removing hurdles to policy
transmission are a mix of recommendations for reducing financial market distortions arising out of
government policy and actions and enhancing conventional monetary safeguards in a global context.

Nominal anchor: The report recommends that inflation should be the nominal anchor for monetary policy
framework, measured by the new CPI (Combined) index. The recommended nominal target is 4 +/- 2
percent, to be adopted after a phased inflation reduction plan targeting 8 percent inflation in the first 12
months and 6 percent inflation in the following 12 months. Although close to 50 percent of the weight in the
index pertains to food and fuel—commodities for which monetary policy has limited direct effect—research
suggests that inflation expectations are more closely correlated and tend to persist longer with CPI inflation
than WPI.

Organizational structure: The report proposes that monetary policy decision-making be vested in a five-
member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) composed of the RBI Governor (Chairman), the Deputy
Governor in charge of Monetary Policy (Vice Chairman), and three members: the Executive Director in
charge of Monetary Policy and two external members chose by the Chairman and Vice Chairman. The MPC
will vote on the policy and will be accountable for failing to meet the inflation target for three consecutive
quarters. In order to support MPC decision-making, the RBI’s Monetary Policy Department will be
significantly reorganized to enhance research support.

Operating Framework: The report proposes that the MPC target a positive real policy rate, keeping in mind
the output gap. In Phase I of the implementation of the new framework, the currently used overnight
Liquidity Assessment Facility (LAF) repo rate will continue as the policy rate but it will be restricted to a
specified ratio of bank-wise Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL). Concurrently, as the 14 day term
repo rate stabilizes, it will to be used increasingly to provide liquidity to banks with the aim of transitioning
the 14 day term repo rate as the policy rate. In Phase II, as the 14 day term repo rate gains acceptance, it will
replace the overnight repo rate as the policy rate. The RBI expects that 14 day term repo rate will improve
monetary policy transmission by discouraging the use of the overnight repo rate as the first liquidity
management option by banks thereby assisting in the development of markets that price and hedge risks.
Simultaneously, the MSF rate will be set high enough to be perceived and consequently used as a facility to
be used only in exceptional circumstances.

The framework also proposes that debt and cash management of the government to be under the Government
and not the RBI, and instruments such as the Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS), Cash Management Bills
(CMB), and Sector-specific refinancing will be phased out. Finally, the framework suggests reducing the
Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) in keeping with BASEL III framework, minimizing government intervention
in commercial banks, detaching open market operations from fiscal operations, and having greater forex
reserves and instruments to deal with inflows and outflows.



Bank profitability continues to be under                    on equity declined in FY2014 as banks faced
pressure even as authorities roll out a large               lower profitability coupled with fresh capital

at the end of the previous fiscal. Under these
conditions, the ability of Indian banks to service
large volumes of low-income customers, as
envisaged under the recently launched
comprehensive financial inclusion campaign
(see section 1.6), may be limited by several
factors such as the burden of bad loans, lower
profitability, need for higher capital, and
existing priority sector obligations.

of Uttar Pradesh requires trucks that pass
through the state (i.e., not for delivering goods
within the state but using the state roads to
transit through to their destination) to declare
their planned route. Reportedly, truck drivers
frequently change their routes for practical
reasons, such as to avoid traffic jams or
congestion on the declared route. However, the
fear of penalty levied for deviating from the
declared route encourages truck drivers to speed
with potential adverse consequences for road

progressively move towards the Landlord
Model, adapted to their own circumstances and
port development plans, but encouraging private
sector investment and participation in the port’s
terminal activities by lease and/or concession.
With regard to intermodal transport, a
comprehensive intermodal surface transport
policy which creates a platform for efficient and
reliable freight and logistics services could be
the missing link in linking investments in freight
corridors, increased private sector involvement
in ports, and revitalization of inland waterways.

The potential gains of more efficient and
reliable supply chains are enormous. Simply
halving the delays due to road blocks, tolls and
other stoppages could cut freight times by some
20-30 percent, and logistics costs by even more,
as much as 30-40 percent. This would be
tantamount to a gain in competitiveness of some
3-4 percent of net sales for key manufacturing
sectors, helping India return to a path of high
growth and enabling large-scale job creation.
