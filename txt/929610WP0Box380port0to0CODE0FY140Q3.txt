II. Evaluation Capacity Development and Learning

   Learning and Knowledge Sharing:

   IEG held an internal launch seminar for World Bank Group staff for its evaluation on the Global
   Environment Facility (GEF).

   Readership of the IEG blog “What Works” continued to grow with evidence of greater engagement
   on the part of visitors. IEG’s presence on social media platforms has substantially increased as the
   result of our increased staffing and focus on social media..

   Evaluation Capacity Development:

   The ECD Working Paper #30 “Connecting Evaluation and Budgeting” was published.

   Members of the ECD team supported the African Evaluation Association Conference in Cameroon,
   leading both a workshop on Country Monitoring and Evaluation Systems and contributing to a
   keynote panel.

   Centers for Learning on Evaluation and Results (CLEAR): The CLEAR program is undergoing an
   independent mid-term evaluation, and the team has worked with the evaluators, CLEAR donors and
   all the program members and partners on providing input to the evaluation. The first draft of the
   evaluation is expected in early July 2014.

   Management Action Record:

   MAR ratings and responses were loaded on our external website, to promote transparency,
   inclusiveness, engagement with stakeholders, and public oversight of WBG-supported operations.
   A technical briefing on the MAR systems (both internal and external) for the ED advisers was held in
   January 2014.




                                                    4
Knowledge Management:

A number of new projects are underway or completed:

       Proposal for a Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) System Business: A
        requirements document and system implementation plan were developed and are now ready
        for discussion with ITS to see whether and if so how the needed solution can be integrated
        with the emerging relationship management tools within the Bank Group’s broader IT
        platforms;

       Initiation of an IEG Data Mart to assist staff in developing maps based on evaluation data;

       IEG is on track in delivering towards its Information Management and Technology
        Solutions action plan, specifically with regard to the efforts to establish a high-quality full-
        text search platform to index all document collections relevant to IEG’s evaluation research.


Enhancing Knowledge Accessibility for External and Internal Stakeholders

With a slowly but steadily increasing number of visitors and viewers, the new IEG Blog “What
Works” maintained most interest coming to us from google and through direct access to our main site.
However, while starting from a low base, there was also a significant growth in Facebook “likes”, up
from the lower double digits to over 2000 for the last blog in Q3. Unsurprisingly, the source of
interest was primarily the US – with large IEG constituencies located here - however, the relatively
large number of views from India and Pakistan also indicate broadening options to engage with
audiences worldwide on evaluation insights.
