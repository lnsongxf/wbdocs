Executive summary
This report summarizes the findings of an allocative efficiency analysis on Sudan’s
national HIV epidemic and response conducted in 2014.


 Key Messages:
    Sudan experiences a low-level concentrated HIV epidemic with the highest HIV
     incidence rates among female sex workers (FSW), men having sex with men
     (MSM) and clients of sex workers.

    Optimization analyses suggest that in a context of limited resources more HIV
     funding should be allocated to four priority, high-impact programs: 1) ART, 2)
     prevention among FSW, 3) prevention among men at higher risk (clients of sex
     workers) and 4) MSM.

    This will require shifting funding from HIV prevention programs targeted at the
     general population to programs reaching FSW and MSM, prioritizing geographic
     zones with the highest HIV prevalence levels if resources are scarce, and
     identifying opportunities for selected reductions in unit cost and management
     cost across programs.



Background
HIV allocative efficiency studies are generally trying to answer the question “How can
HIV funding be optimally allocated to the combination of HIV response interventions
that will yield the highest impact”. In the first half of 2014, the Sudan National AIDS
Programme has reviewed its national strategic plan (NSP) on HIV and AIDS, while at
the same time preparing a concept note for submission to the Global Fund for AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria, the single largest funding partner of the national HIV
response. In this context the government of Sudan approached the World Bank with a
request to conduct an allocative efficiency analysis to inform both the prioritization of
the national HIV response and the concept note development. Four main policy
questions were formulated (Chapter 1) to address: 1) the optimal allocation of funds to
minimize HIV incidence, 2) the optimal allocation to minimize disability-adjusted life
years (DALYs), 3) resource requirements to achieve moderate and ambitious NSP
impact targets and 4) optimal allocations to minimize future spending commitments.

xiv | Executive Summary



    The wider development and health systems context was analysed and trends in
HIV and health financing established (Chapter 2). Sudan’s population was estimated at
38 million in 2013 with a population growth rate of 1.5% (UN population data). The
human development index takes rank 171 of 187 countries included, with life
expectancy (68.1 years) and annual income ($1,848) having positive effects on the
ranking and the education situation (only 3.1 years of schooling on average) having a
negative effect. The morbidity statistics are dominated by communicable diseases,
which in 2012 were responsible for an estimated 63% of causes for years of life lost.
Sudan has been an aid recipient with peak levels in 2008. While health has overall
been a minor recipient of all aid money, the share of aid for health has increased
between 2008 and 2012 from about 6% to about 15%. The proportion of health
expenditure supported by external sources fluctuated heavily in recent years (43% in
2010, 64% in 2011 and 29% in 2012). In 2011, total health expenditure amounted to
about 8% of GDP, however, public sector health expenditure was only at about 2% of
GDP. A large and increasing part of all health expenditure comes from private
households through out-of-pocket spending―in 2012, close to USD 3.1 billion was
spent on health by private households. Government expenditure on health was 10.6%
of total government expenditure in 2012, still some way off the 15% the signatories of
the Abuja Declaration pledged to allocate to public health by 2015.

    The HIV response has been comparatively well supported by external funding in
the past with over two thirds of HIV financing coming from external sources. For every
100 USD in total aid disbursements for health, 15.3 USD were for HIV/AIDS in the
period 2002–12. Between 2011 and 2013, domestic public funding for the national HIV
response declined from 6.6 million USD to 3.7 million USD, while international funding
declined from 14.5 million USD to 9.1 million. Overall funding for the HIV response
declined from 23.3 million USD in 2011 to 13.8 million USD in 2013. This suggests a
declining basis of sustainable HIV financing in Sudan. Optimal use of limited HIV
funding is therefore increasingly important to serve the people in need of HIV services
and to achieve the country’s HIV impact targets.



Methods
The Optima model, which was applied in this analysis, is a mathematical model of HIV
transmission and disease progression (Chapter 3). It is a population-based and flexible
model, which provides a formal method of optimization and quantitatively and
objectively determines optimal allocations of HIV resources across numerous
prevention and treatment programs.
                                                                    Executive Summary | xv



    The inputs into the model were gathered through a comprehensive literature review
and key parameters defined using a participatory consultation of key stakeholders.
During this engagement, ten populations FSW, their clients, MSM, children and –
disaggregated by sex―youth, adults and older people) were defined for inclusion in the
model. Seven core HIV programs were identified for optimization: HIV prevention for
FSW, MSM, clients of sex workers, general population prevention, HIV testing and
counselling for the general population, ART and Prevention of Mother-to-Child
Transmission (PMTCT). Key time frames for analysis included 2016, 2020 and 2030.
Expenditure from the National AIDS Spending Assessment (NASA) for 2013 was used
as a baseline scenario (total spending USD 12.2 million, programmatic spending USD
6.4 million USD).

    Optima was calibrated to HIV prevalence data points available from the different
populations. Cost-outcome curves were developed for the seven programs included in
the analyses. These curves define the relationship between program expenditure and
respective outcomes (such as HIV testing rate, condom use per population, or number
of people on ART) and form the basis for the optimization analysis. Note that these
curves are associated with the technical efficiency and resulting unit costs of a program.
However, this analysis was not designed to explore how potential technical efficiency
gains would affect outcomes and in turn optimal resource allocation.



Key findings
The epidemic model within Optima was used to develop baseline HIV prevalence and
HIV incidence estimates and trends (Chapter 4). The following are the main findings of
the epidemic modelling:

   Sudan experiences a low-level concentrated HIV epidemic with an estimated
    6,376 new HIV infections acquired in 2013

   HIV incidence in 2013 is estimated at 0.44% for FSW, 0.35% for MSM and 0.1%
    for SW clients, and at <0.05% in all age and sex strata of the general population

   31% of all new infections were directly associated with sex work (incidence in
    sex workers and their clients)

   Half of all incident HIV infections occurred in the general adult population (70%
    of which among females), but many of these indirectly arise from sex work-
    linked transmission events
xvi | Executive Summary



   FSW are “net transmitters” whereas female adults in the general population are all
    “net receivers”. All male populations are “net transmitters” including sex work clients
    and MSM (the latter therefore suggesting that MSM also transmit to female partners,
    and a proportion of MSM are indeed married).


    The analysis to determine optimal allocations for minimizing new HIV infections
(also Chapter 4) established the following:

   With the same USD 6.4 million of programmatic spending as in 2013, Sudan could
    avert an additional 19,000 infections (or 36% of cumulative HIV infections) during
    the 2014–20 period if these resources were allocated optimally

   These reductions in new infections could be achieved by prioritizing resource
    allocation to four programs:

    -   ART―22% of all HIV funding instead of 12% as in 2013
    -   Prevention services for FSWs―15% instead of 4%
    -   Prevention services for high-risk men/SW clients―10% instead of 4%, and
    -   Prevention service for MSM―6% instead of 2%
        (note that non-program expenditure for management and strategic information,
        as well as PLHIV support activities, are not considered in this optimal allocation
        analysis although they were 47% of all 2013 HIV expenditure)
   In case the Sudan HIV response has more programmatic funding available than the
    USD 6.4 million in 2013―through mobilizing additional funds or moving
    management/ coordination costs towards intervention programs―additional HIV
    incidence reductions can be obtained (see ES Figure1 below)

   Prevention programs for the general population are not part of the optimal mix of
    investment in any of these scenarios

   At the 2013 level of total HIV funding of USD 6.4 million, PMTCT is not part of the
    optimal mix, a finding that was attributed to the high cost for HIV testing to identify
    one HIV positive pregnant woman. This finding remained unchanged with a
    substantially lower unit cost for PMTCT used in the 2015–17 NSP (USD 2,666 per
    HIV positive woman receiving PMTCT services instead of USD 9,016 based on
    past program data). With the reduced unit cost, PMTCT enters the allocation mix at
    170% of the 2013 programmatic spending amount (USD 10.7 million). According to
    additional analyses of PMTCT program data, 76% of the 254 PMTCT sites did not
    identify an HIV positive woman in 2013. This suggests that increasing cost-
    effectiveness of the program will require geographical prioritization and exploring
                                                                                Executive Summary | xvii



    synergies with other public health interventions such as syphilis testing and
    treatment for pregnant women.

Sources: Populated Optima model for Sudan. Prevention packages for key populations include outreach,
condoms, HTC, but do not include ART (which is shown separately). Reduced PMTCT unit cost were applied in
this analysis. If 2013 PMTCT unit cost was used, PMTCT would not be part of the optimal mix to reduce new
infections for scenarios ranging from 50% to 200% of 2013 levels of spending.

In order to minimize HIV-related DALYs in the population by 2020, very similar
budget reallocations would need to be made as when aiming for minimal HIV
incidence:

   Optimal allocations would avert approximately 29,300 additional HIV-related
    DALYs (23%) compared to the non-optimal 2013 allocation pattern

   ART would receive the largest share of the funding since it is the principal
    intervention to reduce AIDS morbidity and mortality (25% of all HIV funding or 47%
    of programmatic spending).
xviii | Executive Summary



   The contribution of the prevention packages regarding HIV case finding remains
    essential (all prevention packages include HTC). In order to initiate ART in eligible
    individuals, the HTC activities would have to be targeted to higher-yield sub-
    populations – key populations (FSW, clients, MSM), TB cases, STI clients, spouses
    and partners of known PLHIV.

    Optimal     annual      allocations   from   2014   to   2030   to   minimize   fiscal
commitments up to 2050 again called for a very similar allocation. This suggests
that the model-proposed intervention mix for HIV programs is robust for minimizing
different important objectives of preventing HIV transmission, HIV morbidity, HIV
mortality and HIV long-term costs.
    It was also estimated that the minimum programmatic spending to achieve
moderate impact targets of 25% reduction in cumulative HIV incidence and deaths in
the short-term by 2016 was USD 8.1 million per year until 2016. The modelling
suggests that the cost for reaching HIV incidence targets is lower than cost for reaching
HIV mortality targets, particularly for more ambitious mortality targets, which require
extensive coverage of HIV testing for find cases for ART initiation. Reaching impact
targets at lowest costs in the mid-term would require an estimated USD 14 million
annually for program financing to obtain a 25% incidence and AIDS mortality reduction
by 2020 (= 220% of the spend of USD 6.4 million in 2013). Achievement of ambitious
targets (50% reduction in HIV incidence and AIDS deaths by 2020) would require an
estimated USD 34 million annually for programs (over 5 times spend of USD 6.4 million
in 2013).

    Another key finding was that targeting programmatic resources almost exclusively
to KPs and to ART―while de-prioritizing general population programs―has
downstream effects on all population groups and leads to HIV incidence reductions in
all populations over the medium term, at lowest cost.

    The report brings the results of the analysis together in an overall discussion
(Chapter 5) and in offers brief conclusions based on the main findings (Chapter 6).



Conclusions
Sudan’s new 2014 – 2016 HIV strategy already builds on many insights and lessons
learnt. This allocative efficiency study led to the main conclusion that Sudan’s HIV
response allocations could be enhanced by focusing prevention on FSW, their clients
and MSM, while scaling up ART based on an HTC strategy that is targeted
geographically and to key populations.
                                                                  Executive Summary | xix



    The impact of Sudan’s HIV response resource allocations could be enhanced by
focusing on prevention and ART for key populations for the following five main reasons:

    Epidemiologically: The populations causing most HIV transmission (sex workers
and their clients, men having sex with men) need to be adequately served to prevent
onward transmission of HIV. Treatment as prevention is hampered by low and late
case identification and limited ART adherence; supply chains for both HIV reagents
and condoms report failures, and condom promotion faces cultural barriers. As a
consequence the annual number of new HIV infections is projected to slowly rise
unless the HIV response increases its prevention impact.

    Programmatically: HIV resources are spent on populations with very low HIV risk of
1 in 5,000–10,000 new infections per year and low AIDS attributable DALYs. PMTCT
provision is scaled up to many areas where no HIV case is identified in a whole year;
some VCT services experience low demand and until recently targeted low-risk
individuals. HIV money needs to be directed towards the key populations who are most
likely to be infected, develop AIDS and spread HIV to others.        HIV highlights the
pernicious health effects of social and legal marginalization and of gender inequalities
in Sudan, and offers an opportunity to redress.

    Economically: Aid supporting the Sudanese public health sector has in the past
prioritized HIV above other diseases. With international and domestic public sector
contributions to the HIV response rapidly decreasing over the last three years, bold
decisions need to be made to achieve value for money by addressing the epidemic in a
cost-effective manner with greater returns on investment.

    Fiscally: Every new HIV infection represents a future treatment liability for the
Sudanese government. According to our model outputs on future HIV-related
healthcare costs, allocating specific shares of HIV resources to key populations and to
ART scale-up minimizes long-term fiscal costs for the government.

    Sustainability: The results presented in this report can guide Sudan’s allocative
choices to make the HIV response more sustainable and HIV investments more
defendable in a health sector with multiple investment needs. The model-proposed
allocation mix for HIV programs is robust for minimizing different important policy
objectives of minimizing HIV transmission, HIV morbidity and mortality, and long-term
AIDS-related costs. Importantly, the model demonstrates that through indirect effects,
HIV impact is obtained in all population groups, even if prevention programs are
targeted to populations are higher risk of HIV.

1. Introduction
1.1 Allocative efficiency in HIV and health
The concept of allocative efficiency takes health interventions (including services,
drugs, and other activities, the primary intention of which is to improve health) as inputs
and health of the population as an output1. The term refers to the maximization of
health outcome with the least costly mix of health interventions. Practically,
allocative efficiency of health interventions is about the right intervention being provided
to the right people at the right place in such a way that health outcomes are maximised.

    HIV allocative efficiency studies are generally trying to answer the question “How
can HIV funding be optimally allocated to the combination of HIV response
interventions that will yield the highest impact (achieve HIV response goals in the areas
of HIV prevention, treatment, care and support) in the shortest period of time?”

    The dialogue around HIV financing has been changing in recent years, from a
focus on universal access and estimation of the total resource need to
comprehensively finance universal access, to prioritized high-impact HIV response
scenarios within the realistic constraints of an amount of funding a country is
likely to raise. In connection with this, the following developments can also be
highlighted:

   The shared interest to move towards more predictable levels of HIV funding support
    for countries;

   The promotion of better alignment between HIV investment decisions and "need“,
    informed by disease burden and ability to pay (especially Global Fund);

   The concept of shared responsibility or “fair share” promoted by UNAIDS, calling on
    governments to contribute public sector funds to the HIV response;

   The stabilization of most HIV epidemics globally, resulting in a change from HIV’s
    special disease status to a condition with long-term treatment needs similar to
    some non-communicable diseases in many settings;

2 | Introduction



    The move from vertical HIV interventions to more integrated HIV and health service
     provision with strong linkages to TB and SRH services and the management of
     chronic conditions;

    The change from an HIV/AIDS spending approach towards an investment approach,
     using longer time horizons, and analytical approaches to determine where
     investments should be made.

     There is wide consensus that better outcomes could be achieved in many
settings with a given amount of HIV money, or given outcomes could be
achieved with less HIV money, if the resources are distributed optimally or if
resources are technically used in the most efficient ways. One way in which to do
this, is to use mathematical modelling to determine optimal HIV resource allocation. As
an HIV allocative efficiency model, Optima is designed to provide investment guidance
on allocatively efficient HIV responses. The optimal allocation of resources predicted by
the model differs markedly depending on the policy objective(s), and the optimal
distribution of resources across programs changes substantially based on the amount
of funding available to be allocated.

The Optima model:

    is a mathematical model of HIV transmission and disease progression that is
     population-based and flexible,

    provides a formal method of optimization and quantitatively and objectively
     determines optimal allocations of HIV resources across numerous prevention and
     treatment programs, to address multiple policy objectives,

    estimates intervention impact, cost-effectiveness and return-on-investment, and

    provides analysis on the longer-term financial consequences of HIV infections and
     HIV investments.


1.2 Objectives of the analysis
In collaboration with Sudan stakeholders, the following different objectives for
optimization analysis were set, taking into account that different optimization objectives
would yield different optimal funding allocations:


1.   Determine the optimal programmatic funding allocations to minimize HIV
     incidence in the mid-term by 2020
                                                                         Introduction | 3



2.   Determine the optimal programmatic funding allocations to minimize HIV-
     attributable DALYs in the mid-term by 2020 (i.e., lowest cumulative DALYs,
     highest DALYs averted)

3.   Determine the optimal programmatic funding allocations to achieve specific
     impact and coverage targets at lowest costs in the medium-term by 2020

4.   Minimize new spending commitments caused by new HIV infections occurring by
     2020/2030

5.   Determine the optimal programmatic funding allocations to achieve 25%
     reductions in HIV incidence and AIDS deaths in the short-term by 2016.
2. Sudan’s human development, health
   and financing context

2.1 Human development

Sudan’s human development continues to experience various challenges and remains
affected by armed conflicts, internal displacement of people, and influx of refugees
from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Chad, Central African Republic and South Sudan.


     The country takes rank 171 out of 187 countries included in the human
development index (HDI) – Sudan’s score of 0.414 is below the average of 0.466 for
countries with the lowest levels of human development (2013 Human Development
Report) – Figure 1. Sudan also ranks behind other Arab countries including Yemen
and Djibouti ranked at 160 and 164 respectively.

   Sudan’s average life expectancy is relatively high at 68.1 years, compared to 59.1
    for low-HDI countries. Figure 2 shows Sudan’s life expectancy against GNI per
    capita in international comparison with sub-Saharan African and other countries.

   The mean years of schooling are only 3.1 and this affects Sudan’s HDI negatively.

   The average annual income is $1,848 compared to $1,633 for countries in the
    same bracket.

2.2 Burden of disease
Sudan’s morbidity statistics are dominated by communicable diseases (Figure 3)

                         In 2012, an estimated 63% of causes for years of life lost (YLL) were communicable
                          diseases, which is higher than the regional average level (WHO, 2014).

                         About 22% of YLL were due to non-communicable diseases, lower than the
                          average level reported for the region.

                         Injuries contribute about 14% of all YLL.

                         The highest ranking causes for child death in 2012 were acute respiratory infections
                          (18% of all causes), premature birth (14%), birth asphyxia (12%) and childhood
                          diarrhoea (11%)2.

     There is a growing body of national data on morbidity and cause-specific
mortality. However, the data from the 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study –
which provided HIV/AIDS data for countries―cannot be directly used for today’s
Sudan (comprising of pre-secession data).

     The following incidence rates from disease surveillance and estimations can be
highlighted (WHO 2013)3:

   Malaria: 14.8 cases per 1,000 population

   Measles: 260 per 1 million population

   TB notification rate, all forms: 53 per 100,000 population

   Meningococcal meningitis: 911 reported cases

   Syphilis in pregnant women: mean prevalence of 2.3% (2010 ANC surveillance
    data).



2.3 External aid and health financing
Even though Sudan has historically received large amounts of aid, this peaked
in 2008, and health has been a minor component of this aid (see Figure 4).

    While health has overall been a minor part of all aid, the share of aid for health has
     increased between 2008 and 2012 from about 6.0% to about 14.9%.

    A large proportion of aid to Sudan is provided in form of humanitarian assistance,
     which focuses on food security and nutrition, but also includes some health and
     eduction programme;

    Regarding external financing of health expenditure, there has been some
     fluctuation in recent years: In 2009 44.6% of total health expenditure was externally
     financed, in 2010, 2011 and 2012 the share was 42.5%, 63.5% and 29.4%
     respectively.

     A large and increasing part of all health expenditure comes from private
households through out-of-pocket spending (Figure 5).
    In 2012, close to USD 3.1 billion was spent on health by private households, and
     about USD 1.0 billion came from the public sector.

    There is virtually no pre-paid component in the private household expenditure (i.e.
     subscription to health insurance schemes is very rare).

              Total health expenditure amounted in 2011 to about 8% of GDP (GDP was
               approximately USD 1,617/capita in the same year4) (WHO, 2013)5.

                     However, public sector health expenditure was only at about 2% of GDP in
                      2011.

According to the Global Health Expenditure Database6, government expenditure
on health was 10.7% of total government expenditure in 2009, 10.6% in 2010,
10.9% in 2011 and 10.6% in 2012―see Figure 6.

              The share exceeded 12% from 1996 to 1998 (pre-secession data, see footnote).

              The signatories of the Abuja Declaration pledged to allocate at least 15% of their
               national budgets to public health by 20157.

         Comparison of Sudan’s public health allocation with other post-conflict
states shows that Sudan’s percentage-allocation is among the higher ones,
similar to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic
(Figure 7). However, considering that Sudan’s GNI per capita is much higher than
those for the Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic, it could be
concluded that Sudan should use its economic situation to increasingly invest in the
health of its people (Figure 7).

2.4 HIV/AIDS financing
The HIV response has been comparatively well-financed by aid money in the
past:

   For every 100 USD in total aid disbursements for health, 15.3 USD were for
    HIV/AIDS in the period 2002–12. This means that HIV disbursement were 1.0% of
    all aid disbursements over the 2002–12 period.

     Donor disbursements for HIV/AIDS have fluctuated between a low of
approximately USD 1 million in 2002 and 2003 to a high of about USD 45 million
in 2010 (Figure 8).
   Support from the United States has been significant over 6–7 years, however, the
    most important source of external funding has been the Global Fund (rounds 3, 5,
    10). In 2012 and 2013, Global Fund disbursements were at USD 10.9 million and
    8.2 million (with 4.3 million and 1.5 million going into infrastructure development in
    2012 and 2013, respectively, these amounts were hence not considered as part of
    the current HIV program spending).

   Several other donors have over the years contributed annual total funding of about
    USD 1–5 million (predominantly UN agencies and international NGOs).

     In 2011, an estimated 62% of all reported HIV spending was externally
financed (of which 90.8% was from Global Fund), which is an average level when
comparing Sudan with countries with similar income levels (Figure 9) (based on 2013

data from UNAIDS and IMF). In terms of both GDP per capita and the share of external
funding in HIV, Sudan is on a par with the Republic of Moldova.

In 2012, HIV/AIDS consumed:

   About 0.47% of the public sector expenditure on health (USD 4,693,022 of USD
    1.0 billion public sector health spend)

   About 0.45% of total expenditure on health (USD 18,458,156 of USD 4.1 billion

     While overall funding for the HIV response declined, the relative contribution of
different funding sources stayed at similar levels. Global Fund remained the largest
international funding source accounting for 90.3% of international funding. The
reductions in GF spending between 2011 and 2013 mainly occurred through reduced
infrastructure investment through HIV budgets – Figure 10.

     The following graph summarizes the expenditure situation in Sudan (Figure 11). It
depicts the shares of household, state and aid contributions to expenditure in the
country, as well as to health and HIV expenditure. It shows that while households face
considerable expenditure for health, they don’t for HIV thanks to the large contr ibution
from external donors. In general, households seem protected from direct expenditure
for HIV prevention and treatment services (note that this does not include impact
mitigation services and social protection for people affected by AIDS).

3.3 Optimization function
The mathematical optimization provided by the Optima model is a formal and precise
way to determine the “best” allocation. In this process, different objectives (e.g.
minimize HIV incidence, minimize HIV costs) yield different optimal allocations of
resources or spending. The model determines the resource allocation required that
best meets the objective. This process can be graphically depicted as follows:

       Optimization requires the development of cost-outcome curves which define the
relationship between program expenditure and respective outcomes (such as HIV
testing rate, condom use per population, number of people on ART). The cost-outcome
curves are shown in Annex 2.

       The cost-outcome curves allowed deriving unit costs for each program. This top-
down costing approach derives unit costs from expenditure data and reported number
of people served or reported program coverage data (Table 2). The method may
produce different unit costs than when using a bottom-up costing methodology. We
developed average costs based on locally reported data (without gaining a detailed
understanding of the possible ranges of unit costs due to program scale, provider and
location). We then compared our derived unit costs with data from Sudan (NSP
costing) and elsewhere (global unit cost repository of Futures Institute 9 , Resource
Needs Model Niger) and found that our derived unit costs came in at a similar range,
except for PMTCT. For this program, our high unit cost includes the cost of screening
the average number of ANC clients to identify one HIV-positive client, and subsequent
provision of the PMTCT service package to this expectant mother.

HIV positive pregnant women and the cost of a large effort to roll-out PMTCT to a large number of sites.

3.4 Limitations of analysis
3.4.1 Limitations specific to Sudan
Limited/scarce data: Some data are not yet available for the post-2011 Sudan, such
as the data from the Global Burden of Disease Study of 2010. A major limitation of
trend analysis in the context of Sudan is the fact that different epidemiological data
points are not comparable over time, since the sample of sites for collecting HIV bio-
markers changed. Future rounds of surveys using similar samples as previous IBBS
(integrated bio-behavioural survey) and ANC surveillance rounds will add to improving
trend data. In addition, the calibration of the model had overall very few data points
available on the HIV prevalence level in each of the chosen populations. There was
also a lack of data on historical program spending, and little information to associate
program spending to impact or performance.

    Populations insufficiently characterized in terms of their HIV risk: Some
populations of interest could not be included as separate groups in the analysis due to
lack of data. This includes populations of humanitarian concern, migrants, prisoners
and people who inject drugs (PWID). The first two are relatively large groups, for which
it is not clear whether they are at increased risk of HIV infection. Prisoners and PWID
are relatively small groups in Sudan, but potentially at high risk of HIV infection.
Including these groups would most likely not have entirely changed the overall picture
of analysis, but as additional data becomes available their role in the epidemic could be
reassessed at a later stage.

    Migration effects: Another limitation are potential effects of the split of Sudan into
two countries, which led to population movements of former South Sudanese residents
in North Sudan to the South and reduced labour migration from the South to the North.
There is limited data available on these effects, but due to differential levels of HIV
prevalence, this could potentially influence the analysis.

3.4.2 Limitations of the modelling methodology itself:
   A limitation of our approach is the assumption that all changes in behavior are
    assumed to be due to changes in program funding. This assumption is common in
    epidemic models.

   The analysis uses past ratios of expenditure to coverage as a basis for determining
    program cost rather than unit costs (Wilson et al. in preparation). This approach of
    using past cost and results has a number of advantages over using projected costs
    from plans and budgets, which are ultimately predictions of future cost, but also has
                                                                            Methodology | 21



    a disadvantage as there may be future increases or decreases in cost in relation to
    new approaches, implementation arrangements or technologies.

   The modelling approach used to calculate relative cost-effectiveness between
    programs includes assumptions around the impact of increases or decreases in
    funding for programs. These assumptions are based on unit costs and observed
    ecological relationships between outcomes of program coverage or risk behaviour
    and the amount of money spent on programs in the past, and assuming that there
    would be some saturation in the possible effect of programs with increases in
    spending.

   The analysis did not determine the technical efficiency of programs as this was
    beyond the scope of the analysis, however, gains in technical efficiency would lead
    to different unit costs and therefore affect optimal resource allocation.

   Effects outside the HIV endpoints are not considered (e.g. wider effects of PMTCT
    within MCH, of condom use as a contraceptive, or effects of sex work interventions
    on STIs and SRH).

   Our approach does not consider equity or quantification of human rights, stigma
    and discrimination, ethical, legal or psychosocial implications.

   Other models may produce different projections than those produced by Optima.
    However, our model’s predictions matched Spectrum-predicted trends. It used the
    best possible data, the combined experience from model application in about 20
    countries, and it produced realistic forecasts.

4. Results

4.1 HIV transmission dynamics
It is estimated that there were 6,376 new HIV infections acquired in 2013 (Optima),
see Figure 15. Of these:

   31% were directly associated with sex work (incidence in sex workers and their
    clients who are higher-risk men but not MSM)

   Half of all incident HIV infections occurred in the general adult population (70% of
    which among females)—it is subsequently shown in the report that many of these
    indirectly arise from sex work-linked transmission events.

(2013)




Source: Populated Optima model for Sudan

    The risk of infection shows large variation across populations, with FSW and MSM
having significantly higher risk, followed by SW clients —Figure 16:

   HIV incidence in 2013 is estimated at 0.44% for FSW, 0.35% for MSM and 0.1% for
    SW clients, and at <0.05% in all age and sex strata of the general population

   HIV incidence in children is estimated to be <0.01% (most infections in children are
    expected to occur through mother-to-child-transmission)




                                                                                                23

   If 2013 programmatic spending levels and allocations continue, the HIV incidence
    rate is expected to rise, especially in FSW, MSM and clients

FSW = female sex worker, SWC = sex work client, MSM = men having sex with men.

     If the 2013 programmatic expenditure was held constant, increased HIV incidence
rates (Figure 16), combined with the population growth rate of about 1.5%, would lead
to significant increases in the number of new HIV infections in all population groups in
the medium term—Figure 17.

     Ratios of HIV infections transmitted to infections received per population
help understand the transmission dynamics between populations (Figure 18):

   All male populations (in blue) are “net transmitters”, especially men aged 50 years
    and above, sex work clients and MSM (the latter therefore suggesting that MSM
    transmit to populations other than MSM, who will be female partners of MSM as
    many MSM are married)

   FSW are also net transmitters, whereas female adults in the general population are
    all “net receivers” (all female populations in pink)

     Optima projects slowly increasing trends for HIV prevalence, HIV incidence,
AIDS deaths and MTCT numbers—Figure 19. These trends are similar to those
projected by Spectrum (Annex 3). The temporal increase in HIV prevalence arises
through the combined effects of HIV incidence and ART. The average population
growth of about 1.5% as per UN Population Division estimates contributes to the rise in
new infections, mother-to-child transmission and deaths.

4.2 Program data on maternal HIV prevalence
This analysis evaluated the 2013 PMTCT program delivery statistics to contribute to
the policy dialogue on investing in this program targeting members of the general
population within a context of a low-level HIV epidemic. It also served to inform the
modelling scenarios for optimal resource allocation (subsequent report sections). The
overall policy question is whether Sudan should invest in PMTCT, and if so, should it
be selectively scaled up in certain areas of the country.

     PMTCT has been developed and scaled up rapidly, from 71 PMTCT sites in 2011
to 227 in 2013, allowing the HIV testing of 84,916 pregnant women in 2013 (UNGASS
progress report 2014)10. No testing could be offered yet for early infant diagnosis by
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test, and there is no nationally collated data to
indicate the outcomes of mother baby pairs.

       In 2013, about 150 HIV positive mothers were diagnosed in the PMTCT services,
which translates to 2% of women estimated to be in need of PMTCT (UNGASS report,
based on Spectrum 11 ). With this scale of the PMTCT program, the government
considers the impact of PMTCT in prevention of vertical transmission to be very limited.
The reported key challenges are in integrating human resource and HIV supplies
management between of the RH and HIV service delivery, curative and laboratory
directorates at all levels to work together to increase the coverage and quality of
services in PITC in RH health facility outlets and at community level and linked
detected positive cases to HIV care (UNGASS report).

In summary, the 2013 PMTCT site statistics are as follows:

     254 PMTCT sites reported HIV testing data (see Figure 20 for site specific HIV
      prevalence levels based on 2013 program statistics – GARPR report has lightly
      lower number of 227 PMTCT sites).

     Of all PMTCT sites, 24% (62) reported identifying at least one HIV-positive
      pregnant woman, 76% (192) did not find any HIV positive woman.

     Six sites reported five or more HIV diagnoses: Kassala Saudi Hospital (12),
      Omdurman, Khartoum (11), Er Roseires, Blue Nile (9), Madani, GA (7), SFPA PHC
      Center, NK (5) and Elehtiati Elmarkzi, RS (5).

     The nine sites with maternal HIV prevalence levels of 1% and above are shown in
      Table 3 (sites with less than 50 women tested are excluded in the table, but shown
      in Figure 20).

4.3 Optimized allocations to minimize HIV incidence
The key analytical work in this study was on optimal resource allocation to meet
specific HIV objectives, using the Optima model. In this section we present findings
on optimized allocations for minimzing new HIV infections.

     The analysis suggests that in order to minimize HIV incidence by 2020 at
2013 programmatic funding levels, allocations need to shift to FSW, client and
MSM interventions as well as ART, and away from programs targeted at the
general population (which has below 0.05% HIV incidence) – Figure 22.
   Analysis assumes 2013 expenditure amounts are annually available until 2020
    (total annual budget of USD 12.2 million, of which USD 6.4 million is being
    optimized for HIV impact)

   All prevention programs include condoms, HTC, SBCC, ART includes HIV testing.
    Packages do not include enabling environment expenditure

     At the 2013 resource level, PMTCT is not part of the optimal mix. In the course of
the optimization analysis, it became evident that it would be policy-relevant to run two
different scenarios on PMTCT allocations, to give specific input into the allocative
decision-making on PMTCT. One scenario uses the PMTCT unit cost derived from
empirical data (expenditure and number of PMTCT beneficiaries), which results in a
unit cost of USD 9,016 (see Table 2). Secondly, the optimization analysis used the
PMTCT unit cost based on projections by government within the framework of the new,
prioritized NSP, which is USD 2,666 (Table 2 and table annotation). This lower unit
cost will have arisen in a more established PMTCT program delivered at scale and
which is targeted for better cost-effectiveness, as per the key guiding principles of the
NSP. The results of the two scenarios, using different PMTCT unit costs are described
32 | Results



in the following sections. Note that in Figure 22, PMTCT is not part of the optimal mix
even at the lower unit cost.
     With the same USD 6.4 million, Sudan could avert an additional 36% of
cumulative HIV infections during the 2014–20 period if these resources were
allocated optimally—Figure 23:
   The Sudan HIV response can become more allocatively efficient by prioritizing
    expenditure for higher-risk groups (SW, clients, MSM) and ART-eligible PLHIV, and
    de-prioritizing expenditure for the low-risk general population, reducing the
    cumulative HIV incidence by approximately 19,000 infections or 36% by 2020 (this
    optimal allocation also reduces cumulative deaths by 6,744).

   In case the Sudan HIV response has more programmatic funding available than the
    USD 6.4 million in 2013—through mobilizing additional funds, moving management/
    coordination funds towards intervention programs—additional HIV incidence
    reductions can be obtained.

     The following observations can be made when comparing optimal allocations for
reducing new infections for different funding amounts:
    For any total investment between 100% and 190% of 2013 spending, optimization
     suggests that investment should be focused on four programs: prevention among
     FSW, MSM and men at higher risk (sex work clients) as well as ART.

    If only 50% to 90% of 2013 spending is available, optimization suggests that
     investment should be focused on prevention among FSW, MSM and higher risk
     men (sex work clients). 12

    General population expenditure only starts to come into the allocation mix at 700%
     of budget (not shown in figure).

     Even if the lower unit cost for PMTCT from the 2015–17 NSP is applied,
PMTCT only enters the allocation mix at 170% of the 2013 programmatic spending
amount (USD 10.7 million) (Figure 24). Additional analysis suggested that PMTCT
would only receive substantial proportions of funding if unit cost was reduced to around
USD 500 for identifying one HIV positive woman. However, this is difficult to achieve in
a context of HIV prevalence of below 0.2% among pregnant women, where over 500
HIV tests are required to identify one HIV positive woman. This suggests that in the
context of limited resources, PMTCT targeting to geographical areas with higher HIV
prevalence would be needed to make PMTCT programs cost-effective compared to
other HIV prevention interventions and ART.




12
     The fact that ART receives a large portion of funding at 100% of 2013 spending, but is not part of the
     package at lower amounts of investment might appear counter-intuitive, but is due to a combination of
     reasons. It needs to be considered that this is the optimal mix for reducing new infections and that the
     prevention programs for key populations included in the optimal mix can achieve moderate increases in
     condom use at relatively low cost (for reducing deaths and DALYs, ART is part of the optimal mix at all
     levels of investment). In addition, the initial set up cost for a program, which in the model is reflected in the
     cost-outcome curves, implies that with limited resources running several programs at low intensity is not
     cost-effective and therefore only a small number of programs can be run cost-effectively in scenarios with
     low resource availability. Furthermore, if two programs have very similar cost-effectiveness, optimization
     will not propose a split of funding between the two programs, but propose funding the slightly more cost-
     effective program. Only once a tipping point is reached, where the set up and basic running cost for a
     program is reduced through economies of scale, funding for a program becomes part of the optimal mix.
     After this tipping point is reached like it is the case for ART between 90 and 100% of current funding, the
     allocation to the program can be substantial as its unit cost will be lower than the unit cost of the
     “competing” program. This explains why at 100% of 2013 spending, ART enters the optimized mix of
     allocations for reducing new infections and already receives over one third of programmatic spending.

Sources: Populated Optima model for Sudan.
Note: Prevention packages do not include ART here and that ART is shown separately for all populations.

     The baseline and optimal allocation were also compared in terms of their impact on
vertical transmission by 2020 and 2030. The projected rate of HIV-positive infants is
shown in Figure 25, for two allocation scenarios: the ‘baseline’ scenario, in which the
programmatic spending continues as it was in 2013; and an optimized scenario, in
which we assume that the 2013 budget is annually available and is optimized to
minimize incidence by 2020. The model assumed that in the absence of intervention,
the probability of vertical transmission from HIV-positive women to their babies is 38%
for breastfeeding mothers and 25% for non-breastfeeding mothers.

   In the baseline scenario, all programs are funded at the level of 2013 budgets,
    which means PMTCT programs receive 7% of all programmatic funding. Prevention
    among key populations and ART receive less funding than in the optimized
    scenario. Due to the limited coverage that can be reached with the limited
    resources in a national PMTCT program, the impact of PMTCT program funding on
    vertical transmission remains low. Increases in new infections among key
    populations and their downstream effects on pregnant women will lead to
    increasing mother-to-child transmission.

   In the optimized scenario, PMTCT programs drop out of the HIV allocation mix, but
    nevertheless the projected number of HIV-positive infants per 1,000 live births
    declines relative to the baseline scenario because of the reduction in HIV infections
    in females (an indirect effect of the key population interventions and ART scale-up).
36 | Results



   In both scenarios, there is either no or very small reach of PMTCT, and the
    overall rate of vertical transmission from HIV-positive women to their babies
    stays at almost the same levels.

4.4 Optimized allocations to minimize HIV-related
    DALYs
In order to minimize HIV-related DALYs in the population by 2020 (i.e., lowest
cumulative DALYs, highest DALYs averted), very similar budget reallocations
would need to be made as when aiming for minimal HIV incidence—Figure 26:

        ART would receive more funding since it is the principal intervention to reduce
         AIDS morbidity and mortality (25% instead of 22% for the HIV incidence
         objective)

   With a quarter of the total HIV response budget going to ART in this scenario, the
    contribution of the prevention packages regarding HIV case finding is essential (all
    prevention packages include HTC). In order to initiate ART in eligible individuals,
    the HTC activities would have to be targeted to higher-yield sub-populations – key
    populations (FSW, clients, MSM), TB cases, STI clients, spouses and partners of
    known PLHIV.

   Programmatic funding as available in 2013 (USD 6.4 million) would avert additional
    DALYs if allocated optimally. This would avert approximately 29,300 additional
    HIV-related DALYs (23%) compared to the non-optimal 2013 allocation pattern.

Figure 27.   Optimal allocations to minimize HIV-related DALYs by 2020 at different budget levels,
Sudan
38 | Results



    With increasing availability of funding, the optimal mix would only include ART and
     prevention for key populations up to 180% of 2013 spending. PMTCT would
     become part of the mix of allocations at 190% of 2013 spending. General
     population prevention would not be part of the optimal mix for reducing DALYs.

    If less funding than in 2013 was available, ART would remain the key investment to
     reduce DALYs, while HIV prevention in sex work settings would also remain part of
     the optimal mix, but its share reduced at lower funding levels.


4.5 Optimized allocations to minimize the costs of
    reaching 2020 impact and coverage targets
The Optima model was also used to determine the optimal HIV program resource
allocations to achieve specific impact and coverage targets at lowest costs by 2020.
For the purpose of this analysis, two impact and coverage scenarios were defined as
follows:

                 Impact: Reduce HIV      Impact: Reduce AIDS       Coverage:   Coverage:
    Scenarios:   incidence by 2020       deaths by 2020              ART        PMTCT

    Ambitious    -50% (to 3,188)         -50% (to 1,359)               80%       80%

    Moderate     -25% (to 4,782)         -25% (to 2,038)               60%       60%

Meeting impact targets:

    Ca. USD 14 million annually for programs could lead to achievement of the
     moderate targets of 25% incidence and AIDS mortality reduction by 2020 (= 220%
     of the spend of USD 6.4 million in 2013)

    Achievement of ambitious targets (50% reduction in HIV incidence and AIDS
     deaths by 2020) would require an estimated USD 34 million annually for basic
     programs (= over 5 times the spend of USD 6.4 million in 2013)

      We found that reaching 60% PMTCT coverage would in the Sudan context be
very resource intensive. The model predicted that meeting the 60% PMTCT target
would absorb 50% of all program spend.

      Figure 28 shows the minimal annual resource allocation required to achieve the
2020 impact and coverage targets; Figure 29 shows the minimal annual resource
allocation required to achieve the 2020 impact targets only.

     The prevention impact of optimal allocation of USD 6.4 million (2013 programmatic
expenditure) is shown in Figure 30. The key message is that an allocatively more
efficient HIV response—targeted to key populations and prioritizing HIV
treatment―would reduce HIV incidence in all population groups. This is to be
expected in a low-level HIV epidemic, where transmission in the general population is

4.6 Optimized allocation to minimize spending
    commitments caused by HIV infections
Each existing HIV infection represents a future treatment liability. The government will
have to pay for the care and treatment costs associated with HIV infections for the rest
of PLHIVs’ life. An important objective is therefore be to minimize HIV-related fiscal
costs by preventing new HIV infections while maintaining a given level of treatment for
those in need. This objective does require an ART coverage condition, otherwise the
cheapest (but unacceptable option) would be to let people die of HIV/AIDS related
conditions without spending on their treatment and care. Our analysis therefore
assumed that the ART coverage level would not be allowed to drop below the 2013
level. Figure 31 shows the annual allocation mix 2014–30 that will reduce the long-
term fiscal commitments up to 2050.

   The longer-term objective of minimizing fiscal commitments for health care of
    people living with HIV requires a very similar allocation mix to the mid-term
    objectives of minimizing HIV incidence and DALYs (for a summary, see Table 5 in
    section 5.3. of the discussion chapter).
                                                                                    Results | 41

     Figure 32 explores further the future HIV spending needs up to 2030, again under
the condition of not allowing ART coverage to go below the 2013 level of 46% (HIV
prevention costs are kept constant for this projection). Unit costs are as per Table 2.
Average health care costs per PLHIV per year are set at USD 141.55. ART costs,
averaging at USD 440 overall, are split into costs of first-line ARVs (USD 193.50) and
second-line ARVs (USD 1,059.38).

   HIV response costs are projected to rise gradually as new HIV infections occur and
    new and old HIV infections require treatment, with the additional effect on costs as
    the Sudan population grows.

   New, post-2013 HIV infections play an important part in overall future treatment
    commitments.

   This projection emphasizes the need for higher-impact HIV prevention
    targeting in order to reduce the projected future health care costs.

4.7 Optimized allocations to minimize the cost of
    achieving 2016 impact targets
Lastly, the modelling looked at the optimization objective of minimizing spending to
achieve impact targets of 25% reduction in HIV incidence and deaths in the short-term,
by 2016.

     The modelling analysis estimates that about USD 8.1 million would need to
be allocated annually to four priority interventions until 2016. This would lead to
the achievement of the 2016 impact targets (of 25% reduction in HIV incidence
and deaths).

   ART and prevention services for FSW, their clients and MSM would need to be
    prioritized.

    -   Allocations to ART would increase from 23% to 40% of all programmatic
        funding
    -   Instead of allocating 9% of all programmatic funding to FSW interventions,
        23% would be allocated.
    -   Other increases would be from 7% to 16% (high-risk males/clients), and
        from 3% to 21% (MSM).
   Programs targeted at the low-risk general population would need to be de-
    prioritized (HCT, condoms), and the same would apply to PMTCT.
                                                                                      Results | 43



    Such annual investment of USD 8.1 million, optimally allocated to achieve the
impact targets, would reduce HIV incidence and deaths in all populations—
Figure 33.

   The HIV incidence target would, according to our model prediction, be exceeded
    while the AIDS death target of 25% reduction would be achieved.

   Reducing deaths beyond a certain level becomes very expensive as more lower-
    risk people need to be screened to identify HIV cases and eventually treat them to
    ensure their survival.

5. Discussion

5.1 Epidemic spread and potential
Although Sudan has a low-level HIV epidemic, HIV prevalence levels have recently
been measured as high as 7.7% in FSW in Red Sea and about 10% in non-Sudanese
FSW in Kassala, and 6.3% in MSM in Kassala and 4.1% in South Darfur. In the general
population, HIV prevalence reached 0.54% in Red Sea, and 0.39% in PMTCT clients in
Red Sea and Kassala. However, many other population groups encounter very low HIV
risks. The epidemic spread is therefore highly variable by population group and location,
and this knowledge must be used in HIV strategy and decision-making.

    Considering the large differential in HIV prevalence between the main key
populations (FSW and MSM) and the general population, it follows that these key
populations drive HIV incidence via their sexual contacts. Our epidemic modelling
analysis identified FSW, MSM and SW clients as net transmitters. Men above 50 years
of age also showed up as net transmitters in the analysis, this could be due to male
circumcision (which is known to reduce men’s chance to acquire HIV in a risk contact),
or advanced, untreated HIV infections in this demographic.

    According to the Optima model, 31% of transmission events in 2013 were
directly associated with sex work, and our model outputs suggest that many
infections in the general population have indirectly arisen from sex work-linked
transmission events. It was estimated that in every ~200 FSW, there was a new HIV
infection in 2013, and in every ~300 MSM and every ~1,000 SW clients there was a
new infection. In the general population, new infections in females were much
rarer (circa 1 per 5,000), and very rare in males (circa 1 per 10,000). Different sets
of survey data on FSW and MSM suggest low HIV comprehensive knowledge (3 –
40%); low (11%) consistent condom while less than a quarter (4 – 24%) ever had an
HIV test.

    Since measured data on temporal HIV trends are scarce, the projected
course of the epidemic is uncertain. Our analysis predicted that there may be a
small increase in the HIV incidence rate in adults and children if interventions remain at
the same level. However, even small increases in the HIV incidence rate, combined
with the underlying population growth, can lead to significant additional HIV burden



                                                                                       45

over longer time frames. Our projections indicate that if expenditure in each HIV
program was kept constant until 2030, the number of new infections per year could
double between 2013 and 2030.          Due to the lack of supportive survey data, such
predictions need to be treated with caution. But the findings of this analysis suggest
that Sudan’s HIV epidemic may not contract without decisive action on allocative
choices leading to better impact of the HIV investments.


5.2 Funding for health and HIV interventions
Sudan’s health and HIV programs are supported by external financing; 29–64%
of all health spend (2009–12 range) and 62% of HIV spend (2011) was financed
from external sources. Although total aid disbursements have decreased gradually
since 2008, aid for health was essentially maintained, indicating the relative importance
given to health within the country assistance strategies. In 2012, 15 dollars of every
100 aid dollars were for health. Equally, 15 dollars of every 100 health-aid dollars were
for HIV over the period 2002–12. Given that HIV remains a minor cause of disease
burden across the country, the data suggest that HIV/AIDS attracts relatively more aid
money than other disease conditions i.e. 15.3% allocated to HIV within all health aid.
Looking at total health expenditure, HIV/AIDS consumes a small amount—in 2012, less
than half a percent of all health expenditure was for HIV/AIDS (USD 18. 5 million of
USD 4.1 billion total health spend).

    Much of Sudan’s health expenditure is by private households. In 2012, private out -
of-pocket expenditure exceeded USD 3 billion while the public sector spent about USD
1.0 billion. The proportion of total government expenditure for health was at
10.6% in 2012, according to the NHA database, and it remains to be seen if Sudan
raises this proportion further and attains the 15% by 2015, in line with the Abuja
Declaration.

    Annual donor funding for HIV/AIDS has fluctuated heavily, suggesting that
program sustainability and predictability of available resources is a challenge for
program implementation. In the last three years, the total HIV expenditure has
decreased, essentially due to steeply decreasing external support from USD 14.5
million in 2011 to 12.3 in 2012 and 9.1 in 2013.

    According to national resource tracking data of 2013, a relatively low proportion of
HIV funding was directed to key populations—approximately 6% of all HIV expenditure
was for FSW and MSM programs.
                                                                           Discussion | 47



This situation, characterized by:

   a stable or possibly growing HIV epidemic,

   the low-level type of the HIV epidemic but low spending on key population
    interventions,

   high fluctuation in external funding support for HIV and health

   generally decreasing HIV budgets, and

   the need to demonstrate value for money for investors in the HIV response

   called for an analysis of the allocative efficiency of the HIV response and the
modelling of impact of HIV investment options.


5.3 Optimal HIV resource allocation for impact and
    sustainability
The National HIV strategy has been updated to cover the period 2015–17 (NSP III).
There was an intention to scale-up interventions and targets that will impact HIV
infection and death rates. This allocative efficiency analysis generated estimates and
investment scenarios to support the Sudanese government in designing an impactful
and cost-effective HIV response.

    The analysis had several optimization objectives which included optimal HIV
incidence and HIV-related DALY impact, minimal costs to attain international HIV
incidence and AIDS mortality targets, minimal future spending commitments,
and minimal expenditure to reach the NSP impact targets. We defined moderate
and ambitous target levels to explore annual resource needs. The time horizons of
2013 to 2016, 2020 and 2030 were used. We defined 10 populations in the Optima
model, but were not able to include other relevant populations (populations of
humanitarian concern, PWID, prisoners) due to lack of data. Seven programs (or
service packages) with direct HIV impact were defined and included in the optimization
steps. All prevention programs included condoms, HTC and SBCC, and the ART
package included HIV testing. One programmatic expenditure, PLHIV support, was
included in the overall discussion but not in the optimization due to lack of data on the
relationship between this expenditure and HIV impact. We used USD 6.4 million as the
baseline scenario for program-related annual HIV expenditure, and USD 12.2 million
for total HIV spend (data derived from 2013 DSA). In the course of the analysis, we ran
48 | Discussion



two scenarios concerning PMTCT unit costs to give specific input into the allocative
efficiency of investing in this program.
    We found that an allocatively efficient HIV response geared towards
minimizing HIV incidence could avert an additional 19,000 (36%) of new HIV
infections by 2020. It would also avert an estimated additional 6,744 AIDS deaths.
Optimal allocative efficiency would be obtained if investment in FSW interventions
tripled (from 4% to 15%) and more than doubled for client interventions (from 4% to
10%), if MSM spend significantly increased (from 2% to 6%), and ART spend was
raised (from 12% to 22%). Programs for the low-risk, general population would only
become important at 700% of the baseline budget (USD45 million). In general, higher
funding levels would buy further HIV incidence reduction, but optimal allocation of
baseline-level resources was more important than more funding for medium-term HIV
incidence reduction up to 2020.

    PMTCT would not receive funding up to 200% of total 2013 spending, if 2013
unit costs were used (Table 2) due to its low HIV impact in a low-level epidemic
and the fact that vertical transmissions are not usually transmitted onward in a
time frame of 15–20 years (any vertically infected children would need to survive and
become sexually active to pose a transmission risk). Only with a very substantial
reduction of unit cost as envisaged in the 2015–17 NSP budget, PMTCT would
receive funding if 170% or more of 2013 spending was available. If less funding is
available, not investing in PMTCT would create fiscal space for other, higher-impact
HIV programs (essentially HIV prevention for KPs) and thereby indirectly avert more
new HIV infections in children. For PMTCT programs to be cost-effective, further
reductions in cost per HIV positive pregnant woman identified would be required. The
2015–17 NSP budget already foresees important unit cost reductions compared to
2013 spending, and these would primarily arise by better geographical targeting of
PMTCT. The 2015–17 NSP also includes syphilis testing in parallel to HIV testing.
Cost-effectiveness of the program might also be achieved by routine diagnosis and
treatment of syphilis among pregnant women and thereby reducing stillbirths and
neonatal syphilis.

    Optimizing resource allocation for averting HIV-related DALYs instead of HIV
incidence required a similar intervention mix but with even higher allocations to
ART. At 2013 levels of spending, the scenarios for reducing DALYs and new infections
included the same four key interventions (ART and prevention among FSW, MSM and
higher risk men). With reduced availability of funding, further prioritization would be
needed. If only 50% of 2013 funding was available, prevention among key populations
                                                                                             Discussion | 49



would receive all funding for minimizing incidence, and ART plus FSW prevention
would receive virtually all funding for reducing DALYs. In any case, the strong focus on
ART would require excellent targeting of HTC efforts in order to identify HIV cases, and
strong pre-ART services to ensure ART initiation of PLHIV as soon as eligible for
treatment.

     Optimal      annual      allocations       from      2014     to   2030      to   minimize       fiscal
commitments up to 2050 again called for a very similar allocation mix. This
suggests that the model-proposed intervention mix for HIV programs is robust for
minimizing different important objectives of preventing HIV transmission, HIV morbidity,
HIV mortality and HIV long-term costs. Table 5 shows a summary of the model outputs.

     Our other optimization objectives produced relevant findings for short- to
medium-term coverage targets. Model outputs on resource requirements suggested
that achieving high PMTCT coverage is very costly and has low impact. In addition, the
modelling analysis showed that achieving a large reduction in deaths is more resource
intensive than a large reduction in HIV incidence. Preventing deaths requires
identification of a large proportion of PLHIV, getting them enrolled into treatment and
realizing high ART adherence. As HIV infection is already disseminated to some extent
in the wider population (but with low probability of onward transmission), case finding
for ART is a challenge outside the KPs. In contrast, HIV incidence reductions can be
achieved with selective program scale-up among higher-risk populations, with
secondary HIV prevention benefits in all other population groups. One of our key
50 | Discussion



findings was that targeting programmatic resources almost exclusively to KPs
and to ART—while de-prioritizing general population programs—leads to HIV
incidence reductions in all populations over the medium term, at lowest cost.
We also estimated the minimum spending to achieve the impact targets of 25%
reduction in HIV incidence and deaths by 2016, which was about USD 8.1 million per
year until 2016, with the HIV incidence target more feasible than the mortality target.

     ART investment showed up in all optimizations as an allocatively efficient
choice. In 2013, reported treatment adherence was 69.1%, 55.5%, 42.5% at 12, 24
and 60 months, respectively (GARPR report 2014). This is significantly lower than the
WHO-reported LMIC average of 86%, 82% and 72%, respectively (WHO 2013
progress report). Improvements at different stages of the treatment cascade are in
progress, but it is reported that practical constraints like availability of HIV test kits,
shortages in trained staff and confusion around roles and responsibilities can slow
down actual implementation progress. Improved ART adherence, but also earlier
treatment initiation, are important clinical and public health goals for the Sudanese ART
program. 13 Our analysis suggested older men being net HIV transmitters and it is
plausible that low ART access plays a role.

     Two particular HIV programs show low impact in our modelling analysis: HTC
services for the general population, and the PMTCT program. Based on the reported
VCT statistics, the VCT centres have on average screened very few people per time
unit. Re-purposing these services to target higher-risk populations is an important step
to take ART to scale. For PMTCT, this analysis was able to use site-statistics and it
was evident that also the PMTCT sites will need review. Given that there are some
PMTCT sites with higher prevalence of positive women (9 of 254 sites reporting
prevalence of 1% or greater), it seems important to maintain a geographically
prioritized PMTCT program. This analysis suggests that a national scale-up of the
PMTCT program cannot be justified based on cost-effectiveness considerations in the
Sudanese context, where 75% of the PMTCT sites (192 sites) did not identify a single
case of HIV during 2013. Nevertheless, there are a few high-priority sites which
reported HIV prevalence above 1% in expectant mothers. HIV prevalence in expectant
mothers mirrors HIV prevalence patterns in the wider population and is geographically
heterogeneous. The Optima model estimates that about 12% of all new infections are


13
     The 2013 HIV test treat and retain cascade analysis, described in the GARPR report 2014, found that 18%
     of PLHIV know their HIV status and were mostly in late stages of disease. 2012 data from Omdurman ART
     center in Khartoum state, the largest center in Sudan, showed that 81% of newly diagnosed PLHIV were
     stages 3 and 4.
                                                                                              Discussion | 51



vertically transmitted, but that reaching national PMTCT coverage of 60% or higher is
very costly and the investment could have higher prevention impact if allocated to other
HIV programs. Also, with the prevalence of maternal syphilis at about 2.3%, it would
appear that screening pregnant women routinely for syphilis is a better health
investment in the context of overall expansion and improvement of maternal, neonatal
and child health services.

     In our optimization analysis, the outputs all point to the importance of
increasing HIV program coverage in FSW and their clients, as well as MSM, and
concomitantly decreasing the investment in the general population program
(Table 5). For this to succeed, a conducive environment is required to enable key
populations to freely access the commodities and services they need. Although our
expenditure analysis did not include costs for advocacy and communication, we
acknowledge the importance of investing in working with community leaders,
gatekeepers, politicians, regulatory bodies and opinion makers like the press.
The increased implication of civil society organizations and PLHIV groups in Sudan is a
positive sign. Official reports talk about the opposing religious views on HIV
interventions, key population targeting and condom promotion. They also highlight how
late many PLHIV arrive for treatment, due to stigma and low service use by
marginalized populations. Sudan has formulated its strategy for key populations: “to
provide or link specifically tailored prevention services to key populations (MSM, FSW
and their clients) and vulnerable groups (prisoners, refugees, internally displaced
populations, cross-border populations, tea-sellers, raksha and truck drivers, university
students, soldiers and policemen). The service package constitutes of peer education,
condom distribution, information exchange communication, HIV counselling and testing,
STI diagnosis and treatment, and reproductive health services” (GARPR report 2014).
This KP strategy now needs to be taken to scale, condom procurement problems
need to be prevented, and condoms promoted in a culturally acceptable way.
     A recent modelling analysis by Steen et al. (2014) 14 on the effect of sex work
interventions in a Kenyan setting is informative for the Sudan situation too:

          Removing transmission from sex work would have resulted in 66% lower HIV
     incidence and 56% lower prevalence after 20 years. High rates of condom use in
     sex work had the greatest effect, whereas STI treatment contributed to HIV
     declines at lower levels of condom use. Interventions reaching the 40% of sex

    workers with most clients reduced HIV transmission nearly as much as less
    targeted approaches attempting to reach all sex workers. The authors conclude
    that ‘upstream’ transmission in sex work remains important in advanced African
    HIV epidemics. Feasible condom and STI interventions that reach the most
    active sex workers can markedly reduce the size of HIV epidemics (extracted
    from Steen, et al. 2014).

    For key population service planning, more needs to be known in Sudan
about the heterogeneous target groups (typologies, venue profiling), the gaps in
current service provision (programmatic mapping), and population size by
location (geographic mapping). Little is known about the scale of injecting drug use
and HIV in people who inject drugs—the 2011 Integrated Bio-Behavioral HIV
Surveillance Survey (IBBS) found that 2.1% of MSM and 0.9% of FSW injected drugs
in the past 12 months with ranges of 0 to 5% and 0 to 8%, respectively, in different
sites. It was, however, noted by a key informant that questions on injections may not
only be interpreted in the context of illicit drug use, but include misreporting of
hormonal contraceptive use by FSW or other (medical) injections. Figure 34 shows
HIV prevalence levels in FSW (purple) and MSM (orange) by area of recruitment into
the IBBS. Such strategic data on local epidemics are highly valuable for geographic
prioritization of investment in KP services.

5.4 Reducing HIV response costs through more
    efficient processes in implementation and
    management
There are ongoing efforts in Sudan to restructure HIV and health programs based on
bottleneck and situational analyses, joint program reviews, and lessons learnt. For
instance, the Federal Ministry of Health issued a directive for the integration of all the
nine vertical HIV and health programs with the aim to reduce the fragmentation of the
health system and efficiently expand HIV interventions within existent pathways in a
cost effective manner e.g. incorporating HIV supply chain within the existent central
medical stores supply system (GARPR narrative report 2014). Another important
integration effort is happening specifically between reproductive health and HIV. These
integration initiatives preceded the official ministerial directives and their experience is
used to guide the integration process that is currently implemented at federal level.

     In ART, the current emphasis is not to increase the number of HIV treatment
outlets but to increase detection of HIV cases, improve the efficiency of linkage of HIV
detected cases to care services and to address attrition factors and provide support to

retain them within care. Such attempts to integrate HIV and improve linkages between
services will help to make the HIV response more technically efficient and sustainable,
and reduce costs which arise in vertical programs. Another important effort is linkage
between public sector programs and civil society in the form of working partnerships.
These multi-sectoral partnerships are especially important for providing comprehensive
services for key populations and ensuring an enabling environment for service
provision to key population members.

    Official reports also present the joint monitoring missions by developmental
agencies and government counterparts as an additional interaction mechanism which
can help increase efficiency and reduce the waste of HIV resources. Similarly, joint
training between HIV and other health programs, and between public and civil society
sectors are ways to promote integrated service delivery and has the potential for cost-
saving synergies, as promoted for HIV and reproductive health services in Sudan.

    This analysis focused on optimizing likely future budgets, and it was
observed that more impact could be gained in the HIV response if there was
additional funding for HIV interventions. One strategy to increase the programmatic
budget is to identify savings which could be made in non-programmatic expenditure
areas such as management and coordination. Figure 22 showed that a third of the
total HIV expenditure of 2013 was for management support (and 4% for strategic
information). Figure 35 illustrates the relative shares of different management
expenditures in Sudan’s 2013 HIV spend. Almost 18% of the HIV response budget was
used for planning, coordination and program management fees.
The graph also shows PLHIV income generation expenditure, which has a unit
cost of around USD 700 per person/year. This intervention reaches around 300
persons of an estimated 43,000 PLHIV in 2013, i.e., 0.7%, and it therefore very
small scale as of now. The PLHIV income generation activities are designed as a
revolving fund and consume a substantial portion of the PLHIV associations’ budgets
(PLHIV association with federal headquarters and 15 representations in different
states).

     With the decreasing overall budgets for the HIV response in the last three
NASA years 2011–13, the share of program management expenditure has also
decreased (Figure 36). International comparison shows that while Sudan’s
management expenditure was very high in 2011 and 2012 (41% and 52%), it reduced
to 35% in 2013 (the graph uses the total management expenditure from the NASA
system which includes some infrastructure and M&E expenditure).

6. Conclusions
Sudan’s 2014–16 National HIV Strategy already builds on many insights and lessons
learnt. This allocative efficiency study was conducted to specifically support decision-
making on relative HIV allocations within the overall HIV response, and demographic
as well as geographic targeting and prioritization of HIV interventions. It led to the main
conclusion that Sudan’s HIV response allocations could be enhanced by focusing
prevention on FSW, their clients and MSM, while scaling up ART based on an
HTC strategy that is targeted geographically and to key populations.

Sudan’s HIV response resource allocations should focus on key populations
because of the following reasons:

1.   Epidemiologically: Sudan has a low-level HIV epidemic which is unlikely to bet
     generalized in its context of near-universal male circumcision. However, the
     populations causing most HIV transmission (FSW, their clients, MSM) are not
     adequately served to prevent onward transmission of HIV; treatment as prevention
     is hampered by low and late case identification and limited ART adherence; supply
     chains for HIV reagents and condoms report failures and condom promotion faces
     cultural barriers. As a consequence the annual number of new HIV infections is
     projected to slowly rise unless the HIV response increases its prevention
     impact.

2.   Programmatically: HIV resources are spent on populations with very low HIV risk
     of 1 in 5,000–10,000 new infections per year and low AIDS-related DALYs.
     PMTCT provision is scaled up to many areas where no HIV case is identified in a
     whole year; some VCT services experience low demand and until recently targeted
     low-risk individuals. HIV money needs to be directed towards the key
     populations who are most likely to be infected, develop AIDS and spread HIV
     to others, with a focus on those typologies of sex workers and MSM with
     high partner acquisition rates. HIV highlights the pernicious health effects of
     social and legal marginalization and of gender inequalities in Sudan, and offers an
     opportunity to redress.

3.   Economically: Aid supporting the Sudanese public health sector has in the past
     prioritized HIV above other diseases (15 of every 100 health-dollar given was for
     HIV), and the HIV response is heavily reliant on external support (averaging at



                                                                                        57
58 | Conclusions



     64% in the 2011–13). With international and domestic public sector contributions to
     the HIV response rapidly decreasing over the last three years, bold decisions
     need to be made. Better value for money needs to be achieved, by
     addressing the epidemic in a targeted, cost-effective manner leading to
     higher returns on investment.

4.   Fiscally: Every new HIV infection represents a future treatment liability for the
     Sudanese government. According to our model outputs on future HIV-related
     healthcare costs, allocating specific shares of HIV resources to key
     populations and to ART scale-up minimizes long-term fiscal costs for the
     government (and the same allocative split between HIV interventions also
     reduces HIV incidence and averts the maximum of HIV-related DALYs).

5.   Sustainability: The results presented in this report can guide Sudan’s allocative
     choices to make the HIV response more sustainable and HIV investments more
     defendable in a health sector with multiple investment needs. The model-
     proposed allocation mix for HIV programs is robust for minimizing different
     important policy objectives of minimizing HIV transmission, HIV morbidity
     and mortality, and long-term AIDS-related costs. Importantly, the model
     demonstrates that through indirect effects, HIV impact is obtained in all
     population groups, even if prevention programs are targeted to populations
     are higher risk of HIV.

On the use of the Optima model:

1.   Optima provided policy-relevant information for HIV allocative decision making in
     Sudan and highlights once more the need for updated strategic information
     especially on key populations driving HIV incidence, as well as for detailed
     programmatic and expenditure tracking data.

2.   It is very useful to explore the logic chain of an NSP result framework with a
     mathematical model like Optima, which relates HIV spending to targets at the
     levels of sexual behaviour, HIV program coverage and epidemic impact, and helps
     test assumptions on the resource needs to achieve objectives―in Sudan, it
     appears for instance that meeting the NSP’s HIV incidence target requires less
     resources than the AIDS mortality target or a moderate PMTCT coverage target.
     Future   results   frameworks   would   benefit   from   model-informed    targets.

1.1.       Data Collation and Synthesis
Performing our evaluations of HIV prevention and treatment programs required a large
amount of data describing the HIV epidemiology, population demographics, acquisition-
related behavior, clinical characteristics, and HIV program and health costs.

1.1.1.     Data Collation

To evaluate programs, their funding, coverage and outcomes we collated data from all
available publications, documents, reports, and data files. The data included:

1.   Estimated population sizes for the general population and the key populations or
     most at-risk populations (MARPs).

2.   The epidemiological characteristics of the HIV epidemic. Specifically we obtained
     data on:

     -   HIV prevalence;
     -   Annual HIV diagnoses;
     -   Number of people currently on first- and second-line antiretroviral therapy
         (ART);
     -   Number of people on ART;
     -   Number of reported or estimated mother-to-child transmissions.
3.   Descriptions of risk behaviors, HIV transmission patterns, and health-care seeking
     behavior. We used this data to understand modes of HIV transmission between
     populations and the risk of HIV acquisition. Specific data collected includes:

     -   Sexual behaviors (e.g., number of sexual partners and level of condom usage in
         sexual acts);
     -   Rates at which people in specific populations test for HIV.
4.   HIV Program funding, spending data from National AIDS Spending Assessments
     and health utilities for PLHIV at all stages of disease progression.

     Disability Weights

     In our analysis, we used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to measure the
overall impact of HIV programs and for basic health economic calculations. The most
thorough empirical study of disability weights is the 2010 Global Burden of Disease



                                                                                       59

Note: The disability-weight for HIV-positive PWID is the maximum of the value for HIV-negative PWID and the
corresponding HIV-positive category disability weight.

1.1.2. The Optima Model

We use the Optima model to calculate the change in HIV incidence and the number of
HIV/AIDS deaths due to changes in funding. Optima is sufficiently flexible to track
epidemics and behavioral parameters over time to produce long-term forecasts, and to
allow us to conduct allocative efficiency analyses. Optima uses best-practice HIV
epidemic modeling techniques and incorporates realistic biological transmission
processes, detailed infection progression, and sexual mixing patterns and drug
injection behaviors. Optima describes the impact of HIV programs indirectly through
their influence on behavioral and clinical parameters.

1.1.3. Model of HIV Transmission and Progression

Optima incorporates a model of HIV transmission and progression. The model uses a
coupled system of ordinary differential equations to track the transmission of HIV and
the movement of infected people between 21 health states (Annex figure 1). The model
                                                 Annex 1: Technical Data in Optima Model | 61



distinguishes people who are undiagnosed, diagnosed, and on effective anti-retroviral
therapy (ART). Diagnosis of HIV-infected individuals occurs based on a HIV testing
rate dependent on CD4 count and population type. Similarly, diagnosed individuals
begin treatment at a CD4 count dependent rate. The model tracks those on successful
first- or second-line treatment (who have an increasing CD4 count) and those with
treatment failure.

Annex Figure 1.   HIV Infection Progression




    HIV infections occur through the interaction between different populations via
regular, casual, or commercial sexual partnerships.

    The force-of-infection for a population determines rate at which uninfected
individuals within the population become infected. This depends on the number of risk
events individuals are exposed to in a given period and the infection probability of each
event. Sexual transmission risk depends on:

   The number of people in each HIV-infected stage (that is, the prevalence of HIV
    infection in partner populations)

   The average number of casual, regular and commercial homosexual and
    heterosexual partnerships per person

   The average frequency of sexual acts per partnership

   The proportion of these acts in which condoms are used

   The efficacy of condoms

   The extent of male circumcision

   The prevalence of ulcerative STIs (which increase transmission probability)
62 | Annex 1: Technical Data in Optima Model



    The stage of infection (chronic, AIDS-related illness/late stage, or on treatment) for
the HIV-positive partner in a sero-discordant couple also influences transmission risk—
due to different levels of infectiousness in each infection stage.

Mathematically, we calculate the force-of-infection using:



    where     is the force-of-infection,       is the transmission probability of each event,
and n is the effective number of at-risk events (thus n gives the average number
interaction events with infected people where HIV transmission may occur). The value
of the transmission probability      is inversely related to CD4 count, differs for different
modes of transmission (heterosexual or homosexual intercourse, intravenous drug
injection), and may be modified by behavioral interventions (for example, condom use
or circumcision). The number of events n not only incorporates the total number of
events, but also other factors that moderate the possibility that these events are
capable of transmitting infection, such as condom use or circumcision. There is one
force-of-infection term for each type of interaction (for example, casual sexual
relationships between low-risk males and indirect female sex workers), and the force-
of-infection for a given population will be the sum of overall interaction types.

    Optima calculates the number of children infected through mother-to-child
transmission using the birthrate and prevalence of HIV in female population groups.
Children who are breastfed have a higher risk of acquiring HIV than those who are not
breastfed in the model. Prevention of mother-to-children programs reduce the overall
probability of children acquiring HIV through a multiplicative factor equal to one minus
the product of the efficacy of PMTCT and coverage of PMTCT.

    In addition to the force-of-infection rate, in which individuals move from uninfected
to infected states, individuals may move between health states via seven other
pathways:

   Individuals may die, either due to the background death rate (which affects all
    populations equally), due to injecting behavior, or due to HIV/AIDS (which depends
    on CD4 count)

   In the absence of intervention, individuals progress from higher to lower CD4
    counts

   Individuals can move from undiagnosed to diagnosed states based on their HIV
    testing rate, which is a function of CD4 count (for example, people with AIDS
                                                 Annex 1: Technical Data in Optima Model | 63



    symptoms have a higher testing rate) and population type (for example, IDUs
    usually get tested more frequently than low-risk males).

   Diagnosed individuals may move onto treatment, at a rate dependent on CD4 count

   Individuals may move from treatment to treatment failure, and

   From treatment failure onto second-line treatment

   Finally, while on successful first- or second-line treatment, individuals may progress
    from lower to higher CD4 count.

    In total, the model for Sudan accommodates 210 compartments (10 populations
each with 21 health states), and the change in the number of people in each
compartment is determined by the sum over the relevant rates described above
multiplied by the compartments on which they act. For example, the number of
individuals in the compartment corresponding to undiagnosed female sex workers with
a CD4 count between 200 and 350 cells/µL changes according to the following
equation:




    where              is the current population size of people with undiagnosed HIV

and with a CD4 count between 350 and 500 cells/μL,                  is the population size

of the compartment with lower CD4 count (200–350 cells/μL),                is the disease
progression rate for the given CD4 count,     is the death rate, and     is the HIV testing
rate. (Note: this example does not consider movement between populations, such as
female sex workers returning to the low-risk female population and vice versa.) Each
compartment (boxes in Figure 37) corresponds to a single differential equation in the
model, and each rate (arrows in Figure 37) corresponds to a single term in that
equation.

    Most of the parameters in the model are related to calculating the force-of-
infection; a list of model parameters is provided in Annex table 3. We interpret
Empirical estimates for model parameter values in Bayesian terms as prior distributions.

 the force-of-infection.

1.1.4. Calibration to the HIV epidemic data

We calibrated Optima to Sudan’s HIV epidemic to match available population group
HIV prevalence data, overall annual diagnoses, and the uptake of ART. While primarily
calibrated to match epidemiological data, Optima also optimizes input parameters to
match available demographic, behavioral, biological and clinical data. Given the
challenges inherent in quantifying all known constraints on an epidemic, we calibrated
the model manually, with oversight by and collaboration with in-country stakeholders
where possible.

1.1.5. Reconciliation with cost-outcome relationships

The parameter values for the best-fit simulation in 2013 need to match the outcome
values corresponding to the estimated 2013 spending levels in the cost-outcome
relationships (described in detail in Annex 2). Otherwise, there will be a mismatch in
parameter values for future projections and a sharp change in epidemiological trends
even if there is no change in spending. Depending on the parameters affected or the
available country data, we either adjust the calibration to match the data used in the
logistic cost-outcome curves or adjust the cost-outcome curves to match the calibration.

1.2. Optimal allocation
To investigate the potential impact of future HIV prevention programs we ran model
projections into the future from 2013 under different investment or programmatic
scenarios.

1.2.1. Optimization of Program Allocation

The primary aim for our analysis is to determine the allocation of resources or spending
required that best meet the specific objectives described in Section 1.2.

    For each of these objectives we used Optima with the best-fitting simulation and an
adaptive stochastic linear gradient-descent optimization method [15] to determine the
allocation of funding best achieving these objectives for a specific budget. In this
method, Optima starts with a fixed budget with program funding allocated randomly. At
each step of the optimization process Optima determines the expected behavioral and
clinical parameters associated with each program’s funding level using the logistic cost -
outcome relationships.

Annex 2. Cost-outcome curves
A central component of our analyses is the relationships between the cost of HIV
prevention programs and the resulting outcomes. Such relationships are required in our
analyses, to understand how incremental changes in spending ultimately affect HIV
epidemics and determine the optimal funding allocation. Our analysis requires country-
specific relationships for each risk-population and prevention program. A large amount
of behavioral and spending data is required, to inform such relationships.

    We used an ecological “top-down” approach to relate program cost and outcomes.
For each risk population, we derived a set of relationships directly linking estimated
funding to behavioral data for the population’s primary risk-behavior. We describe our
approach in detail below. To produce these relationships we assume indirect costs
have no direct impact on HIV transmission parameters; but changes to HIV programs
may affect these costs to supply additional condoms, clean syringes, and methadone,
for example. A limitation of our approach is the assumption that all changes in behavior
are assumed to be due to changes in program funding.


2.1. Methodological details
    We use a logistic or sigmoid function to model cost-outcome relationships. This
type of function can incorporate initial startup costs, which may have no direct effect on
a behavioral outcome, and allow changes in behavior to saturate at high spending
levels. Using our data synthesis, we identified years where both spending data and
outcome data were available for each model population. We then used this data to fit a
four parameter logistic function of the form


                    ,
    where x is the estimated amount of funding for the population, A is the lower
asymptote value, B is the upper asymptote value, C is the point of maximum change,
and D is the growth rate. Our fits were further constrained using an assumed range for
the maximum/saturation value of the outcome. We estimated this saturation range
subjectively, based on data from high income countries where funding is effectively
unlimited.

    We fitted the logistic function to the available data and saturation range using
Matlab© 2013a with a trust region reflective algorithm [13]. We then adjusted each fit to
reflect assumed zero spending values and expected changes in outcomes with
increases in spending—with further adjustments to remove unrealistic trends, to

reconcile with calibrated outcome values, and in response to feedback from in-country
stakeholders.
