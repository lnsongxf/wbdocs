   1. Policy Frameworks
      A number of strategic documents refer to school feeding as a tool to improve the learning
      environment and food security. However, no explicit reference was made to the school
      feeding project within Jordan’s draft Poverty Alleviation Strategy (2013–2020). An explicit
      reference to school feeding is found in the government action plan 2013–2020, especially
      in the public education sector and the national strategy of school health. School feeding is
      listed in the draft food security strategy currently being drafted by the Ministry of
      Agriculture (2014–2019).

   2. Financial Capacity
      School feeding is listed in the national planning system. Although school feeding financing
      from the state’s budget is stable, it does not fulfill the total requirements needed for
      accessing all targeted students and covering all school days. Furthermore, no budget line
      is in place for school feeding expenditures at the local level or the school level.

   3. Institutional Capacity and Coordination
      A multisector steering committee was formed (Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health,
      Jordanian Armed Forces, Food and Drug Administration, Royal Health Awareness Society,
      Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation, World Food Program, Social and
      Industrial Foodservice Institute) to supervise the implementation of the school feeding
      project at the national level. A unit is in place to manage the school feeding project at the
      central level, but it has limited resources and staff; although a coordination mechanism
      has been set up with national and local entities, its performance is not sufficient. As for
      mechanisms of managing school feeding at the school level, schools are provided with the
      needed details of the coordination mechanisms, but those mechanisms are not fully
      implemented.

   4. Design and Implementation
      The school feeding program currently reaches about 350,000 male and female students,
      compared with 170,000 students in 2012 and 2013. This increase was a result of the
      partnership between the Ministry of Education and the World Food Programme. Criteria
      are in place to target poor areas according to the government’s published periodic
      poverty report. The project is managed by a team at the central level at the ministry, in
      addition to a monitoring system at the directories and school levels; however, it needs
      improvement.

   5. Communicating Roles—Reaching Beyond Schools
      In spite of an active civil society in Jordan, no systems or mechanisms are set up to
      consult with parents, members of the local community, civil society, and the private
      sector on school feeding program design or monitoring and evaluation issues

Introduction
This report presents an assessment of school feeding policies and institutions that affect young children in Jordan. The
analysis is based on a World Bank tool developed as part of the Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER)
an initiative that aims to systematically assess education systems against evidence-based global standards and good
practice to assist countries in reforming their education systems for proper learning for all.

School feeding policies are a critical component of an effective education system, given that children's health and nutrition
impact their school attendance, ability to learn, and overall development. A school feeding program is a specific school-
based health service, which can be part of a country’s broader school health program, and often a large amount of
resources is invested in a school feeding program. SABER–School Feeding collects, analyzes, and disseminates
comprehensive information on school feeding policies around the world. The overall objective of the initiative is to help
countries design effective policies to improve their education systems, facilitate comparative policy analysis, identify key
areas to focus investment, and assist in disseminating good practice.

In late 2013, the World Food Programme (WFP) launched a Revised WFP School Feeding Policy that incorporates SABER–
School Feeding. The revised policy requires every WFP country office with a school feeding component to undertake a
policy dialogue with the Education Sector in the country as part of capacity building activities. WFP decided to use SABER–
School Feeding as one of their policy tools to guide the policy dialogue and to assess in a more systematic way the
transition of school feeding programs to national ownership and/or the strengthening of national school feeding
programs. WFP will integrate this tool into their project preparation from 2015 onwards.

Jordan in Brief
The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a middle-income country with an estimated population of 6.76 million. In 2014 it was
no. 77 among 187 countries on the Human Development Indicators. Most of Jordan's population reside in urban areas,
centered in the governorates of Amman, Irbid, and Zarqa.

Since 1999 the state has taken important steps for economic reform, such as privatization, price liberation, and
encouraging foreign investments, which led to an annual growth rate of 6 percent. However, the gap between the rich
and the poor remains. The rate of growth during the global economic crisis decreased to 2 percent in 2009 and 3.3 percent
between 2010 and 2013, with a budget deficit and a general rise in prices, severely impacting the poor in the country and
their food security. The inflation rate reached 50 percent, the primary contributors being the prices of food and energy.
Jordan also received a large number of Syrian refugees, which affected all strata in society, especially poor families in the
host communities, where poverty rates increased from 13.3 percent in 2009 to 14.4 percent in 2010.

Agriculture plays an important role in the economic and social system of rural communities. The agricultural sector
contributes to the GDP by 2.8 percent, employing 3.5 percent of the total workforce. The agricultural sector in Jordan
faces problems and challenges, represented by successive years of drought, rain fluctuation, limited agricultural lands,
scarcity of water resources, and various risks, in addition to fragmentation of agricultural land ownership and high labor
costs. Agricultural production covers only 15 percent of the food needs in Jordan.

The state identified 32 poverty pockets where poverty rates exceed 25 percent. In 2008, WFP undertook a food security
assessment to measure the impact of food price hikes in marginalized areas; this study confirmed the existence of high
rates of food insecurity and vulnerability. An investigative study of food security conducted in 2010 indicated that food
consumption in poverty pockets is marginal for 25 percent of the population, while food consumption at the national level
is weak or marginal for only 5.2 percent of the population. Studies of family health in Jordan indicate anemia deficiency
among 34 percent of children under five, especially among poor families in rural areas and in the southern areas of the
country.

The government adopted a national system for social security networks that consists of cash assistance programs, food
assistance, bread subsidies, free health insurance, and school feeding. The government also focuses on empowering poor

population groups through establishing sustainable local economies, encouraging local participation therein, and offering
social welfare in line with international best practices, while working on enhancing the role of civil society organizations
in offering these services.

Geography
The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan lies at the crossroads of Africa, Asia, and Europe, giving it a vital location with political,
economic, and ecological importance. It is bordered by Syria on the north, Iraq on the east, Saudi Arabia on the southeast,
and Palestine and Israel on the west. Although relatively small in area, about 90,000 square kilometers, the country enjoys
a wide range of biogeographic zones. Jordan hosts the lowest point on earth, on the shore of the Dead Sea at 416 meters
below sea level, while also hosting mountain peaks that rise up to 1,854 meters above sea level, located at the edge of
the southern heights of the country at Jabal Um Dami Mount (Rum Area).

Other pertinent figures are the following:
•      Population: 6,675,000
•      Poverty ratio: 14.4 percent
•      GDP per capita: $5,382, JD 3,810.8
•      Unemployment rate: 11.9 percent
•      Inflation rate: 2.8 percent
•      Percentage of population less than 15 years of age: 37.3 percent.

Education and Health in Jordan
Education is considered a high priority for the Jordanian government. The education sector seeks to provide education
opportunities for all, to achieve equality and equity in educational services, in both quantity and quality. The sector policies
also focus on improving quality and providing a safe infrastructure through increasing the number of schools and
kindergartens, improving the health level of students, and improving institutional capacities.

Jordan has achieved great progress in all education indicators. The percentage of literacy among youth aged between 15
and 24 reached about 99 percent (99.3 percent for males and 99.1 percent for females). The total number of students in
the kingdom between 2012 and 2013 was 1,726,831 (877,003 males and 849,828 females) enrolled in public schools (68
percent), private schools, military schools, or UNRWA academies. The retention rate of school children is 99 percent, while
dropout rates from the elementary-level education among the poor reached 0.31 percent in 2010 and was due to children
joining the labor market.

The total number of schools under the Ministry of Education's umbrella is 3,545 schools out of a total of 6,355 (55.8
percent), with the number of teachers affiliated with the Ministry of Education totaling 75,401 out of a total of 110,013,
including private schools, military academies, and UNRWA schools.

The school feeding program is part of the school health program at the Ministry of Health, under the School Nutrition and
Food Safety Program at the central level and at the level of health directorates in the governorates, as well as the School
Health and Nutrition Department of the Ministry of Education affiliated with the Education Administration.

The Case for School Feeding
School feeding programs, defined here as the provision of food to schoolchildren, can increase school enrollment and
attendance, especially for girls. When combined with quality education, school feeding programs can increase cognition
and educational success. With appropriately designed rations, school feeding programs can improve the nutrition status
of preschool- and primary school–aged children by addressing micronutrient deficiencies. Combined with local agricultural
production, these programs can also provide small-scale farmers with a stable market. School feeding programs can
provide short-term benefits after crises, helping communities recover and build resilience, in addition to long-term
benefits by developing human capital. School feeding programs can be classified into two main groups: in-school feeding
(when children are fed in school) and take-home rations (when families are given food if their children attend school
regularly). A major advantage of school feeding programs is they offer the greatest benefit to the poorest children. Several
studies have indicated that missing breakfast impairs educational performance.

Present data suggest that almost every country is seeking to provide food to its schoolchildren. Therefore, especially for
low-income countries where most food-insecure regions are concentrated, the key issue is not whether a country will
implement school-feeding programs, but rather how and with what objectives.

Social shocks of recent global crises led to an enhanced demand for school feeding programs in low-income countries
because they can serve as a safety net for food-insecure households through an income transfer. In response to this
amplified request, WFP and the World Bank jointly undertook an analysis titled Rethinking School Feeding. This initiative
sought to better understand how to develop and implement effective school feeding programs as a productive safety net
that is part of the response to the social shocks, as well as a fiscally sustainable investment in human capital. These efforts
are part of a long-term global goal to achieve Education for All and provide social protection to the poor.

School Feeding Program in Jordan

The Ministry of Education, in cooperation with WFP, embarked upon implementing the school feeding program during
the mid-1970s through which a balanced meal was offered for students at the elementary level, from first to sixth grade
in poor areas. The number of students benefiting from this project ranged from 120,000 students in 1975 to 140,000 in
1982, to 60,000 in 1990 and 1991. The target was to reach students in the first five grades as well as students attending
illiteracy eradication programs, women receiving training at the Princess Basma Development Centers, and kindergarten
students in these centers.

Later the Ministry of Education, in cooperation with the Ministry of Planning, adopted a new project for school feeding
from 1999 until 2005 to improve the nutrition and health conditions of public school children in poverty areas and to
develop and embed healthy eating habits and attitudes among students. The number of students reached since the start
of the implementation of the project was 10,000 students within 127 schools with a budget of JD 773,000. The project
gradually expanded, reaching 55,000 students by the end of the second semester of the scholastic year 2004–05, within
471 schools in areas similar in economic circumstances with a budget of JD 2,150,000. This program offered a meal
consisting of milk (200 ml), high-protein biscuits (70 grams), and a piece of fruit along with awareness programs; this
fulfilled about 25 percent of the child's necessary daily calorie intake.

Following a royal initiative during the scholastic year 2005–06, the Ministry of Education expanded the scope of the school
feeding program to include fifth and sixth graders in cooperation with the Jordanian Armed Forces. High protein biscuits
were offered (40–45 grams) fortified with vitamins and minerals, along with a piece of fruit (banana, apple, or others).
The number of beneficiaries of the project reached 170,000 students in 2013.

In 2013 the government, represented by the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation, signed an agreement
with WFP to support the school feeding project with a budget of $12 million, offered by the Russian government, and
about $5 million extended by the Canadian government. According to this agreement, WFP provided date bars fortified
with vitamins and minerals (80 grams) for each student, three days a week, to be complemented by the existing program
of the ministry in cooperation with the Jordanian Armed Forces, which provides high-protein biscuits two days a week.
With this complementary policy, the national school feeding program could expand in terms of the number of beneficiaries
from 170,000 in 2013 to about 350,000 students (out of 730,000 students) in the first to sixth grades, and in public
kindergartens, as of the scholastic year 2014–15 in 1,806 schools of 31 education directorates and in three Palestine
refugee camps under the UNRWA umbrella.

It is also planned that WFP will offer technical support to the Jordanian government in drafting a national school feeding
strategy to enhance institutional stability and the stability of financing to guarantee sustainability. The WFP and Social and
Industrial Foodservice Institute (SIFI) were included in the steering committee of the project, which includes
representatives from the Ministries of Education, Health and Planning and International Cooperation, the Food and Drug
Administration, and the Jordanian Armed Forces. This committee adopts the general policy of the project offering strategic
guidance. A specialized technical committee was formed, chaired by the Education Directorate director, to review and
update the technical operation instructions for the school feeding project, follow up on the implementation of the project,
and convene educational workshops, among other technical support activities related to the project.

Five Key Policy Goals to Promote School Feeding

Five core policy goals form the basis of an effective school feeding program. Figure 1 illustrates these policy goals and
outlines respective policy levers and outcomes that fall under each goal.

The first goal is a national policy framework. A solid policy foundation strengthens a school feeding program’s
sustainability and quality of implementation. National planning for school feeding as part of the country’s poverty
reduction strategy (or other equivalent development strategies) conveys the importance that the government places on
school feeding as part of its development agenda. For most countries that are implementing their own national programs,
school feeding is included in national policy frameworks.

The second policy goal for school feeding is financial capacity. Stable funding is a prerequisite for sustainability. However,
where need is greatest, programs tend to be the smallest and the most reliant on external support. Funding for these
programs can come from a combination of sources, such as nongovernmental organizations (e.g., WFP) and the
government. When a program becomes nationalized, it needs a stable and independent funding source, either through
government core resources or development funding. In the long term, a national budget line for school feeding is
necessary for an effective and stable program.

The third policy goal is institutional capacity and coordination. School feeding programs are better executed when an
institution is mandated with and accountable for the implementation of such a program. Effective programs also include
multisectoral involvement from sectors such as education, health, agriculture, and local government, as well as a
comprehensive link between school feeding and other school health or social protection programs and established
coordination mechanisms.

The fourth policy goal is sound design and implementation. To maximize effectiveness, school feeding programs should
clearly identify country-specific problems, objectives, and expected outcomes. The country’s context and needs should
determine the program’s beneficiaries, food basket (menus), food modalities, and supply chain. Countries and partners
should work toward creating a delicate balance among international, national, and local procurement of foods to support
local economies without jeopardizing the quality and stability of the food supply.

The last policy goal is community roles—reaching beyond schools. School feeding programs that are locally owned,
incorporate contributions from local communities, and respond to specific community needs are often the strongest.

These programs are most likely to make a successful transition from donor assistance to national ownership. Community
participation should be considered at every stage, but without overburdening community members.

Use of Evidence-Based Tools
The primary focus of the SABER–School Feeding exercise is gathering systematic and verifiable information about the
quality of a country’s policies through a SABER–School Feeding Questionnaire. This data-collecting instrument helps to
facilitate comparative policy analysis, identify key areas to focus investment, and disseminate good practice and
knowledge sharing. This holistic and integrated assessment of how the overall policy in a country affects young children’s
development is categorized into one of the following stages, representing the varying levels of policy development that
exist among different dimensions of school feeding:

    1.   Latent: No or very little policy development
    2.   Emerging: Initial/some initiatives toward policy development
    3.   Established: Some policy development
    4.   Advanced: Development of a comprehensive policy framework.

Each policy goal and lever of school feeding is methodically benchmarked through two SABER analysis tools. The first is a
scoring rubric that quantifies the responses to selected questions from the SABER–School Feeding questionnaire by
assigning point values to the answers. The second tool is the SABER–School Feeding Framework rubric that analyzes the
responses, especially the written answers, based on the framework’s five policy goals and levers. For more information,

Framework Paper under Methodology.

A policy foundation helps strengthen the sustainability and accountability of a school feeding program as well as the quality
of its implementation. Nearly all countries with national ownership of programs have well-articulated national policies on
the modalities and objectives of school feeding.2

In spite of the reference to school feeding in several public documents and policies, no general framework is in place to
consolidate school feeding efforts at the national level. School feeding is embedded in the development plan 2011–2013,
which stipulates the need to continue the school feeding program to guarantee the development of the educational
process.3 The national school health strategy of the Ministry of Health for the years 2013–17 refers to the importance of
continuing the school feeding program (goal nine: raise nutritional health awareness among students and parents by
expanding the school feeding project to reach 50 percent of the target group and assess the school feeding program). The
school feeding program is also referred to in the strategic plan of the Ministry of Education 2009-2013. Work is currently
underway to draft a school feeding strategy in cooperation with WFP. The strategy will include a number of themes,
including a policy for food nutrition outlining the goals, geographic and age scopes, and the appropriate design, as well as
financing to guarantee continuity.

     Policy Goal 2:
     Financial Capacity in
     Jordan

Policy Lever
x     Governance of the national school feeding program through stable funding and budgeting

Stable funding is necessary for the long-term sustainability of a school feeding program, especially one that transitions
from being donor-funded to government-funded. School feeding programs supported by external partners generally rely
on food aid, government in-kind donations, and/or government cash contributions. For the program to be sustainable and
nationally owned, the school feeding program should have a budget line and be part of the government’s budgeting and
planning process.

The Jordanian government listed the school feeding project within the state general budget. The annual allocations for
this activity are identified according to priorities and available resources. About JD 5 million was allocated for the scholastic
year 2014–15. The allocations available vary from one year to another and do not meet all the necessary needs of the
target groups and the continued feeding throughout the scholastic year. The feeding currently includes about 350,000
children from poverty areas, but the total number targeted is more than 700,000 in various regions of the kingdom. The
project is currently funded from the state's general budget with JD 5 million annually (about $7 million), with about JD 4
million annually (about $5.6 million) from the WFP grant, which totals $17 million over a three-year period. The cost of
feeding a single student is about $15 (JD 11) a year from the state budget and about $8 (JD 5.7) from WFP. The school
feeding is purchased and distributed on average more than 100 scholastic days out of 195 total per year.

    Policy Goal 3:
    Institutional Capacity and
    Coordination in Jordan

Policy Levers
x      School feeding intersectoral coordination and strong partnerships
x      Management and accountability structures, strong institutional frameworks, and monitoring and evaluation

Implementing a school feeding policy requires significant institutional capacity because the program is a complex school
health intervention. The policy should clearly define the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders and actors at all levels.
Methodically increasing government capacity to manage a school feeding program is important to the program’s long-
term sustainability. A national institution that is mandated and accountable for the implementation of the school feeding
program is considered to be a best practice. This institution should have a specific unit that has adequate resources and
knowledgeable staff to manage the school feeding program. Moreover, policies that detail accountability and
management mechanisms can help ensure program quality and efficiency, especially if the school feeding program is
decentralized.

A steering committee for school feeding is in place that includes most stakeholders but with no representation by either
the civil or the private sectors. Clear mechanisms have been established to manage school feeding at the central level by
the School Health and Feeding Department at the ministry or at the level of governorates and schools, but this system
does not meet the needs in terms of lack of human and financial resources, regularity, and quality. In addition to the
school feeding project, the monitoring and evaluation unit at the school health directorate supervises and follows up
school shops through establishing work plans, programs, and activities for the feeding that target school children and
faculty, in addition to raising health and nutrition awareness. The Ministry of Health also participates in the steering
committee for school feeding with the Ministry of Education. The project administration team consists of five members
at the central level at the Ministry of Education. A system is also in place for follow-up at the level of directorates and
schools through the supervision and follow-up committees in the field at the level of the education directorates, as well
as school-level receipt and distribution committees for those schools included in the school feeding project.

    Policy Goal 4:
    Design and
    Implementation in Jordan

Policy Lever
x      Quality assurance of programming and targeting, modalities, and procurement design, ensuring design that is both
       needs-based and cost-effective

A well-designed school feeding policy that is based on evidence is critical to the implementation of a quality school feeding
program. The policy can include details on targeting the correct beneficiaries, selecting the proper modalities of food
delivery, and choosing a quality food basket. Over time, the school feeding policy may be redesigned or modified according
to reassessments of the school feeding program.

The school feeding program currently reaches 350,000 students; it previously reached 170,00 in 2012 and 2013. This is
due to the partnership between the Ministry of Education and WFP. The Armed Forces and WFP secure and supply the
components of the meal, while the Ministry of Health and the JFDA supervise the components of the meal from a health
standpoint and conduct the necessary periodic tests for their components. The Ministry of Education delivers the
components of the meal to the students and supervises the implementation of the project. The school health and
nutrition department issues an annual standard operation plan (SOP) to be implemented by the personnel responsible
for the project. This plan also includes specifications for the components that make up the meal and periodic report
forms to be filled out at the school and directorate levels.

Criteria are established to target the poverty areas building on the poverty report published by the government.
However, the current system requires development and an increase in the number of staff working on it. It also needs to
be integrated in the information system of the Ministry of Education to become electronic so that information can be
used and analyzed scientifically and periodically. According to the Ministry of Health, there is a shortage of manuals on
food and nutrition, and no periodic studies are done to assess the feeding situation. There is also a weakness in
accessing data and information on the specifications of the foods, their validity, their acceptance by students, and the
rate of compliance with transport and storage terms.4

Policy Lever

x      Community participation and accountability

The role of the community should be clearly defined in a school feeding policy because community participation and
ownership improves the school feeding program’s chances of long-term sustainability. If the government places the
responsibility of sustaining the school feeding program on the community, the school feeding policy should detail the
guidelines, minimum standards, and support for the community to implement the program. The school feeding policy can
also include mechanisms for the community to hold the government accountable.

At the school level, there may be a school management committee comprising parents, teachers, and students that acts
as a liaison between the school and community and that manages the school feeding program. Care should be taken not
to overburden the community, because in some cases the community may introduce fees to support the local school feeding
program, which can negatively impact enrollment rates. Community-assisted school feeding programs are usually most
successful in food-secure areas.

The role of the civil and local community and the private sector in setting school feeding policies is lacking. Furthermore,
no mechanism is in place for integrating this important and effective sector in implementing school feeding in poverty
areas although related activities are present, such as the awareness campaign “Bread and Tea” by Tkiyet Um Ali and the
distribution of aid at the royal grant schools through the Ministry of Social Development and civil societies.

Civil societies also implement programs to combat anemia in most governorates as well as conduct awareness programs
among pregnant and lactating mothers and conduct awareness to combat malnutrition among children aged six months
to five years and pregnant and lactating mothers. There is also the National Accreditation Program, which is implemented
in schools; this program is a monitoring and awareness program that addresses school feeding in cooperation with the
Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health. Work is currently underway to implement the Productive Kitchen project
for the local community, which may support the school feeding program.

Conclusion
Based on the above findings, school feeding in Jordan can be seen as Emerging (2.2). Still, some areas could be
strengthened moving forward. The following policy options represent possible areas where school feeding could be
strengthened in Jordan, based on the conclusions of this report.

Policy Options
In spite of the clear efforts exerted in Jordan to improve and develop the performance of the school feeding project, steps
can be undertaken by the state and its partners in the short, medium, and long term.

In the short term:
x Design a national strategy for school feeding in partnership with all parties in the society, whether they represent
    the government, civil society, or private sector, to guarantee the attainment of desired goals and sustainability and
    linking them with a strategy for agricultural production. Inputs for this strategy will include an up-to-date study
    undertaken by specialists on the impact of the project from educational, health, and economic aspects on the target
    groups and the community at large.
x Activate the role of the school feeding steering committee and review its terms of reference to guarantee relevant
    representation of all stakeholders, including the Ministry of Agriculture, civil society, and private sector, as well as
    benefit from this committee in raising awareness on the importance of school feeding among decision makers.
x Undertake a study to assess and identify human resources and training needs at the Ministry of Education and the
    field levels to supervise the implementation of the school feeding project.
x Develop and activate a follow-up system to guarantee implementation of the school feeding project according to its
    plans in terms of updating and adding indicators for data collection tools, creating a methodology for collecting and
    analyzing data regularly and periodically, in addition to publishing reports.
x Design a new comprehensive system for follow-up and assessment that includes all levels of education, nutrition,
    and health, for all phases of the project, and benefit from the local community, parents, and students within this
    system.
x Train staff at the central and local levels on the new follow-up and evaluation system.
x Include entities represented the steering committee in the technical committee.
In the medium and long terms:
x Work to increase the school feeding allocations whether from the state budget, donors, or the Jordanian private
    sector to include all target students and increase the number of feeding days in the scholastic year. This is based on
    studies evaluating the impact of the project that are promoted among decision makers and through the media via a
    publicity campaign that raises awareness of the importance of school feeding and its impact on the community.
x Study the possibility of establishing a school feeding fund that receives donations from institutions, the private
    sector, and individuals that will be managed transparently and effectively.

x   Convene training workshops to build the capacities of staff working in the field on the importance of complying with
    the SOP, and preparing and distributing educational materials among staff, students, and parents.
x   Benefit from civil societies in designing and implementing health and nutritional awareness programs as well as
    monitor and evaluate school feeding at the local level in cooperation with the Ministries of Education and Health.
x   Enhance the idea of productive kitchens in local communities and school gardens to contribute to the school feeding
    program in cooperation with the Ministries of Social Development and Planning, International Cooperation, and
    other stakeholders.
x   Create a more effective mechanism for financial management of the project to facilitate expenditure procedures
    related to suppliers.

       The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) initiative
       produces comparative data and knowledge on education policies and
       institutions, with the aim of helping countries systematically strengthen
       their education systems. SABER evaluates the quality of education
       policies against evidence-based global standards, using new diagnostic
       tools and detailed policy data. The SABER country reports give all parties
       with a stake in educational results—from administrators, teachers, and
       parents to policy makers and business people—an accessible, objective
       snapshot showing how well the policies of their country's education
       system are oriented toward ensuring that all children and youth learn.

       This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of School Feeding
