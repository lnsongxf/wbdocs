FOREWORD



Uganda’s long run of rapid growth has struggled to maintain its pace in recent years. The economy has faced a number of
shocks, including bad weather; disruption to her export markets in South Sudan as a result of civil unrest; election related macro
instability during the post 2011 election period and high uncertainty around the 2016 election; upheavals in the domestic financial
system; as well as those related to the global up and downs in growth and commodity prices. Under these circumstances, the
economic policies that authorities have pursued have been successful in preserving past gains, particularly keeping inflation in
low single digit levels and reducing poverty. Uganda has also made significant strides in preparations for production of its long-
awaited crude oil.

Unfortunately, the ambitious public investment program meant to stimulate the economy and remove the country’s long standing
deficiencies in physical infrastructure, has not catalyzed acceleration of private investments. As a result, Uganda’s economy has
been growing at an average of 4.5 percent per year since 2012, generating only modest per capita growth as it rallied against a fast
growing population, and falling below projections by at least a percentage point each year. The near term growth projection of
about six percent is also lower than levels sufficient for Uganda to attain middle income status by 2020, and is subject to volatility,
some of which has already materialized. It is important that fiscal policy not become an additional source of shocks. This means
effective delivery of the debt-financed infrastructure program and boosting domestic revenues from among the lowest in Sub-
Saharan Africa.

To boost the private sector side, Uganda needs to pay more attention to strengthening its financial systems to support faster
investments and households management of risks. There has been an intensified interest in the financial systems across the East
African Community due to a number of banking system distress episodes, debates around interest rate capping and innovations
such as mobile money enabled by information and communication technology. Uganda cannot be alone in addressing these and
other issues critical to ensuring its financial system raises the bar in supporting the country’s growth and prosperity agenda.

Against this backdrop, I am pleased to introduce the Eighth Edition of the Uganda Economic Update series. In addition to the
macroeconomic assessment in the first part of the report, this edition explores the options that exist for the country to get a
much larger part of its population financially included and a much bigger proportion of its economic activities funded within the
domestic financial system.

As with previous editions, I hope that this Eighth Uganda Economic Update will stimulate, and contribute to, the debate among
stakeholders on this important agenda.

      Part 1
       The State of the economy


      •	   During the first quarter of FY 2016/17, the economy
           contracted by 0.2 percent as it adjusted to the impacts
           of drought, the ongoing unrest in South Sudan and to a
           slowdown in credit from the banking system.
      •	   With inflation pressures abating, the Bank of Uganda
           continued to implement easier monetary policies.
           However, the impact on the real economy was weak due to
           structural issues in the financial sector and to the increase
           in the level of risk aversion of banks.
      •	   The fiscal deficit is projected to reach 6 percent of GDP
           in FY 2016/17 as the collection of revenues fail to meet
           targets, while at the same time the rate of execution
           of key hydroelectric projects improved and recurrent
           cost pressures increased. In the medium term, the high
           headline deficit should adjust to a more controlled level
           once the externally financed infrastructure is complete.
      •	   The slow rate of export growth combined with the large
           import bill resulted in deterioration of the external current
           account deficit, which is now expected to exceed 7 percent
           of GDP in FY 2016/17.
      •	   The economy will grow at a rate of around 4 to 5 percent
           this year, a rate similar to the average achieved over the
           past five years. The economy will accelerate only gradually,
           to 6 percent by 2019.
      •	   Uganda’s economic growth is expected to be mainly driven
           by public investments, with private investments struggling
           to overcome the effect of shocks and uncertainty regarding
           the pace of the Government’s huge infrastructure program.
      •	   The volatility of regional markets, due in particular
           to the protracted violence in South Sudan and global
           economic uncertainty, could result in a decline in exports,
           remittances and FDI. In order to achieve higher levels
           of resilience, the Government needs to ensure that its
           investment program is soundly financed and generates real
           productivity improvements.
      •	   Resilience to shocks is also impeded by the inefficiency
           of the domestic financial system, with this inefficiency
           acting as a key binding constraint on risk management and
           increased productivity across all sectors of the economy.

1.0 Recent economic developments

           Economic activity at the beginning of FY2016/17 was much more subdued than had been
           anticipated, with the sluggish performance that has characterized the economy since the
           second quarter in the previous year persisting. The easing of monetary policy following the
           completion of the 2016 electoral cycle had only a limited effect, due to bad weather conditions;
           the outbreak of violence in South Sudan; upheavals in the domestic financial sector resulting
           from an increase in the NPL ratio; and correspondingly more stringent loan conditions.
           Together with increased global uncertainties and decreased demand, these factors resulted
           in a decline in exports, remittances and FDI, thus constraining private investment. Overall,
           economic activity declined, with this trend being most pronounced in the agricultural and
           manufacturing sectors.

to reach a value in excess of 6.0 percent of GDP during
this year. This is consistent with the implementation over
the past several years of an investment-driven fiscal policy
intended to stimulate economic growth. The FY 2016/17
National Budget envisaged that the total value of expenditure
would increase from the level of 22.1 percent of GDP recorded
in FY 2015/16 to 22.4 percent, with the construction of key
infrastructure projects intended to address constraints on
private investments and to enhance the productive capacity
of the economy continuing. Consistent with this objective, the
value of resources allocated to the transportation sector was
raised to 19 percent of the total budget, from 15 percent in FY
2015/16. The allocations to the energy sectors also remained
sizeable, at 12 percent of the total budget, even though it
was lower than the figure of 15 percent recorded during the
previous year.

Meanwhile, in a bid to enhance human capital, skills
development and health outcomes, 12 percent of the
budget was allocated to the education sector and 7 percent
to the health sector. The allocations to the education
and health sectors increased by 44 percent and 26 percent
respectively relative to allocations in FY 2015/16. A significant
proportion of the expenditure in the educational sector has
been allocated to facilitating the transition of graduates
from formal education into productive economic activities

2.0 Economic Outlook

            Uganda’s economy is expected to grow at less than 5 percent during FY 2016/17, accelerating
            gradually to about 6 percent in the subsequent two years. These relatively low rates are due
            to a number of shocks, including much lower trade with South Sudan, the low credit from
            the financial system, bad weather, and an uncertain global economy. With these shocks
            particularly affecting private investment, it is expected that public investments intended to
            address infrastructure constraints and prepare Uganda for oil production will continue to
            be the main driver of growth. The main risks include those related to fiscal management in
            the face of huge spending pressures and to the possibility that the investment program will

is unlikely that there will be a dramatic acceleration in the
rate of growth in the second half of the year.8 The looser
monetary conditions and reduced domestic borrowing by the
Government to finance large public investments will create a
more conducive environment for the private sector, with an
increased availability of credit as a result of the reduction in the
crowding out of private investment that has occurred in recent
years. However, as discussed in Section 1.2, commercial banks
have recently tightened their lending standards; authorities
have made capital requirements more stringent; and banks are
becoming increasingly reluctant to grant loans given the recent
deterioration in the quality of their loans portfolio. These

In spite of the progress being made in financial intermediation, new threats to sustained access to credit and growth
and stability of the financial system will need to be closely monitored and addressed quickly and effectively. While
at the aggregate level, the banking system remains sufficiently capitalized, liquid and profitable, the quality of loans has
recently declined severely, with the NPL ratio steadily increasing. With the exception of one bank, all banks met the core capital
requirements as of June 2016. By this time, the value of core capital held by the banks was above 8 percent of the risk-weighted
assets (RWA). If, they maintain the same level of capital, banks would still meet the requirement after it is raised to 10 percent
of RWA and a capital conservation buffer is applied. However, NPLs increased from approximately 4 percent in June 2015 to
more than 8 percent in the current year. This deterioration of loan quality underscores the need to closely monitor credit risk
within Uganda’s commercial banking system (see Box 1). Indeed, the stress tests conducted as part of the 2011 Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP)10 had warned of the need to closely monitor developments in this area.




 Box 1: Non-performing assets rose significantly across the banking system


  Up until 2013, the banking system recorded a strong performance, attributable to the high quality of banks’ loan portfolios. In the
  context of a high level of non-performing loans (NPLs) in the 1990s, the banking system had since adopted a cautious approach
  to lending and hence managed to maintain a very low level of non-performing assets over the last decade. In the period from
  December 2007 to December 2011, the ratio of NPLs to total loans stood at an average level of 2.95 percent.

  However, in the recent past, the quality of loans has deteriorated and associated credit risk within Uganda’s banking system
  increased. Specifically, the ratio of NPLs to total gross loans increased from 2.2 percent in December 2011 to 6 percent in December
  2013. While this ratio had improved between 2014 and 2015, it rose again during 2016 to reach 8 percent by June 2016. In recent
  times, the high credit risk exposure is attributed to the after-effects of high credit growth and the economic slowdown in 2015
  and 2016, which continued to negatively impact the quality of the sector’s loan portfolio. In addition, a large portion of the NPLs
  has been related to loans denominated in US dollars, implying that the risk of high level of default resulting from exchange rate
  fluctuations materialized this year.

  The increasing volume of NPLs in 2015 and 2016, was particularly evident in the manufacturing sector. This has been mainly
  because of the reduced volume of trade with South Sudan, which had been the largest destination for Ugandan manufactured
  goods. By June 2015, the proportion of NPLs in this sector had reached 17.5 percent. Overall, the level of NPLs increased from
  6 percent by June 2013 to 8 percent by June 2016. Trade and commerce account for the largest share of NPLs, with a share of
  39 percent, followed by the building and construction sectors, with a share of 29.5 percent. The share of NPLs in the case of the
  manufacturing sector has increased, reaching the level of 17 percent by June 2016.

  One cause of the high ratio of non-performing assets was the high level of exposure to foreign currency loans in the context of
  the volatile value of the shilling especially between April and November 2015, with this effect being particularly significant in the
  case of the real estate sector. For traders, currency volatility jeopardized the business environment by increasing both the cost
  of importation and operational costs. Even where such goods and services are purchased locally, the effect of imported inflation
  spilled over into domestic prices and into the cost of rented business space, with most rentals denominated in foreign currency.
  Other sources of vulnerability include sporadic episodes of instability in South Sudan, a key business outlet for a wide range of
  economic activities in Uganda. This has had the effect of disrupting income streams for many businesses, thereby constraining
  their ability to meet their debt obligations.

  Across the different banks, NPAs are not distributed evenly, suggesting that bank-specific management factors may have been
  partially responsible for the overall rise in NPLs. As stated earlier, the BoU took over the management of Crane Bank in October
  2016 because this bank was determined to lack sufficient capital and to pose a risk to the stability of Uganda’s financial system.
  Prior to the takeover, its non-performing assets had risen to constitute more than 20 percent of its loan portfolio, which left it
  significantly undercapitalized. Several other banks have also experienced a surge in NPLs in recent months. As at June 30, 2016,
  five other banks had a ratio of NPLs in excess 10 percent. However, it is notable that some banks continue to maintain a low ratio
  of NPLs, in the range of 2-3 percent, and many banks are more than adequately provisioned.


The increase in credit risk for a significant part of the              any bank, standing at 23 percent at the time of its takeover,
banking system had to be contained to avoid a self-                    undermining its capital base (Box 2). Indeed, this bank had

Box 2: Central Bank resolves problematic Crane Bank
  On October 20, 2016, Bank of Uganda (BoU) announced that it had taken over the management of Crane Bank and suspended its
  Board of Directors, upon a determination that Crane Bank Limited was a significantly undercapitalized institution as defined by
  law, posed a systemic risk to the stability of the financial system and that the continuation of Crane Bank’s activities in its existing
  form was detrimental to the interests of its depositors because this bank was deemed to lack sufficient capital and to posed a risk
  to the stability of Uganda’s financial system. By taking over Crane Bank, BoU was fulfilling one of its key mandates, which is to
  ensure the stability of the financial system and the safety of the depositors. Indeed, in the past, BoU has implemented a number
  of actions to achieve these objectives. For instance, over the past half-decade, it closed the National Bank of Commerce in 2012,
  and Global Trust Bank Uganda Limited in 2014, while it carefully managed the resolution of issues related to the management
  Imperial Bank Uganda Limited after its majority shareholder in Kenya had been put under receivership. All these interventions
  achieved the purpose of ensuring the stability of the financial system, even when major institutions had had problems.

   Crane Bank, Uganda’s fourth largest bank in terms of assets and fifth in terms of deposits at the time BOU’s intervention, had
  been on the BoU watch list since 2015. Crane Bank was part of a financial conglomerate with almost 500,000 accounts and 46
  branches across Uganda. It was therefore one of the most systemically important institutions in Uganda’s banking system. A
  key cause of Crane Bank’s distress was the poor quality of its loans, as the ratio of NPLs to loans had risen to 23 percent of its
  loan portfolio. Moreover, in the weeks preceding its takeover, rumors regarding its weakness and a possible closure by BoU,
  prompted depositors to withdraw their deposits due to speculation regarding the bank’s future. This run on the bank resulted
  in a significant erosion in the value of its deposits. As the same time, the shareholders failed to raise enough capital to quickly
  recapitalize the bank to curtail further deterioration.

  BoU issued reassurances that it intended to resolve the issues related to Crane Bank in a manner which preserves its core functions
  and services to customers. Crane Bank remained open to customers and BoU did not institute limits on how much customers can
  deposit or withdraw, as it tried to operate the bank as smoothly as possible while an in-depth audit was being carried out.

  Upon completion of the audit, BOU confirmed that Crane Bank liabilities exceeded its assets and that it was insolvent. On January
  27, 2017, BOU progressed the nature of the takeover of Crane Bank from statutory management to receivership and transferred
  all Crane Bank’s liabilities (including deposits) and assets, to DFCU Bank Limited Uganda. The BoU further issued reassurance
  that it will continue to protect the depositors’ interests and to maintain stability of the financial sector.

           and households have access to a bank loan and/or a line of
           credit. Consequently, domestic credit has financed only 13
           percent of GDP over the past decade.
     •	    The most significant constraint on financial inclusion is cost,
           with Uganda ranking in 120th place out of 138 countries in the
           area of the affordability of financial services, according to the
           Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report (2016-2017).
     •	    Inclusion is constrained by the low level of public confidence
           in financial institutions; by the undeveloped state of long-
           term savings products such as pensions and insurance;
           and by the undeveloped state of credit and mobile service
           infrastructure.
     •	    Reducing the cost of credit requires a comprehensive,
           long-term effort to increase levels of competition and to
           improve the credit infrastructure. In the short-term, effort
           must be focused to addressing information asymmetries,
           strengthening the financial infrastructure, building capacities
           in the sector.
     •	    To raise savings mobilization, there is need to build
           confidence by ensuring financial institutions are safe and
           efficient, raising awareness through consumer education, and
           strengthening regulations.
     •	    For Uganda’s financial system to raise more savings and to
           lower the cost of finance, it must encourage more competition
           between banks and with other non-bank financial institutions
           including insurance and pensions.

since the reform started, which has also been accompanied
by de-concentration of the banking system. Nonetheless,
price competition remains limited. The evolution of the
Herfindahl Index of Uganda’s banking sector shows a decline
in concentration from 2004 to 2013. In 2004, the value of the
index was almost 1,700 but it experienced a significant decline
over the years, down to 939.7 in June 201312 , indicating gradual
decline in concentration within the sector. Entrance of new
players into the market has played a significant role in that:
since the expiration of a moratorium on new bank licenses in
2007, the number of commercial banks in Uganda increased
from 14 to 25 in 2014. Nevertheless, there is still significant
potential for further decline in concentration. Competition has
driven down returns on equity which are now less than half the
levels in the first half of the 2000s. However competition has
generally not taken the form of price competition; instead banks
have competed for customers by opening new branches – the
number of branches is now six times the level in the early 2000s
– which suggests that the banks do not believe that customer
demand for financial services is very price sensitive.

In aggregate, the banking system in Uganda is well-
capitalized with an average Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio
of 19 percent in June 2016, well above the regulatory
minimum level of 8 percent. The average level of Return on
Assets (ROA) stood at 2.2 percent in June 2016, a rate that was
below the level of 2.8 recorded a year earlier. Return on Equity
(ROE) declined significantly over the two points, from 17.7
percent in June 2015 to 13.8 percent in June 2016. While the
banking system is characterized by generally well-performing
loan portfolios, the proportion of NPLs has increased recently
(see discussion in Section 2.3 of this report).

In terms of inclusion, the development of other deposit-
taking financial institutions, such as credit institutions
and microfinance deposit-taking institutions, has been
significant, because these institutions generally have
a wider geographical scope and are more orientated to
serving low-income clients. As might be expected, the CI and
MDI sectors are relatively very small, holding less than four
percent of the banking system’s total value of loans and two
percent of deposits in 2014. These institutions are prudentially                    Airtel service centre registers

technologies, and the increased outreach have all contributed
to greatly improved access, especially for deposit accounts,
but many gaps remain. Compared to the figures recorded in 2011,
the number of Ugandans holding bank accounts has increased
dramatically. Nonetheless the rate of usage is still low compared
to the rates recorded by regional and global peers. Global Findex
results show that the proportion of adults holding at least one bank
account increased from 21 percent in 2011 to 28 percent in 2014.
While this is a significant increase, it is still relatively low compared
to the levels recorded by comparator countries. This is further
confirmed by the IMF Financial Access Survey (FAS) (2015), which
in addition shows that there was a large gap in the proportion of
the population holding a deposit account and that holding a loans
account at commercial banks. By 2015, for deposit accounts, the
figure stood at 230 accounts per 1,000 adults, but at only 25 accounts
per 1,000 adults for loans. While it is usual for there to be a greater
proportion of the population holding deposit accounts than loans
accounts, a number of regional and international comparators have
recorded greater proportion of loans accounts relative to deposit                                         Ruhiira SACCO serves customers

businesses have a bank loan and/or line of credit,
with those obtaining these facilities paying
high costs and having to comply with stringent
collateral requirements. Over the ten years to 2015,
Uganda’s credit to GDP ratio stood at an average of
only 15.1 percent.15 This ratio is very low compared
to the ratio recorded by regional neighbors such as
South Africa and Kenya, and even lower than that
recorded in other regions, such as Europe, Central
Asia, East Asia and the Pacific.

     Box 3: Understanding determinants of interest rate spreads in Uganda
     According to bank-level financial statement data, lending rates and spreads increased to a moderate extent in the period
     from 2009 to 2016. The average effective interest rate spreads17 increased from more than 16 percent in 2009 to around
     17 percent by mid-2016. However, these spreads declined in the period from 2009 to 2012. Effective lending rates (interest
     income on loans divided by net loans) for most banks increased modestly in the period from 2009 to mid-2016. On the other
     hand, effective deposit rates (interest expense on deposits divided by deposits) declined slightly during this period. So, the
     widening in effective spreads is due to a slight increase in lending rates and a small decrease in deposit rates. The level of
     spreads in Uganda is higher than that of any other country in East Africa over the last five years.

     The high operating costs and profits attribute significantly to the spreads in Uganda. The decomposition shows that on
     average, operating costs and profits accounted for 80 percent or more of the overall banking system spread in Uganda in the
     period from 2009 to 2016. A similar tendency is observed in peer countries, where profits and operating costs also contribute
     to a large proportion of the spreads.

     Reserve requirements and loan loss provisioning contribute to a relatively small proportion of the spreads, but they are
     essential for financial sector stability. Reserves and loan loss provisioning increase bank resilience to shocks from sudden
     deposit withdrawals and loan defaults. The level of provisioning can depend on bank-specific and macroeconomic factors.
     For instance, banks with high-risk loan profiles may provision more than banks with lower risk loan profiles, while lower
     GDP growth tends to be associated with higher provisioning. In addition, the loan loss provisioning component of the spread
     increases as asset quality deteriorates, signaling a rise in default risk.

     The most significant component of operating costs is staff remuneration costs, with the scarcity of skilled staff contributing
     to these high costs. On average, staff salaries represented 42 percent of total operating costs across all banks in the period
     from 2009 to mid-2016. High salaries for financial sector professionals in Uganda are an important contributing factor to high
     lending rates. The high cost of skilled staff can be primarily explained by the scarcity of qualified professionals. High operating
     costs in Uganda can also be explained by relatively low levels of efficiency in the banking sector. In 2014, Uganda’s ratio was
     one of the highest in the EAC and it was also much higher than the median ratios of low and upper middle income countries. In
     addition, a bank’s business model and customer outreach have an important effect on operating costs. For banks that target
     MSMEs and low-income consumers, the costs of conducting due diligence on borrowers can be relatively high, particularly in
     an environment characterized by difficult access to reliable information on retail borrowers. In addition, banks with a large
     branch network incur higher operating costs and the requirements for opening branches in Uganda make it very expensive
     to expand into rural areas. For the most part, the costs of rent, electricity, staff etc. outweigh the financial benefits for banks,

     as the numbers of customers served and the volume of transactions is often low in rural areas. Lastly, structural challenges in
     developing countries elevate the costs of doing business. In general, banks in developing countries cite high operating costs as
     one of the main reasons for the high lending rates. Gaps in physical infrastructure, unreliable electricity supply, and expensive
     IT and telecommunication services, all of which are commonplace in these economies, contribute to high operating costs and,
     in turn, to high lending rates and spreads.

     Overall, there is a high rate of variation between the lending rates and spreads of different banks in Uganda. For instance,
     in June 2016, lending rates ranged from about 32 percent to about 9 percent, while spreads ranged from more than 25
     percent to as low as 7 percent. These differences are generally the result of diverse range of bank business models and
     strategies. The decomposition of spreads also varies across the different banks. Operating costs contribute to the largest
     portion of spreads in about half of the banks. These banks are generally smaller, less efficient, with weak balance sheets,
     and with a small market share. More efficient banks have lower operating costs, although they tend to set their interest rates
     in line with less efficient banks to increase their profitability. As a result, profits contribute to the largest portion of spreads in
     the other half of banks. These banks are mostly larger, well-established institutions with significant market power. Provisions
     contributed to a relatively small proportion of spreads for most of the banks over the period of analysis. This is surprising,
     considering the differences in the different banks’ target market segments and the deterioration in asset quality experienced
     by some banks.

     Bank investments in government securities also have an effect on interest rate spreads. African banks tend to invest in
     government securities to a greater extent than do other developing countries in other regions. While this is partly due to the
     limited opportunities to invest in the real economy, the returns on these “risk-free” investments tend to be relatively high in
     Africa. Therefore, bank investments in securities can be highly profitable compared to lending operations, which inherently
     incur a higher level of expense and which carry more risks. In Uganda, bank holdings of government securities in Uganda
     are comparable to other EAC countries, remaining on average relatively stable in spite of rising yields (see Box Figure 3b).
     The share of government securities held by Ugandan banks is higher than the share held by any other EAC country with the
     exception of Kenya. In the period from 2009 to mid-2016, the average share has remained steady, fluctuating around the level
     of 21 percent of total assets.

      The level of development of financial infrastructure is another significant driver of high lending rates and spreads. In
      countries with well-developed financial infrastructure, information asymmetries and risk premiums are relatively low,
      which leads to lower spreads. Lenders have ready, reliable access to information by which to assess their borrowers and
      their pledged collateral, which significantly lowers the costs of conducting due diligence. On the other hand, in countries
      with an underdeveloped financial infrastructure, the costs of conducting due diligence are much higher and credit risks are
      poorly assessed, which means that borrowers are relatively more likely to pay the same rates as bad borrowers. As a result,
      lending rates and interest rate spreads in these countries tend to be higher to compensate lenders for the much higher level
      of risk and operating costs.

    Box 4: Interest Rate Caps: Experiences from around the world
    Around the world, there are numerous examples of governments and regulatory agencies imposing controls on interest
    rates on loans. These controls have been justified for a number of reasons, from supporting specific sectors in the economy
    in cases where there is a market failure in the financial sector, to protecting borrowers from exploitation and increasing
    the level of access to finance. At present, roughly 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa have interest rate caps on loans.
    Most recently, Kenya enacted regulations on lending rates, with these regulations coming into effect in September 2016,
    effectively reintroducing caps that had previously been eliminated in July 1991.

    Available empirical evidence shows that interest rate caps have had varying degrees of effectiveness. Helms and
    Reille (2004) and FAI (2010) show that interest rate caps reduce price transparency and do not prevent the exploitation of
    borrowers. Maimbo (2014) analyses the available empirical research to conclude that the interest rate control has been
    predominately ineffective. However, in the case of the United States, a few studies have demonstrated positive outcomes.

    There is ample evidence that interest rate caps can indeed have unintended negative consequences. These may include
    the withdrawal of financial services from the poor or from specific segments of the market, an increase in illegal lending,
    a decrease in the licensing of new lending institutions, an increase in the total cost of loans through additional fees and

    Documented experiences with interest rate controls in SSA include:

      •	 South Africa: Some financial institutions evaded caps by charging credit life insurance and other services, which
         reduced the transparency of the total cost of credit.

      •	 WAEMU: The imposition of interest rate caps on microfinance loans caused microfinance institutions to withdraw
         their services from poor and more remote areas and to increase average loan sizes to increase the level of efficiency
         and returns, because the interest rate ceiling made serving poor in remote areas unfeasible.

      •	 Zambia: Interest caps, introduced in 2013, were removed with immediate effect at the end of 2015. Studies showed
         that these caps limited access to finance, particularly for SMEs. Micro-finance institutions considered that the rate
         caps did not enable them to reach the breakeven point, causing a number of entities to exit the sector. In addition,
         as Treasury bill rates increased, these caps on commercial bank lending became increasingly binding.
