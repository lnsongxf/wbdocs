Sustainable development is at the core of the World Bank Group’s overarching mission to reduce poverty.
Conservation and sustainable management of natural resources are critical pillars of this mission, which
the World Bank Group has been supporting in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Region for over
two decades. In teaming up with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) we have established a synergy that
has allowed us to make even more progress in MENA. Through our policy framework, analytical work, and
various investment instruments, the World Bank Group brings leverage and impact to GEF resources. The
global perspective of the GEF, and the innovation and sustainability it supports, has in turn contributed to
our goal of becoming the ‘solutions Bank.’
    The region continues to face a number of significant challenges despite its many accomplishments. These
include climate change, rapid urbanization, industrial pollution, water resources scarcity, food insecurity,
fragile ecosystems, and a lack of energy diversification. MENA countries are also facing the demand for
more social inclusion, jobs, and better service delivery. The need for the resources and vision of the GEF
is now stronger than ever as the region continues the current period of transition.
    This brochure focuses on the two decades of the World Bank-GEF partnership with MENA countries.
This partnership has had a global environmental impact by working both at the local and national level
and engaging all relevant partners and stakeholders. In addition, many GEF financed operations stand
as examples of what a more holistic approach can achieve in terms of innovation and catalyzing greater
investment. These operations have also delivered important social benefits such as job creation, enhanced
economic and social inclusion, and strengthened governance capabilities.
    Going forward, we will continue to focus on this partnership making it increasingly strategic, selective,
and appropriate to the MENA context. We welcome the additional leverage it brings to Bank lending and
associated donor finance. It strengthens our support for the region’s sustainable development objectives
and encourages capacity building in government systems as well as provides an opportunity for the crucial
exchange of knowledge. In partnership with GEF, we are committed to helping MENA countries respond
effectively to critical environmental issues at this historical moment in their development.

cal baseline surveys as well as assessments of the
socio-economics of surrounding local communities.
The results of both analyses were used to shape the
Dana Reserve management plan.
     The project pioneered the concept of community
engagement in protected areas and demonstrated how
valuable economic instruments can be in building
local support and involvement in conservation and
biodiversity preservation. At first, the establishment
of a protected area was not warmly welcomed by the
surrounding local communities, who viewed this as
a threat to their livelihoods. The project therefore
adopted an incentive-driven approach. Under this
approach, income-generating activities that could
be an alternative to people’s traditional livelihoods,
such as goat grazing, were promoted. Among the
alternatives developed were eco-tourism facilities
and programs, along with a wide range of handicraft
businesses. These were successful in generating
employment and income, and they were welcomed.
They now collectively support a significant sector of
the target communities and generate revenue that is
used to meet ongoing conservation costs.
     The Dana project set a new standard by providing
a clear basis for linking management decisions in
biodiversity protection to socio-economic develop-
ment. Further, it pioneered the practice of engag-
