                                        Executive Summary

The objective of this Policy Note
•   This Note is intended to support the Government of Mozambique in determining priorities for policy
    decisions with the aim of delivering efficiently produced, technically and financially sustainable
    electricity supply to the Mozambican population.
•   To support the development of recommendations, this Note includes simulation analysis based on
    the current finances of the sector. EDM’s corporate financial model was adapted for this work. Targets
    for electrification are based on discussions with government officials. EDM’s current generation
    pipeline and its timing was taken as a given in order to simulate investment needs and evolution of
    sector finances under various tariff and funding availability assumptions. The various simulations and
    the broader sector quantitative and qualitative discussion should support policy formulation and
    prioritization going forward.
The energy sector in Mozambique
•   Mozambique has a small electricity system (approximately 680 MW installed capacity normally
    supplying the system) that has developed on the margins of important regional projects such as the
    Cahora Bassa hydropower plant (1977), the Mozal aluminium smelter near Maputo (2000) and the
    Sasol-run Pande/Temane gas processing and pipeline project (2004). Despite EDM carrying out major
    electrification in recent years, mostly in urban centers, the system still needs significant refurbishment
    and expansion if it is to enable Mozambique to develop in an inclusive manner and meet the economic
    potential suggested by its mineral resource wealth.
•   In particular, the power system has developed as three separate systems (although the northern and
    central systems have some interconnection). The transmission system does not cover all areas of the
    country. For instance power to the Maputo region from Hidroelectrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB) is
    delivered from South Africa. In large parts of the country that it does reach, it lacks resilience. In
    addition, while the distribution network has reached all administrative centers, the system has large
    gaps without a power grid - contributing to the difficulty in increasing access to electricity.
Challenges in the sector
•   Currently, the power sector in Mozambique faces three key challenges: i) to provide Reliable and
    Efficient Electricity Supply to its customers; ii) to cope with the increase in the electricity demand
    from its current (and future) customer base by expanding its Generation and Transmission Capacity;
    and, iii) to provide Access to Electricity to the vast majority of the population.

Reliable and Efficient Electricity Supply:
•   The physical condition of the system is poor, with frequent breakdowns and high rates of electricity
    losses (approx. 23.2% in 2014). There were over 59 hours of transmission interruptions in 20131 with
    the average interruption time increasing from 30 minutes in 2009 to 68 minutes in 2013. This is also
    caused in part because EDM lacks the technical staff to cope with the regular operation and
    maintenance of the grid2 at the same time as working on a new connections program.
                            Figure 2: Average interruption time in HV network (in minutes)

•   The maintenance and overhauling of the grid is constrained by the financial situation of EDM. Its
    audited accounts show that the cash flow from operations is insufficient to maintain the system and
    fund the current capital expenditure program. The evidence suggests that EDM is foregoing important
    maintenance work that would normally form part of operating costs.
•   EDM is very much dependent on external funding for investment, including government and donor
    support. EDM’s ability to raise money in commercial settings remains limited and the cost of doing so
    is high (loans from local banks are supplied at approximately 14% per annum). It is very likely that this
    high cost of debt funding from local banks relates to credit concerns and underlying tariff and
    operational uncertainty.

•     EDM is also financially constrained due to a significant amount of debt relative to its earnings. In 2013,
      EDM’s current ratio was very close to 1 and the debt service coverage ratio below 1, indicating that
      EDM's operating income is insufficient to meet its debt repayments and interest costs.
Generation and Transmission Capacity:
•     Going forward, significant growth in electricity demand is expected due to growth in industrial and
      commercial activities and broader increases in access to electricity. In 2014, peak demand was
      831MW 3 and growth has averaged over 11.6% per annum over the past 5 years. 4 Demand for
      electricity, as measured by billed energy including exports, has risen by over 9% per annum on average
      for the last 5 years and is expected to continue to increase rapidly in future.
•     The country is well endowed with natural resources for power generation, including certain large
      renewable energy projects – namely the 1,500 MW Mphanda Nkuwa hydropower project and the
      North Bank extension to Cahora Bassa (additional 1,245 MW) that could provide least cost power for
      the country and the region. However, to improve its resilience, coverage and/or to be able to export
      more power, the transmission system also needs to be extensively refurbished and expanded.
•     The cost of refurbishment and expansion, especially in relation to increasing electricity access, is high.

      set out in a draft Energy Strategy, for 50% access to the grid by 2023.

Access to Electricity
•     Without an effective government policy for electrification, electricity access is currently low and
      mainly focused in urban areas. By the end of 2014, only 25.2% of the households had access to the
      grid. Only a fraction of the population chooses electricity as their energy choice for lighting. Most are
      in urban areas. However, the vast majority (70%) of Mozambique’s population lives in rural areas and
      a very small proportion of these consumers use electricity for lighting (only 1.3% of rural households)
      (see Figure 3).

•   The Government of Mozambique in its latest 5 year government plan (Plano Quinquenal 2015-2019)
    has clearly highlighted the need to promote – inter alia – agricultural and industrial development as
    the basis for the socio-economic development of the country. Chief in achieving this objective, as
    recognized in the plan, is the development of the necessary infrastructures in the power sector to
    promote the development of value adding activities in such sectors.
Options and Solutions
•   Mozambique has inter-linked areas to focus on: levels of access to electricity among the population
    and the financial and technical sustainability of the sector, with the latter also contributing to the
    financial health of the power sector.
•   The financial sustainability can be addressed by government actions, developing a fully funded
    national electrification plan and development of regional trade. The technical sustainability can be
    achieved by developing and funding an operations and maintenance plan and by implementing a
    capacity building program that allows EDM (or other stakeholders) to efficiently develop technical
    interventions in the grid.

Improving access to electricity
•     To date, increasing access has been treated by government as part of EDM’s regular operating
      activities. However, based on analysis in this Note and experience from other countries, there is a
      need for the government to take a more proactive approach to funding access related investments.
      The size of investments involved are simply too large. The red bars in the figure below show the annual
      funding gap if Mozambique is to reach 50% access to the grid by 2023. This takes full account of all
      other sources of funding available.

                                                                  Donor loans (ongoing and pipeline)          EdM's own funds
                                                                  Financing gap


      Note: This scenario considers a 25% tariff increase in 2015, budgetary support at the level of 0.05% of Mozambican GDP and 50% access
      target being met by 2023; it also assumes ongoing and pipeline donor loans and grants which effectively reduce the remaining financing
      gap (please refer to Annex 6 for a list of ongoing and pipeline loans and grants); ‘financing gap’ is the additional funds needed to meet the
      stipulated access target of 50% by 2023 beyond budgetary support of 0.05%, ongoing and pipeline donor grants and loans. It is worth noting
      that under this scenario, including the 2015 tariff increase, EDM’s financial position does not improve to the extent that would allow EdM
      to at least partly finance its CAPEX.

•     Government should consider developing a ‘National Electrification Plan’. Such a plan would consider
      the technologies, appropriate costs, coordinating activities between EDM and FUNAE to ensure an
      off-grid strategy is in place to cover those areas in which the grid will not be extended in the short-
      term, financing mechanisms and implementation modalities for reaching access targets in both grid
      and off-grid alternatives. Critically, the Electrification Plan would need to be costed, funded and then
      implemented. Such a Plan and the various studies needed to develop and implement it could be
      funded with grants already available to Mozambique from the World Bank under the Sustainable
      Energy for All initiative.
•     Government should explicitly consider how the investment program under the Electrification Plan
      would be paid for. The important point being that EDM (or any other off-grid operator) needs to be
      supported with such an ambitious access plan. Without such a plan, as is currently the case, the
      difference between customer revenues and the cost of connecting and servicing these new customers

    stands to create a financing gap that – if unchecked – would lead to an increasingly serious financial
    hole for EDM.
Technical Sustainability
•   The development of an Operations and Maintenance Plan is key for ensuring the technical
    sustainability of the grid and to contribute to its financial health. EDM has taken a positive step in the
    reduction of technical and non-technical losses by starting the implementation of two activities under
    the Energy Development and Access Project (EDAP) financed by the World Bank: (i) incorporation of
    a state-of-art commercial management system (CMS) and (ii) roll-out of a revenue protection program
    (RPP), based on systematic recording and monitoring of consumption of EDM’s largest 4,000 users
    with the support of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). These activities need to be fully
    implemented.
•   The evidence from the level of system faults shows that EDM is not carrying out sufficient O&M
    expenditures. It is difficult to say what would be the appropriate level of O&M for EDM because this
    is highly dependent on the specific characteristics of the utility; nonetheless, determining the level of
    O&M and funding it is an exercise that EDM must perform on a regular basis in order to ensure that
    EDM is maintained under certain quality of service parameters. The Ministry of Mineral Resources
    and Energy would need to ensure that the sector has sufficient funding.
•   There is an urgent need for capacity building at all levels in the power sector. The Ministry of Mineral
    Resources and Energy needs stronger capacity to drive system planning and competitive processes to
    improve the efficiency of the sector while also helping to drive it towards the government’s access
    targets. CNELEC’s mandate should be clarified and its regulatory role strengthened, particularly in the
    area of tariff setting as a means to institutionalize financial sustainability for EDM and the need for
    tariff adjustment. Training and recruitment is also needed at EDM. A human resources development
    plan is needed as few staff are sufficiently qualified to maintain an expanding EDM system.
•   FUNAE tends to be excluded from energy planning, which has sometimes led to unnecessary projects
    or investments that are not in line with the national planning of grid extensions. FUNAE should
    consider building sufficient institutional capacity both in terms of financing rural electrification and in
    terms of executing stand-alone off-grid low-cost projects.
Financial Sustainability
•   Tariffs have decreased by about 20% in real terms between 2010 and 2014 as shown in Table 2 below.
    The 26.4% nominal tariff increase in October 2015 means that, in real terms, 2015 tariffs are just
    about three percentage points higher in real terms than in 2010. For residential customers, tariffs
    would still be five percentage points lower than in 2010.

•   Scenario modelling shows that, even with a 25% nominal tariff increase in 2015, followed by inflation
    level increases, EDM’s financial condition does not actually improve to the point of financial viability
    until the end of the decade (EDM is forecast to make a net loss until 2018) when significant exports
    are expected from 2019 onwards. This is shown in Figure 6 below; other scenarios are considered in

•   The size and timing of tariff increases directly affects EDM’s cash flows, profit and therefore its
    dependence on external funding, including budget support. A simulation analysis undertaken by the
    Bank (see Annex 2 and Annex 3) shows that with a 25% tariff increase, EDM will not be in a position
    to finance access related CAPEX in the short-medium term as all the surplus from the operational
    activities will be devoted to the repayment of its short term liabilities. The more ambitious the access
    target, the more difficult for EDM to finance access CAPEX with its own resources and the higher debt
    burden on EDM.
•   From simulation analysis carried out by the Bank (see outputs for the base case scenario in Figure 6),
    EDM is forecasted to generate net profit from 2019. Before that, even though EDM’s cash flow is
    positive, it is not sufficient to fund the rising debt costs, resulting in a net loss until 2018. The
    improvement from 2019 is the simulation can be linked to the commissioning of the 400 MW Temane
    MGTP gas-to-power project (to be developed by Sasol and EDM), with 100% off-take by EDM and
    sufficient transmission to Maputo constituting phase 1 of STE. In the simulation, the Ncondezi coal-
    fired IPP also contributes to the positive cash flows and profit during this period. Whilst EDM will get
    a smaller amount of energy from the Mphanda Nkuwa hydropower project (10% of the 1,500MW),
    this energy is expected to cost EDM significantly less – and therefore to also have a positive effect if
    it becomes available from 2021.
•   Meanwhile, EDM needs to be able to operate and maintain the existing system. To do so, its current
    tariffs need to cover the cost of operations and maintenance (O&M). We estimate that a tariff
    increase of 35% would have been required in 2015, followed by inflation level increases to cover
    appropriate O&M only. Such an increase would ensure a positive net profit. An increase of 25% in
    2015 and thereafter increases in line with inflation only - would only enable EDM to become financially
    viable following the start of substantial exports of power to the region following the commissioning


                                                                                                                                                   11
      of new plant around the end of the decade. We recommend that any tariff increases be designed
      taking into account the impact on the poorest.
Regional Trade
•     Mozambique has energy resources (including hydropower, coal, natural gas, solar and wind) well in
      excess of that needed to meet its internal electricity demand for decades to come (even considering
      potential unconstrained demand). It is also fortunate to be next to the second largest economy in
      Africa and a broader region with high demand for energy. This means that regional trade, whether
      through electricity or gas, could play an important role in assisting the development of Mozambique’s
      economy and could provide the critical mass needed to develop large energy projects within the
      country.
•     Furthermore, a comparison between average tariffs for Mozambique sales (9.1 USc/kWh in 2014),
      export tariffs (12.5 USc/kWh in 2014) and the avoided cost of generation in South Africa (10.5
      USc/kWh in 20126) shows that an integrated Mozambican and exports driven approach provides an
      important potential route to ensuring EDM’s financial viability in the long-run and could also be used
      to partially subsidize tariffs for Mozambican customers. Assuming these export prices persist, they
      could substitute for high tariffs from consumers and/or substitute for budget support and donor funds
      being used to increase access.
•     In the immediate near term, Mozambique is expected to derive benefit from gas from the existing
      Pande/Temane fields (operational since 2004, but mostly used for Sasol commercial activities in South
      Africa to date). A number of gas-fired generation projects are being developed along the pipeline,
      which could supply electricity within Mozambique or supply cross border to power markets in the
      region. The Centrale Termica Ressano Garcia (CTRG) 150 MW plant was recently commissioned, and
      EDM are in discussions with Sasol regarding a 400 MW plant at Temane.
•     Regarding Mozambique’s abundant hydropower resources, the primary projects being talked about
      are the Mphanda Nkuwa 1,500 MW project located approximately 60 kilometres downstream of
      Cahora Bassa and a 1,245 MW expansion to Cahora Bassa involving developing generating capacity
      on its north bank. Current expectations are for Mphanda Nkuwa to be operational by 2021, though
      there are high upfront costs and the need to attract commercial financing means that significant work
      still needs to be done to appropriately structure the project and raise the financing.

•     For the longer-term, Mozambique has abundant gas resources from the offshore Rovuma Basin,
      allowing gas to play an increasingly important role in the energy sector in the region in the future.
      There is a series of complex trade-offs to be made between the different uses for this gas, between
      exporting gas and exporting power to the region and between the level of economic rent to be
      achieved in the power sector and in the gas sector. Preliminary analysis shows that the levelized cost
      of Mphanda Nkuwa hydropower plant would be considerably lower than that of a large gas plant of
      similar capacity7. Decisions also need to be made in the context of HCB’s contract with Eskom expiring
      in 2029, and a potential additional 1,575 MW becoming available to EDM as well as potential changes
      to arrangements with Mozal that currently involve demand for 950MW of power. Given the

                                                                                                         12
    uncertainties and the timeframes involved, there may be greatest ‘option value’ in deferring decisions
    around allocation and forward regional sale of Rovuma gas for now. Options need to be carefully
    analyzed to ensure that Mozambique is optimising its resources.
Government Actions
•   In this environment, government has an important role to play on a number of issues. Government
    should consider taking the following actions:
        o   Taking the lead in ensuring that the National Electrification Plan is properly prepared, funded
            and implemented. This would include a work plan for publicly funded grid activities as well as
            modalities for off-grid private sector generation and supply models. Funding the Plan involves
            reaching out to donors in a coordinated manner to ensure maximum funding for the sector is
            channelled in a coordinated manner to address the funding gap for access investment.
        o   Ensuring that for O&M, EDM is financially viable. This means increasing tariffs at least in line
            with O&M costs. As noted above, real tariffs had decreased by approximately 20% since 2010
            before the tariff increase, while costs have risen. The tariff increase of 25% in 2015 followed
            by inflation level increases are the minimum to keep EDM afloat – even without giving it
            responsibility for investment in new connections. Regional trade would make EDM cash
            positive from operations from around 2019. For EDM to be able to operate and maintain its
            plant well now, an increase nearer 35% would have been needed in 2015, followed by
            inflation level increases.
        o   Working effectively with potential investors. Given the size of projects Mozambique is looking
            to develop, it needs to be particularly careful in ensuring that it provides an attractive
            environment for large investors. In this regard, the Government’s recent track record is poor.
            A number of large and highly credible global operators/investors worked together to reach
            agreement on development of STE and Mphanda Nkuwa. However, in 2013, the government
            bypassed existing parties to work with new parties. This severely dented investor confidence
            and has held back the process on these projects by at least 2 years.
        o   Ensuring that the legal framework is clear, transparent and certain for investors. For example,
            there are currently discrepancies between the Electricity Act and the PPP Law that have led
            to significant delays in re-financing of the new gas fired EDM/Sasol CTRG plant.
        o   Working with multi-lateral partners to offer specific comfort to investors and financiers, such
            as with guarantees, to ensure that investments take place. Certain third party guarantees,
            such as those of the World Bank, can reduce the amount of contingent liability the
            government needs to take in offering guarantees. Such guarantees can also be used by the
            government in a programmatic manner to increase the ongoing impact of public sector funds
            in the sector.

Mozambique Energy Sector Policy Note
                       I.      Introduction

                       1.       This Note is intended to support the Government of Mozambique in
                       determining priorities for policy decisions with the aim of delivering efficiently
                       produced, technically and financially sustainable electricity supply to the Mozambican
                       population. There are trade-offs created by the circumstances Mozambique finds itself
                       in, and the government needs to be able to determine how it will prioritize actions as
                       well as their relative timing. The emphasis, driven by government objectives, is on
                       increasing access as well as diversifying the energy mix as a means to delivering the
                       electricity to the population with security of supply. Given the current performance of
                       the sector, being able to meet these objectives will require significant changes to how
                       the sector is performing.

    For                2.       The Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy has developed a draft Energy
    simulations,       Strategy for the sector which covers the period 2014-238. The strategy sets out the vision
    the                and the way the Government expects to respond to challenges and opportunities in the
    Government         energy sector. The Government Strategy sets as an objective, reaching 50% grid
    draft Energy       connectivity for the population by 2023 (from a current figure of 25.2% 9 ). The UN’s
    Strategy which     Sustainable Energy for All program targets universal access10, which the Government
    sets a target of   should aspire to in the long run. Nevertheless, the Government’s objective for grid access
    50% access by      will need to be complemented by off-grid connections, where more cost effective.
    2023 is used.      Meeting these significantly higher levels of access will require significant investment not
                       just in the grid and off-grid access, but also in the provision of power.


                       II.     Country Context

                       3.       Mozambique is a low income country with a population of almost 26 million. It
                       has enjoyed strong and sustained growth since the end of its civil war in 1992. Its
                       economy grew at an average rate of 7.4% over the past two decades, due in large part
                       to sound macroeconomic management, large-scale foreign investment in projects and
                       support from development partners. However, robust and broad based growth and
                       rapidly falling poverty rates in the aftermath of the civil war have gradually given way to
    Growth has
                       less equitable growth, persistent poverty and rising inequality. Over 50% of the
    been strong
                       population was still living below the poverty line in 2009 and at the end of 2014, only

    inclusive.
                       4.     The vast majority (70%) of Mozambique’s population lives in rural areas11, mostly

                    6.      The Government of Mozambique, in its latest 5 year Government Plan 13 ,
                    highlights the need to promote – inter alia – the agricultural and industrial development
                    as the basis for socio-economic development of the country. Chief in achieving this task,
                    as recognised in the plan, is the development of the necessary infrastructures in the
                    power sector to promote the development of value adding activities in the country.

                    7.       Going forward, Mozambique has abundant energy resources, including an
                    estimated 18,000 MW of hydropower potential, 277 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, 20
                    billion tonnes of coal and significant solar and wind potential.14

                    8.       Mozambique is in the fortunate position of being able to engage in significant
                    regional trade. It neighbours South Africa, whose peak annual demand was 36,000 MWs
                    in 2013, has suffered significant load shedding recently due to issues with maintenance
                    of existing plant and delays with new plants. Although Eskom is currently facing financial
                    challenges, Government of South Africa (GoSA) backed Power Purchase Agreements
                    (PPAs) have proven to be commercially bankable. Since 2011, South Africa has enabled
                    over 4 GW of private sector financed renewable energy Independent Power Producers

                    III.     Sector Description and Challenges

                    Sector Context

                    10.      The sector is governed through the 1997 Electricity Law. The Ministry of Mineral
                    Resources and Energy16 is responsible for governance, planning and policy in the sector.
                    Electricity tariffs are set by the Ministry. Electricidade de Moçambique (EdM) is the state-
                    owned, vertically integrated, generation, transmission, distribution and grid supply
                    company. The Energy Fund (Fundo de Energia /FUNAE) is a public body with the aim of
                    promoting the development and use of different forms of low cost power and the
                    sustainable management of power resources. Initially setup as a fund, FUNAE today
                    operates mostly as an implementing agency notably for off-grid generation and access
                    projects. The National Council for Electricity (CNELEC), although often considered as
                    having a regulatory type function, was established (in 1997) as a purely consultative
                    body, its role being to advise the Ministry of Energy and Council of Ministers on issues
                    including new concessions and tariffs.

                    11.     The Mozambican power system has been heavily influenced by the development
                    of the Cahora Bassa hydropower facility which primarily sells power to South Africa, with
                    Mozambique taking some of the power for its own consumption. It is owned and
                    operated by Hidroelectrico de Cahora Bassa (HCB), which is 92.5% owned by EdM and
                    has a reporting line to the Board of EdM. The plant is a 2,075 MW plant (5 x 415 MW
                    units) with approximately 100 square kilometre reservoir located on the Zambezi River
                    upstream of the city of Tete in the central region of Mozambique. Most of this power is
                    exported to Eskom - though 300MW of firm power and 200MW of non-firm power is
                    made available to EdM. It commenced operations in 1977. Two 533kV high voltage
                    direct current (HVDC) lines were built from this region to South Africa – but no
                    connection was built through Mozambique to its southern region. To this day, power to
                    the Maputo region from Cahora Bassa is still delivered from South Africa.

                  12.     The Mozambique power system actually developed as three separate systems
                  (although the northern and central systems have some interconnection). The
                  transmission system does not cover all areas of the country and - in large parts of the
                  country that it does reach - lacks resilience. In addition, while the distribution network
                  has reached all administrative centers (all 128 district administrative centres had been
                  connected by the end of 2014 17 ), the system has large gaps with no grid access -
                  contributing to the difficulty in increasing access.

                  13.      Mozambique has a significant renewable generation endowment estimated at
                  over 23,000 GW, the vast bulk of which is solar. Of this potential, 7.5 GW have been
                  identified as priority projects including 5.6 GW of hydro, 1.1 GW of wind, 0.6 GW of solar
                  and smaller quantities of biomass and geothermal.18 The Government has a strategy to
                  deploy renewable energy so as to increase access to power and to build human capital
                  in the renewable sector. Indeed, the optimal way to increase access is likely to include
                  significant off-grid, mini-grid and pico-grid developments using conventional and
                  renewable resources. To support the development of renewable generation,

                    Mozambique has approved a regulation for renewable energy feed-in tariffs (REFIT). The
                    REFIT scheme will target generation plants of 10MW or less, connected to the main grid
                    and using any of four types of renewable technology: hydropower, solar, biomass and
                    wind. The feed-in tariffs vary by plant size and technology, ranging between 4.06-5.74
                    MT/kWh (12.23-17.29 USc/kWh) for biomass, 4.12-8.00 MT/kWh (12.41-24.09
                    USc/kWh) for wind, 2.29-4.81 MT/kWh (6.90-14.49 USc/kWh) for hydropower and 7.91-
                    13.02 MT/kWh (23.82-39.21 USc/kWh) for solar, although the tariffs could be changed
                    after three years.19

                    14.      FUNAE has been active in funding and implementing off-grid power production
                    systems, namely in the areas of solar PV, mini-hydro and biomass. For example, in 2012,
                    it put in place 81 mini-grid and off-grid systems with a total capacity of 274kW.20 Over
                    the 17 years of its existence, FUNAE has made an important contribution to improving
                    access to energy in rural areas through the implementation of projects with the support
                    of partners (World Bank, Belgium, European Union, Portugal, Spain, China, India,
                    Denmark and Finland) which consisted of electrification of (i) 260 villages, of which 191
                    were with photovoltaic systems and 69 with generators and extension of the network;
                    (ii) 580 schools, including the residences of teachers and distribution of computers in
                    some schools; (iii) 561 health centers, including the residences of nurses and providing
                    fridges for the conservation of vaccines; (iv) 74 administrative post buildings; (v) 3 fish
                    markets and ice storage facilities; (vi) construction of 1 mini hydro; (vii) installation of 19
                    water pumping systems; and (viii) production of 1,500 stoves that will be distributed in
                    rural communities for the dissemination of this technology. In addition, FUNAE has
                    overseen the construction of three Photovoltaic solar plants funded by South Korea and
                    that have enabled the electrification of the Mavago, Muembe and Mecula districts in
                    Niassa province, as well as the construction of a solar panel factory in Maputo province,
                    which is expected to help reduce costs of implementation of solar energy projects in
                    Mozambique. FUNAE has also promoted the development of a Renewable Energy Atlas
                    for Mozambique, as well as the construction of 51 fuel filling stations under a program

 which is           in Mozambique in the Pande gas field in 1961, followed by Buzi (1962) and Temane
 increasingly       (1967)21. Initially, the gas fields were thought not to be commercial. The internal strife
 being used for     of independence and the civil war combined with the lack of an internal market for the
 domestic           gas delayed development. Work was undertaken to map and appraise the Pande and
 power              Temane fields in the 1980s and 1990s22. In 2003, Sasol undertook extensive drilling of
 generation.        exploration and production wells in the Pande/Temane block and commercial gas

                    MGJ (0.97 tcf) of gas had been produced, of which 989 MGJ (0.94 tcf) had been exported
                    to South Africa. Current production is at a rate of 171 MGJ/annum (0.16 tcf/yr) and these

                    16.     In 2010, gas discoveries were made in the Rovuma Basin, offshore in Northern
                    Mozambique. Gas reserves, at 128 tcf (3P), are sufficiently large to be used
                    simultaneously for LNG exports, for major industry within Mozambique, for power
                    generation and potentially for pipeline exports to South Africa. Announced investments
 Mozambique         to develop the first phase of two Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) value chains from

 significant        capacity, slow development of the regulatory framework24, a lack of infrastructure in the
 quantity of gas    region near the gas resources which may affect the cost and timing of LNG production
 from Rovuma.       and price trends in the global LNG market. The estimated revenues are transformational
                    and could be in excess of US$300 billion over the life time of the projects25.

                    17.     Mozambique as a primary resource rich country also has world class reserves of
                    coal. Part of these reserves have sufficient quality to be exported, while a significant
                    portion can be used for domestic power generation. Specifically, coal deposits are
                    estimated at 20 billion tons and annual exports could amount to 100 million tons at peak,
                    making Mozambique one of the most important coal exporters in the world.26

                    18.      There are two sources of power demand growth in the region. The first is the
                    South African economy. It is the second largest in sub-saharan Africa and its rate of
                    access was 82% in 2014. Its growth would lead to a significant increase in power demand
                    in the region. A significant portion of Eskom’s old coal fired fleet will be decommissioning
                    over the coming years requiring additional generating capacity in the region in addition
                    to that needed to meet incremental demand. For Eskom, peak (suppressed) demand is
                    currently 42,416 MWs and actual available capacity is 41,074 MWs27. In considering its
                    options for purchase of power, Eskom would be expected to consider lifetime costs of
                    various technologies across the region. The Integrated Resource Plan for South Africa
                    quotes imported levelized cost of energy (LCOE) from Mozambican hydro as ZARc 33.2-
                    39.3/kWh (2.7-3.2 USc/kWh). This, together with Zambian hydropower quoted at ZARc
                    14.9-17.5/kWh (1.2-1.4 USc/kWh) is highly competitive compared with other options

                   19.      A number of generation projects based in Mozambique could be important least
                   cost options for the country and the region. The Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) prepared
                   by the Government of South Africa29 and feasibility study work carried out by EDM in
                   Mozambique30 indicate that certain large projects in Mozambique – namely the 1,500
                   MW Mphanda Nkuwa hydropower project (some 60 kilometers downstream of Cahora
                   Bassa) and the North Bank extension to Cahora Bassa (additional 1,245 MW) would
                   provide least cost power for the region. These projects require significant extra
                   transmission capacity to be built – and the projects themselves are highly capital
                   intensive. Mphanda Nkuwa is estimated to cost in the region of US$3 billion and the high
                   voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission to evacuate power to the region a further
                   US$1 billion (part of the regional DC and national Alternating Current (AC) system known
                   as STE). The size of the required investment suggests the project will require significant
                   international and private sector investment and skillful leadership on the part of the
                   Government of Mozambique to advance.

                   Mozambique and currently requires significant adaptation and investment together with
                   institutional development.

                   EDM demand and supply

                   In 2014, peak demand on the EDM system was 831MW and growth has averaged over
                   11.6% per annum over the past 5 years.31 Demand for electricity, as measured by billed
                   energy including exports, has risen by over 9% per annum on average for the last 5 years
                   and is expected to continue to increase rapidly in future. EDM had 1.38 million retail
                   customers at the end of 2014. This number has grown by over 13% per annum over the
                   last 5 years. Consumption in 2014 was broken down as follows by consumer group:
                   transmission connected clients 9.8%, residential customers 40.6%, commercial 9.1%,
 Consumer          agriculture 0.7%, large LV customers 4.8%, large MV/HV tariff based customers 30.7%

                   system are tariff based customers. In 2015, average tariffs were as follows: residential
                   customers 11.3 USc/kWh, commercial customers 17.95 USc/kWh, agriculture 5.7

                   transmission system (who are free to negotiate tariffs with EDM) paid on average 10.00
                   USc/kWh.33 EDM charges for connections. However, these charges do not recover the

                    Developments in the southern region include large mixed commercial/residential
                    developments and new office, residential and mixed use buildings in the center of
                    Maputo. Industrial developments expected include cement works, aluminum foundries,
                    cable manufacturers and a titanium smelter. Developments in the central region include
                    an industrial park and developments of coal and rail facilities and the construction of
                    hydro and thermal power stations. Developments in the northern region are larger and
                    include mining activities, primarily heavy sands, and phosphate, rail and port
                    developments for coal export, off-shore support services to the on-going natural gas
                    exploration and future extraction, and large agricultural and forestry projects36.

                23.      EDM has generation capacity available to it from HCB, own generation and IPPs.
                Historically, Mozambique’s power was based on hydropower. As discussed earlier, HCB
                power makes up the majority of power available to EDM (see Table 5). EDM received
                power from HCB as well as some small hydropower plants. However, recently, gas from
                the Pande and Temane gas fields has been used to develop gas fired power generation.
                EDM signed a temporary PPA with Aggreko for power now being generated at Ressano
                Garcia37. It has recently partnered with Sasol to develop a 175MW gas engine plant at

                   24.      Of the three grid systems, the Southern system serves Maputo and areas up the
                   coast and is connected to South Africa and Swaziland via the Mozambique Transmission
                   Company (Motraco) 38 lines as well as 275kV and 110kV lines to Komatipoort in South
                   Africa. The central system covering the Beira corridor is connected to local hydropower
                   generation at Mavuzi and Chicamba as well as a link to Zimbabwe (mainly used for back-
                   up imports) – and a northern system fed directly from Cahora Bassa and stretching up to
                   Nampula in the north. This northern system also connects to the Southern African Power
                   Pool (SAPP) via the 330kV AC line at Songo into Zimbabwe as well as the 533kV HVDC
                   lines to Apollo in South Africa (the route for the majority of power evacuated from
                   Cahora Bassa). Details can be seen in the map in Annex 7: Map of Mozambique Energy
                   Sector and Proposed Transmission Lines.

                   25.     Due to a lack of connectivity between the central and southern systems,
                   Mozambique actually needs to transfer power via its neighbours to deliver power from
                   the central to the Maputo regions. The power travels via the DC lines to South Africa,

                    and Eskom sends power to the Maputo region via the Motraco lines. Whilst this has
                    worked to date, any new generation in the central region – which includes significant
                    hydropower and coal reserves – would require a national backbone to deliver power
                    down to the Maputo region. The development of a backbone transmission line, known
                    as STE or Sociedade Nacional de Transporte de Energia, has been held up by the slow
                    pace of development of further large Zambezi hydropower generation plants39 – which
                    are seen as critical for the financial viability of such a major transmission project. STE
                    would run from the central Tete region to the south of the country (approximately 1,300
                    kilometres) and is hence key to improving access to electricity for several parts of the
                    country, national security of supply and providing a means to export power from new
                    generation projects utilizing Mozambique’s energy resources. The STE would connect to
                    the existing Motraco lines to South Africa. The Motraco lines are currently used to feed
                    power from Eskom to BHP Billiton’s Mozal aluminium smelter 40 using two 400kV
                    transmission lines. The capacity of the lines is about 1,200MW and the smelter
                    consumes about 950MW – which would therefore allow up to about 2,150MW of
                    exports from the Maputo region using the existing lines in reverse flow.

                    26.     A single transmission line delivers power to the north-eastern region, making
                    power supplies vulnerable to outages on the line. In January 2015, floods damaged the
                    line to this region, cutting power to 350,000 EdM customers (and 2 million people
                    altogether) for a period of four weeks.41 Even under normal operation the line to the
                    north east is overloaded, resulting in load shedding in the region of over four hours per
                    day.42 The development of a second line to the north east is key to improving security of
                    supply for existing customers and for providing the transmission capacity required to
                    meet demand from new customers as access to power in the region is increased. Options
                    include the 400kV US$ 620 million Caia (Chimuara) via Alto Molocue to Namialo line
                    combined with a 220kV line from Nampula to Nacala 43 as well as extension of the
                    proposed Mozambique-Malawi line which would provide a more direct and likely higher
                    capacity (400kV) connection between Matambo substation in central Mozambique
                    where significant future new hydropower development is expected and Nacala in the
                    North East.

                   million) as the direct result of 59 hours of transmission interruptions and due to the

                   30.      Total losses in electricity supply were 23% in 2014. From the experience of Bank
                   staff, technical losses for the transmission and distribution system operated by EDM,
                   with most of the demand concentrated in the Maputo-Matola region, should not exceed
                   12%. This implies that the level of non-technical losses (consumption that is not metered
                   and billed) is at least around 10% of gross available energy, but probably more. In
                   comparable utilities like Kenya Power, non-technical losses do not exceed 7%. The high
                   level of non-technical losses reflects poor performance of EDM in consumption metering
                   and billing activities.

                   31.     As at 2013, pre-payment meters had been installed for 84% of household
                   customers and in that year EDM’s collection rate was 98%.49 Total unbilled consumption
                   in 2014 amounted to 2.6% of gross available energy (123 GWh). Unbilled consumption
                   consists of public lighting for which EDM does not get any revenue, EDM’s own
                   consumption and bad debts (electricity billed but not paid for). Recently there has been
                   an increase in the collection rate from 97% in 2013 to 98% in 2014.

                   32.     Under the Energy Development and Access Project (EDAP) financed by the World
                   Bank, EDM is currently implementing two key activities aimed to achieve and sustain on
                   time an acceptable level of non-technical losses: (i) incorporation of a state-of-art
                   commercial management system (CMS) to support efficient, transparent and
                   accountable execution of all commercial processes and activities, in particular the
                   revenue cycle (metering-billing-collection); (ii) implementation of a revenue protection
                   program (RPP), based on systematic recording and monitoring of consumption of EDM’s
                   largest 4,000 users (3% of total number, representing more than 45% of total current
                   sales) with the support of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI).

                      funding. The STIP consists of 13 network projects that can be completed in the next 2-3
                      years, estimated to cost $118 million. A further example is the plan to install 50MW of

                    36.     The audited accounts show that EdM has a positive cash flow from operations
                    but that these are insufficient to maintain the system and fund current and future capital
                    expenditures. EdM currently does not have the financial resources to meet the
                    government’s access targets and enhance the system, resulting in its continual
                    dependence on external funding. EdM has a significant amount of debt relative to its
                    earnings, as indicated by the debt / EBITDA, CFO / debt and FOCF / debt ratios. A current
                    ratio greater than 1 indicates that EdM would be able to meet its current liabilities at
                    short notice. However, this ratio has deteriorated over time and in 2013 was very close
                    to 1. In addition, the debt service coverage ratio is below 1, indicating that EdM’s
                    operating income is insufficient to meet its debt repayments and interest.

                    37.     Investments in the power sector currently are dependent on a number of
                    different forms of funding. Specifically, EdM’s assets grew by about 24% (from 35,134
                    MT million to 43,631 MT million) between 2011 and 2013, mainly as a result of the
                    expansion of the distribution network. These capital expenditures were covered mainly
                    through budget support in the form of grants, on-lending loans from the government
                    (sourced from institutions such as World Bank IDA, Belgium, Sweden, etc), direct grants
                    from donors and other concessional loans.

                    38.      As at 2013, on-lending loans from the government formed the most important
                    source of debt funding for EdM (44% share in debt funding) and grants from donors
                    38%. 52 EdM’s outstanding on-lending loans in 2013 were 6,875 MT million (US$ 222
                    million) and grants from donors amounted to 5,941 MT million (US$ 192 million). The
                    different forms of debt funding are set out in Table 9 below.

  Grants from donors are net income for EdM as there is no expectation on repayment. These grants are however
recorded as liability on EdM’s balance sheet and recognised in profit and loss account on a systematic basis over
time in line with when the underlying expenditure for which the grants were received are incurred.

                     41.      Only a small proportion of EdM´s current debt funding originates from
                     commercial and quasi commercial loans (18%). EdM had in the order of 2,792 MT million
                     (US$ 90 million) of outstanding loans as at 2013 from a combination of quasi-commercial
                     lenders and private sector investors (local banks). Outstanding commercial and quasi
                     commercial loans increased in absolute terms (from US$ 58 million in 2011 to US$ 90
                     million in 2013) and also increased relative to other sources of external funding (i.e.
                     concessional loans and grants). Outstanding commercial and quasi-commercial loans as
                     a proportion of EdM’s total loans and grants outstanding increased from 14% in 2011 to
                     18% in 2013. The absolute increase in commercial funding suggests that EdM has been
                     better able to raise money in commercial or quasi-commercial settings. The majority of
                     this funding comes from AfD, DBSA and Sasol. 54 The most significant lender is Sasol with

                     42.       EdM’s precarious financial position is partly due to a lack of tariff increases in
                     recent years. Tariffs are currently uniform across the country with large customers
                     (supplied at voltage level of 66kV or higher) required to negotiate their tariffs with EdM.
                     Tariff-based customers form 90% of EdM’s non-export energy sales. The average current
                     level is 3.57 MT/kWh (10.74 USc/kWh) after a 26% increase approved in October 2015.
                     However, the last tariff increase took place in 2010 and since then EdM’s tariffs have
                     decreased by about 20% in real terms while costs have risen by about 18% between 2011
                     and 2013. This is despite a tariff study undertaken for EdM in 2011 that recommended
                     tariffs increase by an average of 15% in 2012, 15% in 2013 and 9% in 2014.56 Table 12
                     below shows the evolution of tariff in real terms. The 26% nominal tariff increase in
                     October 2015 means that that in real terms 2015 tariffs would be about three percent
                     higher than in 2010.

                     43.    Although tariff revenues have increased with the increase in the number of
                     connections, the revenue from each new customer is insufficient to cover EdM’s costs of
                     connection and supply.

                     44.       In October 2015, the Council of Ministers granted EdM an average tariff increase
                     of 26.4%.57 EdM structured the tariff proposal so as to avoid an increase for those on
                     the social tariff and for agricultural consumers connected at low voltage. Below average
                     tariff increases were proposed and approved for residential customers and agricultural
                     customers connected at medium voltage. Above average increases were proposed for
                     other tariff customers (large customers and commercial customers).

   This is likely related to the recent CTRG project, where EdM’s 51% equity share is currently being carried by Sasol
until the project can be re-financed (expected imminently).

                      45.       A comparison between average tariffs for sales in Mozambique and export tariff
                      shows that exports are important to ensure EdM’s financial viability in the long-run.
                      Exports revenues can also be used to partially subsidize Mozambican tariffs. The
                      economic impact study for the Transmission Backbone Feasibility Study estimated an
                      avoided generation cost of 10.5 USc/kWh and a willingness to pay of 17.5 USc/kWh in
                      South Africa.58 For 2014, the average export tariff was 12.5 USc/kWh and for 2015 EdM’s
                      assumed average export tariff is 14 USc/kWh. In comparison, the tariff for transmission
                      connected customers in Mozambique was 10 USc/kWh in 2014 and is assumed to be
                      11.5 USc/kWh in 2015. Currently, average tariffs for sales in Mozambique are 10.83
                      USc/kWh59 for tariff based customers. Table 14 below provides the weighted average
                      tariffs (before and after the tariff adjustment of October 2015) for Mozambican tariff-

                      46.      There are 3,596 customers on the social tariff compared to 1,259,638 on the
                      residential tariff.60 This and the low average consumption of customers on the social
                      tariff suggest that the social tariff is not currently placing a large financial burden on EdM.

                      47.       The 18% tariff increase for residential domestic customers is about 8 percentage
                      points lower than the average proposed tariff increase of 26.4%. That is, in real terms,
                      tariffs for residential customers would still be about five percentage points lower than in
                      2010.

                      48.     EDM’s analysis shows that bills for low income households (consuming 200 kWh
                      per month) would increase by 114.48 MT per month, bills for medium income
                      households (consuming 500 kWh per month) would increase by 286.20 MT and bills for
                      high income households (consuming 1,000 kWh per month) would increase by 597.60
                      MT per month.61

                      49.      EDM´s approved tariff increase in October 2015 shows an average tariff increase
                      of 26.4%. At the time of preparing this Note, mostly prior to October 2015, the Bank’s
                      team considered a more conservative tariff increase of 25% as the base case scenario.
                      This follows from discussions with the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy and
                      EdM. Other scenarios for different tariff increases are considered in Annex 3 to show
                      their effect on EDM´s financial situation going forward.



                      IV.      Analysis of opportunities going forward

                      50.      Delivering efficiently produced, technically and financially sustainable electricity
                      to consumers in the current context of the Mozambican power sector is a challenging
                      activity, requiring careful planning and coordination.

                      51.     Expanding energy access in a sustainable manner requires a plan to prevent new
                      customers further deteriorating EdM’s finances. Promoting a financially sound EdM will
                      require the government to target more budgetary support directly to energy access
                      programs.

                      52.     Furthermore, if Mozambique can take advantage of its natural resources and
                      geographical location to promote regional trade in the power sector, then it could be
                      possible to use trade as a complementary mechanism to help EdM in achieving financial
                      sustainability while promoting electricity access.

                      53.     With this structure in mind, there is a broad range of activities, projects or
                      measures which could contribute, directly or indirectly, to the objective of ensuring
                      sustainable electricity access (see Figure below).

Delivering Operations & Maintenance

54.      Another important aspect that is crucial to drive improvement in the financial
sustainability of EDM, is the reduction of technical and non-technical losses. Under the
Energy Development and Access Project (EDAP) financed by the World Bank, EDM is
currently implementing two key activities aimed at achieving and sustaining an
acceptable level of non-technical losses: (i) incorporation of a state-of-art commercial
management system (CMS) to support efficient, transparent and accountable execution
of all commercial processes and activities, in particular the revenue cycle (metering-
billing-collection); and (ii) implementation of a revenue protection program (RPP), based
on systematic recording and monitoring of consumption of EDM’s largest 4,000 users
(3% of total number, representing more than 45% of total current sales) with the support
of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). These activities need to be fully
implemented.

55.     Apart from improving operations, EDM needs to be able to fully fund its
operations and maintenance (O&M). Doing so involves having sufficient income from
operations which basically means sufficiently high tariffs. Having certainty over sufficient
revenue income will enable EDM to plan more effectively.

56.     EDM is not carrying out sufficient O&M expenditures. It is difficult to say what
the appropriate level of O&M should be for EDM, and it is difficult to benchmark EDM
against other utilities as utilities tend to be different in their characteristics. If we assume
that the rate of 80,000 connections per year is a proxy for sufficient additional O&M, to
cover these costs, at least a 35% increase in tariffs would be required in 2015. This would
make EDM financially sustainable even in the short term.




                                                                                           34
                     Power System Expansion

                     57.     Three forms of investment will be required to deliver on access targets. Firstly,
                     project focused investment for major generation (which will likely be mostly from the
                     private sector with possible limited EDM participation) and for major transmission
                     projects (mostly public sector funded with development partner support). Secondly, a
                     large program of less discrete investments across the grid – mostly focused on increasing
                     access. Thirdly, for off-grid electrification projects.

                     58.      The UN’s Sustainable Energy for All program targets universal access62, which the
                     Government should aspire to in the long run. However, if this target was to be met by
                     2030, this would require a substantial increase in the rate of new connections.
                     Specifically, this would require 419,000 new connections per year which is about 301,000
                     new connections per year more than EDM’s current connection rate of 118,000 per
                     annum. Given the large increase in the rate at which EDM is currently connecting new
                     customers required, the prospects for achieving universal access by 2030 do not seem
                     realistic.
                     59.     EDM published its Business Plan for the period 2015 – 2019 in October 2014.63
                     Thus EDM’s Business Plan was published after the Ministry indicated a draft target for
                     50% access rate by 2023. Based on EDM’s Business Plan, EDM should be connecting of
                     the order of 100,000 to 135,000 new households per year in the next five years.
                     According to our calculations, this translates into achieving a 35.8% access rate in 2019.
                     This is about 6 percentage points lower than the one implied for 2019 by the
                     Government’s draft Energy Strategy target of 50% access by 2023.64 65

                     60.      The optimal way to increase access to electricity services is likely to include
                     significant off-grid or mini-grid developments given the large gaps with no main grid
                     access. Even though the Government’s access target as currently set out specifically
                     applies to grid connected customers only, there is a need for coordination between
                     on-grid and off-grid roll out plans. This should form part of a National Electrification Plan.

                     61.     The Bank has estimated the cost of connecting new customers to the grid based
 It is important     on the Master Plan Update report, revised to use lower cost engineering solutions similar
 to establish the    to those used in a number of countries including in the US, in Latin America and recently
 cost of             in Africa. This includes much greater use of single phase instead of three phase
 meeting the         distribution – which allows to supply low and medium voltage demands with acceptable
 access target -     service quality at significantly lower costs. Market-determined pricing from Peru is used

do Programa Quinquenal do Governo 2015 – 2019, p. 34). Our understanding is that this access target refers to
‘access to public lighting’ rather than grid access as such. The explicit target for grid access of 50% by 2023 was
stated by the government in its Energy Strategy for the period 2014 - 2023 (Estratégia de energia 2014-2023, p.
21).

   We assume linear growth in the number of connections from 2015 to 2023 to achieve the Government target.

 to evaluate        for reference calculation purposes, and make possible to establish a lower bound for
 whether and        electrification costs in Mozambique. The actual costs will likely be higher. With the low
 how it can be      cost solutions, connection costs vary by type of customer between around US$385 per
 funded.            connection for an ‘ordinary’ single-phase connection request to over US$1,400 per
                    connection for rural customers where intensification of the distribution network is
                    required. Given that this is a lower bound, a higher but still reasonable estimate of
                    connection costs made by Bank staff again based on the experience in a number of
                    countries ranges between about US$580 per connection for ordinary requests to over
                    US$2,100 per connection for additional connections above the Master Plan
                    assumptions.66 This compares to revenues today from household customers of about
                    US$120 per annum.67

                    62.     Achieving the 50% grid access target by 2023 would require a considerable
                    increase in the rate at which EDM is currently connecting new customers. EDM has
                    recently been connecting about 120,000 households per annum (between 2011 and
                    2014) and would need to connect an additional 57,000 households per annum above its
                    current rate of connections if it was to meet the 50% access target by 2023 68 . This
                    suggests the following capital cost program (Table 15). These costs use the base
                    assumptions discussed above for low cost engineering solutions estimated by the Bank.

                    connecting customers even setting aside the cost of new generation which will largely
                    take place via IPPs. Figure 11 estimates the amount of additional funds needed for the
                    next five years to meet EDM’s investment needs if it was to meet the 50% access target
                    by 2023 and assuming a 25% tariff increase in 2015.

   In 2013, the average sales per residential customer was 1,224 kWh (1,416 GWh of billed sales divided by 1.156
million residential customers). The average tariff for residential customers in 2012 was 2.95 MT/kWh (the amount
invoiced 3,637 MT million divided by 1,233 GWh of total consumption for residential customers). This implies annual
revenues of US$ 117 per customer in 2013. Sources: EDM Annual Statistical Report 2012 and 2013, and EDM

                       Note: This scenario considers a 25% tariff increase in 2015, budgetary support at the level of 0.05% of Mozambican GDP
                       and 50% access target is met by 2023; assumes ongoing and pipeline donor loans and grants (please refer to Annex 6 for
                       a list of ongoing and pipeline loans).

                       64.     The above figure shows that EDM will need, on average, US$500 million per year
                       on top of its currently expected budgetary support (0.05% of Mozambican GDP) in order
                       to achieve the 50% access target by 2023. A comparison between a 50% access target by
                       2023 and less stringent access scenarios show that a 13% reduction in the yearly
                       financing gap could be achieved if the 50% access target is achieved by 2030 (instead of
                       2023). Alternatively, EDM would need to raise 28% less funds if it was connecting on
                       average 80,000 new customers per year (approximately 35% access would be achieved
                       under this scenario in 2023 and 38% by 2030). This information is summarised in Figure
                       12 below.

65.      The implication of the 25% tariff increase (followed by inflation adjustments) is
to help EDM restore its financial health, especially in the longer term. It is important to
note that even if cash flow from operating activities is positive for most of the years of
the forecast, EDM’s ability to fund its CAPEX remains limited. This is because these funds
are firstly needed to cover any short term liabilities, including debt financing. Only then,
and – if anything is left after the repayment of short term liabilities – could EDM finance
part of the access CAPEX. However, as the amount of short term liabilities is linked to the
access target, the more aggressive the access target is, the more likely EDM will need to
rely on short term loans (unless additional Government or donor support is provided)
and so less financial resources will be available to fund access CAPEX from EDM’s own
resources.

66.     Table 16 below shows that, even under a less aggressive access target (50%
access target met by 2030), it will take more than 7 years to restore EDM’s financial
position to the extent that it will be able to co-finance the access CAPEX. We note
however that if the forecast export revenues materialise, there is a potential that in the
longer term, EDM should have enough internal resources to finance a substantial share
of the access CAPEX. Specifically, EDM could finance on average up to 76% of the overall
capital expenditures for the period between 2023 and 2026, as indicated in Table 16
below.

Note: This analysis assumes lower cost engineering solutions are used in line with the World Bank staff estimates (base
case) and there is a 25% tariff increase in 2015 followed by increases at inflation rate. The remaining CAPEX is funded by
a combination of commercial and quasi-commercial loans at an average rate 7.4% per annum. Worth noting that if the
remaining CAPEX is funded by a combination of grants, donor loans and commercial loans, EDM’s ability to fund the CAPEX
from its own resources would be higher. This is because commercial loans are relatively more expensive as compared to
concessional loans and grants represent net income for EDM.


67.      Finally, it is important to note that there is a need to enhance EDM’s ability to
raise funds at relatively low cost in commercial settings so that the debt burden on EDM
is not unsustainable (currently the average cost of debt from local banks for EDM is
approximately 14% per annum). Enhancing EDM’s ability to raise funds in commercial
settings at a lower cost could be achieved by improving the commercial and operational
fundamental performance of EDM and also by considerably improving sector
transparency on policy and tariff decisions. This should in turn lead to a decrease in cost
of debt (lower interest rates), thus improving EDM’s overall profitability and its ability to
use its operating cash flow to partly fund its CAPEX rather than using its revenues to
repay the high cost of debt. It is important to note that ultimately, before export
revenues increase, EDM’s ability to carry out such an ambitious access investment plan
will depend on a combination of factors, including tariff increases, EDM’s ability to raise
money, the ability of donors to grant or provide loans to EDM, as well as Government
budget support.

                 68.     EDM in its estimates from November 2014 also assumes that it will heavily rely
                 on external funding. Specifically, it assumes the following financing split between donor
                 loans, commercial loans and grant funding for the next five years.

                 69.      The above shows that EDM assumes a considerable increase in the amount of
                 commercial loans going forward. Taking 2015 as an example, EDM assumes that it will
                 be able to raise 7,305 MT million of commercial loans. Although there has been recently
                 an increase in commercial funding (from 1,694 MT million in 2011 to 2,792 MT million in
                 2013), suggesting that EDM has been better able to raise money in commercial or quasi-
                 commercial settings, the current level of commercial funding is considerably lower as
                 compared to EDM’s assumptions going forward. Whether EDM will be able to raise
                 additional funds in commercial and quasi-commercial settings, is likely to depend on
                 tariff and sector/regulatory transparency, among other aspects.

                    Cost Reflective Tariffs, willingness to pay and affordability

                    73.      The experience shows that tariffs have not been adjusted in line with EDM’s
                    costs. To ensure the ongoing financial viability of EDM it is important that in future tariffs
                    are adjusted in line with reasonable costs. Our earlier estimate suggested that full O&M
                    costs may be covered with a tariff increase in 2015 of the order of 35%. If we add to this,
                    the government target of 50% access by 2023, we find that a 45% tariff increase is
                    required in 2015 (see Table 36 in Annex 3). However, such tariff increases are unrealistic
                    to expect in 2015, as it has been demonstrated with the 26.4% tariff adjustment recently
                    approved. In this respect, we consider scenarios with a 25% tariff increase in 2015 as the
                    base case scenario with further increases at inflation and/or further options for filling
                    the ‘gap’.

                    74.       As EDM strives to meet the government’s access targets by connecting more
                    customers, its cash flow position is likely to get worse and its reliance on external sources
                    of financing will likely increase. The following table (Table 19) shows 3 scenarios for
                    EDM’s financial performance, assuming the 50% access target is met by 2023. The
                    comparison of these scenarios demonstrates the need for a tariff increase. Even with a
                    tariff increase of 25% in 2015, EDM would continue to make a loss from 2015 until 2019
                    that amounts to 2,730 MT million (US$ 82 million) on average per annum.70 Only from
                    2020, and provided that new generation projects create a surplus of power in
                    Mozambique and all excess supply can be exported to South Africa/the SAPP, would EDM
                    likely become profitable. This would reduce but not eliminate EDM’s dependence on
                    external sources of funding. 71

  Measured at constant 2015 prices.

  The estimates (Table 19-Table 20) are based on an assumption that the financing gap is funded by commercial
loans at an average rate of 7.4% per annum. We note that if the financing gap was funded by a combination of
grants, donor loans and commercial loans, EDM’s financial position would improve, reducing its dependence on
external sources of funding in subsequent years.

                     significant tariff increase to make EDM profitable in the medium term. However, it would
                     place less financial pressure on EDM, importantly reducing the underlying cost of debt
                     finance.

                     76.      In terms of affordability, households would be, on average, better off if given
                     access to the grid compared to the current situation in which they have to rely on other
                     fuels to cover their power needs. This holds even with the 25% nominal tariff increase in
                     2015.

                     77.      In general, kerosene and other alternatives for lighting are poor substitutes for
                     electricity. This is because not only is the cost of kerosene lighting to consumers
                     considerably higher than the cost of electricity in Mozambique, but also the quality of
                     lighting that can be derived from kerosene is very poor.

                     78.     In 2012, the estimated cost of kerosene lighting was 12.0 USc/kWh72 (about 13%
                     higher than the average residential electricity tariff at that time) which can be considered
                     the opportunity cost of electricity. 73 Alternatively, the Feasibility Study for the
                     Transmission Backbone74 estimated that the willingness to pay for electricity lighting is

   Moreover, as the quality of electricity lighting is considerably higher to the kerosene one (6-18 lumen per watt as
compared to 0.1 lumen obtained from kerosene).

14.0 USc/KWh (about 17% higher than what households were paying for kerosene at that
time and about 32% higher than what they were paying for electricity).

79.     The figure below uses a comparison between projected cost of kerosene lighting,
and the electricity tariffs to demonstrate the relative benefits of electrification. The
analysis shows that as at 2014, residential consumers would have paid on average about
1.5 MT/MWh more for electricity than what they were paying for kerosene. Even if there
was a 25% tariff increase in 2015 and in 2017 and tariffs increased at inflation in 2016
and in all years post 2017, the opportunity cost would still have exceeded the electricity
tariff.

Note: The cost of kerosene lighting is assumed to increase in line with Mozambican inflation (no real price
change), tariffs for electricity are assumed to increase in line with inflation in years when there is no tariff
increase

80.      As expected, poorer households would be the most affected by a general tariff
increase, as the proportion of the electricity bill over total household expenditure is
higher for lower income households than for higher income ones. This is why the tariff
adjustment proposed by EDM excludes customers under the social tariff. For the rest of
the residential consumers, on average, a 25% tariff adjustment would increase the share
of the electricity bill as a percentage over total household expenditure from current 2.2%
to 2.5%, thus, marginally affecting the affordability of the electricity tariffs (see Table 21).

                  81.      As well as meeting growing demand, delivering access and meeting security of
                  supply needs, the investment strategy for both the grid and generation also needs to
                  consider an integrated approach with exports to help the financial sustainability of the
                  sector. This is because with the region being in deficit, there is an opportunity to sell
                  power to the region at profitable prices, and to cross-subsidize activities in Mozambique
                  with these profits. This would enable additional investment or substitution for payments
                  from consumers or the budget. The generation expansion scenario provides for
                  generation in excess of that required to meet Mozambican demand. With the current

                  per new household customer finds that income from exports during the period 2015-30
                  has a financial value of roughly 5 times the financial value of a new household customer
                  when considered in present value terms in 2015. The trade-off between meeting the
                  needs of Mozambican consumption (and the large investment program this entails) and
                  the benefits of export revenues indicates the need for appropriate inter-temporal policy
                  choices leading to an investment strategy consistent with national objectives and
                  financial sustainability for EDM. This may mean trading off the timing as to when the
                  access target is met and the timing of distribution grid investments required to meet the
                  target against the higher revenues from using a greater proportion of generation output
                  for exports and the investments in generation, regional transmission, and the gas
                  facilities required to deliver those exports.

                  EDM. These are presented in Figure 14 and in more detail in Annex 3. These show the
                  importance of the timing and size of tariff increases and exports of power – and what
                  this means for financial sustainability and achievability of access rates. Scenario 1 below
                  shows that the 25% nominal tariff increase in 2015, followed by inflation level increases
                  is the minimum – and in fact, that EDM’s financial condition does not actually
                  significantly improve until the end of the decade when significant exports are expected.
                  In the longer term and if the export revenues materialize, there is a potential to partly
                  subsidize domestic tariffs from exports/to use this revenue to fund the underlying CAPEX
                  needs.

                        Mozambican gas can be competitive with coal in a number of circumstances. As argued earlier,
                        Mozambique has leeway to sell its gas at less than the LNG netback given the enormity of its resource
                        base. Furthermore, the viability of gas-fired power projects would not have to rely on power exports
                        because the economic scale of such project is just 300 MW, an amount that could realistically be absorbed
                        by the domestic market alone.

                        Mozambican gas is competitive against coal in baseload power generation [in South Africa] at a delivered
                        gas cost of $7 per MMBTU. Netting out pipeline transportation costs, this translates into a wellhead price

                    87.     The Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy needs stronger capacity to drive
                    system planning and competitive processes to improve the efficiency of the sector while
                    also helping to drive it towards the government’s access targets. Mozambique has
                    moved from a situation in which there were just a few available generation options to a
                    situation in which there are many options to choose from. This requires that the
                    government develop a least cost plan for meeting demand and export needs, while
                    meeting diversification and security of supply requirements.

                    88.     The Ministry needs to be able to give direction on large projects – and
                    international investors look for such direction, as has been the case with Mphanda
                    Nkuwa and STE. For these projects, highly capable developers and investors including
                    EdF of France, Electrobras of Brazil and Eskom of South Africa had been engaged with
                    EDM to develop agreements for joint development of the projects during 2012-13.
                    However, while initial agreements had been signed and there were high hopes of
                    progress, in April 2013, the Government signed a memorandum of understanding with
                    China Development Bank (CDB) and State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) that reduced
                    the expected shareholdings of the existing investors significantly in order to make room
                    in both projects for significant shareholding for SGCC. Not only did this action badly dent
                    the confidence of these pre-existing potential investors in Mozambique, but progress on
                    agreements came to a halt and has not progressed any further in the last two years. It
                    appears that SGCC and Eskom are looking to the government to address current
                    bottlenecks. Lessons from this experience - as well as from the more successful
                    completion of the Sasol driven Pande/Temane gas processing facility and transmission
                    pipeline program (which had a cost of over US$1 billion and has met all gas production
                    targets), need to be understood and acted upon77.

                     89.     Although EDM is signing Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with Independent
                     Power Producers (IPPs), it is not currently required to follow a pre-agreed least cost
                     generation expansion plan. Such a plan should, in fact, be based on a broader decision
                     framework whereby the development of primary energy sources is analyzed against
                     characteristics such as affordability (least cost approach), security of supply/reliability,
                     environmental footprint and energy access. It would also take account of national and
                     regional demand. This would contribute to improving sequencing of investments to best
                     meet overall sector objectives. EDM should also adopt an approach of competitive
                     tendering for relatively standard technologies such as thermal generation, leaving the
                     option of negotiation for less standardized and higher risk projects (large hydropower
                     being an obvious example). In such cases, underlying contracts such as for the
                     engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) would be expected to be competitively
                     procured.

                     90.     To attract the required level of private sector financing, investors would need
                     confidence that their investments have reasonable protection from non-market risks.
                     This means having in place a clear legal and regulatory framework that provides for
                     reasonable investor protection and guarantees or other mechanisms to protect against
                     the framework being changed unreasonably78, and providing credit support for EDM as
                     borrower or contract counterpart. A particular current concern is the ambiguity created
                     between the Electricity Law and PPA Law as to whether generation projects must be
                     selected via a competitive tender process or whether the direct award of a PPA is
                     allowed.

                     91.     CNELEC 79 has a largely advisory role to the Government and the Ministry of
                     Energy on tariff proposals and setting, as well as in the concession award process.
                     CNELEC’s mandate should be clarified and its regulatory role strengthened, particularly
                     in the area of tariff setting as a means to make EDM’s financial sustainability and the
                     need for tariff adjustment more transparent.

                     92.     EDM’s human resources require80 training and further recruitment is needed. As
                     noted above, EDM’s employee numbers have fallen while at the same time the system
                     has expanded substantially. A study by Statnett concludes that EDM management needs
                     training in leadership and motivational management, that a human resources
                     development plan is needed and that few staff are sufficiently qualified to maintain
                     EDM’s grid assets.81




78
   In the short-term, while the confidence is built up, a program of guarantees/political risk insurance involving the
government/third parties may be required to provide the requisite comfort to the private sector and commercial
lenders.

   CNELEC is the national energy council which is the power sector regulator of Mozambique. Its role is largely to
advise the Ministry of Energy and Council of Ministers including on new concessions and tariffs.

                                                                                                                   47
                    93.     An area of need that has been identified is building sufficient institutional
                    capacity both in terms of financing rural electrification and in terms of executing stand-
                    alone off-grid low-cost projects. A recent European Union evaluation82 finds that FUNAE,
                    having been established primarily as a financial institution, is not adequately equipped
                    to implement projects – the role it finds itself in for some off-grid projects. It also finds
                    that coordination between EDM and FUNAE on projects and intended grid extension
                    could be strengthened. It finds that FUNAE tends to be excluded from energy planning,
                    which has sometimes led to unnecessary projects or investments that are not in line with
                    the national planning of grid extension.

                    94.      As mentioned above, FUNAE has been playing an operator role in the off-grid
                    area and there is a need to better define FUNAE’s role to ensure that it has the necessary
                    capacity projects83,84 it is expected to deliver and, especially, to ensure sustainability of
                    the projects going forward. Maintenance of these projects is challenging, and there are
                    currently no functioning cost recovery mechanisms. Further, exploring ways of attracting
                    private sector for off-grid investments would be important. Driven partly by falling prices
                    and new business models, other countries in the region have been successful in
                    attracting private sector investors into the off-grid area, for example through pay-as-you-
                    go Solar Home Systems (SHS) models. FUNAE has recently completed an exercise to look
                    at how to further involve the private sector in its operations. Discussions with FUNAE
                    have suggested, for example, that a constraint on development of private sector
                    investment in off-grid is the insistence of consumers to pay no more than grid tariff
                    levels. Further studying success stories and best practices elsewhere may help inform
                    government policy especially in relation to attracting investors and replicating these
                    positive experiences in Mozambique. A process of developing a National Electrification
                    Plan is expected to include examination of models that have worked in other countries
                    – and to address the various current issues.

                    95.      There is a need for clear guidance for how the private sector can avail of feed-in
                    tariffs for renewables – especially when this supports off-grid and mini-grid access to
                    electricity as part of the National Electrification Plan.


                    Financing Plan for access and connections

                    96.      The access target is an explicit target for access to the national grid. The
                    government could broaden the target to allow it to be met by main grid and
                    off-grid/mini-grid connections. Grid and off-grid strategy should be coordinated in order
                    to increase the electricity access rates and to maximise access at minimum cost.

                    97.      Access investments need to be costed and funded. Costing includes two
                    activities. Costs of power system expansion and costs of connecting new customers.

                      98.     As discussed above, EDM needs to carry out significant power system expansion
                      in view of increasing the access rates.

                      99.       Regarding connection costs, customers currently are required to make a
                      significant up front contribution towards their connection costs (about US$ 128 in the
                      case of ordinary household customers and US$ 31 in the case of customers on the social
                      tariff85). These costs were about 20% of annual income per capita as at 2014. Therefore,
                      connection costs represent a very significant burden for Mozambican households. 86
                      These high costs of new connections borne by the final consumers cause significant
                      delays in the uptake in an area even once the system has been extended to that
                      particular area. To increase the rate at which Mozambican households are connected to
                      the grid, the up-front connection cost should be supported through a financing program
                      or subsidy of some form.

                      100. In order to address funding of both power system expansion and connection
                      costs, the Government should develop a National Electrification Plan that discusses the
                      technology (lower cost engineering solutions, underlying cost and grid vs off-grid
                      strategy), financing mechanisms and implementation modalities for reaching access
                      targets. Clarification of role of Mozambican institutions’ funding and the role for private
                      sector would be critical.

                      101. The government needs to explicitly consider how increasing access will be
                      funded (‘Financing Plan for Connections’). If we assume that tariff adjustments and
                      income from exports will be needed to maintain EDM’s viability whilst paying for
                      sufficient operations and maintenance, then access is likely to need to be funded through
                      a combination of budget support and donor support, before additional revenues from
                      exports picks up.

                   to increase control of non-technical losses.

                   106. Regional trade that takes an integrated approach to both supply within
                   Mozambique and exports is an important route to improving the sector’s financial
                   sustainability. Simulations suggest that the need to fund the sector from external sources
                   will diminish from around 2019 once significant exports are able to develop. To benefit
                   from exports, EDM must purchase power from the project at a sufficiently competitive
                   price to be able to make a reasonable margin through the sale. As EDM has limited funds
                   – purchasing significant equity in projects is not a realistic option. Regional trade requires
                   that the government prioritize the development of key national infrastructure that will
                   enable regional trade.

 private sector.        Government of Mozambique to work with its key development partners to enable the
                        structuring of third party risk mitigation and credit enhancement instruments (generally
                        available from multi-laterals with the backing of the host country). Such instruments
                        normally reduce risk for commercial lenders, thereby reducing the cost of debt and
                        increasing the chances of reaching financial closure and they also enable the host
                        government to minimize the size of contingent liabilities it needs to take on in providing
                        guarantees for the project (due to the involvement of the multi-lateral).

                        109. HCB has a relatively strong balance sheet due to the regular income from
                        operation of Cahora Bassa and low levels of debt. It can be leveraged more to support
                        financing in the sector. This could take various structures but basically involves using the
                        HCB balance sheet to guarantee repayments on loans.

                        110. Increasing access in line with Government targets will require major
                        investments. The Government needs to consider the trade-offs between the ambition
                        of the access targets imposed upon EdM and the sector’s broader financial viability for
                        carrying out operations, maintenance and investment. EdM is not currently able to even
                        fund these core activities despite significant budget support. Relaxation of the access
                        target so that the 50% target is achieved by 2030 instead of 2023 gives EdM more
                        liquidity in the first years.

                        111. There are opportunities to reduce current estimates for costs of increasing grid
                        access by applying lower cost engineering solutions relating to distribution that have
                        been applied successfully in other countries87. With such approaches, there are a number
                        of countries that have rapidly increased access, and this is something that Mozambique
                        can strive towards.

                        112. The access target is an explicit target for access to the main EdM grid. However,
                        the government could broaden the target to allow it to be met by main grid and off-
                        grid/mini-grid connections. Grid and off-grid strategy in order to increase the electricity
                        access rates should be coordinated to maximize access at minimum cost.

     Cost reductions are of the order of US$700 million in the first 3 years alone.

                                                                                                               51
                  113. Currently, customers must make a significant up front contribution towards their
                  connection costs (about US$128 in the case of ordinary household customers and US$
                  31 in the case of customers on the social tariff). This delays the uptake of connections in
                  an area even once the system has been extended to that area. To increase the rate of
                  connections, the up-front connection cost should be reduced or financially supported in
                  some form.

                  114. The above revenue increases and cost reductions will help to ensure appropriate
                  quality of operations and maintenance for the existing grid. Increasing the level of
                  electricity access in line with national objectives will need explicit extra financial support
                  and the government needs to explicitly consider how increasing access will be funded. It
                  is likely that a combination of higher budget support and donor support will be required
                  in the years to come. Such approaches for funding the electrification plan would free up
                  EdM finances for regular operations, maintenance and – potentially financially viable
                  investments.

                  115. As well as using budget and donor support, experience from other countries
                  (Ghana or Vietnam) shows that explicit levies on consumers for funding a transparent
                  and auditable electrification program are socially more acceptable than general tariff
                  increases. This is something that the government could consider testing out.

                  116. The Government should develop a National Electrification Plan which would

                  meeting diversification and security of supply requirements.

VI.         Annexes

Annex 1: Financial appraisal of EDM

The following financial analysis was undertaken on the basis of EdM´s audited financial accounts for the
period 2011 to 2013, and on the basis of EdM´s projected performance for the period 2014 to 2030. Here
we describe the base case scenario which is used for the forecast of EdM’s performance88:

•      EdM´s forecast for domestic demand;
•      The 50% access target is reached by 2023;
•      A nominal tariff increase of 25% in 2015 (in terms of current MT), with a tariff increase in line with
       Mozambique inflation thereafter;
•      Connection costs between $580 per connection for ordinary requests to over $2,100 per connection
       (based on estimates from World Bank staff experts);
•      We assume that EdM will be funding its CAPEX (or part of its CAPEX) whenever they generate
       sufficient cashflow (i.e. positive bank balances after repaying any previous bank overdrafts);
•      An annual budgetary support in the order of 0.05% of Mozambican GDP;
•      All ongoing and pipeline loans and grants listed in Annex 6 to this note are considered;
•      The remaining financing gap is funded through a combination of grants, donor loans and commercial
       loans;
•      All surplus power is exported (at 14 USc/kWh in 2015).
All forecast figures are in 2015 constant MT prices and thus allow for direct comparison between years,
unless stated otherwise.

EdM is forecast to generate positive cash flows from operating activities in most of the years of the
forecast. However, this is not sufficient to fund EdM’s capital expenditures or even the cost of financing,
resulting in net loss for the period between 2015 and 2019. Only after that EdM is forecast to generate
sufficient cash flows that would first need to be used to repay its short-term liabilities (including bank
overdraft) and only from 2027 cash flow surplus could be used to co-finance the underlying CAPEX.
Funding capital expenditure at least partly from cash flow from operations will decrease EdM’s
dependence on external sources of funding, reducing the underlying cost of debt.

Income statement

EdM’s revenues increased on average by 10% per annum between 2011 and 2013. Nevertheless, these
increases were insufficient to offset the increased power purchase cost and other operating expenses as
these increased at a higher rate (14% and 11% per annum, respectively). Consistent with increasing access
rates, the asset base has increased, meaning a higher depreciation and finance costs. This resulted in a
loss of 76 MT (2015) million in 2013 as shown in Table 23 below.

The forecast of EdM’s financial performance suggests that its position deteriorates in the period from
2014 to 2019. Even if there were a 25% nominal tariff increase in 2015 and tariffs increased at inflation
thereafter, EdM would make a loss in the order of 2,730 MT (2015) million on average per year from 2015
to 2019. Only from 2020, and provided that sufficient generation capacity is developed to create a surplus
and all excess supply is exported, EdM would start making profits. These would be in the order of 10,695
MT (2015) million on average per annum from 2020 to 2030.

Finance costs are projected to increase considerably, subject to assumptions about the source of external
funding (these costs would considerably decrease if the remaining financing gap was funded by a
combination of grants, donor loans and commercial loans rather than commercial loans alone). About 8%
of EdM’s operating income will be used to cover the costs of debt finance between 2015 and 2020.

Statement of financial position

EdM’s assets grew by 24% between 2011 and 2013 as measured by net book value in current MT. This
increase in asset base reflects increased capital expenditures, mostly as a result of new connections and
other projects. These capital expenditures were funded predominantly by grants from donors and the
government.

Representation of EdM’s sources of funding in its balance sheet is shown in the graph below. Budget
support (government grants) has increased considerably as a source of funding over the years as has
donor grants. Retained earnings also increased due to EdM profits in 2011 and 2012.

Looking ahead over the period from 2014 to 2030, EDM’s balance sheet is projected to continue to expand
as it invests in the network to meet access targets. Investments in large generation projects and large
transmission projects are assumed to be project financed and therefore are not on EDM’s balance sheet.

Note: Trade payables (current) are included in other current liabilities; provisions, deferred tax and trade payables (non-current) are included in
other non-current liabilities; due to accumulation of losses up to 2019, EDM’s retained earnings are negative in 2020, showing a need for capital
injection or increase in revenues.

Cash and liquidity position

In recent years, EDM’s cash flow from operating activities has been positive. However, this cash is
insufficient to fund EDM’s investment activities, resulting in a negative free operating cash flow. EDM
therefore has relied on external funding to fund capital expenditures to meet the government’s access
targets and enhance the system.

The projection of EDM’s financial position shows that even though EDM’s cash flow from operating
activities is positive under most of the years of the forecast, in the next five years EDM will be unlikely to
have sufficient revenues to cover all of its short term obligations (including debt repayment obligations),
resulting in the need to take bank overdrafts in 2017 and 2018. This short term and expensive way to
cover its short term obligations further increases the cost of financing. Only from 2019 is EDM forecast to
generate positive cash flow (i.e. operating cash flow minus cash flow from financing activities), suggesting
that there is a potential to decrease the dependence on external funding in the future. This is largely due
to the commissioning of new generation projects and the revenue from the export of surplus power.

Assuming a considerable part of EDM’s capital expenditures is debt financed results in a considerable
increase to EDM’s annual debt service costs. In 2013, EDM’s annual debt service costs (comprising interest
and debt repayments) were 682 MT (2015) million, and this is projected to more than quadruple by 2015
to 2,935 MT (2015) million. This is projected to further increase, to 10,206 MT (2015) million in 2020. As
EDM’s financial position is forecast to considerably improve in the long term, there is a potential to finance
a considerable proportion of the CAPEX from EDM’s own resources, decreasing the debt financing needs.
That is, under this scenario EDM could start financing (approximately 70% of CAPEX) in the period 2022
to 2025 and almost all of the CAPEX required to meet the access target in the period after that, provided
export revenues materialise. This results in a decrease in debt repayment from 2023 onwards.

Financial ratios

Currently, EDM has a significant amount of debt relative to its earnings. This is evidenced by the debt /
EBITDA, CFO / debt and FOCF / debt ratios. A current ratio greater than 1 indicates that EDM would be
able to meet its current liabilities at short notice. However, this ratio has deteriorated over time and in
2013 was very close to 1. In addition, the debt service coverage ratio is below 1, indicating that EDM’s
operating income is insufficient to meet its debt repayments and interest.

The projection shows that EDM’s current ratio turns below 1 in 2014 and increases above 1 only in 2026.
This suggests that EDM would have difficulties in meeting its short term liabilities if these became due at
short notice.

Annex 2: Cost of investment in power systems to deliver access

EDM has a power sector master plan that puts a significant emphasis on transmission and distribution
investment to meet the grid access targets for EDM and to allow output from new generation projects to
be delivered to Mozambican and export customers. The plan suggests the following capital cost program.
This program allows for the connection of 100,000 new customers per year on average, about 60% of the
number of new connections per year required to meet the Government’s draft access target of 50% by
2023. At 100,000 per year, by 2023, 38% of the population would be connected and 43% by 2030.

As compared to the sector Master Plan that targets connecting 100,000 households per annum or even
EDM’s current performance, the government access target of 50% by 2023 is quite ambitious. Achieving
the 50% access target by 2023 would require connecting an additional 75,300 connections per year as
compared to Master Plan assumptions, or alternatively an additional 57,200 new connections as
compared to EDM’s current performance. The information on the average number of connections per
annum needed under different access scenarios are summarized below.

As 2023 is an aspirational target, we run a scenario for achieving the access target in 2030, which would
require about 130,000 new connections per year. This suggests the following capital cost program (Table

We also run a scenario whereby EDM connects 80,000 households per year, as is assumed by its financial

Base Case: Achieving the 50% grid access target by 2023 would require a considerable increase in the rate
at which EDM is currently connecting new customers. EDM has recently been connecting about 120,000
households per annum (between 2011 and 2014) and would need to connect an additional 57,000
households per annum above its current rate of connections if it was to meet the 50% access target by

Annex 3: Projections of inter-                                   revenue, access rates and exports

The present scenario analysis contained in this section enables us to assess the impact of various tariff
increases on EDM’s operating cash flows, as well as its profitability and therefore its dependence on
external funding. Considering various scenarios for the level of access targets enables us to see the
implications on EDM if they were to meet the stipulated access target.

Finally, EDM’s profitability and therefore its own ability to invest in enhancing the transmission and
distribution network is dependent not only on the domestic tariff increases but also on the level of
budgetary and donor support it will get in the years to come. The level of budgetary and donor support
not only affects EDM’s ability to meet the stipulated access targets but also decreases the amount of
capital EDM will need to raise on commercial and quasi commercial terms. This in turn decreases the
associated cost of debt and the debt burden in general.

While we take the view that EDM’s ability to raise additional capital in commercial and quasi commercial
settings should be improved, there is likely to be the need for government support and donor support in
the years to come before EDM can generate additional revenues from exports and before it becomes
financially sustainable.

Finally, it is important to note that in recent years EdM was better able to raise funds in commercial
settings, the cost of debt on the local market is relatively high for EdM (approximately 14% per annum).

Business as usual scenario

The ‘Business as usual scenario’ considers what would be the impact on EDM if there was no tariff increase
whatsoever and EDM was to meet the 50% access target by 2023. The scenario simulation shows that
under this scenario, EDM’s financial situation is not sustainable both in the short and long term.
Specifically, EDM’s revenues would not be sufficient even to cover the more limited operating
expenditures it is currently undertaking (resulting in negative cash flows from operating activities). Hence,
EDM would be completely dependent on external sources of funding not only to finance its capital
expenditures but also there would be a need for external support to meet EDM’s short term liabilities. It
is worth noting that even in the years when EDM is forecast to make a profit (2021 – 2022 and 2030),
these funds would need to be fully used to cover the associated cost of financing and debt repayment.
This can be seen from the tables and chart below.

in the period between 2020 and 2026. Nevertheless, these revenues would not be sufficient to cover the

                  EDM is profitable
Scenario at which ED

The ‘Scenario at which EDM is profitable’ considers what would need to be the tariff increase to make
EDM profitable in the short term, holding other characteristics constant.

The simulation analysis shows that tariffs would need to increase by at least 45% in 2015 to make EDM
profitable in the short term if EDM was to meet the 50% access target by 2023. Even though in the short
term the financing gap would remain the same as in the previous scenario, from 2023 EDM would be in a
good position to finance a considerable part of its capital expenditures. Specifically, EDM could finance
approximately 80% of its capital expenditures from its own funds, considerably decreasing its dependence
on external sources of funding.

More realistic tariff increase

Even though a 45% tariff increase in 2015 would mean that EDM would be in a position to generate
sufficient cash flows to make a profit in the short term, we consider that a 25% tariff increase in 2015
combined with budgetary and donor support in the early years of our forecast is sufficient to make EDM
profitable in the medium and long term as shown in Table 42 below.

Specifically, in the first years of the forecast cash flow generated from operations would be sufficient to
cover EDM’s operations. EDM would be also in a position to partly fund its capital expenditures (on
average EDM could finance approximately 27% of its CAPEX between 2023 and 2030). It is important to
note that there is a delay between EDM’s ability to fund part of its CAPEX and EDM’s profitability. This is
because EDM’s financial position under a 25% tariff increase does not actually improve to the point of
financial viability until the end of the decade, resulting in sourcing short term debt (taking bank overdrafts)
and bearing the associated costs.

More realistic tariff increase, including donor funding (base case)

This scenario considers a 25% tariff increase in 2015, followed by tariff increases at inflation in the years
after, as in the previous scenario. The difference between this scenario and the previous one is in the way
the resulting financing gap is funded. While the previous scenario considered that the financing gap is
funded by a combination of commercial and quasi commercial loans at an average rate of 7.4% per annum,
here we consider what would be the impact on EDM’s financial position if the resulting gap was funded
by a combination of grants, donor loans and commercial loans. Specifically we assume the following split
between grants, donor loans and commercial loans:

                                                         Table 43: Funding of the financing gap

                                                                            Grant aid Donor loans Commercial loans
                           Cash flow from operating activities               22%        28%          50%



Under this scenario, grant aid and donor loans have a positive impact not only on EDM’s net profit but
also substantially decreases the associated cost of debt. In this respect EDM’s revenues can be used to
finance part of its capital expenditures and not only to cover the associated cost of financing.

Under this scenario EDM’s dependence on external funding would decrease from 2022 onwards when
EDM would be able to finance approximately 70% of its CAPEX itself. More specifically, between 2022 and
2030, EDM could finance almost 90% of its CAPEX from revenues generated by operations. This suggests
that in the long term a combination of tariff increases and donor and government support enhances
EDM’s finances not only to the extent of EDM being financially sustainable but also to the point to be able
to fund a considerable proportion of the underlying capital expenditures to meet the stipulated access
target.

Lower access rate, EDM being profitable
This scenario considers the impact on EDM’s profitability and finances if EDM was connecting 80,000 new
customers per annum, which is about half of the connections required to meet the 50% access target by
2023.

The simulation analysis shows that under this scenario it would be enough to increase the tariff of the
order of 35 to 40% in 2015 to make EDM profitable even in the short term. The exact range of tariff
increase to make EDM profitable depends on how the remaining financing gap is funded. That is:

                                                                                                                                                         69
     •     If the financing gap is funded by a combination of grant aid, donor loans and commercial loans, it
           is enough to increase the tariff by 35% to make EDM profitable from 2015;
     •     If the financing gap is funded by a mix of commercial and quasi-commercial loans at an average
           rate of 7.4% per annum, the tariff would need to increase slightly more (by 40%) to make EDM
           financially viable in the short term.

Table 46 and Table 47 below show the situation when the financing gap is funded by a combination of
commercial and quasi-commercial loans.

Under this scenario the total CAPEX amount to US $4,759 million (2012 constant prices) which is about
43% lower than the capital expenditures required to meet the 50% access target by 2023, resulting in
considerably lower financing gap.

Annex 4: Projections of inter-
of export tariffs

EdM estimates that their export tariff amounted to 12.5 USc/kWh in 2014 and should equal 14 USc/KWh
in 2015. We are of the view that as it stands due to a shortage of power in South Africa this is the tariff
EdM could achieve. However, in the long term South Africa may be in the position to develop lower cost
generation options, decreasing its reliance on exports from Mozambique. In this respect we consider what
would be the impact on EdM and its profitability if the export tariff was 10 USc/kWh in 2015. Thereafter
we assume that the export tariff will increase in line with inflation in Mozambique. Other parameters are
held the same as in the base case scenario:

    •     50% access target by 2023
    •     budget support 0.05% of annual GDP, and
    •     financing gap funded through a combination of grants, loans from donors and commercial loans.
