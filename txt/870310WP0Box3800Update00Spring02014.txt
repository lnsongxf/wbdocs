                                           Summary
        The enabling environment for development has improved but opportunities need to
be effectively leveraged through focused policy action. The successful election of a new
parliament and subsequent formation of a popularly mandated government provide a more
conducive environment for private sector activity and economic policy. The uncertainties brought
about by Nepal’s prolonged political transition and electoral period have acted as a break on private
sector investment and diverted attention of the bureaucracy away from difficult and important
reforms. Going forward, it will be important for the government to signal, from the start, that
increased political stability will be put to profit to tackle the country’s formidable challenges. This
will involve a balancing act to ensure that the arduous process of constitutional drafting can be
carried-out in tandem with regular and improved government operations.
        Nepal has significant resources in the form of remittances from abroad, but the
economy cannot use these resources in a productive manner to enhance the overall welfare
of all citizens. The budget process does not work -funds cannot be used to build decent
infrastructure that would bring in the private sector- and inefficiencies in the financial sector
hinder the optimal allocation of resources to private agents. In view of these challenges, the GoN
should set a new course for policy and tackle emerging risks. The appointment of a new Finance
Minister with deep experience and reformist credentials is a positive sign and initial declarations of
Minister Mahat committing to “take forward the second round of reforms […] in partnership with
the private sector” are also encouraging.
   Specific priorities include:
   1. Developing a growth promotion vision / agenda: because the numerous challenges facing
      Nepal make achieving clarity over policy goals and priorities particularly difficult. The
      Nepalese authorities have formulated the aspiration of graduating to “developing country”
      status by 2022, but have not articulated the vision for development that would underpin it
      and identify those policies and reforms that are the most urgent. In the absence of such
      clear prioritization, the process of development planning is likely to remain un-strategic.
   2. Resolving Nepal’s ‘fiscal paradox’: Nepal, today, is in a paradoxical situation. It is the only
      country in South Asia to record a budget surplus (helped by buoyant revenue growth), its
      level of indebtedness is modest, it is flush with liquidity (thanks to large remittance inflows)
      and yet it struggles to maintain investment at already low levels. Fiscal discipline is a means
      to an end, but in Nepal it appears to be pursued as an end in itself, with the government
      unable to plan and implement the budget. This bottleneck needs to be addressed urgently.
   3. Boosting investment: Faster and sustained economic growth will not be possible without
      higher levels of investment but Nepal’s model of growth appears premised on remittance
      financed consumption. The public sector has a key role to play to unlock investment by: (i)
      providing a friendlier environment for the private sector –domestic and foreign- to find it
      attractive to bid for projects in Nepal, and (ii) developing the essential public infrastructure
      needed for firms to thrive and private funds to be crowded-in. The fate of Nepal’s “National
      Pride Projects” demonstrates that such synergies are not currently taking place.

   4. Tackling enduring financial sector risks and managing excess liquidity: Uncertainty over the
      true health of the financial sector remains the single most important macroeconomic risk
      for Nepal. First, although unlikely, a financial sector crisis would have devastating effects on
      public finances and economic growth. Second, the ability of the financial sector to provide
      adequate credit to deserving borrowers is currently hampered by inter alia (i) distortionary
      policies (ii) low levels of effective access to finance, (iii) poor risk management practices by
      monetary authorities and banks amplified by deficient information, and (iv) limited
      recourses of banks vis-à-vis delinquent borrowers. As a result the financial sector is
      operating at sub-optimum and the current excess liquidity in the system is largely a
      reflection of this state of affairs.
    After a difficult year in FY13, the economy is poised to recover, albeit modestly. In FY13,
Nepal achieved only modest growth of 3.6%. This was due largely to poor performance of the
agricultural sector as well as very modest levels of industrial activity. The only source of relief came
from the services sector. The main difference in FY14 is expected to come from the agricultural
sector with expanded production on the back of a good harvest, while strong remittance inflows
will continue to drive services sector expansion.
Nepal’s internal and external balances are sound but not for the right reasons.
      The combination of low expenditure and robust revenue growth accounted for a
       large budget surplus and declining debt. With a significant increase in foreign grants the
       overall government surplus ballooned to NRs 56.0 billon. Reflecting this comfortable fiscal
       position the GoN did not issue any fresh T-Bills in FY14 and domestic debt fell to NRs
       217.61 billion. While much of the blame for low rates of budget execution and important
       bunching had been blamed, hitherto, on delayed budget approval, this was not the case in
       FY14 when a full budget was unveiled on day one of the fiscal year. In other words Nepal is
       yet to come to grips with deep structural inefficiencies in the process of budget planning,
       formulation and execution.
      Nepal’s external position is comfortable thanks to large remittance inflows. On the
       external side Nepal has benefited from the depreciation of the rupee but also –and much
       more significantly- from a sharp further increase in inward remittances which are expected
       to amount to over 30% of GDP in FY14.
    Monetary policy has sought to achieve a delicate equilibrium between controlling
inflation and supporting economic activity but the optimal balance may evolve and call for
corrections. Significant inflation, close to double digits, appears to have become a feature of the
Nepali economy. While expanded agricultural output may contribute to dampen inflationary
pressure, the significant growth in the money supply may eventually generate inflationary
expectations and second round effects as well as translate into lower reserves. From that view
point, the evolution of the quantity and quality of credit to the private sector will be important to
monitor.
   For FY14, the outlook is cautiously optimistic. The previous assessment estimated that
growth would reach 4-4.5% in FY14 essentially driven by increased agricultural output and
improved execution of the budget. While the pace of capital expenditure may be below initial

                                                   5
expectations, inward remittance inflows have been significantly above projected levels and should
provide an additional boost to the services sector. On balance therefore, growth is projected to
reach 4.5%, especially if capital spending picks up in the second half of the year.
    As remittances have become a defining feature of the Nepali economy the country must
learn to manage excess liquidity. The significant buildup of liquidity in the financial sector
reflects both strong push factors (remittance inflows translating into a build-up of net foreign
assets) and weak pull factors (slowing credit growth and loose monetary policy). In the short term,
the NRB will need to strike a delicate balance between encouraging sound credit growth –so as to
not compromise economic activity objectives- and containing inflation. At present this balance is
particularly difficult to achieve because of uncertainties over the true health of the banking sector,
weak risk management systems and market failures. In the short run, the NRB may also need to
expand its toolset to deal with excess liquidity. In the medium run, resolving structural bottlenecks
to efficient credit market functioning is a precondition for monetary policy to operate more
smoothly and efficiently and for ample available resources to be allocated to grow Nepal’s
productive potential.

                      Review of Recent Economic Developments

Economic growth is expected to recover in FY14, albeit from a low point. Agricultural potential has
expanded in the first half of the year on the back of a good monsoon and the sharp increase in
remittance inflows should support services sector growth as well. The structural bias toward
consumption led growth – as opposed to investment- is expected to continue with relatively low levels
of both public and private investment.
Nepal, for the second year in a row, should achieve a twin surplus reflecting healthy developments
(particularly domestic revenue mobilization) but also deep absorptive bottlenecks, which are really
missed opportunities for growth. First, the slow pace of budget execution has translated into a sizeable
budget surplus that is not leveraged to build the country’s infrastructure. Second the sharp increase in
remittances has more than made up for Nepal’s chronic trade gap but it has also resulted in a buildup
of liquidity in the financial system that may be in excess of the private sector’s ability to translate it
into sound credit.
      Economic growth has slowed in FY13 and remains contingent mostly on exogenous factors.

        Economic growth slowed in FY13 mainly on account of low agricultural production
and depressed investment. The economy grew by 3.6% in FY13 compared to 4.9% in FY12.
Owing to a weak monsoon and inadequate supply of agricultural inputs during the peak plantation
season, agricultural sector performance was disappointing with growth of 1.3% in FY13 compared
to 5% growth in FY12. Industrial sector growth slowed from 3% in FY12 to 1.6% in FY13 as private
sector players held back investments due to political uncertainty. The only source of relief came
from significant growth of the services sector (6% in FY13 compared to 4.5% in FY12) mostly aided
by continuous growth in remittance transfers (15% growth from FY12 in dollar terms).
        Agriculture output is expected to recover in FY14 and services growth to continue at
a healthy rate. With a good monsoon, the production of Nepal’s two staple crops has expanded
significantly. Paddy production grew by 12% whereas maize production grew by 10% as compared
to the level at the same time in FY13. Sharp and higher than anticipated inward remittance flows
are expected to drive services sector growth, particularly wholesale and retail trade and social
services. By contrast industrial activity is likely to remain lackluster owing to structural constraints
–including irregular access to energy and difficult labor relations- and to modest levels of public
capital spending.
        Economic activity has remained driven by consumption and weak investment
continues to hold back the economy’s growth potential. While record levels of remittance
inflows and a significant increase in recurrent spending commitments of the government are
expected to translate into consumption growth, both public and private investment have been
depressed in the first half of FY14. First, the timely adoption of the budget has not translated into
faster utilization of the capital budget and key priority projects remain at a standstill. Second,
despite ample liquidity in the system and an accommodative monetary stance, private sector credit
growth has slowed as a result of both weak demand (despite improving political stability) and
reluctance of banks to lend. Finally, FDI inflows have been low even compared to FY13.

                                                    7
        There is a significant discrepancy between investment commitments and realizations
indicating the potential for improvements in the second half of the year. Total domestic
capital investment commitments increased significantly in the first half of the year (by almost
400% relative to the same time in FY13) to reach NRs 183 billion. Likewise FDI commitments also
increased relative to the same time in FY13 by 50%. In both cases the commitments have been
overwhelmingly in the energy sector (95% and 70% of domestic and international commitments
respectively). However, these additional commitments have not been reflected to date in either
credit growth or FDI inflows. Total credit of Bank and Financial Institutions (BFIs) to the private
sector grew by 9% in the first half of the year, compared with 12.3% at the same time in FY13.
Likewise FDI inflows fell by 65.6% relative to the first half of FY13 amounting to a paltry NRs 1.3
billon (or just above USD 13 million).
                 The Government of Nepal has not managed to tackle structural absorption problems and has
                                          accumulated a large treasury surplus.

        While a full budget was adopted on day 1 of the fiscal year, public capital expenditure
has continued to lag significantly, relative to plan. The low level of expenditure in FY13 was
widely blamed on political instability and the GoN’s inability, as a result, to adopt a full budget
before the last quarter of the fiscal year (on the 9th April, 2013). As a full budget was adopted on
time in FY14, the expectation was that both capital and recurrent expenditures would grow
significantly given pent-up demand and the freedom given to implementing agency to use their
allocated budgets. This expectation has materialized to the extent that spending has grown
significantly in the first six months of the year relative to the same time in FY13 (NRs 156 billion vs.
NRs 104 billion or a 50% increase). While this improvement was for recurrent and capital spending
alike (Figure 1), it is however relative to very different bases. As investment spending had lagged
dramatically in FY13 the nominal increase in FY14 (NRs 11.46 billion compared to NRs 7.66 billion
in FY13) is no cause for celebration and remains small in absolute terms and relative to budgeted
amounts.

        The budget, at mid-year is under-executed, particularly for capital. At mid-year, only
13.5% of the capital budget and 36.8 % of the recurrent budget have been used (Figure 2). As a
result underspending of the budget is likely as is important bunching of expenditure in the last
quarter and especially in the last month of the fiscal year, calling into question both the realism of
the budget and the quality of the expenses that are actually / eventually realized.

         In view of the low budget outturn, the government has revised and lowered its
spending targets. Total expenditure is now expected to reach NRs 479.132 billion which is 92.6%
of the total budgeted amount, with capital expenditure targets revised downwards by 13.4 billion (a
16% decrease) and recurrent spending by NRs 21.8 billion (a 6% decrease).

        Recurrent expenditure growth accounted for 83% of the total increase in total
expenditure, relative to FY13. In the first six months of FY14, recurrent spending reached NRs
130.1 billion (vs. NRs 86.9 billion in the corresponding period of FY13), driven inter alia by the
public sector wage bill (following a 18% increase in the salaries of public employees as well as an
additional NRs 1000 in monthly allowances) and significant growth in conditional and
unconditional recurrent grants to government agencies, committees and boards (

        The fate of so called ‘National Pride Projects’ illustrates deep absorptive bottlenecks
especially for capital projects. Of the 21 projects that have received allocations in the government
budget under this category, three projects (Bhairahawa International Airport, Second International
Airport, and West Seti Hydropower Project) have not spent anything at all in the first half of the
year, while a further two projects (Bheri-Babai Diversion Multipurpose Project and the
Kathamandu-Terai Fast-track project) have spent less than 1% of their respective allocations. In
this respect they exemplify shortcomings in preparations and implementation that affect the
broader capital project portfolio of the government. Their fate underscores the need to thoroughly
re-evaluate the entire budget process from planning to formulation and execution (see the “review
of policies and short to medium term development challenges” section for a fuller discussion) as
well as to potentially review the basis upon which the prioritization process is carried-out.




                                                                       10
Box 1: "National Pride Projects" progressing at slow pace


The Government of Nepal has accorded 21 infrastructure projects the status of ‘National Pride Projects’ to reflect their
importance for Nepal’s Development. The budget allocations for these projec ts represent 4.22% and 25.67% of the total
and the capital budget respectively. However, the rate of utilization of budgets by these projects has been dismal. At mid-
year, only 12.9% of the NPR 21.8 billion total allocation has been spent. Only two projects have exceeded the 50%
utilization mark.
Some projects have run into difficulties even before they could begin, while with most projects progress has been very
slow. A feasibility study is still missing for the West Seti Hydropower project and work has not started on the Nijgar
International Airport - while a detailed feasibility has already been prepared, the BOOT (Build-Own-Operate-Transfer)
Committee has not been able to decide on the BOOT modality to implement the project.
The Kathmandu-Tarai Fast Track link has stalled for lack of investors. The government had begun construction and
opened the track with the expectation that the remainder of the work (like tarmacking) would be contracted out to the
private sector. However, no private party has shown interest. On the other hand, Bhairahawa International Airport has
nearly completed its land acquisition and an international tender has been released. A detailed design for irrigation from
the Bheri-Babai Diversion Multipurpose project is being developed but the rate of progress suggests it will not use up its
allocated budget for FY14. The vast majority of the funds utilized by the Bhudhigandaki Hydropower project have been
spent on the engineering company preparing a detailed project report.
The Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower project is expected to come online in 2016 after problems while digging the main
tunnel delayed it by a year. Melamchi Drinking Water has restarted tunneling work again after a new company was
awarded the contract through rebidding. The original company contracted to dig the tunnel was dismissed in September
2012 due to its inability to fulfill contractual obligations. The Sikta Irrigation project was expected to be completed in
FY14 but due to problems with land acquisition and contract management it has also been delayed.

       Revenue growth has continued at a sustained pace, from a high base in FY13, albeit
with a shift in drivers. Six months into the fiscal year, domestic revenue mobilization stood at NRs
163.4 billion or 39% of the ambitious target set for FY14 (NRs 424 billion). Sharp revenue growth
continued in FY14 (21.5% in the first half of the fiscal year compared to 21.2% at the same time in
FY13) albeit driven relatively less by customs and personal income tax and more by other taxes and
non-tax revenues (Figure 4). The growth rate of customs revenue slowed to 20% in FY14 as
compared to 39.1% in the same period in FY13, although the reasons are unclear. Indeed, while
import growth has slowed, the deceleration was in fact modest (1.3 percentage points). Likewise
mid-year growth in income tax receipts was only 11.8% as compared to 30.3% at the same time in
the previous fiscal year. A possibility is that tax administration of customs and the PIT may have
been relaxed somewhat in the run-up to the election. The gap was made up to some extent by VAT
which grew at 19.6% as compared to 17.4% in the same period in FY13 -mainly due to the positive
impact of leakages control initiatives in VAT administration. A significant boost also came from
non-tax revenues which grew by a whopping 42.6% in FY14 as compared to a -6.6% decline in
FY13, mostly on account of increases in dividends paid by public enterprises and added royalties
from telecom companies. It appears likely that the revenue target for FY14 will be met especially if
customs and PIT revenues pick up in the second half of the year.

        The shift in drivers is reflected to some extent in the composition of revenue streams.
VAT and customs taxes still accounted for almost half (49.3%) of the revenue mobilization by mid-
year in FY14. Even though there was a slowdown in the collection of income tax, it still made up
21% of the total revenue collected by mid-year in FY14 (as compared to 22.8% of the total revenue
collected in the same period in the previous year). The share contributed by excise duty remained
at 13.1% whereas the share of non-tax revenue grew from 10.8% at the end of six months in FY13
to 12.7% in the same period in FY14.

        The combination of low expenditure and robust revenue growth accounted for a
significant budget surplus and declining debt. With a significant increase in foreign grants
(which more than doubled in the first six months of the year compared to the previous) the overall
government surplus ballooned to NRs 56.0 billon. Reflecting this comfortable fiscal position the
GoN did not issue any fresh T-Bills in FY14 and domestic debt fell to NRs 217.61 billion.

                 Inflationary pressures have not subsided with the risk of second round effects.

        Inflation stood at 9.7% (y-o-y) in January 2014, driven by rising food prices. This is in
contrast with FY13 when non-food items were pushing inflation up (Figure 6). At the end of the
second quarter of FY14, the index for food and beverage prices had registered a 12.9% increase (y-
o-y) while that of non-food item had grown only by 6.9%. In particular, within the food and
beverage category, cereal grains and its products, vegetables, and meat and fish had seen sharp
price rises (12.7%, 19% and 24.5% respectively).

        A multiplicity of factors affected food prices during the review period. The price of
meat was driven upwards by avian-flu fears leading authorities to impose a quarantine on imports
and to destroy vast numbers of animals. Recorded increases in the prices of cereal grains, however
are counterintuitive given that agricultural output is believed to have improved significantly.
Among the possible reasons for persistently high prices: (i) high demand in the run up to the
election in November 2013 (reflecting both campaign-related expenditures and ‘stock piling’ by
households in anticipation of strikes); (ii) high food prices in India, allowing (iii) hoarding of supply
to the market by middle-men (as indicated by the differential between CPI and WPI). In parallel, the
decline in non-food prices growth is partly attributable to petroleum products whose administered
prices were left unchanged during the first half of the year after the increases in FY13 (Figure 7).

        Higher food prices could generate second round effects. There is some evidence –
logically given the share of food items in Nepal’s CPI basket- that food prices are transmitted to
non-food price inflation probably through changes in expectations and wages. Therefore, the speed
at which food prices decline will need to be monitored closely. To reflect higher than expected
inflation outcomes during the first half of the year the NRB has revised its annual inflation target to
8.5% (from 8%).
  Sharp remittance growth and a slower deterioration of the trade balance leading to a record BOP
                                             surplus.

        In the first 6 months of FY14, Nepal accumulated a significant current account surplus
driven in part by a slower deterioration of the trade balance and a significant increase in the
rate of growth of workers’ remittance transfers. In the first six months of the fiscal year, exports
of goods increased by 16% (against 10.2% at the same time last FY) while import growth was
23.3% (vs. 24.6% in FY13). As a result the trade gap continued to grow, by just under 25%, albeit at
a slower pace than in the corresponding period of FY13 (28%). Moreover, in parallel, workers’
remittances grew by a whopping 34.4% since the beginning of the fiscal year, much in excess of the
already impressive 22% growth registered in the first half of FY13 (a difference of NRs 68 billion).
As a result, compared to the same time in FY13, the overall current account surplus increased by a
1150% (a difference of NRs 50.6 billion).



        The rupee’s depreciation and possible substitution by Indian importers resulted in
significant export and moderate import growth. (Figure 8)

        In the first 6 months of FY14, exports to India grew significantly (by 18.45%) compared to
the corresponding period in FY13 (3.8%) driving the growth in total export to 16% at the end of six
months in FY14. Since the INR is pegged to the NPR, the depreciation of the Indian currency vis-à-
vis other currencies made Nepali products comparatively more attractive. The depreciation of NPR
should have boosted exports to other countries as well but the product base of Nepal’s exports to
other countries is very narrow and further it is mainly in niche products like handicrafts, carpets
and pashmina which have relatively low price elasticity of demand. In contrast, Nepal’s exports to
India are more varied. Of the top 10 highest value exports to India, 4 grew at a rate above 25% (Zinc
Sheet 62.5%; Cardamom 38.6%; Juice 25.8%; Shoes and Sandals 43.9%), while exports declined
only in 2 products. Likewise the depreciation of the rupee is likely to have caused the modest
decline in the growth rate of imports, which slowed to 23.1% from 25.2% in the same period in
FY13 (a predictably modest decline since the bulk of imports is from India for which there were no
price effects at play).

         The trade balance continued to deteriorate in FY14, albeit at a slower pace. While
exports grew significantly in the first half of the year, their overall small size relative to imports
(11.9% of total trade) meant that the trade deficit continued to grow by 24.4% at the end of first
half of FY14, compared to 28.4% in the first half of FY13 (Figure 9).

      Record levels of remittance inflows are keeping the current account in surplus, by a
wide margin. Remittance increased by 34.4% as of January 2014 compared to 21.8% over the
same period in the previous year (Figure 10). The growth in the number of migrant workers

departing Nepal together with favorable policy changes in destination countries may have
contributed. First, important destination countries revised upwards the minimum compensation
entitlements for migrant workers. Second, the decision by Saudi authorities to grant amnesty for
illegal workers may have promoted a significant number of illegal Nepali workers to return to
Nepal with their life savings. Finally, the depreciation of NPR has provided additional incentives for
migrant workers to send a larger proportion of their income (and possibly some savings) in foreign
currencies back to Nepal.

        Reflecting the large balance of payment surplus, reserve assets grew significantly
(Figure 11). As of January 2014, foreign exchange reserves were sufficient to cover the equivalent of
10.2 months of goods and services imports.

           Monetary policy has remained accommodative in the face of sharp remittances growth.

        The massive increase in remittance inflows was only partly sterilized and resulted in
a significant increase of the money supply. In the first half of FY14, broad money (M2) grew
nearly twice as fast during the first six months of FY14 (9%) compared to the same period in FY13
(4.8%). Somewhat lower growth in net domestic assets (4.8% in the first six months of FY14
compared to 6.2% at the same time in FY13) was largely made up by a rapid build-up of net foreign
assets, which grew at a fast rate of 16.5% (compared to 2% in the first half of FY13). Likewise
money supply grew significantly in the first half of the year both on account of currency and
demand deposit growth (jointly by just under 9% during the first six months of the year vs. -0.5% at
the same time in FY13) and saving and call deposits (jointly 11.2% vs. 9.6%).

  The financial system is characterized by excess liquidity with systemic weaknesses and uncertainty
                                              remaining.

         Deposit growth has outpaced credit over the past 12 months with excess liquidity
building up in the system (Figure 13 and Figure 14). In the last 12 months to Q2 of FY14, banks’
deposit grew by 20.7% (NPR 174 billion) compared to credit growth of only 18.2% (NPR 126
billion). This is a reversal from the trend observed at the same time in FY13 when deposit and
credit increased by 19.2% (NPR 135 bn) and 24.8% (NPR 137 bn) respectively. As a result the
market is in surplus, by around NPR 50 billion, above and beyond the 20% mandatory liquidity
requirement.

         The NRB has acted to mop up liquidity albeit at levels significantly below market
demand. In the first half of the year, the NRB has undertaken reverse repos worth NPR 118.5
billion and issued outright sale auction for securities worth NPR 8.5 billion and development bonds
worth NPR 10 billion to address short and long-term liquidity issues. The last round was subscribed

billion) at an average rate of 0.23%.


       The rise in market liquidity and sluggish credit growth has impacted weighted T-bill
(91 days) and average inter-bank rates considerably. T-bill (91 days) rates ranged between
0.515% to 0.016% and inter-bank from 0.24% to 0.15% in Q2 of FY14. In comparison, the T-bill
was 1.6% and inter-bank 0.95% as of end of Q2 FY13.
        Bank balance sheets are still vulnerable to real estate exposure as well as NPLs and
reported figures may understate the extent of such vulnerabilities (Figure 15). As per reported
figures, the total exposure to real estate (including home loans) declined y-o-y from 15.1% of the
total loan portfolio in Q2FY13 to 14.2% as of Q2FY14, with the share of home (mortgages) loans –
considered relatively safer- growing to make up 47% of the total real estate exposure compared to
36% one year ago. None of the banks have real estate exposure in excess of the NRB cap of 25%.

        The share of NPLs increased marginally albeit from a small –reported- base and with
adequate coverage (Figure 16). The share of NPLs was 3.1% of the total loan portfolio as of Q2FY14,
a marginal deterioration relative to Q1 (2.8%) but similar to that of the same period in FY13
(3.2%). Only three banks (14% of the system) have NPLs in excess of 5% including two state
controlled banks (ADBL and RBB). Total loan loss provision coverage vis-à-vis total NPLs is 113%
for the commercial banking industry, including 9 banks with coverage of less than 100% and five
banks with less than 90%.

         The overall capital position of the commercial banking industry remains sound. The
average Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is estimated to be 11.8% compared to 11.7% at the same
time in FY13, albeit down from 14.2 % recorded at the end of last fiscal year (mainly due to
dividend payouts and a significant increase in risk weighted assets - from NPR 785 bn to NPR 981
bn). All banks meet the minimum CAR of 10 % except two state controlled banks (representing 14.5
% of the banking system). These banks – NBL and RBB – have improved their CAR y-o-y from -5.4
% to 0.84% and -2.4 % to 4.3 % respectively as a result of equity injection from the government and
retained earnings as per their recapitalization plan.
         Banks remain profitable but the NRB’s proposed policy to limit interest spreads could
put pressure on returns. The commercial banking industry posted a record net profit of NPR 9.4
billion in Q2 of FY14 compared to NPR 7.9 billion recorded in the same period last FY – a y-o-y
growth of 18 %. Based on data of 23 (out of 31) banks, the average yield (from loans and
investment) declined to 9.88 % (compared to 10.1 % in Q2FY13 and 10.3 % in Q4FY13) resulting
from a decline in interest spread to 4.3 % (from 4.41 % in Q2FY13 and 4.6 % in Q4FYE13) while
there was no change in average (industry) cost of funds at 5.5 %. However, in terms of return on
equity, there has been a gradual decline for the last three quarters (shareholders of 27 private
commercial banks received an average return of 13.8% as of the first six months of the current
fiscal year) due to low yielding investments made by banks resulting from lack of investible
opportunities to extend loans and advances. The NRB’s move to cap the rates spread - BFIs have
been told to reduce the spread rate to 5 percentage points by the end of the current fiscal year- and
service charges will imply greater challenges for BFIs to increase or even maintain their returns. As
of the first six months of the current fiscal year, 13 commercial banks had spread rates of above
5pp.

   The stock market has climbed to a historic high reflecting improved investor sentiment and easy
                 access to financing but decreasing incentives for needed reforms.

the listed companies and improved prospects for political stability. The NEPSE posted a

increased investor confidence following the formation of the new government. According to
stockbrokers, this bullish sentiment is explained by increased confidence of both old and new
investors holding new positions, availability of funds from the banking system at reasonable
interest rates, the formation of a new government and the majority of listed companies reporting
good financial results.

   The master plan to reform capital markets has remained on the backburner. After more
than two years since the five-year master plan on capital market was devised (2011), nothing
substantial has materialized. The master plan was supposed to address most of the shortcomings of
the Nepali securities market and to bring it at par with international standards by July 2016. SEBON
had sought international support to address structural problems troubling the overall market as
the stock index had crashed. However, as the stock prices have become bullish again, implementing
the plan seems to have remained on SEBON's backburner.

Review of policies and short to medium term development challenges
The new government will have to focus resolutely on removing constraints to public and private
investment without which growth will not accelerate significantly in the near future. This review of
policies and short to medium term challenges focuses on those areas where the major bottlenecks to
unlocking investment-supported growth currently reside, namely public financial management (PFM)
and infrastructure development. Specifically it seeks to highlight feasible reforms that the new
government could initiate.
                   Improving PFM systems to unlock more and better investment

        Public investment is not per se constrained by lack of funds but rather hindered by
weak PFM systems and practices. The key question is what explain the state’s under-investment
relative to potential. The answer lies in PFM systems that are well defined on paper but
dysfunctional in practice, with critical gaps at all stages of the budget planning, formulation and
execution as well as deficient oversight capacity and systems.
           Address systemic weaknesses in the budget preparation and execution process

        While a budget was adopted on time in for FY14 public investment has continued to
underperform indicating fundamental flaws in the incentives and systems for the
government to efficiently use the funds set aside for capital expenditure. What the experience
of FY14 suggests is that budget timeliness and added MoF scrutiny may be a necessary but still
insufficient condition for capital expenditure to proceed at the level and pace required. Poor
execution of the capital budget in FY13 was blamed on the numerous delays with which the full
budget was eventually adopted (in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year). The GoN made
commendable efforts to adopt a full budget on day one of FY14 and has also set up ad hoc
mechanisms for regular progress reviews but this has yielded only modest progress in the pace of
spending.
    To address structural absorptive bottlenecks, the GoN should carry out an in depth
review of the entire budget chain from planning to budgeting and execution. Below are
insights from a recently conducted WB-ODI report that could serve as a basis for such review. The
basic finding is that, while formal budgetary guidelines and procedures exist, the budget process is
practically in disarray:
   1. Budget planning and preparation entails numerous and inefficient review steps. The budget
      ceilings approved by the MoF in January and presented to line ministries and agencies
      constitute, in theory, the basis for each ministry to submit their budgets by the end of
      March. Not only does this typically not happen until May but the ceilings are often not
      adhered to (by wide margins). This in turn requires a round of evaluations by the MoF and
      NPC that stretches up to the beginning of the fiscal year (although the budget circular
      specifies March-April). Program and sector discussions on the budget estimates are held
      between MoF, NPC and the concerned ministry or agency to reconcile the proposals
      (submitted in hard copies and inputted manually into the budget management information
      system) within the constraints imposed by the aggregate ceiling for the central government.


                                                24
   The negotiated budget requests are compiled by the MoF at the end of June when a draft
   annual budget is prepared. At the same time the Resources Committee decides the final set
   of macroeconomic forecasts and corresponding adjustments are made to the overall
   revenues and expenditures estimates (and ministries’ allocations).
To accelerate the pace of budget approval and ensure a closer alignment between policy priorities
and budgetary allocations, the GoN should consider enforcing adherence to budget ceilings, which
may in turn require revising the bottom up process through which ministries prepare their budget
proposals.
2. The approved budget is de facto renegotiated throughout the year. The approved budget is
   not a predictor of actual spending but, in some ways, the beginning of a new set of budget
   negotiations (with new projects included throughout the fiscal year) and a constant stream
   of reallocations and virements. While the ceilings outlined in the Red Book are binding, the
   inclusion / exclusion of activities within these limits are subject to ongoing discussion and
   there is no hard deadline for inclusion of new capital projects. Line ministries, departments
   and local bodies complain that the NPC and the MoF change the budget at the last minute by
   including projects and programs not previously planned for – possibly in response to
   political pressure. The concerned departments, division offices and local bodies must then
   re-adjust their work programs, re-write project implementation plans and develop new
   procurement plans, which must be sent afresh to the respective ministries and the NPC for
   approval. Moreover reallocations within budget headings are frequent during the fiscal
   year. Virement rules are extremely flexible, allowing line ministries to reallocate up to 25%
   of any particular line item within each budget heading, and there is no monitoring
   mechanism to track changes thus made to the budget.
To enhance the credibility of the budget as a tool for policy implementation and provide
implementing agencies with clear marching orders at the beginning of the fiscal year, the GoN
should consider ways to limit the inclusion of new projects after submission of the budget and
curbing virements powers of implementing agencies.
3. The authorization process for development projects remains highly centralized and
   bureaucratic, causing major delays in project implementation. While the execution of salary
   payments may start on issue of the authorization letter by MoF, line ministries and the NPC
   must further assess other expenditures – notably from the development budget – before
   project implementation can start. Specifically, the approval of P1 projects (with so called
   priority projects accounting for 90% of the total) requires the adoption and vetting of
   feasibility studies, work plans and procurement plans by the NPC, following approval of the
   annual budget rather than ex ante. This approval process can take an additional 3 to 4
   months and sometimes rolls into the last semester.
To expedite capital spending, the GoN should consider including in the budget only projects for
which the full set of feasibility studies, work plans and procurement plans has been prepared and
approved by the NPC ex ante.




                                             25
   4. Weak fiduciary capacity at the level of implementing agencies as well as deliberate
      manipulation further slow-down capital projects’ implementation. While cumbersome
      approval processes and budget release procedures are partly to blame, delays are also the
      result of poor preparedness on the part of implementing agencies, with insufficient
      attention devoted to feasibility studies and other elements of project preparation. Moreover
      the process can also be manipulated. As unspent balances increase at the end of the fiscal
      year, budget holders gain additional freedom to expedite spending including by diverting it
      to lower priority projects and causing fragmentation of the capital budget into multiple
      small projects (with weaker procurement and oversight constraints). Approved projects are
      often unfinished, resulting in wastage of resources and ineffective development outcomes.
   5. Budget process bottlenecks are compounded by implementation and procurement
      weaknesses, particularly for investment and at the local level. Significant local-level
      discretion by user committees over contractor selection and the financial terms of contract
      awards has frequently been associated with leakage and inefficient use of expenditure.
      There are reports of loss and leakage of funds through the inflation of user costs of
      construction as well as over-charging by user-committees which then subcontract.
      Procurement and contracting are weak in terms of both competition among contractors and
      technical capacity for proper procurement planning.
   To improve procedures and capacities for procurement planning and management, the GoN could
   consider developing national norms and rates for project costing to replace the current district-by-
   district regime and establishing minimum technical standards for contracted works and enforcing
   them through technical monitoring.

           Amplify good governance initiatives begun under the technocratic government.

    To boost growth and service delivery, the GoN must focus on improving both the quantity
and the quality of public spending. Important steps in the right direction were taken by the
previous technocratic government, which ought to be leveraged and amplified. This is important
not only for moral reasons (spending people’s money well) but also for efficiency as poor public
financial management distorts allocative decisions resulting in poor value for money. Interestingly,
the ministries with the highest amount of reported irregularities (as per OAG) are also those in
charge of delivering the infrastructure that the country critically needs. Specifically, low hanging
fruits for reform include:
      Strengthening internal audit by separating, within FCGO, the audit and treasury functions.
       Internal control systems remain inadequate. In FY13, the cumulative backlog of unsettled
       irregular expenses incurred by government offices, committees and district development
       committees (DDCs) increased to NRs 204 billion (or 12% of GDP).
Separating the treasury and internal audit functions and the creation of a distinct internal audit cadre
would strengthen the audit function and reduce the risk of both erroneous and inappropriate actions -
by creating additional layers of review and by ensuring that authorization to spend and the review of
such authorization are not carried out by the same service or person.



                                                  26
      Strengthening the Office of the Auditor General. The OAG has prepared and submitted
       proposed improvements to the audit legislation governing its operations. The proposed
       legislation would give the OAG the level of independence called for by the International
       Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI). The OAG would for example be able
       to hire, promote and fire staff without going through government, and have financial and
       administrative independence. This is a pre-requisite to effective audit, as the auditor
       currently depends (for its budget) on those same people it is responsible for auditing.
   As next step the GoN should review the proposed legislative improvements and submit an Audit Bill
   to Parliament for its consideration.
      Restore and resource key parliamentary committees. In the absence of an elected
       Parliament since April 2012, the key functions of the Finance and Public Accounts
       Committees of Parliament have not been exercised. In particular the Annual Reports of the
       Auditor General have not been tabled for review. In FY12, irregularities of government
       offices and organized entities, committees and DDCs amounted to NRs 35.1 billion or 19%
       of total audited expenditures. The Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport
       (MoPIT) and the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (MoFALD) were found
       to have the highest amounts of reported irregularities (respectively 20% and 13% of the
       total).
   With the new assembly in place, it is now imperative to restore the functions of the PAC and its
   ability to address reported irregularities.
                                 Developing strategic infrastructure

        Infrastructure is central to any development vision for Nepal. Not only is it at the core
of the challenge to unleash private investment but it is also a fundamental pillar in building the
bridge from economic growth to inclusion and shared prosperity – with a direct impact on the lives
of the poor and the marginalized. Necessary actions would need to address both a quantity and
quality deficiency, particularly in the two big and critical infrastructure sectors: transport and
energy. Given limited resources the focus should be on maximizing the impact of every rupee spent
and on creating the conditions for private finance to complement and leverage public resources.
                                 Tackle issues in the transport sector

    The quality of Nepal’s road infrastructure is particularly poor relative to other low
income countries. Some 80% of respondents to the WB’s 2010 Logistic Performance Index survey
ranked Nepal’s roads as low or very low quality and 100% ranked the cost of road transport as high
or very high. Improving connectivity throughout Nepal is not only important for growth but also for
inclusiveness in order to ensure physical access for all to social and economic services and facilities
including markets, educational institutions or health centers. In the short- to medium-term the GoN
could consider the following policy priorities:
      Reviving the proposed fast track linkage between Kathmandu and the Tarai plains project.
       Although it is of vital economic significance the project appears to have stalled. At present
       goods and passenger transport vehicles make a 250km detour to avoid the Tribhuvan


                                                  27
           highway (between Hetuada and Kathmandu) that has steep gradients and unfavorable
           alignment for larger vehicles. The initial feasibility study for a ‘fast track’ alternative
           estimated potential time savings of 4-5 hours, fuel savings of US$30 per one way trip for a
           heavy truck and some 32 million liters of fuel saved in the first year of operation alone. At a
           more macro level the project would greatly facilitate trade with India and the transit of
           goods to and from Kolkata and reduce the cost of imports and exports (inland transport and
           transshipment costs account for over 60% of export costs in Nepal). Rough cost estimates
           suggest that building the fast track will require approximately US$ 1 billion. Given the
           project’s importance and complexity it is clear that much preparatory work will be needed
           which should begin now.
In particular the GoN could consider (i) enacting new legislation to manage the unique institutional,
regulatory and operational challenges that the fast track entails, and setting up a separate authority
to manage the project – with a clear business and procurement plan; (ii) preparing the technical
ground including : a detailed alignment survey, basic design of structures and tunnels, social and
environmental safeguards, (iii) making a plan for financing such a huge investment including
recosting the project, carrying out a fiscal assessment and identifying external partners.

   Resolving overlapping institutional roles and mandates in the transport sector is key to
    unlock and improve public infrastructure spending.             Institutional limitations and
    overlapping roles and responsibilities severely hamper Nepal’s ability to make sound
    capital investments in the transport sector. According to the World Bank’s 2011 Roads
    Sector Public Expenditure Review, roughly 70% of spending in the transport sector occurs
    in the last trimester of each fiscal year. This fact evidences that the budgeting, planning,
    procurement, and contract management processes applied throughout the transport sector
    need to work more smoothly. The capacity of local government entities and the
    accountability framework that applies to their transport sector investment activities also
    require significant improvement. Roughly 30 paisa of every rupee that the GoN transferred
    to support local government-led transport sector investment triggered some form of audit
    observation from the Office of Auditor General. Throughout the transport sector, there are
    instances of overlapping institutional roles and mandates. For instance, the department
    responsible for strategic road network and bridges takes-up local road network and bridges
    and vice versa. This is particularly challenging for urban transport interventions that
    simultaneously aim at improving physical infrastructure, traffic management, and policies
    that fall under different ministries or departments. At present, four different line ministries
    and roughly 23 different departments, divisions, or local government bodies have
    jurisdiction over issues relating to urban transportation in the Kathmandu valley. Reducing
    this complexity can help make meaningful urban transport interventions less unwieldy.
In order to reduce such complexity and streamline the process of investment project
implementation the GoN should consider (i) placing urban transport in Kathmandu under one
single institution (new or rebooted), (ii) taking measures to ensure that departments under MoPIT
and MoFALD stick to investments only along roads under their official remits, (iii) making local
government bodies more accountable regarding investment decisions and implementation.
   Addressing Kathmandu's growing urban transport challenges. Although improving urban
    transport may not appear to be a short term priority given Nepal’s overall low levels of
    urbanization, the pace at which Nepal’s cities are growing (particularly in the Kathmandu
    valley) is the highest of any South Asia country. Addressing this medium- to long-term
    challenge will therefore require resolute action now. Managing rapid motorization more
    effectively is critical for improving transport and the urban environment in the Kathmandu
    valley. The number of vehicles registered annually in the valley grew by 14% each year
    between 2001 and 2010, especially personal motorcycles and at the same time public
    transportation has increased dramatically with close to a million trips made every day via
    bus services.
In order to meet the challenge of urban transportation on time, before it is too late, the GoN should
develop a plan to (i) provide more appropriate pedestrian infrastructure as walking accounts for
nearly 40% of all trips in the valley and Kathmandu was identified as one of the least ‘walkable’
cities in Asia; and (ii) improve public transport facilities and bus services for those relying on
public transportation.

                                Initiate reform in the power sector

Unreliable and poor power supply is probably the single greatest obstacle to development
and growth in Nepal. All political parties have recognized that, pledging in their electoral
manifestos to reduce load shedding hours within 3 years. The task however is huge and it should
begin now. Below are a few areas that the new government could consider addressing as a matter
of priority.
      Launching a process for electricity tariff reform: the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) a
       vertically integrated government owned utility suffers from severe financial losses and
       cannot, therefore, generate financing for investment in critical power generation,
       transmission and distribution infrastructure. Since 2002, almost no transmission line has
       been built and only 92MW have been added to the system. NEA owns 66% of the generation
       capacity in the country and has the monopoly of power transmission and distribution
       (therefore it is a single buyer for privately generated power). While private investment is no
       doubt needed to increase generation, lack of transmission capacity, exposure to foreign
       exchange risk and risks of NEA payment default (in addition to other country risks) are
       major bottlenecks for such sizeable private investments. The current tariff charges to
       consumers are about 25% below the cost of supply by NEA which accumulated net losses of
       8.55 billion in FY12 alone. With such dismal financial performance, it would be difficult to
       provide comfort to the private developer for which NEA is the off-taker of power
       generation. Tariff reform is therefore imperative, but it must be combined with actions to
       reduce T&D operating losses and structured in a way that minimizes public resistance
       (legitimate to the extent that service is poor) and does not generate unwanted
       redistributive effects.
   The tariff reform would need to consider a stepped approach to deal with social impacts and allow
   tariff adjustment, with indexation to inflation and foreign exchange rates, and tariff categories
   restructure and allow cross-subsidies among consumer categories to address impacts on the poor.
      Introducing compensation policies for transmission lines right of way (ROW): On-
       going transmission line projects have suffered extensive delays in construction due to
       disputes on compensation payments for land under the ROW. One World Bank-funded
       transmission line project has been under implementation for 10 years but still could not be
       completed due to the dispute for a 3.8 km ROW stretch. While government laws and
       regulations allow full compensation for acquiring land for tower foundation under the
       transmission projects, NEA does not have a clear corporate policy for the compensation for
       land under the ROW. As is common practice in many countries, NEA provides full
       compensation for losses of properties, trees and crops for ROW clearance. In addition, NEA
       also provides 10 % of the land value as compensation for the restricted use of the ROW.
       This practice has worked well in remote rural areas where the land is used predominantly
       for cultivation. However, ROW compensation has become a serious issue in urban and peri-
       urban areas, where land has significant value appreciation potential due to the growing
                                                30
    real-estate market in Nepal. In the absence of a clear corporate policy for compensation, the
    process of making decisions for compensation above 10%, such as in urban and peri-urban
    areas, has been unduly long and difficult.
As a matter of priority the GoN / NEA should formulate a transmission line ROW compensation
policy that provides justifiable compensation for restricted land use within the legal framework of
Nepal taking into account land location and use.
   Producing a road map on power sector development: Hydropower and transmission
    projects have long lead times in preparation, financing and construction; so a strategic
    vision is needed for power sector development to guide policy and regulation efforts and
    investments. The strategic vision or the road map should clearly indicate the GoN's
    objectives of power sector development and how these objectives could be achieved. The
    rich hydropower resources available in Nepal make it possible to provide reliable,
    affordable and sustainable electricity supply and to generate huge export revenues (which
    in turn can be invested in infrastructure development and service delivery). While public
    investments are needed, such as in transmission lines, it is impossible to achieve these
    objectives in Nepal without private sector hydropower participation and policy reforms are
    needed to create an enabling environment for such private investments. As the Nepalese
    hydropower generation has strong seasonality, there is also a need to balance the seasonal
    generation through a development of seasonal storage hydropower plants and effective
    power trading with India, Bangladesh or China. The power trading would allow to export
    surplus generation during the wet season to make large sized hydropower projects financial
    viable, and import of electricity to meet domestic demand during the dry season when
    hydro-generation is low. Power trading would help to reduce the trade deficit and enhance
    regional integration.
The GON should produce a power sector road map with full cabinet endorsement.

Short and medium term economic projections
         Growth is expected to recover to 4.5% in FY14, mostly on account of favorable
exogenous developments, and despite lackluster public spending. Overall economic growth is
expected to recover from the slow-down experienced in FY13 and to reach 4.5% in FY14, above the
initial forecast made at the end of FY13 but below the GoN’s own projection of 5.5%. Agriculture
output is expected to grow significantly reflecting more clement weather patterns (a timely and
adequate monsoon) as well as improved supply of agricultural inputs, particularly fertilizers.
Likewise and more importantly given the sector’s contribution to overall value added, growth in the
services sector is expected to be boosted by much higher than anticipated remittance inflows
growth, particularly education services and retail trade.
        Much uncertainty remains on the extent to which investment may pick up in the
second half of the fiscal year. The slow pace of budget execution, particularly for capital projects
reflects a combination of structural factors (weaknesses in budget preparation and
implementation) but also circumstantial elements. Focus on policy implementation was
overshadowed by the elections (which took place in November) for which a significant number of
key civil service personnel (including technical staff from line ministries) were deployed to prepare
and supervise the ballot. With the electoral period now over and a government in place, the pace of
project execution is expected to pick up. Likewise, it is also likely that private players have been
withholding planned investments until a clearer picture of the political environment could be
formed. Indeed, during the first half of the fiscal year there has been a sharp discrepancy between
domestic and external investment commitments and actual realization. The length of the lag
between the improved political outlook and its translation into fresh domestic and external
investments will determine whether the growth dividends from increased political stability will
materialize mostly at the tail end of the fiscal year or into FY15.
        External developments are unlikely to affect the outlook significantly, other than via
their possible effect on remittance inflows. While higher growth in India and expansion in
developing-country markets may boost exports, their small base means that the overall impact will
be modest. With limited exposure to foreign capital, Nepal will not be affected meaningfully by
tighter financial conditions. Despite their importance in Nepal, the drivers of remittance inflows
remain largely unknown: much in the same way as the sharp increase observed in the first half of
the year was unexpected one cannot assume that such growth can be sustained over time.
       Given the trend observed during the first half of the year, it is likely that the budget
will end the year in surplus. With robust revenue growth, the increase in total expenditure is
expected to translate into a smaller overall surplus (equivalent to 0.3% of GDP against 2% in FY13).
         Inflation in Nepal tends to follow India’s but inflationary pressure could build up if
record remittance inflows observed in the first 6 months continue and if monetary policy
does not adapt. Overall inflation for FY14 is expected to remain significant – at 9.8%. Although the
impact of this year’s good harvest will be to drive down food prices, the expected accelerated pace
of public spending in the latter part of the year combined with relatively loose monetary policy is
likely to translate into inflationary pressures. Moreover, this assumes that the NRB stands ready to
act decisively, should the large build-up of liquidity in the system translate into asset bubbles and

implications of excess liquidity.


Bank support and activities
        A new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for fiscal years 2014-17 is under
preparation. The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) covered FY04-07, and was followed by
three Interim Strategy Notes (in 2007, 2009, and 2011). The new strategy proposes a major shift in
World Bank Group (WBG) support away from short-term post-conflict assistance towards
establishing the foundations for increased and inclusive growth. Based on Nepal’s progress to date,
there is a compelling case to provide assistance under a longer-term partnership strategy, while
maintaining the flexibility needed to accommodate a fragile country environment. To do this, the
strategy aims to consolidate the WBG’s current engagement in basic services while shifting focus on
the binding constraints to growth:           inadequate infrastructure (especially energy and
transportation), a poor investment climate, a fragile financial sector and a poorly skilled workforce.
Given the reality of the Nepali economy, it will also focus on agriculture, which accounts for over
one third of GDP and employs three-quarters of the population (including the bulk of the poor). It
also aims to shift the Bank’s engagement in the social sectors from provi ding financing for access to
services to providing knowledge and solutions for improving quality, governance and providing
equal opportunities.
        The new CPS will focus on two pillars—(i) increasing economic growth and
competitiveness; and (ii) increasing inclusive growth and providing opportunities to increase
prosperity—while also seeking, in a crosscutting manner, to enhance governance, accountability
and citizens’ empowerment. Given Nepal’s fluid political situation, the CPS has been developed
through extensive consultations with key stakeholders, including political parties, and is aligned
around Nepal’s development priorities.
         The current portfolio consists of 17 projects with net commitments of US$1.5 billion,
and three regional projects with net commitments of about $240 million. The average project
size is $86 million, near the Bank-wide IDA average of about US$87 million. Under IDA16 (FY12-
14), Nepal’s total IDA allocation is about $630 million, and similar indicative financing levels are
expected for IDA17 (FY15-17). Cumulative disbursements as of January 31, 2014, were $633
million (about 46 % of net commitments) for the national and about $15million (about 6 % of net
commitments) for the regional projects. The portfolio also includes three active trust fund projects
with commitments above $5 million each. The total commitment of these three projects is $87.5
million of which $15.06 million (about 17.2 % of net commitments) have been disbursed.
        Pipeline Program: The FY14 lending pipeline includes a total of $221 million in new
commitments across three projects of which two ($150 million) have already been approved by the
Board on December 23, 2013. They include the Strengthening of the National Rural Transport
Program Project ($100 million) and Additional Financing for the Irrigation and Water Resources
Management Project ($50 million). The Rural Water Supply Project of about $71 million is planned
for Board submission in May 2014. This would provide for the full commitment of the entire IDA16
allocation to Nepal. Several strategic pieces of analytical support have been completed or are

Diagnostic, Mapping of Local Service Delivery, Medium Term Expenditure Framework and TA for

Excess liquidity – A “Fortunate Problem” … if well managed.
       Since the turn of the decade Nepal has experienced a liquidity squeeze, which almost
brought about a financial crisis, followed by a build-up of excess liquidity. In a recent review
of monetary policy the NRB Governor characterized such excess liquidity as a “fortunate problem”.
However, the volatility -from scarcity to abundance- is problematic for the private sector and
symptomatic of inefficiencies in the financial sector. This note looks at short and medium term
challenges it poses for policy

        The buildup of liquidity in Nepal’s financial system reflects strong push and weak pull
factors. The steady and impressive growth of remittance inflows - in FY14 as in previous years -
has translated in a significant buildup of liquidity in the financial system as banks appear reluctant
to extend credit to the productive sector, despite cheap access to funds and policy encouragements.
The NRB’s response so far has been muted and geared toward striking a delicate balance between
supporting credit growth on one hand and controlling inflationary pressures on the other.

         Excessive liquidity can potentially be of concern for both growth and inflation. Bank
liquidity can be a source of concern for growth to the extent that it amounts, de facto, to a
tightening of the money supply. Other things equal, excessive liquidity (money held by banks rather
than extended as credit) means less lending to support non-government productive investment –
for a given money base- and therefore slower overall economic growth. However, at the same time,
it is also potentially a source of inflationary pressure. Abundant liquidity comes at a cost for
commercial banks (in the form of deposit) who will only hold it if they need to improve their
balance sheets and/or consider the risk profile of borrowers to be too high. But such liquidity can
be rapidly mobilized for lending if these parameters change and can translate in asset bubbles
fueling inflation.

        The question is what characterizes ‘excess’ liquidity. It is not only an academic one but
has important policy implications. At minimum it describes a situation where banks chose to hold
liquid assets above and beyond statutory requirements. This may be purely rational if banks are
worried about their balance sheets and anticipate a deterioration in borrower credit worthiness
such that the holding of excess liquidity amounts to an additional self-imposed precautionary
behavior. At maximum, however, it may be the case that banks in fact involuntarily hold excess
liquidity because of information asymmetries (keeping rates sticky), poor alternatives (such as
bonds or viable demand for credit), lack of competition, and/or missing safety nets (such as a well-
developed interbank market and operational lender of last resort function by the NRB). It can also
be that banks are irrationally conservative in their appetite for risk.

        Achieving a sound diagnostic of Nepal’s situation is not easy and many of these
features could be simultaneously at play. Given Nepal’s recent near financial crisis it is likely that
psychological factors are making banks more risk averse than they otherwise might be. At the same
time one should also recognize that much uncertainty remains as to the true state of the financial
sector (including health of banks’ balance sheets) and quality of demand for loanable funds. Finally,
it is clear that there are substantial market inefficiencies. Given such ambiguity, thoroughly
diagnosing the patient’s condition should be a prerequisite to prescribing remedies and the first
therapeutic imperative, in the meantime, should probably be to ‘do no harm’.

                                                 35
        In the short term, monetary prudence may be the wisest course of action. Given
persistently high inflation and the overall healthy growth rate of the economy, the most immediate
risk is that inflationary expectations could build-up and become, eventually and increasingly,
harder to control. Relative monetary restraint (such as through sterilization of inflows) may come
with a price tag in terms of growth in the short term but would be unlikely to result in a vicious
spiral. Monetary expansion is a riskier choice. If banks are indeed excessively conservative and the
growth potential of the economy is solid, then monetary expansion could yield important dividends.
However, if banks are correctly assessing the risk of further extending credit and the economy
susceptible to asset bubbles (in the absence of productive avenues for credit expansion combined
with weak safeguards) then loose monetary policy combined with additional policy directives to
boost credit could spur inflation and possibly a return to financial sector stress.

        The NRB, sooner rather than later, may need to clarify its overarching strategy to deal
with persistently large private inflows. With remittance inflows showing no sign of abating -
characterized by both large volumes and volatility- and liquidity building up in the system, the NRB
has followed a course of action characterized by (i) an overall loose management of money growth
– intended to keep interests low and encourage credit expansion, (ii) targeted policy measures to
encourage banks to extend credit and access to finance, combined with (iii) ad hoc interventions to
mop up liquidity in the system through open market and reverse repo operations. This course of
action is equivalent to walking a fine line between pro-active support to economic growth and
containing inflationary pressures, but it does not amount to a clear and predictable course of action.
Moreover it has resulted in high interest rate volatility, which may have adversely affected the
propensity of banks to extend lending and of private agents to borrow.

        Ultimately, building the systems required for banks to safely and sustainably expand
credit is a sine qua non condition to strike the best possible balance between economic
growth and inflation control objectives. A patient has greater chance to recover from a
temporary illness if she is in good health to start with. Building-up the ‘immune system’ of the
financial sector should therefore be of paramount importance and there are many avenues to do so
in Nepal. By contrast, policy measures intended to force banks to simultaneously strengthen their
balance sheets and to expand credit (via interest rate caps) and direct it to underserved clients (via
directed lending to priority sectors) may be inefficient and possibly counterproductive. Ultimately
the key is to establish a strong enabling environment that creates opportunities for banks to lend
for productive purposes.

        This special focus section proposes a number of steps: to clarify the monetary policy
stance in the face of high liquidity as well as to develop market alternatives to potentially
distortionary policies to allow the credit market to work more efficiently.

Nepal’s financial system is currently characterized by excess liquidity reflecting a combination of
conjunctural and structural factors. On the one hand bank lending to the private sector has slowed –
with lending rates adjusting sluggishly to available liquidity- possibly remaining below optimal levels.
On the other hand, high external inflows of cash into the economy are creating significant pressure
that could translate into prices if banks are unable to channel this liquidity to sound investments and if
the monetary authorities do not act to effectively and predictably manage the overall level of liquidity
in the system.

In the short run, therefore, it may make sense for the NRB to clarify its monetary stance by articulating
a liquidity management strategy in relation to both growth (credit) and inflation goals as well as
financial stability and development objectives. This may call for creating new instruments to manage
excess liquidity, which has become a feature of the Nepali economy.

          From symptoms to diagnostic: excess liquidity, credit slowdown or credit “crunch”.

        In mid-2011, a financial sector crisis nearly unfolded in Nepal. Withdrawals of deposits
from smaller financial institutions and severe liquidity constraints across the banking sector
exposed the vulnerabilities of the financial system and required urgent intervention by Nepal’s
central bank and bank regulator, the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB). The World Bank, together with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), was called on by the NRB and the Government of Nepal (GoN)
to provide assistance, both technical and financial, to support efforts to contain the developing
crisis and to provide longer-term support for institutional and regulatory changes that would
contribute, over time, to a more robust system. Due to quick and effective intervention by the NRB –
including large scale liquidity support through multiple lending windows and regulatory
forbearance - and thanks to a favorable environment (notably continuing large flows of remittances
which contributed liquidity to the system), a full-blown financial crisis was averted.

         Over FY13 and FY14, excess liquidity has been building up in Nepal’s financial system.
Nepal’s banking sector appears to be increasingly biased toward holding liquid assets rather than
supporting productive investment through lending. Deposit mobilization increased by 8% in the
first half of the year vs. 5.3% at the same time in FY13; by contrast domestic credit growth slowed
to 7.3% over the first 6 months of the fiscal year under the influence of both lower levels of
government borrowing and slower growth of claims on the private sector (9% in the review period
vs. 12.3% in the first half of FY13). As a result, the loans-to-deposits ratio has been declining over
time. Three commercial banks (8.8% market share) recorded Credit to Deposit Ratio (in LCY) in
excess of 90% in the second quarter of FY14 compared to five commercial banks (9% market
share) in the previous quarter and eleven banks (30percent of the market) in the previous year. At
the same time, treasury bills accounts of commercial banks increased significantly, almost doubling
between FY11 and FY13. Reflecting these trends the interest rate spread between risky assets
(private sector loans) and low risk assets (T-Bills) widened significantly.

        Banks appear to be withholding credit by maintaining high lending rates despite
slower credit growth. Indeed, while credit to the private sector remains high, the rate of credit
growth has decreased significantly from FY13. Also, the large interest spread between risky assets
(credit to the private sector) and low risk assets (T-bills, deposits at NRB) is significant, indicating
reluctance from banks to use the price mechanisms to attract greater demand for loanable funds.
That is not because of involuntary rationing (although the NRB has imposed some limits to real
estate related lending) but rather appears to be a voluntary behavior, possibly linked to
psychological factors, a reassessment by banks of default risk and balance sheet weaknesses,
and/or absence of competition in the sector.

        Understanding the drivers of the credit slowdown – and whether Nepal’s situation
can in fact be characterized as a mild credit crunch1- is not straightforward as both demand
and supply factors may be at work. On the one hand political uncertainty, especially since the
dissolution of the first Constituent Assembly and in the run-up to the elections, may have led
private operators to postpone investment decisions; likewise the depreciation of the Nepali rupee
may have led importers to reduce their demand for letters of credit. On the other hand however, the
supply of credit may also have fallen (for any given level of interest rate –i.e. leftward shift of the
supply curve) due to balance sheet weaknesses of banks and/or heightened perception of default
risk. The banks’ continued exposure to real estate – whose valuation is particularly hard and where
the market remains subdued– adds to the constraints that banks face in assessing the true extent of
their exposure and need for additional protection beyond those imposed by regulation. Perceptions
could also be playing a part including the experience of crisis (an impaired loan portfolio) and/or
heightened uncertainty (leading to regard previously normal loans as having now excessive risk).

  Arguably Nepal is not in a full credit crunch scenario as the term usually refers to situations in which a drastic
reduction of credit (against the backdrop of deleveraging) precipitates a sharp contraction in real economic activity.
By comparison, Nepal’s slowdown is relatively mild.

                                                                    39
These two dynamics maybe re-enforcing each other since the most typical form of collateral is real-
estate.
Box 2: Definitions: credit slowdown and credit crunch


  A credit slowdown can be defined as a general decline in credit growth that may have been generated by either
  demand or supply factors, or both. Broad changes in the demand for credit may be cyclical (varying with the
  pace of economic activity) or structural (induced by changes in the tax code etc.). Credit supply can be
  influenced by changes in financial regulations, structures, and institutions. Monetary policy and autonomous
  shifts in lender and borrower psychology will have an impact on both credit supply and demand.

  Unlike credit slowdown, which is a fairly general term, credit crunch specifically refers to a reduction in the
  available supply of credit. During a period of credit crunch, lenders become reluctant to lend either because of
  funding problems stemming from disintermediation, or because regulators have urged credit restraint. The
  reluctance to lend may also stem from the lenders’ own balance sheet weaknesses (capital constraints) and
  their reassessment of borrowers’ average credit quality. Although credit crunches are often deemed as
  primarily supply phenomena, it is difficult to disentangle supply from demand effects since some of the same
  factors that reduce the willingness to lend may also restrain the desire to borrow.

  A credit crunch implies changes in the relationship between credit availability and interest rates: (i) less credit
  may be available over a wide range of interest rates -- a condition consistent with a leftward shift in a credit
  supply schedule, or (ii) the reduction in credit availability may bear little relation to the level of rates -- a
  condition that takes place when allocation occurs via non-price mechanisms. Since credit is normally allocated
  across potential borrowers by the interest rate, the term credit rationing is commonly used for situations in
  which the supply of credit is allocated through non-price mechanisms. In general, credit rationing episodes are
  considered to be a subset of credit crunches in which the interest rate is not the price underlining the credit
  allocation mechanism. Credit crunches that are characterized by credit rationing may be difficult to alleviate
  through monetary policy alone.

         Understanding the reasons behind the recent credit growth slowdown and/or the
stickiness of lending rates at which banks extend credit is imperative in order to assess the
most appropriate monetary policy response. In very schematic terms, the monetary policy
dilemma can be expressed as follows. On the one hand, if sound demand for credit exists in the
economy which is not materialized either because investors are postponing investment and /or
banks are excessively risk averse, then maintaining a relatively loose monetary policy may be
justified. On the other hand, if banks are worried about balance sheet weaknesses and assess the
existing demand for credit as too risky (given such balance sheet weaknesses) then loose money
combined with policy directives to expand lending could exacerbate financial sector woes and feed
asset bubbles and inflation.

                                                        Monetary policy choices

    From a policy standpoint determining what constitutes ‘excessive’ liquidity is
particularly difficult and the outcome of the diagnostic has important implications. In theory,
the buildup of liquidity, in excess of regulatory requirements, can have at least four sets of adverse
consequences albeit with different implications for policy:


                                                                  40
   -   On growth: as the bias toward liquidity implies a higher cost of borrowing (or credit
       rationing) leading businesses and households to defer investments or current expenditure
       and possibly to sectoral shifts in the composition of lending at the expense of smaller and
       less well established clients (flight to quality)
   -   On inflation: since it increases the capacity of the banking sector to boost credit in response
       to demand shocks, inflationary pressures could quickly become difficult to contain
   -   On financial sector stability: the effect is ambiguous: to the extent that banks can have
       access to cheap money, high levels of liquidity provide a boon to the banks’ ability to rebuild
       their balance sheets; at the same time, if adequate safeguards are not in place banks could
       be tempted to engage in overly risky lending practices
   -   On monetary policy effectiveness: by affecting the ability of monetary authorities to
       stimulate demand and stabilize the economy during downturns: with banks already highly
       liquid (i) further attempts by the monetary authorities to stimulate demand would likely
       prove futile and (ii) the ability to regulate the money supply via reserve requirements and
       the money multiplier are also proportionately weaker.

The monetary policy stance, therefore, involves a tradeoff between the objectives of
avoiding an unnecessary slowdown in growth on one hand and controlling inflation on the
other hand. Maintaining a relatively lose monetary policy and allowing the excess liquidity to
remain is consistent with emphasis on the first objective. Draining off excess liquidity is consistent
with a priority on the second objective. In addition, in Nepal, the NRB has identified two additional
objectives namely, financial development and stability. Lose monetary policy is consistent with
both, however its combination with policy directives to fix the spread that banks can maintain
between deposit and lending rates is not and even possibly counterproductive.

    Striking the right balance implies understanding the drivers of banks’ unwillingness to
extend credit and bias toward holding more liquid assets. On the one hand, banks may be
purely rational in their choice, holding excess reserves as a precautionary measure. On the other
hand, banks may be acting irrationally if their bias for liquid assets is above and beyond what
statutory requirements and what precautionary measures would call for. The extent to which
banks are acting ‘rationally’ has important implications for monetary policy.

         If banks are irrationally restricting credit, despite sound balance sheets and worthy demand
          for loans, then loose monetary policy may in fact be required. In fact excess liquidity could
          call for monetary base expansion: to support the same nominal aggregate demand, a higher
          base is needed the less inclined bankers are to lend.
         However, if banks are adequately assessing risks of expanding lending, then loose monetary
          policy would be risky. If borrowers have weak solvency –if at all- or there are few sector
          with viable investment opportunities, then banks are being rational in denying them credit,
          hence expanding the money supply may run the risk of increasing the fragility of the
          financial sector, creating speculative bubbles and driving up inflation especially when
          combined with policy directives to boost credit.
         Lastly, if banks are involuntarily holding excess liquidity (potentially because of asymmetric
          information or an underdeveloped bond market), then the most appropriate response is to
          tackle these inefficiencies directly to allow the credit market to function more smoothly.

   Mapping Nepal neatly within this typology is hard because these factors are likely to be
simultaneously at play. Little is known about the true health of the financial sector and credit
growth, though slower, has far from collapsed.

What to do in the short term?

    The response of the monetary authorities to date has been muted. In the face of large
remittance inflows and persistent inflationary pressures the NRB has adopted a muted response,
clearly displaying reluctance to face the cost of sterilization in terms of credit and economic growth.
Massive inward remittances are sustaining a large current account surplus, reflected in the buildup
of net foreign assets. At the same time, food prices have remained high despite an improved
agricultural production outlook. The NRB’s response to date has involved a delicat e balancing act
between maintaining a relatively loose monetary policy to support credit growth while preventing
the buildup of ‘excessive’ liquidity through ad hoc interventions.

         On the one hand the NRB has deliberately not fully sterilized the reserves build-up leading
          to low interest rates and a widening spread vis-à-vis Indian rates.
         On the other hand it has acted – with increased frequency- to drain off the excess via
          reverse repo and open market operation, to contain inflationary pressures in the face of
          weak credit growth.
Box 3: Reverse repo and open market operations: Basic definitions


  Both instruments are used to decrease the money supply in the economy
  Reverse repo: The Central Bank agrees to borrow money from commercial given them a vehicle to
  park their funds with the NRB, thereby decreasing the supply of money in the market. However this is
  only a temporary absorption of money (i.e. for the duration of the loan)
  Outright sales auctions: The Central Bank sells government securities and thus withdraws money over
  the longer term.

   The NRB appears to have adopted a wait and see position, to gauge whether demand for
credit will pick up. The decision of the NRB to maintain loose monetary policy is presumably
premised on the belief that:
     -    Inflationary pressures are in fact manageable because driven mainly by food prices, energy
          prices and the value of the rupee (i.e. all largely exogenous) and much less so by domestic
          credit growth, while
     -    Sound pent up demand for credit exists which either (i) requires more time to materialize
          and/or (ii) has been prevented by excessive conservatism on behalf of banks.


                                                                    43
This strategy, however, has the potential to be risky, on at least two counts:

    -   First, much is still unknown about the true health of Nepal’s financial sector and a
        better diagnostic is needed. While officially reported/recorded problem loans represent a
        modest 3.8% of the total, ever-greening is believed to be widespread, partly as a result of
        policy. Currently, the quality of outstanding loans is assessed essentially on the basis of
        “past due days”, which is particularly prone to missing (and perhaps encouraging) ever-
        greening of bad loans2. Moreover, the decision to suspend dividend payments in institutions
        reporting NPLs over 5% may have prompted bank managers to underreport and
        constituted in fact a disincentive to adequate and transparent risk assessment – possibly
        driving a wedge between the NRB’s assessment of BFI health and the institutions’ own
        understanding of their risks.

    Therefore, in the short term the NRB should carry out an in depth review of weaknesses of BFIs
    and build its capacity to provide effective supervision. With support from DfID and in preparation
    for the Second Financial Sector Stability Development Policy Credit, the NRB has started carrying
    out an in depth review of BFI balance sheets, which will shed light on the extent of these
    problems. Over time banks and the NRB should also move increasingly toward carrying out Asset
    Quality Reviews so that the assessment of overall portfolio health and decisions on new loans
    should be made on the basis of detailed analysis of the borrower’s repayment capacity (rather
    than history).

    -   Second, additional policy measure to fix the spread between deposit and lending
        rates and direct lending toward deprived and “priority” sectors may compromise
        both the objective of restoring balance sheet health and allowing sound demand for
        credit to be met. Of specific concern are (i) the establishment of a margin cap (of 5
        percentage points between deposit and lending rates) designed to protect customers, and
        (ii) requirements for banks to lend to deprived sectors. The margin cap, affects both the
        ability of banks to rebuild balance sheet strength and to use price mechanisms to
        discriminate between good and bad demand for loans. The requirement to lend to deprived
        sectors has translated in commercial banks’ lending to class D and cooperatives, which are
        poorly regulated and often unable themselves to find appropriate destinations for their
        funds.

    Therefore, in the short term the NRB may want to reconsider such policy initiatives that affect the
    ability of the market to allocate credit efficiently through price signals

 In principle the number of overdue days provides a simple, objective benchmark for asset quality but in the case of
Nepal there is some evidence that banks do not ‘play by the rules’ and, in the absence of strong superv ision, trade
each other’s bad loans booking them as fresh credit.

Box 4: Ever-greening: lipstick on a pig?


  It is quite common, and in fact appropriate, for banks to revisit the original terms of a loan when corporate
  clients that are in fact solvent are faced with a temporary liquidity shortage. In Nepal however this
  practice has been largely indiscriminate and unrelated to an assessment of borrowers’ ultimate
  repayment capacity.
   Ever-greening refers to such practices whereby banks extend new loans to customers to allow them to
  remain current on obligations from previous (bad loans), motivated solely by the objective to avoid
  provisioning charges (that would be deducted from capital). As a result bank balance sheets appear
  healthier than they really are (because the quality of loans is essentially measured in relation to default on
  payments due but artificially so).
  In a recent statement, warning banks against engaging in such practices, Reserve Bank of India Governor
  Raghuram Rajan said that one ‘can put lipstick on a pig but it doesn’t become a princess’.

In the short run, therefore, it might make sense for the NRB to

          Closely monitor the evolution of bank balance sheets and new loans and stand ready
           to tighten monetary conditions. Given the relatively favorable macroeconomic outlook
           (and particularly the absence of recessionary risks), Nepal is in a fortunate position that it
           can afford to be relatively conservative in its monetary policy stance. In other words, tighter
           monetary policy is unlikely to feed into a vicious recessionary circle (where lower credit
           depresses output, which leads banks to be even more cautious, which depresses output
           further). In coming months the NRB should pay close attention to both the volume of
           private sector credit growth and its quality. The impact of credit expansion on inflation and
           financial sector health will depend a lot on the quality of underlying projects. Of particular
           importance will be the evolution of the housing market. So far growth of credit in this sector
           has been biased toward home loans relative to developments indicating that banks remain
           cautious. However any indication that credit remains constrained over time or that it may
           be feeding speculative ventures would call for tighter monetary conditions.
          Reconsider the proposed cap on interest rate margins. The proposed cap on interest
           spreads is consistent with growth objectives but possibly detrimental to stability goals as
           well as to the objective of extending access to finance (which is was ostensibly meant to
           promote).

    In the medium run, the NRB may want to consider developing (and/or making explicit) a
clear strategy for action with adequate tools to manage excess liquidity. The NRB should
develop its toolkit to deal with excess liquidity in a way that provides clarity and stability with
respect to goals (inflation and growth) and adopt corresponding targets for bank liquidity and
interest rates.

Clarify monetary policy objectives and expand the available monetary policy tool kit in the face of
structural excess liquidity


                                                       45
        In Nepal, the large buildup of liquidity in the system reflects to a large extent
structural push factors. While excess liquidity can result from temporary shocks, in Nepal this is
increasingly a structural feature of the economy. The phenomenal and sustained rise in inward
remittances and corresponding buildup of net foreign assets –other things equal- is steadily
growing the money base. At the same time this overall steady rise is combined with short term
fluctuations driven by remittances and asset bubbles (and their bursting), which discourage
investors from making long term investments (due to the un-predictability of funding) and bank
lending (due to the unpredictability of supply of credit).
        The instruments deployed so far by the NRB are well suited for handling such inflows
in the short term but not for strategically managing them over time. The NRB has acted with
increasing frequency in FY14 to absorb excess liquidity in the system via reverse repo and open
market operations (outright sale auctions) but these are short term fixes, in fact more typically
used for fine tuning purposes -to smooth the interest rate fluctuations caused by temporary
variations in liquidity- than for long term management. As such they are different from so called
structural operations that are used to adjust a central bank’s long term position vis-à-vis the
financial sector.

    In order to manage liquidity predictably and efficiently over the long run, the use of
dedicated instruments may become necessary. While open market and reverse repo operations
may be suited to fine tune liquidity management they are ill adapted to manage liquidity in the face
of persistent and large pressures stemming from the inflow of remittances. The result is high
interest rate volatility and lack of clarity –on the side of market players- on medium to long term
prospects (possibly fueling excessive holding of liquidity).

   -   The NRB may consider formulating an explicit strategy for managing excess liquidity: that
       strategy should make explicit how credit growth and inflation control objectives are traded
       off against one another and reflect that position in targets for overall bank liquidity
   -   The NRB should develop new instruments to effectively and strategically manage excess
       liquidity. Given the sustained nature of inward remittances and the GoN’s commitment to
       the peg (when a flexible exchange rate would automatically act to correct external
       imbalances) ad hoc mopping up of liquidity may (i) not be sufficient to absorb the very large
       inflows, nor (ii) provide the level of predictability that is needed for the market to function
       effectively.
            o This would involve developing longer term treasury bonds explicitly issued to
               absorb excess liquidity. The proposed ‘sterilization bonds’ would have longer
               maturities although at the cost of higher interest rates. In fact this has been the path
               followed by India when, in 2003, it introduced a new scheme known as the Market
               Stabilization Scheme to sterilize liquidity absorption spurred by large external
               capital inflows via issuance of additional T-Bills and securities. (Box 5). An additional
               benefit would be the development of capital markets with greater ability for market
               players to develop a yield curve.
            o In parallel, the NRB could consider introducing an interest rate corridor to limit
               volatility above or below a desired / targeted level. This would be done by setting a
               floor rate (through a deposit facility) as well as a ceiling rate (lending facility).

Box 5: The Use of Sterilization Bonds in Asia


  In the wake of the Asian Crisis, a number of Asian economies have accumulated large FX reserves to sustain exchange
  rate regimes, leading to large increases in their balance sheets. In order to maintain monetary stability central banks
  have resorted to sterilization through non-market and market based approaches. Among the latter sterilization bonds –
  mostly the sale of own securities by CBs- have been increasingly popular and seen as a way to deepen local bond
  markets and develop a yield curve while avoiding the negative impact of non-market measures on financial
  intermediation.

  In Korea, “Monetary stabilization bills” were issued for the first time in 1961 and used as the primary method to remove
  excess liquidity, reaching an amount equivalent to 20% of GDP in 2005.

  China issued central bank bills, alongside other instruments (including reserve requirements, open market operations,
  etc.) beginning in 2003. In China market based issuance has also been combined with targeted issuance to specific
  commercial banks experiencing abundant liquidity and fast credit growth.

  While the Reserve Bank of India is not allowed to issue its own securities a new instrument was created in 2004, namely
  the “Market Stabilization Scheme” – or government treasury bonds and medium-term dated securities used solely for
  sterilization purposes (with the proceeds from the auction placed on a separate cash account).

  Adapted from: Aaron Mehrotra “On the Use of Sterilization Bonds in Emerging Asia” BIS paper No66



        In the medium run, given the cost of sterilization, the best option is to tackle the
inefficiencies that are at the source of involuntary or ‘excessive’ of liquidity. While developing
the toolset needed for effective liquidity management, the GoN should carry out structural reforms
to improve the overall credit environment and the investment climate to make sure that banks can
expand lending in a sustainable and safe manner to viable investments.

PART II: EXPANDING THE REACH AND THE EFFICIENCY OF CREDIT MARKETS
The Central Bank’s policy stance is consistent with the interpretation that commercial banks are
excessively cautious in their credit allocation decisions and thus simultaneously restricting the
economy’s growth potential and hurting customers by maintaining high spreads between deposit and
lending rates. Specific policy measures, such as the proposed cap on interest rate spreads and directed
lending to deprived sectors and priority sectors are meant to correct such market inefficiencies.
However they run the risk of introducing additional distortions and should be evaluated carefully.
Moreover such interventions are at best ‘second best’ while a more sustainable option would be to
improve the ability of the market to function efficiently.

The section below contains recommendations on how such an agenda could be pursued to improve
access to finance, release under-exploited economic potential and help banks diversify their risk.

     Access to finance is broad by some measures but limited in fact for specific categories of clients
                          (households and firms) and in practice under-exploited.

       Nepal’s financial sector has been growing rapidly, and in most respect access to
financial services compares favorably to other low income country peers. The aggregate
amount of deposits, credit and number of branches and ATMs has been increasing steadily over the
past few years. Deposits and credit are 65% and 55% of GDP respectively, somewhat higher than
the South Asia averages and exceeding the predicted value for a country of Nepal’s GDP per capita
and population, by a significant margin. Accessibility in general has improved: the number of BFI
branches per 100,000 adults in Nepal has doubled from 3 in 2004 to 8 in 2012.
Figure 24: Access to finance indicators

         Nonetheless significant gaps remain in the coverage of financial services, both in
terms of access and effective use. Access gaps are most acute in the more remote and
geographically isolated parts of the country, which as of yet remain underserved by formal financial
institutions. Despite the relatively large deposit base, financial services are concentrated among the
urban and male population. Of the urban population, 51% has a bank account, compared to 22% of
the rural adult population. Similarly, a persistent gender gap exists: while about 30% of Nepali
adult males have a bank account, only 21% of females do. Moreover, access to deposit accounts
does not necessarily mean that they are used for savings. An average of 18% of adults in Nepal save
money, but only 10% do so at a formal financial institution, and most of the savings are intended for
emergencies (Figure 25).
Figure 25: Household savings behavior

A large fraction of household borrowing occurs outside of the formal sector. Some 11% of loans come from a formal
financial institution (Table 2) – a proportion higher than the South Asia average (9%) but still low. Most of
household borrowing comes from informal sources such as friends and family (33%) or other private lenders
(19%), well above the South Asia average.

         Access to finance is a major and worsening constraint for firms, particularly small
and medium enterprises (SMEs). Some 40% of firms recently surveyed in the World Bank’s
Enterprise Survey 2013 considered access to finance to be a major or severe obstacle to their
operations, significantly higher than the 5% reported in 2009. This proportion is also higher than
reported by firms in regional peer countries (Figure 26). While the percentage of firms with a
checking or savings account has increased from 2009 to 2013, the share of firms with a line of
credit or loan has fallen in the same time period. Compared to their regional peers, large Nepali
firms have very favorable access to credit – in large part due to the close affiliations between
industrial groups and banks. All the large firms surveyed in Nepal’s Enterprise Survey had a
checking or savings account, and 84% had a loan or line of credit. However, although 85% of SMEs
have a savings or checking account, only around 35% had a loan or line of credit from a financial
institution in 2013 due to the higher collateral requirements for SMEs (mostly in the form of fixed
assets of the owner of the enterprise).

       Retail electronic payments and innovative delivery channels such as e-banking and
mobile banking are only slowly gaining traction. As of yet, Nepali customers rely primarily on
conventional delivery channels. Over 75% of adult Nepali withdraw their money through
conventional branch tellers, while over 81% deposit their money by the same way. The use of ATMs
is low – only 1% of adults in Nepal deposit money through ATM, while almost 12% withdraw
money through ATMs, a proportion lower compared to Pakistan (32%) or Sri Lanka (15%). Banks
in Nepal are taking various initiatives for retail electronic payments in the spheres of internet and
mobile banking, cross-border inward remittances and cards.
The authorities have actively promoted improved access to finance but there are shortcomings to the
                                         current approach

        The Government of Nepal (GoN) and the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) strongly recognize
the importance of the financial sector in advancing economic growth and poverty reduction.
The authorities have taken an active interest in promoting access to finance and financial inclusion.
Over time, the strategic direction of the policy package has undergone marked changes. In recent
years, the Nepali authorities have moved away from a strategy centered on liberal licensing policies
(Box 6) toward more interventionist administrative measures.

Box 6: Licensing, market structure and financial development


In the past, the NRB has pursued a liberal bank licensing policy, which set the stage for the entry of a
large number of new financial institutions. The liberal licensing policy has promoted entry of many
smaller financial institutions - attracted by the prospect of high dividend pay-outs-, particularly in the B and C
categories. The banking system now comprises 31 class A banks (i.e. regular commercial banks), 86 class B
banks (i.e. development banks) and 59 class C banks (i.e. finance companies). Although there are differences
in permissible activities and prudential requirements, particularly minimum required capital, all categories
are allowed to accept deposits from the public.
The common perception is that the liberal bank licensing policy has fallen short of expectations in
terms of financial deepening and access to finance. The entry of new players has had only limited impact
in terms of motivating banks to venture out of the narrow readily bankable sector of the economy. As a
consequence, the upper end of the market (i.e. the large corporates) has become more crowded, while a
significant portion of the economy remains seriously underserved by the financial system. Liberal licensing
has also contributed to the emergence of a fragmented banking structure, with many banks, particularly in
the B and C classes, that appear too small to be professionally run and remain commercially viable. A
moratorium for new licenses has been in effect for class A, B and C banks since 2011.
There are indications that the fragmented market structure of Nepal’s banking system may be
inefficient from a financial development point of view. When viewed in comparison with peer countries,
the lending-deposit spread appears to be below the averages for regional and income group peers. The
picture that emerges from a detailed decomposition of the lending-deposit spread for class A banks is that
there is considerable variety in terms of deposit rates (i.e. funding costs), but that lending rates are fairly
uniform across the board. It appears that size is associated with lower funding costs and higher efficiency, as
is illustrated by the lower overheads of the larger private banks. These efficiency gains are however not or
only partially channeled through to the end users as larger banks also have higher profit shares. The state-
controlled class A banks are a notable exception to this pattern. Their funding costs are among the lowest in
the sector, but their overheads and provisions are among the highest in the sector. The low funding costs
plausibly reflect widespread expectations among depositors and other liability holders of implicit state
support. The high overhead costs reflect large and unionized workforce, lack of automation and an ongoing
restructuring agenda while the high provisions reflect a diminishing but still high exposure to non-
performing assets. As a consequence, the state-controlled class A banks have the highest lending-deposit
spreads in the sector in large part due to their inefficiencies.
The liberal licensing policy remains in force for the so-called class D financial institutions. Class D
financial institutions comprise entities engaged in microfinance activities, covering a diverse set of financial
NGOs (FINGOs), a limited number of cooperatives, microfinance development banks and regional rural
development banks (MFIs) that are regulated by the NRB. In fact, the NRB is encouraging Class D institutions
to set-up in under-served areas by fast-tracking licensing for Class D institutions in 22 districts. Currently,
there are 35 MFIs, 33 FINGOs and 15 cooperatives licensed by NRB. While the NRB supervises a limited
number of cooperatives, the vast majority of cooperatives fall under the auspices of the Department of
Cooperatives (DoC).




                                                               52
The Nepali authorities have been actively promoting access to financial services through a
wide range of (i) institutions, (ii) policies and (iii) funds and subsidized credit schemes.
The Nepali authorities have pushed the access to finance agenda by directly assuming
ownership in a variety of financial institutions:
       Regional Rural Development Banks (Grameen Bank replicators3): Purbanchal, Sudur
        Pashchimancal, Pashchimanchal, Madhya Pashchimanchal and Madhyamanchal Grameen
        Bikas Banks were established in 1992 to bring the rural population into the formal financial
        channel and to channel micro-credit to micro-industries, agro business and trading among
        others in the rural area. In October 2012, it was decided to merge the five banks and form a
        national level development bank, although the merger has not yet taken place. Four
        Grameen replicator banks are insolvent, have high NPLs (unlike the rest of the sector), high
        operating costs, low productivity and unionized labor.
       National Cooperative Bank Limited (NCBL): The NCBL was established in 2003, as the
        only umbrella bank in the cooperative movement of Nepal to provide banking and financial
        services to all cooperatives. It was established under the Cooperative Act, 1992 (first
        amendment, 2000) and received a banking permit from NRB. The GoN has a small equity
        ownership of NPR10 million. The bank works with 6,309 member cooperatives in 72 out of
        75 districts.
       The Small Farmers’ Development Bank is a government-owned apex institution that
        channels funds to farmer cooperatives to be on-lent to small farmers. It is categorized as a
        “D” class bank. Besides providing funds to cooperatives and MFIs, it also supervises its
        client cooperatives’ and MFIs’ activities to ascertain adherence to prudential regulations
        and provides technical and capacity building assistance to its client institution.
       State-controlled banks: The three class A state-controlled banks – Rastriya Banijya Bank
        (RBB), Agriculture Development Bank Limited (ADBL), Nepal Bank Limited (NBL) – account
        for 22% of class A banks total assets, 20% of deposits, and 18% of lending. The state also
        owns NIDC Development Bank, a class B bank. These state-controlled banks do not have a
        specific developmental mandate but do provide certain public services 4 , and as a
        consequence have been competing with each other and against private banks.
       The NRB has introduced several new policies aimed at reallocating banking credit
    towards underserved productive sectors, and lowering the cost of credit, in addition to
    pre-existing deprived sector lending targets:
       Deprived Sector Lending: The policy has been in place since the 1990s, whereby NRB
        mandates that a percentage of the total loan portfolio of banks and financial institutions
        (BFIs) be lent to the “deprived sector”, defined as “low income and especially socially
        backward women, tribes, lower caste, blind, hearing impaired and physically handicapped
        persons, marginal and small farmers, craft-men, labor and landless families”. Currently,

3 These are microfinance institutions (MFIs) modelled after the Grameen Bank model of uncollateralized
group lending. There is one bank for each region of the country. The five banks fall in the class D category.
4 RBB and NBL are the main agents of the government for expenditure disbursements and revenue collection.

They also claim to be promoters of access to finance in remote areas. ADBL and NIDC were originally
established to focus on agriculture and manufacturing respectively.

                                                     53
        4.5%, 4%, and 3.5% of Class, A, B and C banks’ loan portfolios respectively have to be lent to
        this sector.
       Productive Sector Lending: the NRB has issued new regulation requiring class A
        institutions to lend 20% of their portfolio to agriculture, energy, tourism, cottage and small
        industries (of which 12% has to be lent to agriculture and energy) by mid-July 2015.5 The
        NRB has also directed development banks and finance companies to raise the level of their
        lending to the productive sector to 15% and 10% respectively by mid-2016.
       Cap on the deposit-lending spread: The NRB has issued directives instituting a cap of 5
        percentage points of the interest rate spread of class A banks. The NRB has directed all
        class A banks to reduce their interest rate spread to 5pp to curb the increasing gap in the
        interest rate the borrowers have to pay and the interest rate depositors get.
       Cap on fees and commissions: The NRB is also drafting a regulation to restrict the ability
        of BFIs to charge fees and commissions, in order to lower the cost of financial services. This
        is considered a pre-emptive move so that BFIs don’t start charging more fees and
        commissions to compensate for loss in the income from reducing the interest rate spread.
        NRB is preparing to instruct the banks to reduce fees for cards, collateral evaluation and
        insurance, and stop charging fees on inactive accounts and is seen as move towards seeking
        more transparency from the banks.
       Branch Expansion Policy: NRB has instituted a branch expansion policy where a bank or
        financial institution must establish three branches outside the Kathmandu valley to open a
        branch inside Kathmandu valley (an increase from two branches outside the valley in the
        previous policy). These three branches should include at least one branch in one of the 14
        under-served districts designated by the NRB 6 , one branch outside any district
        headquarters or municipality, and one branch as per the bank’s own interest outside the
        Kathmandu valley. NRB accords a priority to open branches outside the ring-road or in the
        VDCs inside Kathmandu valley.
       Branch Expansion Loan: the NRB is offering a 6-month interest free loan to BFIs to open
        branches in 22 remote districts, and no prior approval is needed from the NRB to open
        these branches. For Class D institutions, up to NPR. 2 million at zero interest; for Class A, B,
        and C institutions, loans of up to NPR 5 million for opening branches in headquarters of
        those districts and NPR 10 million for expanding branches outside district headquarters.
   Finally various public sector agencies are involved in the subsidization of a diverse set of
credit schemes


5 Productive sector lending comprises (i) agriculture lending that goes to sectors such as cash crops, tea,
coffee, tobacco, fruits and floriculture, livestock, bee keeping, fertilizer and pesticide enterprises, cold stores,
irrigation and fishery, among others., (ii) lending to the energy sector including hydropower and renewable
energy projects, (iii) tourism, covering trekking, travel agencies, mountaineering, rafting, camping, resorts,
hotels and recreational activities, and (iv) cottage and small industries refers to industries having a fixed
capital of less than Rs 30 million.

6The underserved districts are: Bhojpur, Okhaldhunga, Manang, Rukum, Salyan, Jumla, Mugu, Humla, Kalikot,
Dolpa, Jajarkot, Bajhang, Bajura and Darchula.

      The Rural Self-Reliance Fund (RSRF) is an apex fund that provides wholesale credit at
       relatively low interest rates to cooperatives, FINGOs, MFIs, and ADBL operating in rural
       areas. It was set up in 1991 by the NRB and the government of Nepal to ease credit access to
       self-entrepreneurs, cottage industries and SMEs to help in the reduction of poverty in the
       country. It can extend wholesale loans to cooperatives and NGOs working as financial
       intermediaries and long term wholesale loans to MFIs and Agriculture Development Bank
       Limited. The borrowers should be based in rural areas and priority should be given to the
       areas that fall in the poverty map created by the National Planning Commission.
      The Youth Self-Employment Fund (YSEF) is managed by Ministry of Finance (MOF), and
       is funded by a one-time loan from a third of the deprived sector lending requirement in
       2010. It was set up to facilitate self-employment programs, and providing orientation,
       vocational and skills development training to the unemployed youths. YSEF helps provide
       collateral free loan up to NPR 200,000 for an individual and up to NPR 5,000,000 for a
       group (max. 25 people) at low interest rate to run commercial farming, agro-based industry
       or service oriented self-employment programs. If the payment of interest and the loan is
       made on time, YSEF reimburses 60% of the interest amount.
      Credit guarantee schemes: The Deposit and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DCGC) has a
       twin mandate of deposit insurance and credit guarantees. The credit guarantee component
       offers three schemes: livestock insurance, SME credit guarantee and a Microfinance credit
       guarantee. The SME credit guarantee scheme has very little uptake, due to the settlement
       mechanism where the guarantee can only be invoked once the SME loan is declared non-
       performing, a process which takes more than a year. The Microfinance credit guarantee
       scheme is somewhat more used. However both schemes are subject to adverse selection
       and high transaction costs because they are not portfolio-based.
  The policies currently implemented or envisaged imply tangible risks in terms of effectiveness, un-
                                  intended distortions and stability

        A lot has been achieved in Nepal to expand the frontier of outreach but much remains
to be done. Although the GoN and the NRB have initiated many programs and policies, they do not
amount to an overall strategy and coherent approach towards access to finance. Policies,
regulations and laws, introduced to enhance access to finance do not seem to be founded on
evidence-based analysis of the underlying problems or an appreciation of best practices from other
countries. Also, there is little monitoring as to whether policies have achieved their intended
purpose.
        The current set of policies raises several serious concerns in terms of effectiveness,
and distortionary side effects. The combination of deprived and productive sector targets with
the envisaged introduction of the cap on the deposit-lending spread imply restrictions on banks’
room to maneuver through both prices and quantities. Of particular concern is the channeling of
large amounts of funding through deprived sector lending, which may discourage eligible MFIs
from developing products and targeting clients beyond those specified in the policy, leaving a
segment of the market unserved by formal financial institutions. In addition, the interest rate
spread cap could also prove counterproductive, as it likely induces banks to reduce their exposures
to sectors that carry a higher interest rate. Among the sectors likely to be affected are SMEs and

                                                  55
long term finance – precisely two segments that are currently underserved by the banking system.
Lastly, restrictions on banks from charging fees in mobile banking will likely dissuade them from
investing in innovative delivery channels, due to the inability to recoup their investment costs –
although such channels hold significant promise for expanding outreach in the geographically
remote areas of the country.
         Current policies are also associated with a series of stability risks. To comply with the
deprived sector requirements, class A, B and C banks are building up a significant exposure to not
only class D financial institutions, but also to the largely unregulated cooperative sector which is
known to be problematic. The deprived sector targets may be leading to an oversupply of credit to
the bottom of the pyramid, possibly setting the stage for an Andhra Pradesh type microfinance
crisis, with incipient signs of personal indebtedness.
        The introduction of the 5pp intermediation spread would impact the banking sector’s
capacity to internally rebuild capital buffers through earnings. It is common knowledge that
banks in Nepal frequently “evergreen” non-performing assets. As a consequence, banks are not
setting aside the necessary provisions, which leads to a potentially serious overstatement of
reported capital adequacy figures. It is unknown which banks are most impacted. The diagnostic
review that is to take place later this year should bring greater clarity to the true financial state of
the banking system. However, preliminary evidence suggests that the true capital adequacy for the
banking sector could be significantly lower than reported. The introduction of a fixed
intermediation spread could therefore squeeze profitability at a time when there is a likely need to
rebuild capital through earnings.
         In part, these problems are symptomatic of the obfuscation of promotion and
prudential responsibilities, with the former taking precedence over the latter. This is also
illustrated in the mandate of the NRB’s class D supervisory department, which explicitly includes
regulatory as well as promotional activities. Similar issues affect the DoC that considers itself both
promoter and regulator of the cooperatives under its purview. Typically, the promotional activities
take precedence over the regulatory responsibilities.
 What needs to be done? Strengthen the enabling environment for the market to operate smoothly
                                        and efficiently.

        The difficulties that Nepal is experiencing in terms of limited reach of the financial
system and the high cost of finance are, to a large degree, typical for low income countries. At
a fundamental level, the lack of depth and the high costs of finance reflect a series of structural
weaknesses in the overall lending environment that exacerbate information asymmetries between
lenders and borrowers. The sectors that are typically underserved by the financial system,
particularly SMEs and households, are among the most impacted.
       To minimize the need for potentially distortionary policies and let the markets
allocate credit efficiently the emphasis should be to strengthen the enabling environment.
Administrative measures to influence the amount and cost of credit to underserved sectors does
not address the root causes. Put differently, the current set of policies target the symptoms of
deeper structural weaknesses, rather than addressing the issues at the very root. Specific areas of


                                                  56
action would include: improving the credit information bureau (CIB) and implementing the long-
overdue secured transactions framework.
        Financial infrastructure improvements reduce the information asymmetry that
constrains access to credit and raise the costs and risk of financial intermediation. CIB’s
information is only collected quarterly, above an NPR 1 million (US$ 10,000) threshold, thereby
excluding exactly those smaller borrowers that stand most to gain.7 Many banks reportedly do not
meet these requirements without penalty, undermining the quality of information. In addition, the
lack of a unique identifier means that verification of information is time-consuming and prone to
error.
        The implementation of a secured transactions framework and collateral registries
could make the use of collateral more feasible, particularly the kind of lower value movable
collateral that is more suited to microenterprise loans. The Secured Transactions Act has been in
place since 2006 but has not yet been implemented. The law provides for the establishment of a
Registrar’s Office, and the operation of an electronic registry, which is pending. Banks have
reported numerous cases of multiple charges on the same movable collateral. This has resulted in
many disputes, prolonging debt enforcement, and explains the over-collateralization of loans and
the over-reliance on immovable collateral.
       To advance innovations in retail electronic payments in the spheres of internet and
mobile banking, cross-border inward remittances and cards, it is an urgent priority to establish
interoperability of cards, switches and mobile payments, as well as to incentivize other innovations.
        In addition, weaknesses in the debt enforcement and insolvency framework weigh
heavily on the lending environment. Although the passage of new laws has helped to improve the
regulation of NPLs, there are several inconsistencies between the various pieces of regulation,
creating confusion amongst creditors, and leading to time-consuming court disputes. Also, the 5
specialized Commercial Benches of the Court of Appeal are typically ill-prepared to deal with
matters pertaining to companies law in large part due to the very short tenure of the judges. As a
consequence, there is poor continuity in knowledge and weak uniformity of judgments. The
effectiveness of the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT), which is used by both secured and unsecured
creditors, is compromised by onerous threshold requirements, and time consuming proceedings,
reducing the likelihood of creditor recovery. While the enactment of the Insolvency Act 2006 was
an important landmark, providing the legal framework for corporate liquidations and
restructurings, liquidations under the Act are rare and those that take place are excessively long.
       Complementing these improvements in the enabling environment, there is also
substantial scope for making markets work better. While the outcomes of the spread
decomposition analysis point to an imperfect functioning of markets, these should be addressed by
strengthening the preconditions for markets to function. This points to a need to establish a more
robust competition authority8 and but also to enhance transparency in the disclosure of the

  The Competition Promotion and Market Protection Act was enacted in 2007 and a Board was set-up, but it is
either weak or non-functioning.

effective cost of financial services in an environment characterized by low levels of financial
literacy. This could be done by designing a methodology to calculate, disclose and monitor the cost
of basic financial products in a standardized and comparable manner for typical user-groups. These
measures could usefully complement newly introduced transparency and disclosure guidelines,
and would be helpful in enabling consumers to make educated financial decisions by facilitating the
comparison between different providers and similar types of financial products. Similarly, to
promote true competition in loan pricing, the practice by banks of charging prepayment penalties
for regular loans could be restricted so that consumers can more easily switch between various
suppliers.
        Overall it would make sense to restore the balance between stability and
development objectives of policy. A natural goal for any policy framework aimed at improving
financial access is to maximize, on a sustainable basis, the availability to as wide a range of users as
possible of suitable financial products at affordable prices. It is equally crucial, however, to ensure
that policies to improve access do not compromise soundness and stability of the financial system.
        Until the liquidity crisis of 2011, developmental objectives appear to have taken
precedence over stability. However, even the more recent set of policies aimed at strengthening
access to finance, could potentially lead to a steady build-up of risks in various parts of the financial
system. These challenges justify a recalibration of the policy stance, and likely require a stronger
separation between potentially conflicting regulatory and promotional mandates. More specific
measures to reconsider include (i) the discontinuation of the liberal licensing policy for class D
financial institutions, (ii) the deprived sector lending targets, which lead to the build-up of
exposures of the banking system to risky and under-regulated cooperatives, and which has set the
stage for a microfinance credit boom, and (iii) the cap on the intermediation spread which could
limit bank profits and affect the ability of banks to provision adequately and build their capital.
         Lastly, it would be helpful to adopt a more structured and strategic approach to
public policy interventions aimed at strengthening access to finance. The starting point for
public policy should be a thorough gap analysis, explicitly specifying in detail the unmet demand for
financial services (i.e. “market failure”). The assessment should then inform policies aimed at
strengthening the provision of suitable financial products at affordable prices. Cost and benefit of
new policies should be assessed systematically and built around the strategic priorities emerging
from the gap analysis. New measures should be subjected to a more rigorous impact assessment,
while the effectiveness of existing measures should be assessed periodically. The different
institutions, programs, policies and directives also need to be analyzed and reviewed collectively, to
eliminate contradictions and unintended side-effects. The upcoming Financial Sector Development
Strategy (FSDS) provides a window of opportunity for developing a more coherent and effective
access to finance framework.
