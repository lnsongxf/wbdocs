Introduction and key findings

1.1 Background and objectives
In the wake of the food price crisis of 2008, rising commodity prices and the collapse
of financial markets caused a significant increase in private sector interest in agricul-
tural investment. It raised international concern that agricultural investment involving
large-scale land acquisition could have negative impacts on local communities. On the
other hand, it was recognized that there may be the potential for positive impacts from
such investments. The gaps in knowledge on the overall effects of such investments
prompted the need to examine this topic. In light of this, endorsed by the UN General
Assembly, G8 and G20, the Inter-Agency Working Group (IAWG) was set up by FAO,
IFAD, UNCTAD and the World Bank in 2009. The IAWG was tasked to examine
this topic in order to improve understanding of the impacts of such investment and
to provide broader recommendations on the appropriate conduct of “responsible”
agricultural investment.

Through this programme, the IAWG has sought to distill and disseminate the les-
sons from past and current agricultural investments to understand what works and
what does not work for host countries, local communities, investors, and other par-
ties impacted by agricultural investments (Box 1.1). The lessons emerging from this
body of work have supported and informed a set of responsible investment principles,
including but not limited to the Committee on World Food Security (2015).1

Under the umbrella of the IAWG programme, UNCTAD and the World Bank con-
ducted a study and reported the findings in “The Practice of Responsible Investment Prin-
ciples in Larger-Scale Agricultural Investments: Implications for Corporate Performance and Impact
on Local Communities (UNCTAD and World Bank, 2014).” That study was based on a
field survey of agricultural investors, local communities and other stakeholders. First-
hand information was obtained through on-site 240 interviews with 550 stakeholders

Notes: (a) A previous land user refers to a local stakeholder who utilized the land for cultivation or cattle and grazing purposes. Displaced people are considered under the category resettled people.
(b) Supplier/Customer refers to any local stakeholder with regular direct sales such as supplying input to the investor or who is a regular buyer of local produce. Outgrower is separately considered
as outgrower/contract farmer. (c) The characteristics above are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but a principal designator is indicted for each interviewee. (d) Less NGOs were interviewed than

                             the area who otherwise might have migrated to the cities to find a job.

    Outgrower schemes      •	Outgrower schemes were most successful when the business model was defined before outgrowers
                             were introduced.
                           •	A lack of transparency and inclusivity of outgrowers in the pricing mechanisms for their crops hin-
                             dered the successful operation of outgrower schemes.
                           •	Marginalised groups and women, were less likely to participate in outgrower schemes.
                           •	Funding and partnerships with various stakeholders such as local governmental agencies or experienced NGOs played
                             an important role.

          Food Security    •	The main positive contribution to food security was through direct employment and outgrower schemes.
                           •	The main negative aspect was deemed to be through reduced access to land.

    Technology transfer    •	Technology transfer occurred primarily through training, particularly of outgrowers.
                           •	The impact varied substantially from site to site, depending on the business model, crop and other factors.

          Prescreening     •	In many cases, prescreening of foreign investors could be improved to increase the prevalence of

                             which the operation would have developed.
                           •	Large land allocations, particularly to investors introducing new crops, could be fairly risky. Investors
                             could have been required to phase their programmes in stages.
                           •	Some governments had allowed foreign investment in agriculture to proceed at a faster pace than

                               environmental regulations was in most cases inadequate.

            Operating        •	A stable host country operating environment is a key determinant of investors’ success. Sudden, drastic changes in the host

                             •	Unclear land laws create situations of conflict over land rights especially where customary land was concerned.
                             •	Business models with low land needs, such as processing operations, could provide important employ-

                             •	Resettlement processes should be handled adequately, with communication, consultation and transparency about the
                               process for resettlement.
                             •	Clear, transparent procedures to follow and standard valuations for compensation in the case of
                               resettlement could be developed. Adherence needed to be monitored effectively.

                             •	Outgrower schemes could be effective in supporting livelihoods while allowing people to retain their
                               most valuable asset—their land.
                             •	Governments should have considered the whole value chain and promoted the downstream value addi-

                             •	With the arrival of an investment, many communities underwent a period of rapid transition with potential for both
                               positive and negative consequences.
                             •	There could be redistributive effects and a creation of insider-outsider status as some people would benefit from the investment
                               but others may not, and may indeed create difficulties due to impacts such as rising prices.
                             •	The extent of positive economic spillovers from large-scale investments varied widely and depended on the investor’s busi-

                             •	Governments should recognize the risk that the employment benefits may diminish over time as production becomes more mechanized.

         Transparency        •	In general, there was an insufficient amount of publicly available information to ensure the fully
                               transparent and accountable conduct of agricultural investment.

 Technology transfer         •	Technology transfer was by no means an assured benefit.
                             •	Appropriate, proven and customized use of innovation in new crops, business models, and techniques
                               should have been encouraged to reduce risks.
                             •	The types of technology transferred should be contextualized to fit with available levels of finance, skills, equipment or

          Consultations                  •	Representatives of civil society played a useful role in monitoring consultations and could work with
      between investors                    investors to ensure that all relevant communities and stakeholders were included within the consulta-
      and communities                      tion process.
                                         •	There were instances where agreements were not documented, leading to confusion and disputes.
                                           While recognizing a capacity gap, local communities should have ensured that all agreements and
                                           commitments made through consultations wee documented.
                                         •	Investors said it was easier to include local communities which were well-organized. NGOs could
                                           assist local communities in this regard.

                 Monitoring              •	Civil society could play a role in monitoring conflicts between investors and stakeholders or instances
                  investors                where an investment was degrading natural resources, e.g., in making those issues public or known to
                                           relevant authorities.
                                         •	Monitoring led to positive outcomes when conducted in a constructive, rather than antagonistic, fashion.

       Engagement with                   •	Civil society could forge partnerships with the private sector to stimulate responsible inclusive invest-
              investors                    ments that gave due consideration to reduction of rural poverty and more equitable benefit sharing
                                           with farmers and the local communities.
                                         •	The most successful social development programmes were those that were done in collaboration with NGOs or other
                                           organizations (e.g., workers unions) who were able to directly connect these programmes with local needs.

          Marginalised                   •	NGOs could play a key role in helping investors to forge partnerships with marginalized groups including women and
       communities and                     youth, for example:
               groups                       help them link with outgrower schemes

         Land rights and                 •	Some NGOs were effective in raising community awareness regarding their rights and how to exer-
            resettlement                   cise them, as well as ensuring that people had a realistic assessment of the value of their land in the

       Rural livelihoods                 •	Civil society could partner with investors to provide trainings such as financial literacy or vocational training, to enable
                                           communities to benefit from new opportunities.

   Technology transfer                   •	Civil society could facilitate partnerships with investors to provide vocational training to assist communities, especially
                                           outgrowers, with the adoption of new technology and inputs.

Chapter Two
Financial And Operational Success
Of Investments
The focus of the IAWG research programme mentioned earlier was to understand
those conditions that best ensure that large-scale agricultural investments maximize
benefits for all stakeholders, particularly surrounding communities, and for the host
economy more broadly. In most cases, a critical prerequisite for a positive contribu-
tion to development is the financial and operational success of the investments them-
selves (UNCTAD and World Bank 2014). Investments that were operating successfully
(from the investor perspective) were more likely to be well perceived by local com-
munities through the relatively positive economic and social impact of the business.
Failing or failed investments, on the other hand, lead to unmet expectations, broken
commitments and underutilized productive resources (including land). In this respect,
agriculture related investments—especially greenfield operations—are challenging,
because there is a gestation period. Even for successful cases there is an inevitable time
delay—stretching into many years—between land preparation, full production7 and
(ultimately) profitable operations.

The most common obstacles to success that investors faced related to the host coun-
try’s operating environment (Section 2.1), access to finance (Section 2.2) and variable
international commodity prices. The last was felt most keenly by local communities.
Price volatility in crop markets, for example induced by weather conditions, was a con-
cern shared by interviewees, especially those working at the investment. The impact of
success or failure of operations on socioeconomic impacts arose principally through
employment generation, business linkages and social development programmes
(Section 2.3).

 For example, it typically takes 3–4 years for a coffee tree to start production. Investors need to consider a potentially
long “no-income” period when they choose perennial crops.

Employment

3.1 Employment generation
Employment is the principal benefit perceived by communities.

In line with the earlier study, employment creation remained a principal benefit that
communities perceived from the presence of an investor, especially in terms of income
and food security aspects when compared with subsistence agriculture. Employees’
perception from investments was overall positive (Figure 3.1) and was also more
positive than the full sample average, but only slightly so, indicating that the overall
positive community perceptions of these investments were not driven by employees’
views alone.

Many investors in the survey generated formal job opportunities in rural communities
for the first time. 60 percent of 54 employees interviewed across all investments for
this supplementary report had no previous formal work experience. For over 80 per-
cent of female employees, the job with the investor was their first experience with
formal employment. Job security and regularity of income were particularly appre-
ciated. Although there were concerns expressed about pay and working conditions,
86 percent of all employees—and all female employees who responded—perceived
themselves to be better off as a result of having a job with the investor (Figure 3.2).

The arrival of an investor creates an expectation of jobs but can under-
mine relations with the local community if these remain unfulfilled.

When jobs generated were lower than expected, community disappointment impacted
negatively on the relationship with the investor. This underscores the importance of
clear and open communication during the consultation process and management of
community expectations, especially when companies face financial difficulties. A sug-
arcane company in the survey promised a local community that the establishment of
a sugar mill would create job opportunities, but after 5 years struggling with access to
finance and low international commodity prices, the jobs had not materialized. Indeed,
employee numbers had fallen between researchers’ first and second visits (Table 3.1).

Chapter Four
Rural development
Investments can have a transformative impact on the communities where they are
located.16 Much of this impact can be long term, and go beyond the immediate activi-
ties of the investors. Employment provides the local community with salaries, which
can be saved and invested to create further opportunities (Section 4.1). Over time,
the local economy also thrives, initially from an expansion in small businesses—
restaurants and other services—to, ultimately, bank branches, agricultural input sup-
pliers, building suppliers and supermarkets (Section 4.2). Additional spillovers occur
when investors, sometimes in addition to government efforts, develop infrastructure
around the investment (Box 4.2).

Spillovers can be negative. For instance, when the presence of an investment leads to a
rise in local prices, including the price of land or the price of products in local shops;
or where investments create a divide and tensions in the local community between
employees who have money to spend and those who find life less affordable.

It is important to recognize that positive spillovers are not automatic: the policies and
practices of the investor and the government influence outcomes (for example, the
capital intensity of production methods, the choice of crops, the use of outgrower
schemes, or investment in education and skills). At the same time, much depends on
local factors; for instance, the potential for knowledge transfer to local smallholder
farmers depends on the latter’s existing capabilities and their ability to learn, absorb
and utilize new knowledge.

4.1 Saving and investment of wages
Salaries create opportunities for people to invest in fixed assets, land
improvements or education.

In the case of a number of agricultural investments visited, they have created oppor-
tunities for the first time in remote areas where few opportunities existed before,

(a) The emphasis is on disproportionate. In general, precautionary savings have positive impacts on people’s lives by making them more financially resilient. However, because of insecure condi-
tions, a lack of knowledge on how to best save and invest for the future (see second bullet under good practices), or the mechanisms to do so, individuals and households may save at a rate which
is undesirable from the broader perspective of the community and economy.

Technology Transfer
The impact of large-scale agricultural investment on rural communities
through technology or skills transfer occurred primarily through training.
The impact was uneven, varying substantially from site to site, depending
on the business model, crop and other factors.

Under the best circumstances, the deployment by farmers of new technology introduced
by investors could allow them over time to move from subsistence to commercial farm-
ing, generating funds that can be reinvested, but this is not always the case and, indeed,
there can also be negative repercussions from technology transfer (Box 5.1).The impact
of large-scale investment through technology transfer was uneven, and at some sites vis-
ited, local farmers felt there has been no transfer of any consequence (including where
outgrower schemes were involved). In other investments, positive technology trans-
fer from investors to the local farming community was reported, taking place mainly
through training of employees and outgrowers, sharing of farming techniques, provi-
sions of inputs (such as seeds, agrochemicals or fertilizers that can raise the productivity
of local farmers), and in limited cases through sharing of tools and machinery.

Investors could open up markets for local farmers by introducing mechanization,
improving access to roads or providing finance. Employees who were also farmers
could apply skills and capital (wages) gained from their job to their own farm.

Knowledge transfer takes place through formal training of local farmers, on-the-job
field training, informal meetings, or through visits to plantations. One of the companies
visited in Ethiopia has developed a “model farmers system” in which the company pro-
vided experts to train local farmers in ways to increase productivity. Training was pro-
vided in collaboration with the local agricultural bureau. So far, some 400 farmers have
benefited from this training, and further plans to develop an outgrower scheme by the
company have already been approved. Visits to the company farm can also be a useful
means for learning: one farmer mentioned that the investor’s farm served as a “demon-
stration to local farmers on how to better utilize fertilizers and agrochemicals.” Farmers
who took part in this training indicated that so far they had learned how to plant maize

Relocation and Resettlement

6.1	 The impact of resettlement
Physically resettled people tended to have the worst perceptions of
investments.

Resettlement and relocation was a significant area of contention in some locations
visited. Whereas across the entire sample, stakeholders mentioned 2.5 positive impacts
for every one negative impact, for resettled persons the ratio was one positive impact
for every negative impact (Figure 6.1). Even those who mentioned positive impacts in
other respects, such as employment or infrastructure, tended to perceive the experi-
ence of resettlement itself as negative.

The impact of resettlement depended on how people perceived their living situation
had changed after the resettlement. Typical grievances from resettled persons were
that the compensation was inadequate or that replacement land was not equivalent
in terms of soil quality and suitability for agriculture. For instance one resettled com-
munity20 voiced their disappointments about the outcome; they claimed that they have
lost their farmland without adequate compensation for their land, that there was no
compensation for their crops, that the replacement land was unsuitable for farming
as it contained dangerous animals and was flood-prone, that the houses constructed
were too small for their families, that their children now had to travel much further to
school, that there is now no interaction with the investor and that they are marginal-
ized and reap no benefits from the presence of the investor, and that many of the com-
munity had given up on the area and moved further away. Those interviewed noted
they were staying because they were getting too old and did not want to move and start
a new life again.

Another particular area of concern was that not sufficient support mechanisms were
provided along with financial compensation. In cases where people received financial
compensation for being resettled, the impact depended substantially on how people use

Environmental Impact

7.1 Perceptions of
    environmental impact
Local people were often insufficiently conscious of environmental degra-
dation. For many this was secondary to improving livelihoods.

The topic of environmental impact was often referred to in stakeholder interviews, but
with a lower level of priority compared to other issues. In spite of the number of stake-
holders who perceived some negative change to the biophysical environment, it was
only occasionally that environmental degradation was strongly felt as a negative issue.
Economic effects seemed to be much more prominent in the minds of local communi-
ties; and environmental conservation (or improvement) tended to be less prioritized.
One government official interviewed was concerned that, “the impact will be observed
in the long term. Thus, so far nothing has happened.” Where environmental concerns
were voiced these were more frequently from community members not directly associ-
ated with the investment (Boxes 7.1 and 7.2). Moreover, since some investments were
established in remote areas to which people moved only after the investor arrived,
concern about environmental degradation has been muted. For example, in Ethiopia
a male worker made the point that, “when this farm started here some years ago it was
a jungle, no one used to live here.”

The most common issues raised were a loss of biodiversity and extensive
use of agrochemicals, including pesticides.

The intensive use of land and natural resources could contribute to conversion of
natural and critical habitats that may lead to a loss of diversity (Figure 7.1). At one
operation visited, local people claimed that poor forest management was causing the
reduction in biodiversity and a drop in wildlife numbers. The area referred to had
been cultivated previously by another investor, but then abandoned and reverted to

  In addition to running community development programmes, investors support other requests and initiatives from
local communities, but this is not always recognized. For example, one company’s support to the local community in

government does not inform the community about the origin of the grant. Thus, many villagers presumed that the
projects are self funded.
