       n the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), the development of a vibrant private sector is essential to fire up the
       engines of economic growth and that, in turn, is necessary to meet the needs and aspirations of the people in the
       region. The formal private sector represents a relatively small part of these economies; nonetheless it has the potential
     to become a powerful driver of job creation and rising living standards in the region. Creating an environment that is con-
     ducive to private sector development depends on a detailed understanding of the key determinants of firm performance
     and the major challenges that firms face, and also the role of government in providing the right business environment.

     This is why three of the leading international institutions active in the MENA region, the European Bank for Reconstruction
     and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank (EIB), and the World Bank Group (WBG) have joined forces
     to produce this report. It presents the results of the MENA Enterprise Surveys (MENA ES) conducted during 2013-2014
     in eight economies: Djibouti, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, the West Bank and Gaza,
     and the Republic of Yemen. By analysing detailed information on more than 6,000 private firms in the manufacturing and
     services sectors, the report provides fine-grained insights into their performance and the business environment in which
     they operate.

     Firms in MENA face many distorting incentives and barriers to competition. On the financing side, many appear to be
     not so much constrained by financing conditions as completely disconnected from the financial sector, thereby forgoing
     opportunities for growth. Workforce skills are another constraint, with a need for the re-orientation of education and
     training, so that workers have greater workplace skill and are prepared for the modern work environment. Enhancing the
     productivity of firms in the region also requires greater openness to international trade, something which will support
     innovation by facilitating the acquisition of knowledge about new products and processes.

     In 2015, the EIB, the EBRD and the World Bank Group together provided more than USD 7              .7 billion in financing for
     development in MENA. Looking forward, we remain committed to supporting private sector development in the region,
     each institution according to its strategy and remit, and in partnership with local authorities and stakeholders.

     Note: Standard errors in parentheses. ***, ** and * denote statistical significance at the 1, 5 and 10 percent levels respectively. Innovator means the firm has introduced a new
     or significantly improved product, service, or process. Manufacturing sectors are classified as follows, based on Xu (2003): High labor intensity: wearing apparel, leather, furniture;
     moderate labor intensity: wood products, publishing, printing; low labor intensity: food, tobacco, textiles, paper and paper products, rubber and plastics, machinery and equip-
     ment, electrical machinery and apparatus, motor vehicles, transport equipment, other manufacturing; very low labor intensity: coke, refined petroleum products and nuclear fuel,
     chemicals and chemical products, basic metals, fabricated metal products, other non-metallic mineral products. All regressions control for a dummy variable indicating whether at
     least 10 percent of the firm is owned by foreign agents and economy fixed effects. Ordinary least squares regression coefficients reported for columns 1, 4, 5, 6; probit regression
     coefficients reported for columns 2, 3, 7 and 8.

Note: This table reports regression coefficients for the first and second stage of the model described in box 5.1. The results are estimated using asymptotic least squares (ALS) on
a sample of manufacturing firms with at least 20 employees. Standard errors are reported in parentheses below the coefficient. Two-way trading firm is a firm that exports at least
10 percent of revenue and imports at least 10 percent of inputs. PFTE = permanent full-time employees. Variables omitted from the table: Percent PFTE with university degree (don’t
know), percent PFTE with secondary education (don’t know), sector and economy fixed effects, and the intercept. ***, ** and * denote statistical significance at the 1, 5 and 10
percent levels respectively.

Manufacturing firms in Djibouti are relatively more reliant on inputs of foreign origin, which is a                       origin
result of the country’s lack of natural resources and harsh climate. On average, 63 percent of

manufacturing inputs are of foreign origin, well above the average for all MENA ES economies

of firms with majority female ownership: 7
percent, which is almost twice the regional
average (4 percent). The proportion of permanent full-time employees that are women is also higher than the MENA ES average
(figure 8). The relatively strong participation of women in the local workforce and firm management may be partly the result of the
preponderance of the services sector in Djibouti’s economy, since services firms are typically more open to women.

5 percent of firms acquire knowledge, and the proportion of
firms engaged in at least one type of innovation also lags
behind the MENA ES average. These discrepancies could be
driven by differences in trade integration: among firms in high- and medium-high-tech industries, more than 60 percent are exporters
and more than 90 percent import their inputs. In the medium-low and low-tech industries, roughly 40 percent of the firms are
exporters and about half import their inputs.

      also compares poorly with other lower-middle-income economies, where the
      averages for bribery depth and incidence are 16 and 21 percent respectively.
      An inadequately educated workforce ranks second as top obstacle in Morocco,
      and practices of competitors in the informal sector emerge in third place. Indeed, 47 percent of firms in Morocco report that they
      are competing against unregistered or informal firms, which is significantly higher than the regional average of 16 percent and trailing
      only the Republic of Yemen.

bank finance is mirrored by the highest share of not credit-
constrained firms (those that either did not need a loan or
whose loan was approved in full): 87 percent, compared with
the average of 73 percent in the MENA ES region (figure 5).
Moreover, a low share of firms are discouraged from applying for a loan due to unfavorable terms and conditions such as complex
application procedures, unfavorable interest rates, high collateral requirements, or insufficient size of loan and maturity. In fact, the
share of discouraged firms in Morocco is the lowest among all MENA ES economies, as only 10 percent indicate being discouraged
from applying for a loan while this proportion ranges from 13 percent in Djibouti to 49 percent in the Republic of Yemen. Morocco
also has one of the lowest collateral ratios (the ratio of the value of collateral to the value of the loan) in the MENA ES region at
166 percent. The higher regional average of 208 percent is driven by the very high collateral ratios of the Republic of Yemen (281
percent), Egypt (272 percent) and Tunisia (252 percent).

not need a loan thanks to sufficient capital. Tunisian financial
institutions rely heavily on the use of collateral as guarantees for loans. Both the collateral ratio (the ratio of the value of collateral
to the value of the loan) and the collateral incidence (the share of loans that are collateralized) are high, the former being above
any other MENA ES upper-middle-income economy at about 252 percent, and the latter (at 87 percent) being above the MENA ES
average of 83 percent (figure 5). These two measures of collateral requirements also compare poorly with upper-middle-income
averages (190 percent for the collateral ratio and 75 percent for the collateral incidence).

these firms tend to be well integrated into

The proportion of firms undertaking process innovation is particularly high at almost a quarter of all firms—this may be related to the
knowledge transfer from their GVC partners.

      Big player exporters             Firms between the 50th and 94th percentile by their export sales volume
      Business environment             The various domains that affect the day-to-day experiences of firms. Examples include accessing finance, meeting
                                       regulatory requirements, infrastructure, corruption, etc.
      Collateral incidence             The share of outstanding loans that are collateralized

      Collateral ratio index           The inverse of the collateral ratio, calculated from bank-specific information, reflecting the prevalent requirements applied
                                       by the bank to its client. It is presented as a measure reflecting the environment in the area where the bank is located,
                                       by providing a weighted average based on the relevance of the branches of banks located in a circle with radius of 10km
                                       centered on the specific firm.
      Competitiveness                  At the firm level, competitiveness can be thought of as the ability to sustain market position by supplying quality products
                                       on time—at competitive prices—and the ability to adapt quickly to changes in the external environment. It requires
                                       continuous increases in productivity, by shifting from comparative advantages, such as low cost labor, to competitive
                                       advantages—competing on cost and quality, delivery, and flexibility.
      Connected firms                  Firms that applied for a loan, regardless of whether their application was approved or rejected
      Credit-constrained firms         Firms that had a loan application rejected or were discouraged from applying in the first place. They can be fully or
                                       partially credit-constrained.
