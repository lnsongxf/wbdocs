THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of such
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

        Obtain planning permission

        Architects apply to obtain planning permission on any working day but
        can receive the planning permission only on Sundays, Tuesday, and
        Thursdays. The cost of obtaining a planning certificate (QAR 100) has
        not changed since 1998.

        The application to obtain planning permission must include the
        documents below. These documents are usually available within the
        company, causing no need for further procedures to be recorded:
        • Ownership Certificate: The government owns all lands in Doha and
        leases them to private citizens. A rent payment is paid on an annual
        basis to the MIA. The architect should only bring the receipt of last       3 days           QAR 100
   1
        year's payment. This receipt is a proof that all previous payments have
        been made. No stamp is needed.
        • Land plan showing the location, area, and neighboring plots of land.
        • Copy of the applicants ID card
        • Copy of company's registration certificate

        Planning permission includes a location clearance from the Municipality
        of Industrial Area, set of design guidelines for construction work from
        the Municipality of Industrial Area, and a land plan with site map.

        Agency: Municipality of Industrial Area



        Obtain fire safety clearance from the Civil Defense Department

        The law requires the Fire Department to issue permission to build a
        warehouse within 15 days. Usually the fire department does not take
   2    more than 15 days to issue such permissions if all documentation is        14 days           no charge
        correct. To obtain clearance, BuildCo must submit fire drawings
        showing the fire exit strategy, location of fire alarms, etc.

        awaits estimate of connection fees and internal inspection from
        Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation (Kahramaa)

        The customer needs to hire an electrical consultant to design the internal
        installation and later inspect its execution, and an electrical contractor to
        execute the internal wiring. Both need to be approved by the electricity
        utility, Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation (Kahramaa).

        The approved electrical contractor completes, signs, stamps, and submits
        an application (‘Service Note’ and ‘Meter Card’) to the Installations
        section of the Customer Services department at Kahramaa for electricity
        supply.
        After the submittal, the form is forwarded to the concerned Kahramaa

        will be indicated on the bottom of the back side of the form.
        When the approval is obtained, a copy of the form is given to the
        contractor to fulfill the said conditions in order to receive the requested
        service.
        Any charges to be paid by the client as a result of the required service
        will be received from the concerned Kahramaa departments on a
        separate letter and will be collected prior to performing any work.
        The client will need to attach the following documents to the application:

      substation, the client is requested to submit electrical drawings signed
      and stamped by an approved electrical consultant (which is not the case
      for 200 A)

      Thanks to the drawings submitted and the utility’s up-to-date maps, no

      In this case, a service cabinet is needed. The customer’s approved

      connected to the Qatar General Electricity And Water Corporation

      Where practicable, so that all parts of the wiring may be tested, all lamps
      should be removed and all current using apparatus should be
      disconnected and all local switches controlling lamps or apparatus

the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:

        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
