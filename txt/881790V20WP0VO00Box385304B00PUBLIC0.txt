This report distills an array of data, studies and evidence to shine a spotlight on the
pervasive deprivations and constraints that face women and girls worldwide—from
epidemic gender-based violence to laws and norms that prevent women from own-
ing property, working, making decisions about their own lives and having influence
in society. It identifie some promising programs and interventions to address these
deprivations and constraints.

Policymakers and stakeholders need to tackle this agenda, drawing on evidence
about what works and systematically tracking progress on the ground. This must
start with reforming discriminatory laws and follow through with concerted policies
and public actions, including multi-sectoral approaches that engage with men and
boys and challenge adverse social norms. There is much to gain. Increasing wom-
en’s voice and agency is a valuable end in its own right. And it underpins achieve-
ment of the World Bank Group’s twin goals of eliminating extreme poverty and
boosting shared prosperity for girls and boys, women and men, around the world.

“The World Bank Group’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and
boosting shared prosperity demand no less than the full and equal
participation of women and men, girls and boys, around the world.”

“The world is changing beneath our feet and it is past time to embrace
a 21st Century approach to advancing the rights and opportunities of
women and girls at home and across the globe.”
