I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in the
        Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) perceive the Bank;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in the DRC regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in the DRC;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in the DRC;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank ’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               work and activities, and communication and information sharing in the DRC; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in the DRC.
       Use data to help inform the DRC country team’s strategy.


II. Methodology
In February 2013, 400 stakeholders of the World Bank in the DRC were invited to provide their
opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President; the office of the
Prime Minister; the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry,
ministerial department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World
Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; community-based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks;
and the judiciary branch. A total of 331 stakeholders participated in the country survey
(83% response rate).
Respondents completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency. Respondents
were asked about: general issues facing the DRC; their overall attitudes toward the World Bank;
the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the World Bank’s knowledge work and activities;
working with the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in the DRC; and the Bank’s
communication and information sharing in the DRC.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions ar e
identified throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues Facing the DRC: Respondents were asked to indicate whether the DRC is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, and which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in the DRC.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in the DRC, Bank staff preparedness to help
   the DRC solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements regarding
   the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development partner.
   Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on which it would be most
   productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest values and greatest
   weaknesses in its work, the most effective instruments in helping to reduce poverty in the
   DRC, with which stakeholder groups the Bank should collaborate more, and to what reasons
   respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in the DRC, the extent to which the Bank
   meets the DRC’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the Bank’s
   level of effectiveness across thirty-six development areas, such as economic growth, poverty
   reduction, agricultural development, natural resource management, etc.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to indicate
   how frequently they consult Bank knowledge work and activities, the areas on which the
   Bank should focus its knowledge work and activities, and to rate the effectiveness and
   quality of the Bank’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a
   contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank ’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing the DRC’s institutional capacity, and
   providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in the DRC: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in the DRC’s development in the near future and to
   indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in the DRC and which
   development priorities would benefit from the World Bank playing a leading role and which
   would benefit from other donors in the DRC.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s website s and PICs.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank
   and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in the DRC, and their geographic location.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
    For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the office of the President
       and the office of the Prime Minister were combined with respondents from the office of a
       Minister; consultants/contractors working on Bank-supported projects were combined
       with respondents from PMUs; respondents from private foundations were combined with
       those from NGOs, CBOs, trade unions, and faith-based groups to create a Civil Society
       Organization (CSO) category; respondents from the financial sector and private banks
       were combined with those from private sector organizations; and the few respondents
       from the judiciary branch were included in the “Other” category. Note that there were no
       respondents from independent government institutions.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank
       Respondents from PMUs/consultants working on Bank-supported projects,
        academia/research institutes, and bilateral/multilateral agencies indicated the highest
        levels of familiarity with the Bank whereas respondents from the office of the
        President/Prime Minister/Minister, local government, and the private sector/financial
        sector/private banks indicated significantly lower levels.
       Respondents from Matadi and Kinshasa indicated significantly higher levels of
        familiarity with the Bank (5.1 and 4.8, respectively) compared to respondents from Other
        locations (3.9).
       It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were
        significantly, strongly correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall
        effectiveness in the DRC and the Bank’s relevance to the DRC’s development , as well as
        significantly, moderately correlated with perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve
        development results in the DRC.

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)

       There were significant stakeholder differences in their ratings of the Bank’s effectiveness
        across twenty-three of these thirty-six areas. For the most part, respondents from
        PMUs/consultants working on Bank-supported projects, the local government, and the
        media had the highest ratings across these areas whereas employees of ministries/
        implementation agencies and respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies, the private
        sector/financial sector/private banks, CSOs, and academia/research institutes tended to
        have significantly lower ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness across these areas. Those
        areas with significant stakeholder group differences were:
             “Anti-corruption”;
             “Information and communications technology”;
             “Transport”;
             “Law and justice”;
             “Urban development”;
             “Basic infrastructure”;
             “Communicable/non-communicable diseases”;
             “Poverty reduction”;
             “Gender”;
             “Domestic private sector development”;
             “Local governance and institutions”;
             “Water and sanitation”;
             “Trade and exports”;
             “Energy”;
             “Job creation/employment ”;

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)

Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in the DRC, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-six specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in the DRC. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at basic infrastructure;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at rural development; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at regulatory framework.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in the DRC, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at transport;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at urban development;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at water and sanitation; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at global/regional integration.

VII. World Bank Knowledge and Instruments

Knowledge: Frequency of Use

       Respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies consulted World Bank knowledge work
        and activities significantly more frequently than respondents from other stakeholder
        groups (78% of respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies indicated weekly or
        monthly consultations).
             Employees of ministries/implementation agencies and respondents from the
              private sector/financial sector/private banks were the least frequent users of World
              Bank knowledge work and activities compared to other stakeholder groups (7%
              and 10% indicated monthly usage, respectively).

The World Bank is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in the DRC or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The following
survey is meant to give the World Bank’s team that works in the DRC, greater insight into how the Bank’s work is
perceived. This is one tool the World Bank uses to assess the views of its critical stakeholders. With this
understanding, the World Bank hopes to develop more effective strategies, outreach and programs that support
development in the DRC. The World Bank commissioned an independent firm to oversee the logistics of this
effort in the DRC. This ensures anonymity and confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the survey,
please circle/check the response that most accurately reflects your opinion. If you prefer not to answer a
question, please leave it blank.
