    Executive Summary
What is the purpose of this report?
The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) produced ‘A Public Financial
Management Roadmap for Forum Island Countries’ (“The Roadmap”) in 2009 (PFTAC 2010). This
document was adopted at the Forum Economic Ministers’ Meeting (FEMM) of the Pacific Island Forum as
an agreed approach to Public Financial Management (PFM) reform in Forum Island Countries. The
document established the need for regular Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
assessments and the development of PFM reform plans for Pacific countries based on PEFA assessments
and other inputs. Based on international experience, the document concluded that PFM reforms in Pacific
countries should, among other things: i) reflect country priorities; ii) take account of country constraints,
including capacity constraints; and iii) have strong country ownership and take political dimensions into
account.
Five years on from the adoption of the Roadmap, this report examines experiences of PFM reform
in two Pacific island countries in order to inform future improvements. Drawing on the messages of
the Roadmap we assess PFM reform planning and implementation in case study countries of Kiribati and
Tonga over the 2010-2014 period. We assess the extent to which PFM reform planning and implementation
in these countries was consistent with the recommendations of the Roadmap. Based on this assessment, we
reiterate the relevance of the Roadmap’s messages and present recommendations for improved planning
and implementation of Pacific PFM reform in future.
This report does not assess current PFM systems in case study countries. Rather, it provides an analysis
of previous experiences with PFM reforms, focusing on the research period 2010-2014. PFM problems
identified in this report may have since been resolved.

Findings from the Case Studies
Over the review period, PFM systems were functional in both Tonga and Kiribati, reflecting
investment over many years by governments and development partners. Budgets in both countries
provided a reasonably reliable plan for how much would be spent in aggregate and by which ministry
(although plans became much less reliable at below-ministry level). Salaries and most payments were
generally paid on time, despite limited banking, IT and communications infrastructure. Corruption and
fraud were limited in both countries, but there were important concerns regarding inefficiencies.
Much has been achieved through recent PFM reform efforts in both case study countries. Over the
period under examination, both countries managed to implement reforms that significantly impacted
development outcomes. Perhaps because recent macroeconomic challenges faced by Kiribati were so
daunting, the success of several PFM reforms is very clear, including reforms to debt management,
management of the Revenue Equalization and Reserve Fund (RERF), and some reforms in the SOE sector
(such as privatization of the telecommunications utility).1 In Tonga, improvements in procurement are
likely to have led to some improvement in value-for-money in public expenditure, while audit reforms
supported increased confidence among development partners, opening the door for increased budget
support.

proceeds of phosphate extraction in the 1960s and 1970s.

Reforms that were well-targeted, consistent with capacity, and enjoyed political support generally
achieved their objectives. There is a very clear association between reforms that were judged to meet the
three key recommendations presented in the Roadmap and those that were effective. Around a third of the
reforms assessed across both country case studies were considered to have been fully consistent with the
Roadmap recommendations and all of these reforms were also judged effective in achieving their intended
outcome (although for two reforms gains were not, or have not yet been shown to have been, sustained).
This demonstrates the continued relevance of the initial PFTAC recommendations
While reforms mostly focused on broad PFM areas relevant to priority development problems, there
was sometimes a weaker link between specific reforms and required solutions (Figure 1). Most reforms
were responding to real problems at a broad strategic level. Confronted with PFM problems, however,
development partners sometimes tended to seek major changes to policies, processes, and systems, rather
than working to repair increase compliance with existing systems. Development partners sometimes
recommended broad, system-wide and “packaged” reform programs that extended well beyond (or
sometimes even omitted) the often relatively simple PFM dysfunction directly causing the observed
problem.2 Examples of such “packaged” reforms include SOE corporatization to address problems of weak
SOE financial performance in Kiribati, and implementation of medium-term budgeting to address weak
alignment between policy priorities and resource allocation in both countries. The team estimates that
around two thirds of reforms in Kiribati had a strong and direct link to the specific PFM dysfunctions
contributing to major development challenges. Around one quarter of reforms in Tonga were only weakly
linked to main development challenges.

Capacity constraints often undermined implementation across both countries. Around half of the
reforms attempted in Kiribati and Tonga were negatively impacted by capacity constraints. Capacity
constraints were encountered for two different reasons. Firstly, in both countries, there were instances in

  We define “packaged” reforms as those involving introduction of an internationally-established model for achieving
a broad policy objective involving several mutually-dependent changes to processes and rules typically across several
agencies Examples of such “packaged” reforms include SOE corporatization, implementation of an MTEF, or
introduction of a VAT.

ii
which the large number of reforms being pursued simultaneously placed an unrealistic capacity burden on
government officials. Secondly, some of the reforms recommended or attempted in case study countries
were excessively complex given lack of specialized staff and absolute constraints on staff time and
numbers. Capacity constraints led to reforms remaining unimplemented or incompletely implemented, or
heavily reliant on the continued presence of international technical assistance. Because reforms were
typically intended to achieve sustainability over short time horizons, reversals sometimes occurred
following the withdrawal of technical assistance. Because of both the number and complexity of reforms,
there were cases when reforms in one area diverted capacity from other reforms or core business in central
agencies, undermining previous or parallel reform efforts.
Some reforms were successful because of strong political support, but others did not adequately
reflect the political-economy context. Several important PFM reforms achieved good results because of
strong political support, including reforms to the RERF in Kiribati and to procurement in Tonga. But around
half the reforms in Kiribati and Tonga were in some way negatively impacted by political economy factors.
Negative political impacts arose through two main channels.

     Firstly, some reforms were stalled by direct political opposition or a lack of political support. In some
      cases this reflected the fact that technocratic PFM reforms were being progressed by development
      partners as a solution to political decisions that they did not agree with (for example, debt management
      reforms to address political decisions to contract large external loans, or medium-term budgeting as a
      solution to ad hoc in-year spending decisions). In other cases, reforms were simply pursued without
      high-level political buy-in and without key policy-makers understanding the implications or –
      sometimes – objectives of reform.
     Secondly, reforms were sometimes predicated on unfounded assumptions regarding the incentives
      facing policy makers and public employees and the ability of technical reforms to change those
      incentives. Reform plans often relied on assumptions that state-society relations in case-study countries
      were similar to those in OECD countries, with expectations that – for example – transparency would
      incentivize and ultimately lead to improvements in efficiency and effectiveness. This was clearly not
      the case in several instances where international practices were implemented with disappointing results.
Problems with capacity constraints and misalignment with political priorities reflected some
weaknesses in planning. PFM reforms did not follow a plan in either country, possibly detracting from
prioritization and alignment with government priorities. The 2011 Kiribati PFM Reform Plan included too
many reforms to be useful in informing planning, and was generally recognized as unhelpful by government
and development partners. A PFTAC review of the document identified improving the FMIS and associated
business processes as the reform priorities. While the review did not lead to adoption of a revised plan, it
influenced donor engagements towards these areas. In Tonga, a careful and consultative process was
undertaken to develop a PFM reform plan over several years covered by this report, but the final plan has
only recently been endorsed by Cabinet and so did not drive PFM reform planning over the period of
analysis.

Recommendations
We present five main recommendations to further improve PFM Reform in Pacific island countries.
Recommendations are drawn from our analysis of case study countries and draw on international experience
and literature. They overlap and are entirely consistent with previous advice and guidance on PFM reform
in Pacific island countries provided in the past by PFTAC and the World Bank (PFTAC 2010; PFTAC
2012; Haque et al. 2013). Crucially, all of the recommendations build on Roadmap advice that PFM reforms
should: i) reflect country-specific priorities; ii) take account of country-specific constraints; and iii) enjoy

iii
country ownership and political support (PFTAC 2010). Recommendations presented below will vary in
relevance and usefulness depending on country circumstances. They are suggestions that could be tested
and improved through future application by Pacific PFM practitioners with specific country knowledge.
Recommendation 1: Consolidate progress towards better-prioritized reform plans
Substantial progress has already been achieved towards improving Pacific PFM reform plans. The
process of developing a PFM reform plan in Pacific island countries provides an important opportunity to
confront the reality that addressing all PFM weaknesses may not be possible with available capacity, and
that things may need to be done differently to standard practice in larger countries. Since 2012, PFTAC has
moved towards a more country-owned and prioritized approach to PFM reform plan development,
involving extensive consultation, increasingly linking PFM reform priorities to development challenges,
and encouraging governments to carefully consider why and when a low PEFA score requires corrective
action. There is explicit recognition that PFM reform plans should be based on consideration of priority
development problems and the priority PFM reforms to address those problems. A number of options exist
to consolidate gains and ensure that Pacific PFM reform plans all include a feasible number of reforms
which are tightly prioritized towards addressing binding development constraints:

    Adequate resourcing for roadmap development. Increasing the time and resources dedicated to
     developing roadmaps would be useful to ensure that they reflect country context and priorities.
     Allowing adequate time for in-country consultations is important, as is ensuring that the PFM reform
     planning team includes (local or international) economists and other country experts to ensure that PFM
     reforms are not considered in isolation from broader challenges. Adequate consultation at senior levels
     is also required to ensure buy-in and political support (PFTAC 2012).

    Improved PEFA Summary Assessments. PEFA assessments are frequently used as the start-point for
     PFM reform plans. Existing guidance from the PEFA Secretariat specifies that PEFA Summary
     Assessments should explain the likely impact of identified PFM weaknesses on fiscal discipline,
     strategic allocations of resources, and efficient service delivery. However, this does not always occur,
     with Summary Assessments often summarizing the full range of PFM weaknesses discussed in the
     document without discussion of which of these weaknesses are more relevant, given the country
     context. Summary Assessments that followed existing guidance and specified which PFM weaknesses
     were causing outcome level problems would assist the process of reform plan formation by providing
     a start-point for prioritization, and avoiding any perceptions that all PFM weaknesses need to be
     addressed.

    Beginning planning processes with a fixed resource constraint. Once planning processes and
     consultations get underway it can become very difficult for team members to resist calls from officials,
     politicians, and development partners to include additional reforms in PFM reform plans. This can drive
     an unfeasibly ambitious reform plan. Gaining broad agreement regarding the envelope of resources
     available for implementation at the outset can help avoid this outcome (including staff capacity as well
     as financial resources for technical assistance and infrastructure). Beginning with a resource constraint
     forces prioritization by making it clear that including additional reforms beyond a certain point can
     only be achieved at the cost of excluding others (Haque et al. 2013).

Recommendation 2: Further strengthen donor coordination and alignment
Country working groups could support ongoing coordination. Development partners and governments
need to continuously coordinate to manage PFM reform implementation, establish distribution of labor, and
– potentially – update the PFM reform plan as country context and priorities change. A country-level
working group, led by a representative of a key government agency (likely Ministry of Finance) and
comprising other government and development partner officials, could be given responsibility for
coordination of all PFM reforms. The working group could meet regularly to jointly review progress on
PFM reforms. To build awareness and ownership among policy-makers, the working group could report
regularly to Cabinet on progress and constraints. While the overall path for reform should be ideally set by
the PFM roadmap, the working group could play an important role in updating and adjusting the reform
agenda – while maintaining a tightly prioritized approach – as country conditions and political priorities
change. An important opportunity may arise from the same working group taking responsibility for PFM,
budget support coordination, and broader economic reforms. While reducing the time burden associated
with additional meetings, this approach could also ensure development partners and government agree on
relative priorities and constraints across different areas of engagement, build understanding of the capacity
burden arising from different areas of reform, and ensure that donor conditionalities were aligned with
prioritized PFM actions.
Recommendation 3: Ensure implementation approaches reflect Pacific realities
PFM technical assistance models could be altered to provide greater emphasis on outcomes rather
than policy, legislative or process changes. Case studies demonstrated that the large number of reforms
that impose additional capacity burdens often leads to recommendations not being implemented or
implemented for only a short period of time. There have been growing calls for international organizations
to work iteratively and adaptively for institutional reform, focusing on improved outcomes rather than
delivering pre-determined outputs such as new rules, procedures, policies, and laws (under labels such as
“Doing Development Differently” or “Problem-Driven Iterative Approaches”). In practical terms, such
approaches in relation to Pacific PFM reform might involve:

   Ensuring short-term assistance is coordinated with implementation support. There were no clear
    examples from case study countries of short-term assistance leading to substantial reform or
    improvements in outcomes without subsequent implementation support. Development partners could
    seek to ensure that resources for such implementation support are available before mobilizing short-
    term technical assistance, or simply combine analytical and implementation phases of assistance.

   Innovative approaches to contracting. Consultants could be provided with greater leeway to change
    their approach and planned outputs as reforms develop as long, as overall goals remain consistent. In
    some cases, consultants could be contracted to solve a particular problem or improve the functioning
    of an existing process (and be held accountable on that basis), rather than necessarily introduce policy
    or legislative reform or lead significant change to existing systems. Management frameworks could
    specify outputs and monitor indicators of progress over short time horizon (e.g. quarterly) to allow
    reforms to adjust using new information about the context or political environment.

   Investigating the use of financing instruments that increase focus on results. Development policy
    operations have proven an effective and useful means of supporting PFM reforms in Pacific island
    countries. Development policy financing might be usefully complemented by financing mechanisms
    that allowed a closer focus on results, rather than on significant institutional and policy reforms.
    Providing financing against results (e.g. reliable supply of pharmaceuticals to clinics) would open space

v
      for development partners and governments to discuss on the most context-appropriate means of
      achieving the targeted result and reduce the temptation to reach for “packaged” reforms. Focus could
      be moved towards simple improvements to (or increased enforcement of) existing systems when more
      ambitious overhauls of policies and procedures was unnecessary and might impose an excessive
      capacity burden. A focus on results, rather than changes to the formal PFM system, might also
      encourage development partners and government to consider interactions between PFM systems and
      broader problems of public sector management. Targeting specific results could magnify the impacts
      of PFM reforms by incentivizing complementary process and management improvements beyond the
      PFM system.
Opportunities for regional capacity sharing and selective outsourcing of capacity-intensive functions
could be pursued. Given that some Pacific island countries may not be able to maintain specialized
capacities required for all PFM functions they seek to have fulfilled, capacity supplementation and capacity
substitution can play an important role, alongside traditional capacity building. Pacific governments may
wish to outsource particular functions to the private sector or regional institutions. Such capacity
supplementation and capacity substitution can be delivered sustainably if costs are acknowledged and
planned for. Such outsourcing and capacity sharing arrangements need to be considered carefully, however,
and previous work has provided a framework for judging when and where such approaches may be
appropriate (Haque et al. 2013).
Recommendation 4: Deepen country-specific knowledge
Development partners could work to build understanding of Pacific political economy and how it
relates to PFM. Case studies suggest that PFM reforms are sometimes predicated on intervention logics
that do not hold in Pacific countries, with the outcomes of PFM reforms depending heavily on the broader
institutional and political environment.3 Development partners could undertake political economy and
institutional analysis to ensure that expectations regarding the likely impact of standard PFM reforms in
Pacific island countries are accurate. Such work might also usefully inform the design of less-conventional
and more-holistic interventions through which desired outcomes could be achieved. For example, political
economy analysis may have shown that standard budget transparency measures were – by themselves –
unlikely to drive stronger accountability relationships between policy-makers, the bureaucracy, and
citizens, and could have informed broader programs for education or civil society engagement to strengthen
these relationships.
Regional bodies could play an important role in developing context-specific approaches to PFM.
Bodies such as the University of the South Pacific (USP), Pacific Island Center for Public Administration
(PICPA), PFTAC, the Pacific Island Forum (PIF), and the Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions
(PASAI) play an important role in capacity building through training and peer learning. They are also
mostly staffed by Pacific islanders with deep country and regional knowledge. Development partners could
further support these institutions in developing context-specific solutions to common PFM problems,
including through sponsoring knowledge exchange with other countries at similar levels of development or
facing similar challenges, and linking such agencies with academic institutions developing (and providing
training on) innovative approaches to PFM reform.

    This point has been made in general terms by Schick (1998) and Allen (2010)

vi
Recommendation 5: Adopt coordination mechanisms to support good practices
Case studies demonstrated that institutional incentives can drive proliferation and excessive
complexity of PFM reform interventions. Development agencies and staff sometimes face incentives to
implement more projects that adhere to internationally familiar designs, even when a smaller number of
context-specific interventions might have the greatest positive impact. The collective goal of improved
Pacific PFM systems might therefore be served by instituting mechanisms to bind development agencies to
collective restraint and coordinated action. Such mechanisms might include:

     Adoption of good practice principles. Development partners could formally and collectively adopt a
      set of good practice principles to guide their approaches to Pacific PFM reform. Coordination principles
      could commit development partners to practices that promote better information sharing between
      donors and strengthen the dialogue between development partners and the government. Prioritization
      principles could commit development partners to developing reforms that are realistic, appropriate and
      solve real problems. Implementation principles could commit development partners to longer-term
      engagement, flexibility to adapt to changing priorities and problems and a greater variety of reform
      interventions for governments to choose from. These principles could be discussed, adopted, and
      monitored at the annual ‘Heptagon’ meeting of major donors. Alternatively, and more formally, the
      principles could be submitted to the Pacific Islands Forum for formal endorsement, with the Pacific
      Island Forum Secretariat playing an ongoing role in monitoring compliance. This would help ensure
      shared commitment to the principles among donors and governments. Annex 1 presents draft principles
      to inform this discussion.

     Commitment to sharing and mutual review of project design documents, consultant terms of
      reference, and training plans. Through mutual review, development partners can seek to ensure
      coordination and broad agreement on the appropriateness of reforms being pursued. Development
      partners could collectively consider whether or not the proposals adequately reflected the priorities
      agreed in the country working groups and the capacity of the government to support or implement the
      proposed deliverables.

 1. What is the purpose of this report?
    1.1. This report is intended to inform improvements to planning and implementation of PFM reform
         in Pacific countries
A well-functioning public financial management (PFM) system is a vital tool for development.
Institutions governing public finances have a determining impact on the economic and social costs and
benefits of revenue collection and expenditure. Sound PFM systems are vital to the delivery of social
services for the achievement of social development goals and the provision of infrastructure and public
institutions that enable economic growth. Reflecting their importance for the achievement of development
outcomes, substantial attention and resources are being devoted to strengthening the PFM systems of
developing countries worldwide.
Improving PFM systems is a joint priority of Pacific island countries and development partners.
Interest in, and funding for, PFM and public sector management reform has increased significantly since
the early 2000s (de Renzio et al. 2010). Global trends towards increased investment in PFM reform are
apparent in the Pacific. Pacific governments have publically committed to improving PFM systems. Most
of the independent Anglophone Pacific countries currently have PFM reform programs of some sort
underway, supported by international technical assistance (Haque, Knight, and Jayasuriya 2015). Many of
these PFM reform programs have achieved substantial gains.
The IMF’s Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) produced ‘A Public Financial
Management Roadmap for Forum Island Countries’ (“The Roadmap”) in 2009 (PFTAC 2010). This
document was adopted at the Forum Economic Ministers’ Meeting (FEMM) of the Pacific Island Forum as
an agreed approach to PFM reform in Forum Island Countries. The document established the need for
regular PEFA assessments and the development of PFM reform plans for Pacific countries based on PEFA
assessments and other inputs. Based on international experience, the document concluded that PFM reforms
in Pacific countries should, among other things: i) reflect country priorities; ii) take account of country
constraints, including capacity constraints; and iii) have strong country ownership and take political
dimensions into account.
Five years on from the adoption of the Roadmap, this report examines experiences of PFM reform
in two Pacific island countries in order to inform future improvements. Drawing on the messages of
the Roadmap we assess PFM reform planning and implementation in case study countries of Kiribati and
Tonga. We assess the extent to which PFM reform planning and implementation in these countries has been
consistent with the recommendations of the Roadmap. Based on this assessment, we reiterate the relevance
of the Roadmap’s messages and present recommendations for improved planning and implementation of
Pacific PFM reform in future.

    1.2. There is particular need for prioritization in Pacific island countries
The recommendations of the Roadmap reflect that capacity constraints are a defining feature of
government in Pacific island countries. Along with all of the challenges faced by larger countries in
implementing PFM reforms, small island states face additional important and well-known challenges due
to small populations. With limited pools of human resources, a small number of public servants, and
important weaknesses in institutions providing secondary and tertiary education, small island governments
are often unable to access the skills required for some specialized PFM functions from local labor markets
(Baker 1992; Brown 2010; Horscroft 2014). Often, there are simply too few people to complete all of the
functions required in a full PFM system, with available staff stretched across a wide range of functions.

1
The public sector in PICs also faces strong competition for human resources from the local private sector,
donors, and NGOs, both locally and overseas. Capacity building efforts are often undermined, as staff with
newly acquired skills and qualifications emigrate or move to new roles in or outside of the public service.
The strength of capacity within any agency often varies significantly over time and can change quite
suddenly with the departure of one or two key staff. While many countries face capacity constraints in
PFM, evidence suggests that these constraints are particularly severe in small countries, and exert a
significant negative influence on PFM performance as measured by PEFA scores (Haque, Knight and
Jayasuriya 2015). While larger countries may be able to build capacity to fill capacity gaps over time,
capacity constraints arising from small population sizes are likely to be longer-term, with capacity-building
efforts not always a sufficient solution (Haque et al. 2013).
There is a growing consensus regarding the importance of prioritization in Pacific PFM reform. A
significant literature discusses the importance of prioritization and sequencing in PFM reform (see Box 1).
Most international guidance stresses the need for gradualism, and a ‘basics first’ approach (Allen, Schiavo-
Campo and Garrity 2004; Diamond 2013; Diamond 2013a; Tomassi 2013). In the Pacific context of severe
and sustained capacity shortages, prioritization becomes even more essential (PFTAC 2010; Haque et al.
2013). Some Pacific island countries are likely to remain unable to implement a full ‘best practice’ PFM
system or address all of the weaknesses identified through the application of common benchmarking tools
(such as PEFA assessments) for many years to come. While PFM reforms need to be prioritized and
sequenced in all countries, some Pacific countries may not be able to implement all aspects of a ‘good
practice’ PFM system (such as assessed under the PEFA framework) for the foreseeable future. Decisions
must therefore be made not just about what reforms should come first, but also about what reforms and
systems are most important, given that doing everything is not possible, potentially even over the longer
term. Policy makers must consider not only sequencing, but broader questions about what type of PFM
system is desirable and achievable within long-term capacity and resource constraints. Governments and
their advisors need to consider the impacts of reforms not only on the area in which reform is taking place,
but also in terms of the opportunity costs: should scarce capacity be used to undertake reform in one
particular area when this makes reforms (or perhaps even sustaining existing levels of functionality) in
another area impossible?
Building on the recommendations of the Roadmap, this report draws on recent literature regarding
‘problem-driven approaches’ to further inform analysis of and recommendations for prioritization
of PFM reforms. Institutional reform in developing countries has often involved ‘transplanting
preconceived and packaged “best practice” solutions to institutional reform’ (Andrews, Pritchett, Woolcock
2012). “Problem-driven” approaches instead emphasize the need to develop context-specific reform
solutions to carefully-identified context-specific problems (Fritz and Levy 2009; Andrews 2012; Andrews,
Pritchett and Woolcock 2015; Andrews and Woolcock 2015). Based on concepts from this emerging
literature, recent guidance has encouraged Pacific PFM practitioners to target scarce resources towards
specific PFM dysfunctions that are having the greatest negative impact on development progress, taking
account of what is likely to be possible within a specific country and institutional context (Haque et al.
2013). Such approaches are fully consistent with the application of the PEFA framework and PEFA scores
can provide an important input when identifying PFM dysfunctions to be targeted in prioritized reform
plans (Diamond 2013; PEFA Secretariat 2016). Through the application of this approach, Governments and
their advisors can identify where scarce PFM reform capacity can be most usefully deployed to maximize
development impacts.

    1.3. Methodology
We review PFM reforms in each case study country in terms of key recommendations of the
Roadmap. We begin by trying to identify the main PFM constraints contributing to major development
problems in each country during the research period, as identified through interviews with policy makers
and officials. Using a framework previously developed by the World Bank and PFTAC, we assess the
extent to which reforms pursued by government and development partners were targeted towards these
pressing development constraints over the period (Haque et al. 2013). From this point, we assess the extent
to which those PFM reforms took account of capacity constraints through detailed analysis of reform
implementation and outcomes. Finally, we assess the extent to which those reforms enjoyed country
ownership and took account of country-specific political factors (Table 4). Our broad operating assumption
is that sound prioritization processes should have led to PFM reform efforts that: i) were targeted towards
addressing pressing development challenges; ii) were achievable with available capacity and therefore not
derailed by capacity constraints; and iii) were aligned with government priorities and the political
environment, and therefore not undermined by a lack of political support or other political economy factors.
By analyzing patterns in when and whether these criteria were met, we develop recommendations as to how
prioritization efforts could potentially be improved in future.
Kiribati and Tonga were selected as case study countries because of important divergences in the
quality of their PFM systems and their overall levels of development. Generalizability of findings to
the wider Pacific is strengthened by including case studies with variance across important dimensions.
Incomes in Tonga are among the highest in the Pacific, and considerably higher than those in Kiribati.
Human development outcomes in Tonga are much higher than those in Kiribati – which are among the
worst in the Pacific. Dysfunction of ‘basic’ PFM systems in Kiribati has contributed significantly to both
poor coverage and quality of services and challenges to long-term fiscal sustainability. In contrast, a
reasonably well-functioning PFM system in Tonga has supported strong social outcomes and relatively
sound fiscal management, with the authorities now focused on addressing a deficit of public accountability
and some perceived technical inefficiencies at the level of line ministries (Table 2 and Table 3). While
capacity constraints remain a major challenge in both countries given their small populations (both around
100,000) and small public services, access to technical training differs considerably. Tonga has leveraged
higher incomes and migration links with New Zealand and the United States to build a cadre of highly-
educated public servants occupying key senior roles, while Kiribati continues to struggle to recruit, train,
and retain staff with relevant tertiary-level qualifications.
This report represents the conclusions of joint work between the World Bank, the New Zealand
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade,
and the Overseas Development Institute. The analysis is based on a desk review of existing literature and
in-depth case study evidence. The team, comprising both global and regional PFM experts and practitioners,
travelled to both case study countries and conducted more than fifty interviews with government officials,
development partner representatives, and civil society organizations (see Annex 2 for a list of meetings).
Findings were tested through extensive follow-up discussions with additional technical and regional
specialists.

Box 1: Recent literature on Planning and Sequencing PFM Reforms

A substantial literature discusses appropriate sequencing and prioritization of PFM reforms (Allen,
Schiavo-Campo and Garrity 2004; Diamond 2013; Diamond 2013a; Tomassi 2013). While there remain
areas of debate, a general consensus has emerged around the need to focus on ‘basics first’ and take an
incremental approach to improving PFM systems (Diamond 2013).

The PEFA Secretariat has recently published good practice guidance on sequencing PFM reforms, which
provides a range of practical suggestions and recommendations to governments and development
partners (Diamond 2013; Diamond 2013a; Tomassi 2013). The World Bank and PFTAC also recently
produced guidance for planning PFM reforms, with a specific focus on prioritization under the capacity
and resource constraints facing Pacific island countries (Haque et al. 2013).

There is broad consensus that: i) reforms should be tailored to unique country circumstances and take
into account non-technical factors (including cultural and political economy factors); ii) there is no
universal, off-the-shelf PFM reform program, and an incremental approach should be followed; iii)
sequencing must not be seen as a purely technical exercise and should reflect country constraints and
realities; and iv) success should be judged by improved PFM deliverables.

This report is loosely based around the application of the framework presented in the World
Bank/PFTAC Guidance Note, given its specific relevance to Pacific contexts. The Guidance Note
suggests potential benefits from applying a ‘problem driven’ approaches to PFM reform in Pacific
contexts where capacity is sometimes lacking to even achieve all of the ‘basics’ identified in the broader
literature. In the context of pressing capacity constraints, the note argues that PFM priorities should
reflect the broader macroeconomic and development challenges preoccupying policymakers, and
presents a framework for tracing observed macroeconomic and service delivery constraints to underlying
contributory PFM dysfunctions. Through the application of this approach, and drawing on recent work
from the broader governance literature, the Guidance note also emphasizes the need to focus on
‘function’ rather than ‘form’, allowing for systems and processes that do not take the same form as those
applied in advanced country contexts (and may therefore be unlikely to meet criteria for high PEFA
scores) as long as the underlying PFM function is being successfully fulfilled (Andrews 2010; Andrews
2015).

 2. Are we pursuing the right PFM reforms?
In this section we review PFM reform efforts in case study countries over the review period (2010-
2014). We begin by identifying important PFM problems that were contributing to the major development
constraints in each country over the research period, as identified by policy makers and senior officials. We
then describe actual PFM reforms pursued over the period and assess them against three criteria: i) the
extent to which they targeted the main PFM problems constraining development; ii) the extent to which
they were weakened or undermined by capacity constraints; and iii) the extent to which they reflected the
political context and the political priorities of government. It is important to note that this report does not
evaluate current PFM performance, and many of the constraints and problems noted over the period of the
review may have been addressed through subsequent reforms.

Two main development challenges were identified as the most-pressing over the research period by
those interviewed in Kiribati. These challenges were: i) weaknesses in service delivery; and ii)
unsustainable fiscal deficits. In this section we describe the PFM-related problems contributing to these
challenges, and assess the extent to which PFM reform efforts have been targeted towards addressing these
problems.

        2.1.1. What PFM problems are constraining development in Kiribati?
Kiribati faced important challenges in basic service delivery. In interviews with the authorities, the poor
quality of basic social services was cited as a primary PFM-related development constraint. This assessment
was supported by most data and indicators, especially when Kiribati was compared against other Pacific
island countries (Figure 3: Under-five mortality - per 1,000 live births). Kiribati is ranked 121 out of 187
countries on the Human Development Index, among the lowest in the Pacific. Primary net enrolment, at 82
percent, is the lowest among small Pacific island countries, and substantially below the average for the
East-Asia and Pacific region. Enrolment drops significantly from primary to junior secondary school levels.
Health outcomes are of particular concern. Infant and child mortality rates are the highest in the region, as
are infectious diseases including diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory infections associated with
overcrowding and lack of access to safe water. Kiribati’s rate of HIV was the highest in the Pacific in the
early 2000s (though the number of new cases has been low since 2006) and in 2014 there were 119 new
cases of leprosy diagnosed in South Tarawa (MHMS 2016). Urbanization and reorientation of consumption
patterns towards imported foods has contributed to rising rates of diabetes and other non-communicable
diseases since the early 1990s. Despite improvements in some areas, Kiribati was off track with the MDGs
for primary education, child mortality and maternal health care (GoK 2015).

Problems with service delivery were partially driven by problems with PFM systems. Many factors
contributed to problems with service delivery, including overall resource constraints, geographical
dispersion, and weak capacity within line ministries and service delivery units. There is no reason to believe
that PFM problems were the only, or even the most significant, contributor to problems of service delivery
in Kiribati. However, based on a thorough assessment of the PFM system (including a review of the most
recent PEFA assessment) several weaknesses in the PFM system were identified by the team that could
reasonably be considered to have exacerbated – or at least limited the capacity to resolve – service delivery
challenges. These included:

   Expected resources not reliably available to expenditure units. While the Ministry of Finance had
    capacity to access both its sovereign wealth fund balances and commercial bank overdrafts to avoid
    cash shortages, there were instances in which basic payment systems caused delays and disruption.
    Delays in payment of purchase orders led to some suppliers requiring payment in advance, with
    subsequent disruption of spending plans. Medical supplies, including pharmaceuticals, sometimes ran
    out. Utility payments were often delayed, with flow-on impacts for the financial management of
    government-owned utilities. In outer islands, local government units reported frequent disruption of
    payments. Several underlying PFM dysfunctions were reported to have contributed to this problem:
        o Geography-related system vulnerabilities. In the absence of reliable internet access, and with
            a very limited network of commercial bank branches, government relied heavily on paper-
            based systems. With frequent transportation delays and disruptions between islands,
            documents, cash, and procured goods were sometimes held up or lost. These challenges were
            compounded by the telegraphic money order ‘TELMO’ system. Without a banking system, the
            private sector can make transfers between islands using the post office, through the TELMO


7
            system. TELMO transfers transit through the main government account, which means that the
            government is handling both private and public money, and makes it hard to monitor the true
            government balance, without reconciling the many different transactions.
        o   Weak expenditure management by line ministries. In the absence of an integrated FMIS,
            line ministries encountered problems with tracking expenditure and commitments against
            budget allocations. Line ministries sometimes tried to manage expenditure by delaying the
            transmission of payment orders received from expenditure units to the Ministry of Finance,
            disrupting service delivery.
        o   Delays in processing of payment requests by MoF. While specific causes are not known,
            several line ministries reported delays in Ministry of Finance processing of payment requests.
            This may simply be related to slow internal processes in the Treasury Department, which was
            responsible for making all payments, and to the difficulties faced in reconciling returns from
            line ministries and transactions made through the telegraphic money order ‘TELMO’ system.
        o   Delays in updating payroll records to reflect staff movements. Staff in outer islands and
            line ministries reported that, while salaries were generally paid on time, staff experienced
            payment delays following changes in staff duty stations. Delays in payment were also
            experience by new contract teachers. Late payments arose from delays in updating payroll
            information to reflect staff records, given infrequent reconciliation.

   Technical inefficiency in expenditure. Respondents cited concerns regarding the efficiency and
    accountability of resource use by line ministries and expenditure units over the period. The team was
    informed of instances of corruption, and perceptions that low-quality expenditures, including overtime
    payments, were squeezing resources available for service delivery. Several underlying PFM
    dysfunctions were reported to have contributed to this problem:
        o Problems with procurement. The team heard different views regarding the extent to which
           procurement processes were followed within ministries over the period. The lack of a central
           procurement system was cited as limiting the quality and cost effectiveness of overall
           procurement. Lack of capacity at some Ministries also contributed to poor procurement
           outcomes.
        o Absence of incentives for efficiency and effectiveness across line ministries. External
           accountability mechanisms were generally considered to be weak. While there was substantial
           progress in the frequency and coverage of audit over recent years, follow-up action on audit
           recommendations was limited, while information and data to track efficiency in delivering
           outputs and achieving outcomes was typically absent. The team heard different views regarding
           the extent to which hiring and promotion decisions were based on merit, but this was cited as
           a concern by some officials.

   Poor alignment between resource allocation and policy priorities. Analysis of expenditure patterns
    showed a declining proportion of resources devoted to specified government priority areas over time.
    While budget execution at the ministry level was usually within 10 percent, there was substantial
    variance between budgeted and actual spending at the level of line items, while ministries reallocated
    substantial resources during the year from front-line service delivery towards administrative expenses
    (Government of Kiribati and World Bank 2012) (Figure 6). Over-expenditure was driven by unforeseen
    costs associated with Sate-Owned Enterprises and debt service, while salary allocations were typically
    underspent, with salary allocations frequently reallocated to temporary staff and other operating costs
    (Figure 7). Poor alignment between resource allocation and policy priorities was driven by three factors:


8
          o    Weak budget formation based on incremental budgeting. In earlier years of the review
               period, budget preparation was highly incremental with limited capacity and incentives at the
               line ministry to improve the quality of budget. Line ministry budgets were generally set at the
               level of the previous year, adjusted for new initiatives or cost and wage increases. Under- and
               over-expenditure was not corrected for in budget allocations, and therefore reproduced in
               subsequent fiscal years.
          o    Insufficient control over transfers. While some controls were in place (for example to prevent
               operating allocations being used to finance new hiring), ministries retained some flexibility to
               reallocate resources between programs and line-items but with limited information captured or
               produced to facilitate oversight of resource use. During the period, control over transfers was
               centralized within the Ministry of Finance to help address these issues. Output data was not
               systematically tracked, provided to the Ministry of Finance or reported in budget documents.
          o    Weak alignment between planning and budgeting. For most of the period, plans at the
               National and Ministry level were not adequately costed, and therefore could not be realized
               within available budgetary resources. The medium-term cost implications of plans were not
               reflected in medium-term budgets, despite the inclusion of medium-term projections at the line
               level in budget documentation.

Kiribati also experienced problems with macroeconomic management. Authorities also cited long-term
fiscal sustainability as an important PFM-related challenge. Such concerns were particularly pressing
during the early years of the research period, with the value of the RERF sovereign wealth fund – on which
government relied for budget support – negatively impacted by declining asset values during the Global
Economic Crisis, and government running successive large fiscal deficits. Due to declines in asset values
and successive large drawdowns, the real per capita value of the trust fund declined by more than 50 percent
between 2008 and 2011, generating concerns that RERF balances would fall into an irreversible downward
spiral without uncomfortably large fiscal adjustment. Such concerns have since eased, with massive
increases in fishing license revenues supporting large budget surpluses and some recapitalization of the
RERF over recent years.

Problems with macroeconomic management were partially driven by weaknesses in PFM systems.
The decline in RERF values between 2008 and 2011 can only be indirectly and partially ascribed to PFM
weaknesses. Unsustainable drawdowns were the result of well-informed political decision-making, with
reliance on such drawdowns frequently discussed in Parliament (with debates broadcast on radio) and
reflected in public budget documentation. Again, however, our analysis of the PFM systems suggests that
PFM weaknesses exacerbated and limited government options to respond to these challenges. Relevant
PFM weaknesses included:

      Unpredictable expenditure pressures. Unforeseen expenditure pressures arising within budget years
       led to increases in allocations through supplemental budgets and growth of fiscal deficits (Figure 9).
       These unforeseen expenditure pressures were, themselves, driven by PFM dysfunctions.
           o Weak financial management of SOEs. Periodic bailouts to SOEs generated an unpredictable
                source of additional expenditures over the period, contributing to deficits. The Government of
                Kiribati spent AUD19.4 million (or 11 percent of current GDP) on bailing out SOEs through
                the budget between 2003 and 2013. The Public Utility Board was largest recipient of subsidies,
                followed by Air Kiribati. Further unpredictable budget shortfalls were imposed through the
                failure of several SOEs to pay corporate taxes and the frequent practice of withholding the
                PAYE taxes of their employees.
           o Unplanned and expensive borrowing. High and unbudgeted interest costs on domestic debt
                further increased budget pressures. Partly to finance SOE bailouts, while avoiding
                unsustainably large draw-downs from the RERF, GoK drew heavily on overdraft facilities
                provided by the only commercial bank during 2011 and 2012. By mid-2012, the commercial
                debts through overdraft facilities had reached AU$20 million (around 11 percent of GDP), with
                a $14 million balance held over from between FY2011 and FY2012. The nominal interest
                charged on these facilities was 11 percent per annum (Figure 10). This borrowing occurred on
                an ad hoc basis, was incurred without Cabinet approval, and was collateralized against RERF
                assets. This practice was eventually eliminated through debt policy reforms discussed below.

      Unpredictable revenues. Unsustainable deficits were also driven by persistent revenue shortfalls, with
       weak and unpredictable revenues from most sources.
          o Weak tax compliance. Fiscal deficits which were exacerbated by declining revenue
              performance. During the period of declining RERF balances, tax revenues declined from 14
              percent to 12 percent of GNI with significant declines in import duties and company tax receipts
              (declines in company tax were reversed, however in 2015) (Figure 11). While the tax-free
              threshold on income tax was increased in 2008, declines in revenue were too great to be
              explained by any policy changes. Import duties declined as a proportion of imports, without
              any adjustment to rates, indicating growing compliance problems with trade taxes. Broader
              weaknesses in the justice system exacerbated revenue collection challenges, with no successful
              prosecutions for tax non-compliance.
          o Poor systems for managing fisheries revenues. Over the period, fisheries revenues grew
              rapidly, driven by regional mechanisms to ration supply. With weak communication between
              Ministry of Fisheries and MFED, fisheries revenue forecasts were developed amid substantial
              uncertainty. Over the period of analysis, the Ministry of Fisheries consistently declined to share
              any information with MFED regarding the source of revenues, the agreements that revenues
              are generated from, or the commercial performance of joint ventures. Consequently, it was
              impossible for the budget team to make any meaningful projections of future revenue
              performance. Lack of predictability in fishing revenues undermined realism of overall revenue
              forecasts, with fisheries license fees sometimes accounting for as much as 80 percent of total
              revenues. (Figure 12).

      RERF underperformance. The RERF was severely impacted by the Global Economic Crisis
       including through exposure to Icelandic banks. The portfolio suffered a large, irrecoverable loss when
       the three largest Icelandic banks defaulted on their debt in the fall of 2008, and the Icelandic króna
       became non-convertible. The real value of RERF assets declined by AUD 75 million, or around 12
       percent of the fund’s total value (Figure 4). Subsequent analysis by technical assistance providers has
       suggested that this exposure was inappropriate, and reflected both an unsuitable investment strategy on
       behalf of asset managers, and a lack of adequate government oversight. Subsequent fiscal sustainability
       challenges can, therefore, be partly attributed to RERF management and governance arrangements,
       which are arguably a component of the PFM system.
           2.1.2. Have the right PFM reform efforts targeted the right problems in Kiribati?
In this section we discuss PFM reforms implemented in Kiribati. We discuss these reforms in terms of:
i) the extent to which reforms targeted and adequately addressed the main PFM problems constraining
development, including identification of important PFM problems left unaddressed; ii) the extent to which
reforms were weakened or undermined by capacity constraints; and iii) the extent to which reforms were
suited to the political context and reflected the political priorities of government.
PFM reforms to address weaknesses in service delivery

      Reform effort was targeted at problems of resource disruption facing line ministries. One
       technical assistance project was intended to strengthen the Attaché Financial Management Information
       System (FMIS) and expand access to line agencies. This would have allowed daily tracking of
       expenditures, avoiding over-commitment of expenditure warrants and the need for Ministries to
       withhold payment orders submitted by expenditure units. While progress was made in a number of
       areas – notably in bank reconciliations through the establishment of a separate Access-based system –
       the project was not successful in expanding the use of Attaché outside MFED due to persistent problems
       with meeting IT requirements, inadequate capacity to effectively utilize the system, and limited buy-in
       from line ministry staff. A new project focusing on treasury systems was implemented in 2014. This
       project was critical of the use of Attaché software, a system that was primarily designed for small to
       medium sized commercial businesses. The project commented that Attaché fell short of each
       functionality criterion for a government accounting system. The use of Attaché has significantly
       impeded PFM reforms in Kiribati.

       Various informal efforts were made to accelerate the processing of payment orders by the Ministry of
       Finance, but without evidence of systematic reduction in payment delays. Sporadic efforts were made
       to address basic system failures, including the weaknesses of the TELMO system and reliance on the
       unreliable mail system, but these were ultimately unsuccessful given limited internet connectivity, and
       resource constraints to meeting hardware requirements. No payroll system reforms were undertaken to
       reduce delays in salary payments following staff movements.

      Several major reforms were attempted to address problems of technical inefficiency within line
       ministry operations. A procurement review was undertaken by a major donor, providing
       recommendations for strengthening procurement rules and processes. The major recommendation of
       the review, however, was the outsourcing of all major procurement services, which attracted strong
       political opposition. As a result, little progress was made against any of the major recommendations.
       Some respondents argued that the establishment of a separate, donor financed and TA-supported
       procurement unit within MFED to deal with procurements for major infrastructure projects reduced the
       incentive for government to strengthen its own systems. However, the successful operations of this
       unit does demonstrate the need for a centralized procurement system for all procurement within the
       Ministry of Finance.
       Substantial effort was also dedicated to improving audit functions, to increase accountability for
       resource use and reduce incidence of wastage and corruption. The capacity of the Kiribati National
       Audit Office (KNAO) was substantially strengthened, and a backlog of audits reduced. With a weak
       public accounts committee and no evidence of the legislature or the executive taking action on audit
       recommendations, outcome-level impacts of this reform remain to be realized.

      Additional reforms were pursued to deal with weak alignment between public expenditure and
       policy priorities. Initial attempts to introduce an output-based budgeting approach in the 1990s were
       too complex and were not maintained. Substantial effort has been expended over several years to
       implement a medium-term expenditure framework, with the budget including three-year projections at
       the line-item level. A medium-term fiscal model has been developed, incorporating macroeconomic
       and revenue projections, and was intended to be populated with out-year expenditure information from
       budget initiatives. Improvements could be made to the system with better out-year estimates provide
       by line Ministries. Execution of the annual budget remains weak below ministry level and annual
       expenditures and revenues vary substantially from ceilings established in Medium-Term Expenditure
       Frameworks (MTEFs) (see Box 2).

       Institutional reforms within the budget office were more successful in improving the alignment between
       plans and budgets. Under an international advisor with line management responsibilities and financed
       by a donor agency, the National Economic Planning Office was restructured so that budget officers
       were responsible for both planning and budgeting functions for a cluster of ministries, rather than
       dividing the planning and budgeting functions. This reform was widely considered to have ensured
       ministry annual plans were more commensurate with resource availability and allocations.
       Recently, efforts have been made to improve the realism of annual budget allocations, with the Ministry
       of Finance liaising closely with line ministry staff to identify upcoming expenditure pressures and have
       them reflected in annual allocations. Adjustments are now made for previous over- or under-spending,
       and for new policy proposals. Prior to this, annual allocations were based on allocations in previous
       years, rather than on actual resource use, leading to wide divergence between budget and actual
       expenditure at below-ministry level. This simple measure has improved budget formation, leading to
       some improvements in execution as major cost pressures are known in advance.

PFM reforms to address challenges to fiscal sustainability

      Several reforms were implemented to improve revenue predictability and performance. One
       donor financed a long-term tax administration advisor to help address the decline in tax compliance
       and collection, and initial improvements in systems yielded some good results. In 2012, however, at

14
       the urging of development partners and consistent with the recommendations of several technical
       assistance reports, government moved to introduce a value-added tax (VAT) within short timeframes.
       Policy preparation and administrative preparation for the introduction of the VAT absorbed a large
       proportion of tax office capacity, and most of the tax advisor’s time (who had been hired to provide tax
       administration rather than policy advice). Uneven understanding of the new tax within the executive,
       and in the context of upcoming elections, led to the introduction of several exemptions which
       effectively eliminated expected revenue gains. Introduction of the VAT, however, has incentivized
       improved compliance with company tax requirements, leading to some recovery of company tax
       revenues in 2015.
       As a first step towards improved information flows between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry
       of Fisheries, the two ministries jointly produced and published a public report regarding fishing license
       fee revenue developments in 2014. A similar report was produced for 2015 with technical assistance
       support. At the time of the research visit, there was some evidence of improved information flows,
       including monthly reconciliation of revenue received. However, there is little improvement in the
       accuracy of MFEP’s fisheries revenue projections.
       No substantial reform efforts have so far been dedicated to improving customs performance, although
       a new in-line technical assistant was mooted at the time of the field visit to assist Customs management
       including legislative reform.

      Several PFM reform initiatives were implemented to address unplanned and expensive
       borrowing. On the advice of development partners, the Ministry of Finance drew down on the RERF
       to clear expensive overdraft balances and some outstanding SOE debt. A debt policy was agreed by
       Cabinet and has been effectively implemented, preventing new accumulation of commercial debt and
       instituting requirements for approval of all borrowing at the level of Cabinet and the President’s office.
       The adoption of the new debt policy was not an easy process, however, with an initial debt policy
       drafted by development partners being rejected on the basis that it was overly complex and unfeasible
       within current capacity constraints.

       A short-term technical assistance mission was also mobilized to provide advice on managing RERF
       drawdowns. This TA recommended the establishment of a cash buffer through a once-off transfer of
       RERF resources to manage cash-flows. Fiscal rules could then be implemented to preserve the RERF

15
       without the need for drawdowns to meet short-term cash management needs. No action was taken on
       these recommendations, reflecting limited policy dialogue on recommendations, and the presence of
       different political views regarding the appropriate frequency and extent of RERF drawdowns.

       One development partner provided technical assistance on institutional and system reforms to improve
       debt management, and recommendations have been implemented. Limited priority was initially
       ascribed to improving debt management given perceptions that risks were limited by the simple debt
       portfolio comprising a small number of highly concessional loans. Since early 2014, MFED has taken
       important steps towards implementation of the debt management reform recommendations under the
       leadership of an international advisor holding an in-line management position. Among other things, a
       full debt database has been established and debt information included in budget documents and the
       MFED Annual Report. Cabinet is also provided with a regular assessment of the debt situation in
       Kiribati.

      Ambitious governance reforms were implemented to address the weak financial management of
       SOEs. Broad SOE reforms were implemented over the period. These were intended to improve the
       financial management of SOEs and reduce their drain on the budget, improve the quality of services
       they provided, and allow for selected divestment of those SOEs not serving a public good function. An
       early step was passage of a new SOE law which borrowed heavily from New Zealand’s SOE
       framework. The new law: i) commercialized designated SOEs by establishing legal requirements that
       they operate on commercial terms; ii) established a formal process for budgeting and gaining approval
       for Community Service Obligations (CSOs); iii) introduced requirements that SOEs produce a
       Corporate Plan and Statement of Corporate Objectives to be agreed-upon with the government; iv)
       established an independent committee to advise on the selection of SOE directors; v) established rules
       for director eligibility to prevent conflicts of interest in SOE management; and vi) established a Public
       Enterprise Review and Monitoring Unit within the MFED with responsibility for monitoring SOE
       performance, coordinating technical assistance to reforms, and overseeing future divestments and
       restructuring.
       Largely as the result of technical assistance, financial management and reporting of SOEs has
       improved. Many aspects of the governance model, however, remain unevenly implemented. The
       Ministry of Finance has exerted substantial energy in ensuring compliance with board membership

16
       requirements, but faces important challenges in finding board members with adequate skills. SOEs lack
       the capacity to meet full documentation requirements under the new legislation without ongoing
       technical assistance. While Community Service Obligations were formally established and funded with
       a line in the annual budget, Cabinet continues to consider requests for financial assistance from SOEs
       on an ad hoc and as-needed basis (although capped within the total allocation for CSOs within the
       budget). Recent data shows that the overall fiscal burden from SOEs has declined.
       Several SOEs were privatized, including a trade store and the telecommunications utility. Privatization
       of the telecommunications utility was an important success and was supported by long-term technical
       assistance.
       Work was initiated to improve the efficiency of SOEs involved in the copra sector through a
       restructuring of involved entities. Production subsidies for copra were imposing large costs on
       government generating strong political support for reform of the sector. While technical assistance
       support led to the realization of some efficiency gains in the sector, the fiscal savings were quickly
       offset by increases in the regulated price of copra paid by government to growers, in the lead up to
       elections.

      Additional reforms were implemented to address the weak performance of RERF asset
       managers. Recent RERF reforms began with a substantial analytical report delivered to the Ministry
       of Finance in 2011 by a multilateral development agency. The analysis included in the report, however,
       was highly technical, and recommendations proved beyond the implementation capacity of MFED.
       From 2012, another donor provided a sustained program of technical assistance to implement a range
       of changes largely in accordance with the recommendations of the initial report. This culminated with
       the governments’ decision in early 2015 to replace both asset managers, with new asset managers
       operating under revised and more-appropriate investment strategies. It remains unclear whether
       improvements in monitoring will be sustained after the current program of technical assistance expires,
       but reforms to date have had an important impact in reducing government’s inappropriate exposure to
       investment risks.

Box 2: Assessing medium-term budget credibility

Kiribati has implemented a medium-term budget framework since the 2010 budget. Aggregate revenue
projections have been rendered highly inaccurate by unexpectedly strong fishing revenue performance.
In the context of rapidly increasing revenues, the aggregate and ministry-level expenditure projections
have been consistently surpassed. Accuracy of projections has been further undermined by unexpected
debt servicing obligations driven by SOE debt and use of the cash overdraft facility (see above).

Inefficiency and ineffectiveness in services       Lack of public accountability        Rapid debt accumulation


Two main development challenges were identified as most-pressing over the research period by those
interviewed in Tonga. These challenges were: i) inefficiency and ineffectiveness in service delivery; and
ii) weak public accountability over public resource use. Some of those interviewed were also concerned
about recent unsustainable accumulation of public debt. In this section we describe the PFM-related
problems contributing to these challenges, and assess the extent to which PFM reform efforts have been
targeted towards addressing these problems.
            2.2.1. What PFM problems are constraining development in Tonga?
Tonga enjoys strong social outcomes, but may have scope to improve efficiency in service delivery.
Tonga does not face major problems in service delivery, especially if considered relative to Kiribati. Health
and education have long been government priorities, and social indicators were already strong at
independence. Primary school enrolment rates, for example, were nearly 90% in 1970, and subsequently
increased to over 95%. Literacy is effectively universal, life expectancy at birth is around 72 years and
absolute poverty rates are close to zero. As a result, the 2015 Human Development Index ranks Tonga third
only to Palau and Fiji among small island countries in the Pacific. Despite these strong indicators, the
authorities believed that further progress was both possible and necessary, and cited inefficiency and
ineffectiveness in public service delivery as important PFM-related constraints to further development over
the research period.

Strong social outcomes were supported by generally well-functioning PFM systems, but some
weaknesses were undermining efficiency. Tonga did not suffer from the same weaknesses as Kiribati in
terms of basic accounting and reporting systems. Payments were made in a timely fashion – The Ministry
of Finance and National Planning (MFNP)’s 2015/16 Corporate Plan claims that 70% of eligible vouchers
were paid within a day in 2014/15. Cash management is supported by large cash buffers in government
accounts (although cash reserves were at precariously low levels during the early years of the research
period). MFNP is able to maintain aggregate fiscal control. Resources can be tracked through the financial
management system to the service delivery level. However, our analysis of PFM systems – drawing on the
PEFA assessment, interviews, and review of budget and other formal documentation – suggested that there
are some weaknesses that may be constraining service delivery:

      Poor alignment between resource allocation and policy priorities. Expenditure analysis showed
       some important weaknesses in budget execution in Tonga are undermining the capacity of government
       to utilize resource in line with plans and priorities. The PEFA self-assessment for 2014 showed that
       expenditure deviations were generally within 5% of the original budget, in aggregate. However, as the

24
       budget is disaggregated it becomes less credible. At the line level, actual expenditures commonly
       exceeded the allocated budget by more than 50 percent. In aggregate, ministries consistently spent
       above or below the budget for some items, as shown in Figure 19, including daily paid staff, travel
       allowances, and maintenance. Similar patterns of consistent over-expenditure were also present at the
       ministry level, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Palace Office and Ministry of Education
       consistently overspending (Figure 20). The following underlying PFM dysfunctions were considered
       to have contributed to these problems:
           o Weak budget formation. Line ministries cited weaknesses in budget preparation as a cause
               for weak budget execution. From the perspective of line ministries, increases and reductions in
               allocations often seemed arbitrary. With inadequate consultation, allocations for new programs
               or specific needs were often scaled down without apparent awareness of indivisibilities or
               economies of scale. As in Kiribati, annual budgets were prepared on the basis of the previous
               years’ budget, and have not systematically taken account of in-year execution.
           o Weak controls over transfers. Following the implementation of ‘program budgeting’, MFNP
               relinquished control over resource use below program level, and MFNP staff are no longer
               required to approve transfers at that level. While MFNP staff appreciated the reduction in time
               commitment to approving transfers, this change – in the absence of strong accountability at the
               ministry or division level – may have contributed to problems of weak alignment between
               policies and budgets. Partly due to these concerns, controls over transfers at the sub-program
               level were reintroduced in 2014.

      Inadequate revenues. Total tax revenues in Tonga were cited as a concern for several stakeholders.
       Tax revenue in Tonga, while around the average for small states, remain well below that of neighboring
       comparator countries, Fiji and Samoa. Large tax expenditures were cited as an important contributor to
       this problem, with tax exemptions imposing large revenue costs while bringing little economic benefit.

25
         Tonga provided a fairly broad range of tax exemptions, mostly applied at the border. These included
         exemptions for aid projects, electricity generation, and goods consumed by the Royal family (Figure
         22). PFTAC estimated the value of these exemptions at nearly TOP45 million over the two years to
         August, 2011. The process for granting exemptions was also problematic, requiring only an Order in
         Council, rather than full parliamentary approval.

        Technical inefficiency in expenditure. Respondents cited concerns regarding the efficiency and
         accountability of resource use by line ministries and expenditure units. There were widespread
         perceptions that low-quality expenditures, including overtime payments and travel, were squeezing
         resources available for service delivery. Several underlying PFM dysfunctions were reported to have
         contributed to this problem, including:
             o Weak procurement. Some respondents noted a lack of competition and potential for nepotism
                 in procurement processes. Weaknesses in procurement practices were confirmed by a DFAT-
                 financed review, which found nearly none of the procurements in the review sample had been
                 carried out in accordance with formal rules. Few respondents, however, considered corruption
                 to have in fact been a major issue or constraint to service delivery even if improved
                 procurement could have achieved better value for money.
             o Limited accountability for efficiency. As discussed below, external accountability
                 mechanisms were generally considered to be weak. While audits were carried out, follow-up
                 action on audit recommendations was limited, while information and data to track efficiency
                 in delivering outputs and achieving outcomes was typically absent. More fundamentally, also
                 discussed below, some respondents considered that Tonga was yet to develop a culture of civil
                 society and public oversight, given the long history of monarchy and limited experience with
                 democratic institutions.
A lack of public accountability over public expenditure decisions may also be constraining
development. Tonga has recently undergone major political transition. After a long period monarchy,
Tonga’s first fully democratic elections were held in 2010 and 2014 (IDEA 2015). While political
institutions have been reformed, some argued that fiscal institutions remain non-transparent, with decision-

26
making powers too narrowly concentrated with the executive, and with little opportunity for public
oversight. Understanding of the roles and functions of different government institutions remains unevenly
understood at all levels. These problems are thought to both contribute to resource allocation decisions that
do not fully align with public needs and interests, and prevent the deepening of political inclusion and
participation under a newly democratic system.

There are some weaknesses in existing PFM systems that may have contributed to weaknesses in
public accountability and legislative oversight. Tonga’s PFM system is well-functioning. Most of the
processes required under standard Westminster models of governance are followed, and associated
documentation produced and published. There are, however, some areas where existing PFM processes are
less facilitative of public oversight than would be ideal:

     Despite sound formal processes, accountability through audit mechanisms is limited. Financial
      reports are prepared that allow the comparison of budgets and actual expenditures, and these are audited
      by the Tonga Audit Office which has been made independent of the executive. Disagreements between
      the Audit Office and MFNP mean that audit reports can take a long time to be finalized, but the financial
      reports are mostly compliant with international standards and the audit is debated in the Public
      Accounts Committee of the legislature before being published. However, in practice, the external
      oversight functions are still weak within the new democratic context, and play a relatively small role in
      enforcing accountability for public finances. At the time of writing, the Public Accounts Committee
      was dominated by Government, and understanding of its role among members was uneven. One senior
      MFNP official suggested that there are few “difficult questions” on the budget and the 2014 PEFA
      assessment concludes that “follow up on audit recommendations is weak and could be strengthened
      through more awareness at the CEO and Minister’s level of the financial risks involved”.

     Public access to fiscal information has been limited. Several respondents stated that the Tongan
      public lack information with which to hold government adequately accountable for resource use. There
      is some evidence to support this view. Tonga scored a ‘C’ against the PEFA indicator measuring public
      access to key fiscal information, with only one of the recommended six ‘good practice’ criteria met.
      While year-end financial statements were made available to the public, the budget was not published
      until approved by parliament, audited financial statements of government were published later than
      required, no in-year budget execution reports were initially produced, no details of contract awards
      were published, and no information was available regarding resources available to service delivery
      units.
Some stakeholders reported concern regarding rapid debt accumulation in Tonga. Following the
political turmoil of the mid-2000s, Tonga contracted two loans from EXIM Bank China in 2007 and 2010
for roads and the reconstruction of Nuku’alofa. As a result of these loans, external debt increased from
negligible levels to nearly 50% of GDP in 2013 (IMF 2015). The contracting of these loans appears to have
reflected a clear political decision, and does not appear to reflect weaknesses in PFM processes. Following
the contracting of these loans and subsequent concerns regarding debt sustainability, Tonga implemented a
de facto “no new borrowing” policy which has only been softened over recent years to allow for highly

27
concessional borrowing from multilaterals for Cabinet-approved, high-priority projects. In general, the
Government has been able to implement measures which maintain fiscal stability even during periods of
political and economic uncertainty, and the country remains at only “moderate” risk of debt distress under
the World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Framework.
         2.2.2. Have the right PFM reform efforts targeted the right problems in Tonga?
In this section we discuss PFM reforms implemented in Tonga. We discuss these reforms in terms of:
i) the extent to which reforms targeted and adequately addressed the main PFM problems constraining
development, including identification of important PFM problems left unaddressed; ii) the extent to which
reforms were weakened or undermined by capacity constraints; and iii) the extent to which reforms were
suited to the political context and reflected the political priorities of government.
PFM reform measures to address weaknesses in service delivery

    Several initiatives were taken to strengthen the alignment of expenditure with government policy
     priorities. A range of “strategic budgeting” reforms were pursued in Tonga, including the introduction
     of requirements for medium-term budgeting and ministry corporate planning.
         o Medium-term budgeting. While utilizing a top-down Medium-Term Fiscal Framework
             (MTFF) since 2005/06, development partners allocated substantial resources to supporting
             development of a bottom-up full medium-term budget framework from 2011, with all
             ministries required to provide fully-costed 3-year projections at line-item level for all existing
             and new policy commitments. These expenditure projections were to be situated within a
             rolling medium-term fiscal framework, involving various fiscal targets informed by a
             macroeconomic model. Initial moves towards output budgeting were implemented, with
             increased inclusion of output information in corporate plans, and ministries gaining discretion
             over use of resources at the program level. At the time of research these reforms had made little
             tangible impact on budget management. In interviews medium-term budgets were hardly
             mentioned by MFNP or line ministry officials, but those who did also noted that budgeting
             remains focused on the next financial year only. As in Kiribati, there is large variation between
             budget and actual expenditure at the below-ministry level on an annual basis, expenditure
             projections included in previous-year medium-term budgets were generally ignored, and the
             budget process remained focus on current year pressures (See Box 3). The combination of
             limited output information with increased discretion over resource use were thought by some
             respondents to have had some perverse outcomes in terms of increased expenditure on
             persistently overspent ‘low quality’ items such as overtime, allowances, and travel.
         o Corporate planning. Corporate plans were clearly a more visible document, and were
             intended to provide performance information on outputs and outcomes to inform allocation
             decisions and build accountability to the executive, parliament, and the public. Several
             respondents claimed that preparation of corporate plans had proven disruptive and absorbed
             substantial time and capacity. Corporate plans are now submitted to Parliament each year, but
             officials in MFNP and line ministries claimed that these were not aligned with either the
             national development plan or the budget. Development partners have recently sought to support
             government in simplifying the content and format of corporate plans to reduce the capacity
             burden.

      Additional reforms were introduced to address revenue inadequacy.
          o Revenue administration technical assistance. Substantial long-term in-line technical
              assistance was provided to both the Inland Revenue and customs divisions to strengthen core
              administration procedures and processes, including strengthening compliance and taxpayer
              services functions. This technical assistance was highly valued by government and delivered
              improvements in compliance. Some development partners were concerned about the
              sustainability of gains, with in-line advisors fulfilling core functions rather than building local
              capacity.
          o Exemptions transparency. As a condition for joint-donor budget support, the Ministry of
              Finance began publishing details of tax expenditures in the annual budget in 2011. This
              increased transparency, however, did not have any major impact or lead to increased political
              scrutiny, attracting little attention from the public accounts committee, the legislature or the
              public. Perhaps reflecting limited demand for the inclusions of this information, it was dropped
              from budget documents from 2013.

Box 3: Assessing MTEF credibility in Tonga

Comparison of medium-term budget projections and actual expenditures in Tonga shows large variance
at the aggregate and line ministry level. As in Kiribati, conservative expenditure projections have been
outstripped by rapid expenditure growth, with expenditure increasing by 18 percent and 12 percent in
2014/15 and 2015/16 respectively, relative to no increases under the 2013/14 expenditure framework.

At the level of line ministries, the Ministry of Health experienced substantial budgeted expenditure growth
relative to projected declines, while budgeted recurrent expenditure under the Ministry of Education
increased significantly less than projected in 2014/15 and significantly more than projected in 2015/16.

    Several reforms were introduced to improve technical efficiency in the operation of ministries.
        o Procurement review and reform, including establishment of centralized procurement
            unit. A procurement reform plan was developed with donor support and procurement
            subsequently centralized in the Procurement Division of MFNP for amounts in excess of TOP
            7,500. In contrast to the model proposed for procurement reform in Kiribati, recommendations
            for Tonga did not involve full outsourcing, but rather the establishment of a separate internal
            unit supported by development partner technical assistance. The reforms drew substantial
            criticism from line ministries during interviews. While some suggested that procurement had
            been an area of abuse in the past, especially on larger contracts, many officials did not see why
            reform was needed and thought reforms were being implemented because “donors think we are
            corrupt”. Officials also claimed that the new unit did not initially have the capacity to manage
            their requests, leading to delays, and some ministries were not fully informed of new
            procedures and responsibilities. The MFNP responded to requests from line ministries for the
            thresholds to be raised and provided clarification over what constituted emergency
            procurement, and greater flexibility to meet urgent demands.
             It is not possible to state conclusively if these reforms have had an impact on the value for
             money of procurement itself. The PEFA indicator (PI-19) was marked down in the 2014 self-
             assessment, but this is not a good indicator of procurement functionality, and the lower score
             was partly due to inconsistencies in the legal framework and because the independent
             complaints body had not yet been set up. More certain is that the new processes are becoming
             more accepted and compliance is improving, even if some ministries continue to flout
             procedure. The MFNP reports compliance with formal processes has increased by 10 percent
             between FY2014 and FY2015. As reforms become more embedded it is possible that the new
             systems will deliver better value for money in procurement which could free up resources for
             improving service delivery. However, it is too early in the reform process to make such
             conclusions, especially without better indicators of procurement functionality.
         o   Strengthened audit capacity and independence. The Audit Act was revised in 2007 to move
             the Auditor General from the executive to the legislature, then in 2012 to place audit staff under
             the responsibility of the Auditor General, independent from the government. The budget for
             the Tonga Audit Office was also increased to allow it to fulfil its responsibilities, though there
             have been challenges finding suitably qualified auditors. Support provided through PASAI
             built capacity to undertake performance audits.
             The Tonga Audit Office has welcomed these reforms, and the Minister and Public Accounts
             Committee were quick to identify this as an important reform area. However, auditors did not
             think that its independence has led to any greater follow-up on audit queries and
             recommendations. The Public Accounts Committee were not fully familiar with the specific
             benefits of performance audits (relative to financial audits), and claimed such approaches
             needed to be “translated into the Tongan language” to be useful within the Tongan context.

Reforms to improve public accountability

      Several reform were introduced to improve fiscal and budget transparency. For the FY2012/13
       budget process, and as a condition of donor budget support, a complete set of budget documents were
       able to be obtained by the public through the Ministry of Finance website at the time it was submitted
       to the legislature. In the FY2013/14 budget, however, while the approved budget was made publicly
       available, the budget proposal was not made publicly available. In-year budget execution reports were
       prepared and routinely made available to the public on the Ministry of Finance website (within one
       month of their completion) until the second half of FY2012/13, again as a condition for budget support.
       This practice ceased when staff changes led to delays in the preparation of reports and staff capacity
       was diverted during the budget process, amid significant staff turnover and several vacancies. It is not
       clear that this information was ever used by the legislature or general public, and we could find no
       evidence of public awareness that the information had become available, or that publication had ceased.

      Substantial effort was dedicated to strengthening audit functions. As discussed above, audit
       strengthening efforts did not lead to increased legislative accountability or substantial changes in
       practices or performance. Recent developments point to the possibility of future progress, however,
       with a Cabinet Audit Oversight Committee established in 2015 (as a condition for donor budget
       support), and the Ministry of Internal Affairs being provided with additional resources to promote civil
       society development. Reforms in this area have arguably served as an important signal – to Tongans
       and to development partners – of commitment to change and “good governance”. This signifier of
       “good governance” was widely recognized by donors and achieved with relative ease, arguably because
       it did not fundamentally change the behavior of other parts of the bureaucracy.

Reforms to address rapid debt accumulation

         Debt management reforms were pursued, but lacked a clear linkage to debt sustainability
          challenges. Tonga accessed two standard debt management technical assistance products over the
          period: a debt management reform plan mission and a medium-term debt strategy mission. The
          debt reform plan provided a long list of recommendations for strengthening debt management
          practices and procedures, including policy and institutional reforms within the debt management
          office. The medium-term debt strategy was intended to support the Ministry of Finance assessing
          its financing options and identifying a suitable mix of debt instruments to meet financing needs.
          Follow-through on debt management reform plan recommendations was limited. While the
          medium-term debt strategy was recently agreed by Cabinet, its core recommendations of restraining
          borrowing to concessional lenders while pursuing domestic debt market development were
          arguably unsurprising, and had little immediate operational impact. The debt management unit
          lacks the capacity to update the strategy to reflect current fiscal policy.

Box 7: Was medium-term budgeting an appropriate priority in case study countries?

World Bank analysis has shown that medium-term budgeting can have a positive impact on fiscal
outcomes and resource allocation to vital social sectors (World Bank 2013). The use of medium-term
budget frameworks, with medium-term projections prepared down to the line-item level, could also
theoretically be very helpful in case study countries in supporting improved budget formation and thereby
budget execution. By preparing such forecasts based on detailed understanding of exogenous cost
pressures (such as demographic change), the implications of new policy measures, and the “tail costs”
of capital investments, policy makers can gain a greater understanding of available fiscal space and the
medium-term implications of current budgeting decisions.

In the case of case study countries, however, it is not clear that medium-term budgets as they were
implemented were likely to achieve the potential benefits. Aggregate fiscal discipline was not being
undermined so much by unforeseen expenditure pressures arising from past government policy
decisions as from poor revenue forecasting and in-year ad hoc expenditure decisions (including through
the allocation of ‘contingency funds’ in Tonga and allocation of persistent windfall fisheries license fee
revenue in Kiribati).

Both countries faced major weaknesses in annual budget execution at the ministry, program, and line-
item level. Underspending occurred against lines where expenditure forecasting should have been
possible without detailed medium-term projections (e.g. salaries). Overspending occurred against items
for which ministries would be expected to have considerable discretion such as temporary staff, overtime,
and allowances (Government of Kiribati and World Bank 2012). As the Pacific PFM Roadmap has stated
“a system that cannot accurately forecast resources on an annual basis is unlikely to be able to have
success at planning a number of years into the future” (PFTAC 2010).

Overall, it is not clear that medium-term budgeting was the best solution to the most pressing problems
faced by case-study countries during the period of analysis. Improving budget execution could have been
achieved in a number of ways, including strengthening revenue forecasting, ensuring that costs of debt
servicing and SOE bailouts were being accurately projected and budgeted for, and implementing controls
to prevent ad hoc reallocations at below-ministry level. Building some basic understanding of medium-
term cost pressures within line ministries and introducing a credible medium-term fiscal framework could
have been useful initial steps before medium-term budgeting at the line-item level.

    3. Conclusions from the Case Studies
In this section we draw conclusions from the case studies presented above. We summarize lessons from
examples of successful reform. We assess recent efforts to further strengthen PFM systems in terms of their
consistency with PFTAC recommendations that such reforms should: i) reflect country priorities; ii) take
account of country constraints, including capacity constraints; and iii) have strong country ownership and
take political dimensions into account.

     3.1. What worked well?
PFM systems are functional in both Tonga and Kiribati, reflecting investment over many years by
governments and development partners. Budgets in both countries provide a reasonably reliable plan for
how much will be spent in aggregate and by which ministry (although plans become much less reliable at
below-ministry level). Salaries and most payments are generally paid on time, despite limited banking, IT
and communications infrastructure. Corruption and fraud are limited in both countries, but there are
important concerns regarding inefficiencies.
Much has been achieved through recent PFM reform efforts in both case study countries. Over the
period under examination, both countries managed to implement reforms that significantly impacted
development outcomes. Perhaps because the macroeconomic challenges faced by Kiribati were so daunting,
the success of several PFM reforms is very clear, including reforms to debt management, management of
the RERF, and some reforms in the SOE sector (such as privatization of the telecommunications utility). In
Tonga, improvements in procurement are likely to have led to some improvement in value-for-money in
public expenditure, while audit reforms supported increased confidence among development partners.
Reforms that were well-targeted, consistent with capacity, and enjoyed political support generally
achieved their objectives. There is a very clear correlation between reforms that were judged to meet the
three key recommendations presented in the Roadmap and those that were effective. Around a third of the
reforms assessed across both country case studies were considered to have been fully consistent with the
Roadmap recommendations and all of these reforms were also judged effective in achieving their intended
outcome (although for two reforms gains were not, or have not yet been shown to have been, sustained).
This demonstrates the continued relevance of the initial PFTAC recommendations. These reforms varied
in terms of their areas of engagement, objectives, and approaches but seem to provide some useful lessons:

    Progress did not necessarily require high-level policy changes. The sustained presence of
     international advisors led to important improvements within existing policy settings. Examples from
     Kiribati include improvements in tax administration, the reorganization of the National Economic
     Planning Office to integrate budgeting and planning, and improved systems for account reconciliation.
     In Tonga, in-line assistance to tax and customs administration delivered important gains.

    Technical assistance reports had impact only when followed by implementation support. In the
     case of RERF reform in Kiribati and procurement reform in Tonga, initial short-term technical
     assistance delivered sound analysis but achieved limited immediate results. This reflected limited
     government capacity to implement technical reforms. It was only when analysis and recommendations
     were picked up by subsequent technical assistance providers with the resources to support government
     through required reform processes that important gains were achieved.



37
    Crises can spur action. The context of declining RERF balances and rapidly accumulating expensive
     overdraft debt in Kiribati was an important factor in mobilizing political support for reforms. Success
     with debt policy and RERF management reforms may have reflected deep concerns among policy-
     makers regarding RERF losses during the Global Economic Crisis and the pressing need to return to a
     sustainable fiscal situation.

     3.2. Were PFM reform efforts targeted towards the right areas?
PFM reforms in Kiribati and Tonga were generally targeted to broad areas relevant to development
constraints. It is clear that governments and development partners were to some extent strategic in devoting
resources to particular reform areas, and conscious of how weaknesses in broad areas of PFM contribute to
broader development problems. In Kiribati, government and development partners clearly recognized that
improvements in expenditure quality and aligning expenditures with policy priorities was vital for
addressing key weaknesses in service delivery, while improving revenues and debt management was
important for fiscal sustainability. In Tonga, reform efforts generally focused on weaknesses in alignment
between expenditure and policy priorities and the overall desire to improve public accountability.
Within each of these broad problem areas, however, there was sometimes a weaker link between
specific PFM problems and the reforms pursued. While reforms were responding to real problems at a
broad strategic level, development partners sometimes recommended broad, system-wide and “packaged”
reform models that extended well beyond (or sometimes even omitted) the often relatively simple PFM
dysfunction directly causing the observed problem. Development partners sometimes focused on
implementing new policies, processes, and systems, rather than devoting efforts to repairing existing
systems. The team estimates that around two thirds of reforms in Kiribati had a strong and direct link to the
specific PFM dysfunctions contributing to major development challenges, while a similar proportion had
some link in Tonga (Figure 27 and Figure 28). For example:

    A perception that public debt was a cause of concern in Tonga led to fairly technically advanced reform
     efforts to build debt management institutions and optimize borrowing strategy, despite very simple debt
     portfolios and very limited debt management capacity (two junior officers). Staff of the debt
     management office viewed their role as primarily administrative (processing repayments) and were
     typically not consulted on policy decisions regarding new borrowing or borrowing options. The primary
     (and fundamentally political) problem of politicians contracting loans without proper process and
     analysis was largely managed through high-level engagement by development partners at the political
     level.

    In Kiribati, SOE reforms involved implementation of an entire new governance model based on OECD
     experience, including boards of directors and relatively elaborate reporting and accountability systems.
     Implementation of this model imposed substantial capacity burden on the Ministry of Finance, which
     was forced to constantly enforce rules regarding board membership and reporting requirements.
     Problems of poor financial management could arguably have been addressed more directly through
     simpler financial management technical support to distressed SOEs.

    Attempts to implement medium-term budgeting in both countries had only limited linkage to immediate
     resource allocation problems in contexts where annual budget execution was very weak and revenue
     projections highly inaccurate (as was especially the case in Kiribati). Neither country systematically
     quantified the out-year expenditure implications of policy and capital investment decisions, nor
     adequately funded maintenance of capital projects and infrastructure. But the implementation of

38
     medium-term budgets was neither a necessary nor sufficient response to this challenge. Simpler systems
     for recording recurrent cost implications of major expenditure decisions could have been implemented
     with reduced capacity demand and potentially greater potential for sustainability (an excel spreadsheet
     of the small number of major projects and programs with inflexible and substantial ongoing expenditure
     implications could have been established within the Ministry of Finance).

While the reforms that were pursued often targeted important problems, several important problems
were also left unaddressed. In Kiribati, analysis undertaken by the Ministry of Finance showed major
problems with tax and customs compliance. Initial technical assistance to improving tax administration was
largely distracted by the process of VAT implementation. No technical assistance was provided to customs
administration. In both countries, substantial effort was allocated to establishing medium-term budgeting
and planning frameworks (including through medium-term budgeting in both countries and the corporate
planning process in Tonga), when a range of problems continued to undermine annual budget execution,
including persistent over-appropriation to salaries, inaccurate revenue projections in Kiribati, and use of
the ‘contingency fund’ to provide appropriation for ad hoc in-year policy decisions in Tonga.

     3.3. Did PFM reform efforts take account of capacity constraints?
Capacity constraints often undermined implementation across both countries. Development partners
and government sometimes did not take adequate account of capacity constraints and the need for systems
and processes that were robust to uneven and variable capacity. Nearly half of the reforms attempted in
Kiribati and Tonga were significantly impacted by capacity constraints (Figure 29 and Figure 30). Capacity
constraints were encountered for two different reasons. Firstly, in both countries, there were instances in
which a large number of reforms being pursued simultaneously placed an unrealistic capacity burden on
government officials. This led to reforms remaining unimplemented or incompletely implemented, or
heavily reliant on the continued presence of international technical assistance. Because reforms were
typically intended to achieve sustainability over short time horizons, reversals sometimes occurred
following the withdrawal of technical assistance. In both countries, reforms in one area sometimes diverted
capacity from other reforms or core business in central agencies, undermining previous or parallel efforts.

As well as too many reforms being pursued, some reforms were too complex. Some of the reforms
recommended or attempted in case study countries were excessively complex given lack of specialized staff
and absolute constraints on staff time and numbers. For example:

      Attempts to roll out medium-term budgeting at the line level relied on macroeconomic forecasting
       capacity within the Ministry of Finance and systems to record out-year expenditure pressures within
       line ministries. At the time the reforms were implemented these underpinning capacities were not
       established.

      In Tonga, compliance requirements for corporate planning, including specification of intervention
       logics and output and outcome indicators often proved too complex for line ministry staff, necessitating
       extensions of and continued reliance on international technical assistance.

      Initial recommendations for improved management of the RERF trust fund in Kiribati were too
       complex to be absorbed by officials with responsibility in those areas. Recommendations initially
       included in a comprehensive report provided by a multilateral development agency remained
       unimplemented for nearly three years until they could be translated into specific policy steps through
       subsequent assistance.

       3.4. Did reforms have country ownership and take account of political context?
Some reforms were successful because of strong political support, but others did not adequately
reflect the political-economy context. Several important PFM reforms achieved good results because of
strong political support, including reforms to the RERF in Kiribati and to procurement in Tonga. But around
half of reforms in Tonga and Kiribati were in some way negatively impacted by political economy factors
(Figure 31 and Figure 32). Negative political economy impacts arose through two main channels. Firstly,
some reforms were stalled by direct political opposition or a lack of political support. In some cases this
reflected the fact that technocratic PFM reforms were being progressed by development partners as a
solution to political decisions that they did not agree with (for example, debt management reforms to
address political decisions to contract large external loans, or medium-term budgeting as a solution to

40
political decisions to underinvest in asset maintenance). In other cases, reforms were simply pursued
without high-level political buy-in and without policy-makers understanding the implications or –
sometimes – objectives of reform (for example, the introduction of value-added tax in Kiribati was seriously
impeded by incomplete understanding among Cabinet members of how the tax would work).
Political economy factors were also significant in terms of the implicit intervention logic
underpinning recommended reforms. Reforms were often predicated on unfounded assumptions
regarding the incentives facing policy makers and public employees. Reform plans often relied on
assumptions that state-society relations in case-study countries were similar to those in OECD countries.
This was clearly not the case in several instances:

    Expectations regarding outcomes from strengthening audit capacity in both countries did not reflect the
     reality that such audit findings seldom led to action (which was clearly noted in both PEFA reports).
     Most of those interviewed did not believe that there was strong public pressure for legislators to take
     action on audit recommendations, and did not believe that audit purpose and procedures were widely
     understood by the general public. Similarly, efforts to improve performance through enhanced fiscal
     transparency did not reflect the absence of legislative and public oversight and weakness of civil
     society. Especially in Tonga, extensive efforts were allocated to improving the comprehensiveness of
     budget documents and publish additional fiscal information. The expected audience for this increased
     supply of information was not clear, nor how supplying this information could be expected to lead to
     changes in decisions and outcomes. This is not to say that fiscal transparency measures, including basic
     audit strengthening measures, should not have been pursued. But, firstly, the likely limited short-term
     impact of such measures could have been more explicitly taken into account when considering the
     likely impact and relative priority of such measures. Secondly, such measures could usefully have been
     complemented by broader efforts to engage parliament, the public, and civil society to generate the
     desired accountability relationships. Pursuing standard recommendations to strengthen audit and
     publish more budget information was unlikely to have been enough, on its own, to achieve the outcome
     being sought given the context within which reforms were introduced.

    ‘Strategic budgeting’ agendas were heavily predicated on assumptions that senior officials would be
     motived to deliver on stated goals and targets, presumably due to oversight from politicians who were,
     in turn, held accountable by their electorate for quality in service delivery. Under New Public
     Management logics, the executive was expected to be both capable and inclined to discipline and
     reward well- and poorly-performing ministries through increases or reductions in fiscal allocations. In
     reality, performance had little influence on resource-allocation decisions, with policy-makers generally
     considered to be more concerned with constituency and patrimonial obligations. The capacity of
     Ministers to incentivize high performance among staff of their ministries was similarly weakened by
     cultural and organizational norms, and networks of patronage influencing senior public sector
     appointment and promotion decisions.

The political economy of development support also influenced approaches to PFM reform. The team
interviewed several staff of development agencies and government officials to explore the institutional
incentives influencing provision of PFM technical assistance. While all respondents noted capacity to resist
such incentives to some extent, development partner representatives reported pressures to spend, generating
incentives to establish technical assistance engagements. Spending pressures could be general (the need to
exhaust a country or regional allocations) or specific (the need to access a specific facility or mobilize
assistance in an areas of internal priority). Government representatives, on the other hand, reported being
generally reluctant to turn down assistance of any kind, citing the need to maintain good relationships with
development partners and avoid the risk of ‘losing’ an opportunity to access specialist assistance in any
area. Development agency staff also outlined several factors influencing the type of PFM assistance that
development partners would offer. Representatives of development agencies cited greater ease in obtaining
clearance and resourcing for assistance that: i) took forms that were intelligible to reviewing or senior staff
without familiarity with country context, such as implementation of “packaged” reforms such as medium-
term budgeting or development of a medium-term debt strategy; and ii) relied on a generalized skillset that
could be accessed from easily-available consultants. Further, development partners also sometimes faced
incentives to be able to quantify progress from their interventions, driving a focus on improving PEFA
scores, sometimes with limited consideration of the strength of links between PEFA score improvements
and outcomes.

     3.5. Were PFM reforms adequately planned and coordinated?
Problems with capacity constraints and misalignment with political priorities reflected some
weaknesses in planning. PFM reforms did not follow a plan in either country, possibly contributing to
weaknesses in prioritization and alignment with government priorities. The 2011 Kiribati PFM Reform
Plan included too many reforms to be useful in informing planning, and was generally recognized as
unhelpful by government and development partners (see Box 4). A PFTAC review of the document
identified improving the FMIS and associated business processes as the reform priorities. While the review

42
did not lead to adoption of a revised plan, it did influence reform efforts towards these areas, although
limited progress was ultimately achieved, as described above. In Tonga, a careful and consultative process
was undertaken to develop a PFM reform plan over several years covered by this report, but the final plan
has only recently been endorsed by Cabinet and so did not drive PFM reform planning over the period of
analysis (see Box 5).
As a result of the weaknesses in formal planning processes, both countries relied on de facto planning
mechanisms with varying degrees of success. Economic reform coordination groups, established to
manage budget support and comprising government and representatives from a small group of major donors
providing budget support assistance, played an important de facto role in coordination PFM reforms in both
countries. In Kiribati, for example, reforms to RERF management were largely managed through the
Economic Reform Task Force, with participating donors able to respond to a pressing macroeconomic
challenge identified as a priority by both government and all development partners. In Tonga, specific
revenue policy reforms identified as priorities by both development partners and government were
implemented with technical assistance mobilised through the Budget Support Management Committee
process.
Much technical assistance, however, was provided outside of these processes. Sometimes, such support
was supply-driven and initiated without any opportunity for collective consultation or assessment.
Uncoordinated provision of technical assistance inevitably made it difficult to ensure that reform efforts
were always aligned with the highest relative priorities. The weaknesses of formal prioritisation processes
opened the door for ad hoc requests and “requests for requests” based on different development partners’
specialisations or resource availability. In some extreme instances development partner regional offices
were unaware of the activities being carried out by headquarter-based teams, while in one instance, a senior
official was unaware of the tasks being undertaken by a technical advisor operating within his division.
Development partners had limited opportunity to inform or influence each other’s activit ies. While
regional PFM coordination meetings were held in various formats and locations, some development
partners were concerned that coordination efforts often involved simple information sharing about
respective plans, rather than genuine coordination of activities around shared objectives. Few development
partner representatives reported any capacity to engage sufficiently early in planning processes to
substantively influence other development agencies’ program or project designs. This lack of mutual
oversight may have contributed to instances in which reform efforts were inadequately attuned to country
priorities and contexts, and weakly aligned with ongoing reform efforts.




43
 Box 4: The Kiribati PFM Reform Plan

The Kiribati PFM Reform Plan was completed in draft form in 2011. The reform plan is a simple inversion
of the PEFA. All weaknesses (reasons for not achieving a perfect score) identified in the PEFA
assessment are listed against ‘policy actions’ required to address those weaknesses. These p olicy
actions are both extremely ambitious, and sometimes extremely vague. A weakness, such as “failure to
record expenditure arrears” is listed against a corrective measure such as “record expenditure arrears
[and] ensure arrears stock is modest”. Targets for 2014 are established based on these corrective
measures which, if achieved, would have placed Kiribati among the highest scoring countries globally.
Overall, the PFM reform plan does not function usefully as a plan for three reasons:

          Firstly, it includes a huge range of tasks of activities without prioritization or sequencing. Given
           inevitable capacity and resourcing constraints, a primary function of planning is left unfulfilled.
          Secondly, the plan does not provide any realistic, specific, or practical details regarding how
           outcome goals (such as reducing expenditure arrears) would be achieved. New IT systems,
           revised legislation, and upgraded “systems” are recommended without providing guidance to
           inform a government-led process towards achieving these goals;
          Finally, the plan omits all issues not explicitly raised in the PEFA assessment. For example,
           crucial macroeconomic issues of RERF management and the difficult political questions around
           fiscal sustainability and management of fisheries revenues are simply not addressed.

Box 5: Tonga’s PFM Reform Plan

The more-recent Tonga PFM reform plan represents a significantly more useful document. The higher
quality of the Tonga plan reflects substantial efforts by PFTAC over recent years to ensure government
ownership of reform plans (rather than delivery by external consultants), extensive consultation, and
careful consideration of PFM reform needs based on PEFA assessments and other data.

Substantial thought and consultation has gone into developing very specific and methodological plans
for implementing reforms. Reforms are specified in terms of detailed and carefully sequenced process
steps, rather than just as improvements against outcome indicators. Identification of reform actions is
situated within a clear discussion of the outcome being sought, and a general discussion of progress in
that area over recent years. While the general structure of the document follows the PEFA assessment,
reforms are discussed in more practical terms.

The document, however, could more clearly explain linkages between specific reforms and broader
development or macroeconomic challenges. While the executive summary helpfully identifies IFMIS
upgrading and improved budget execution as key priorities, it is difficult for the reader to identify relative
priorities between remaining listed policy reforms, with reforms with major resource implications (such
as reducing tax expenditures) and those relating to changes in accounting standards (adoption of IPSAS)
given apparently equal weight. The number of reforms included in the plan – over 70 actions to be
completed in the next five years, most of which will require coordination across multiple government
departments – also raises questions regarding both the credibility of the plan and its usefulness in guiding
prioritization beyond the high-level priorities identified in the executive summary.

 4. Recommendations

The analysis above illustrates many achievements but also opportunities for continued improvement.
This report has shown that PFM reforms undertaken by governments with the support of their development
partners helped address important constraints to development in both Kiribati and Tonga. Many reforms
adhered to the guidance articulated in the Pacific PFM Roadmap in 2010, including: i) reflecting country-
specific priorities; ii) taking account of country-specific constraints (including capacity constraints); and
iii) ensuring country ownership and political support. Significant reform effort, however, was also spent on
reforms that were poorly targeted towards major constraints, and therefore had little impact, or could not
be effectively implemented due to capacity constraints or political factors. In Kiribati, especially, important
basic system weaknesses, including in treasury systems, annual budget execution, revenue administration,
and revenue forecasting remained unaddressed. For the period under consideration, neither country had a
functioning, formal PFM reform plan in place, despite the recommendations of the Pacific PFM Roadmap
(although important progress was made towards development of a reform plan in Tonga over the period).
The assessment of mixed success is largely consistent with global experience. World Bank global
evaluations have shown disappointing results from efforts towards institutional reform (IEG 2008; IEG
2011). Even when reform efforts have been successful in improving systems, there has been limited
evidence of “noticeable positive effect on the overall performance of the public sector” (IEG 2011). With
this context in mind, clear examples from case studies where development partners have worked
successfully with governments to achieve real gains should be celebrated as cause for optimism. Another
implication is that there is unlikely to any ‘magic bullet’ or simple set of recommendations that allow all of
the problems associated with complex public sector reforms to be avoided.
In this section we present five key recommendations for consideration by governments and
development partners. These recommendations are drawn from our analysis of experiences in case study
countries and draw on international experience and literature. They overlap and are entirely consistent with
previous advice and guidance on PFM reform in Pacific island countries provided in the past by PFTAC
and the World Bank (PFTAC 2010; PFTAC 2012; Haque et al. 2013). Crucially, all of the recommendations
build on Roadmap advice that PFM reforms should: i) reflect country-specific priorities; ii) take account of
country-specific constraints; and iii) enjoy country ownership and political support. Adoption of these
recommendations is unlikely to ‘solve’ all problems discussed above but may allow incremental progress
and allow practitioners to avoid some of the more obvious constraints encountered in the recent past.
Different approaches will work in different situations. Recommendations presented below will vary in
relevance and usefulness depending on country circumstances. They are suggestions that could be tested
and improved through future application by Pacific PFM practitioners with specific country knowledge.
Recommendations are summarized and mapped to the original Pacific PFM Roadmap recommendations in
the following table and explained more fully in the following text.

Recommendation 1: Consolidate progress towards better-prioritized reform plans
Substantial progress has already been achieved towards improving Pacific PFM reform plans. The
process of developing a PFM reform plan in Pacific island countries provides an important opportunity to
confront the reality that addressing all PFM weaknesses may not be possible with available capacity, and
that things may need to be done differently to standard practice in larger countries. Since 2012, PFTAC has
moved towards a more country-owned and prioritized approach to PFM reform plan development,
involving extensive consultation, increasingly linking PFM reform priorities to development challenges,
and encouraging governments to carefully consider why and when a low PEFA score requires corrective
action. These improvements are reflected in Tonga’s recent PFM reform plan, but some concerns still arise
due to the very large number of reforms included. A number of options exist to consolidate gains and ensure
that Pacific PFM reform plans all include a feasible number of reforms which are tightly prioritized towards
addressing binding development constraints:

    Adequate resourcing for roadmap development. Increasing the time and resources dedicated to
     developing roadmaps would be useful to ensure that they reflect country context and priorities.
     Allowing adequate time for in-country consultations is important, as is ensuring that the PFM reform
     planning team includes (local or international) economists and other country experts to ensure that PFM
     reforms are not considered in isolation from broader challenges. Adequate consultation at senior levels
     is also required to ensure buy-in and political support (PFTAC 2012).

    Improved PEFA Summary Assessments. PEFA assessments are frequently used as the start-point for
     PFM reform plans. Existing guidance from the PEFA Secretariat specifies that PEFA Summary
     Assessments should explain the likely impact of identified PFM weaknesses on fiscal discipline,
     strategic allocations of resources, and efficient service delivery. However, this does not always occur,
     with Summary Assessments often summarizing the full range of PFM weaknesses discussed in the
     document without discussion of which of these weaknesses are more relevant, given the country
     context. Summary Assessments that followed existing guidance and specified which PFM weaknesses
     were causing outcome level problems would assist the process of reform plan formation by providing
     a start-point for prioritization, and avoiding any perceptions that all PFM weaknesses need to be
     addressed.

    Beginning planning processes by establishing a fixed resource constraint. Once reform planning
     processes were underway it became very difficult for team members to resist calls from officials,
     politicians, and development partners to include additional reforms in PFM reform plans. This partly
     drove unfeasibly ambitious reform plans. Gaining broad agreement regarding the envelope of resources
     available for implementation at the outset might help avoid this outcome (including staff capacity as
     well as financial resources for technical assistance and infrastructure). Beginning with a resource
     constraint forces prioritization by making it clear that including additional reforms beyond a certain
     point can only be achieved at the cost of excluding others (Haque et al. 2013).


Recommendation 2: Further strengthen donor coordination and alignment
Country working groups could support ongoing coordination. Development partners and governments
need to continuously coordinate to manage PFM reform implementation, establish distribution of labor, and
– potentially – update the PFM reform plan as country context and priorities change. A country-level

48
working group, led by a representative of a key government agency (likely the Ministry of Finance) and
comprising other government and development partner officials, could be given responsibility for
coordination of all PFM reforms. Establishing this group need not involve an additional burden, as existing
coordination mechanisms could be used – for example, joint donor budget support working groups already
exist in several Pacific countries with substantially overlapping membership. The working group would
hold the following responsibilities:

    Meet regularly to jointly review progress on PFM reforms and guide progress. To guide the
     review, the working group should first agree on a set of 2-3 reforms to undertake over the course of the
     year from the PFM roadmap. Each subsequent meeting would then agree a small sub-set of actions to
     take before the next meeting and consider progress against the actions agreed in the last meeting. In
     general, there should be no support for new PFM reforms that do not address one of the agreed actions.

    Provide a mechanism for policy-level engagement. To build awareness and ownership among policy-
     makers, the working group could regularly report to Cabinet on progress and constraints, and to seek
     guidance on policy priorities.

    Update and adjust the reform plan. While the overall path for reform should be ideally set by the
     PFM roadmap, the working group could play an important role in updating and adjusting the reform
     agenda – while maintaining a tightly prioritized approach – as country conditions and political priorities
     change. This will inevitably involve difficult choices regarding the reforms that should not be pursued
     or continued if more-urgent priorities emerge.

    Coordinate with other related reform activities. An important opportunity may arise from the same
     working group taking responsibility for PFM, budget support coordination, and broader economic
     reforms. This could ensure development partners and government agree on relative priorities and
     constraints across different areas of engagement, build understanding of the capacity burden arising
     from different areas of reform, and also ensure that donor conditionalities were aligned with prioritized
     PFM actions.
Recommendation 3: Ensure implementation approaches reflect Pacific realities
PFM technical assistance models could be altered to provide greater emphasis on outcomes rather
than policy, legislative or process changes. Case studies demonstrated that the large number of reforms
that impose additional capacity burdens often leads to recommendations not being implemented or
implemented for only a short period of time (for example, the rules governing membership of SOE boards
in Kiribati and new processes for fiscal transparency in Tonga). There have been growing calls for
international organizations to offer support for institutional reforms based on improved outcomes rather
than delivering pre-determined outputs such as new rules, procedures, policies, and laws. In practical terms,
such approaches in relation to Pacific PFM reform might mean:

    Ensuring short-term assistance is coordinated with implementation support. There were no clear
     examples from case study countries of short-term assistance leading to substantial reform or
     improvements in outcomes without subsequent implementation support. In some cases expectations
     that government would implement recommended reforms without additional assistance led to long
     delays before pressing problems were resolved (for example, technical assistance advice on improving
     RERF management was delivered several years before any reforms were implemented following the
     mobilization of additional implementation support from a different development partner). Development


49
     partners could seek to ensure that resources for such implementation support are available before
     mobilizing short-term technical assistance, or simply combine analytical and implementation phases of
     assistance.

    Innovative approaches to contracting. Consultants could be provided with greater leeway to change
     their approach and planned outputs as reforms develop as long, as overall goals remain consistent. Calls
     for such flexibility are increasingly common in international literature under titles such as ‘Problem -
     Driven, Iterative Adaptation’, ‘Doing Development Differently’ and ‘Thinking and Working
     Politically’ (see Andrews et al 2014, Williamson 2015; Gulrajani and Honig 2016; Carter 2016).4
     Consultants could be given more time to understand context and adapt their approach accordingly. In
     some cases, consultants could be contracted to solve a particular problem or improve the functioning
     of an existing process, rather than to necessarily introduce policy or legislative reform or overhaul
     existing formal systems. Management frameworks could specify outputs and monitor indicators of
     progress over short time horizon (e.g. quarterly) to allow reforms to adjust using new information about
     the context or political environment.

    Investigating the use of financing instruments that increase focus on results. Development policy
     operations have proven an effective and useful means of supporting PFM reforms in Pacific island
     countries. Development policy financing might be usefully complemented by financing mechanisms
     that allowed a closer focus on results, rather than on significant institutional and policy reforms.
     Providing financing against results (e.g. reliable supply of pharmaceuticals to clinics) would open space
     for development partners and governments to discuss on the most context-appropriate means of
     achieving the targeted result and reduce the temptation to reach for “packaged” reforms. Focus could
     be moved towards simple improvements to (or increased enforcement of) existing systems when more
     ambitious overhauls of policies and procedures was unnecessary and might impose an excessive
     capacity burden. A focus on results, rather than changes to the formal PFM system, might also
     encourage development partners and government to consider interactions between PFM systems and
     broader problems of public sector management. Targeting results could magnify the impacts of PFM
     reforms by incentivizing complementary process and management improvements beyond the PFM
     system.5
Previous work has emphasized the potential benefits of regional approaches and outsourcing in
relation to Pacific PFM. Given that some Pacific island countries may not be able to maintain specialized
capacities required for all PFM functions they seek to have fulfilled, capacity supplementation and capacity
substitution can play an important role, alongside traditional capacity building. Pacific governments may
wish to outsource particular functions to the private sector or regional institutions. Case studies showed the
potential positive benefits of outsourcing and regional capacity sharing. In-line technical assistance to tax
administration in Tonga and the Kiribati budget office generated fiscal savings of likely much greater value
than the costs of the assistance. Long-term technical assistance to RERF management in Kiribati supported
important reforms that were well beyond government’s technical capacities. Such capacity supplementation
and capacity substitution can be delivered sustainably if costs are acknowledged and planned for. Advanced
economies often outsource certain government functions to enable civil servants to focus on core
government roles and responsibilities. Such outsourcing and capacity sharing arrangements need to be

  Despite an emerging consensus on these issues, much less has been offered to explain clearly how it might put into
practice (Gulrajani and Honig 2016; Carter 2016).

considered carefully, however, and previous work has provided a framework for judging when and where
such approaches may be appropriate (Haque et al. 2013).

    Box 8: Eight questions for those developing PFM reform plans
    For the plan:

       Does the reform plan explicitly identify main development problems and how weaknesses in the PFM system
        contribute to those problems?
       Taking into account time requirements of everyday work and reform processes already underway, are there
        sufficient numbers of people with sufficient knowledge and skills to implement and sustain the proposed
        reforms?
       Is sufficient technical assistance and financial support reliably available from development partners to support
        all listed reforms?
       Does the plan identify relative priorities between different reforms and reform objectives?

    For each reform:

       Is there a clear causal logic between the reform and desired improvements against outcomes that citizens and
        policy makers are most concerned about?
       Does this causal logic still hold when existing non-compliance with formal rules, limited enforcement capacity,
        and potentially limited engagement and influence of civil society, citizens, and parliamentarians are taken into
        account?
       Who will benefit and who will lose from the reform, and how will resistance from losers be overcome?
       Is there a simpler way to achieve the desired outcome?

Recommendation 4: Deepen country-specific knowledge
Case studies showed that PFM reforms are sometimes predicated on intervention logics that do not
hold in Pacific countries. Case studies showed that PFM systems exist within and depend on the broader
institutional and political environment.6 Reforms to strengthen public and parliamentary transparency were
based on the assumption that the public could and would hold policy makers to account for poor
performance and corruption, and that policy makers could – in turn – drive corrective change within the
bureaucracy. But PEFA assessments for both countries had noted that action was not taken on audit reports.
Civil society lacked the capacity and knowledge to leverage budget transparency towards policy change.
Ministers and senior civil servants were often unable to drive change within bureaucracies where personal
relationships, informal institutions, and cultural norms exerted strong influence. Similarly, absence of
effective tax enforcement through the legal system in Kiribati (due to weaknesses in tax division and justice
sector capacity and political economy factors) may have given cause to question the relative effectiveness
of efforts to change formal systems compared to working to see existing formal rules better enforced. While
the dominance of informal institutions is often understood as a defining characteristic of developing

countries, and therefore a common issue encountered by those working on PFM reforms, such institutions
may operate in unique ways in Pacific countries and require particular analysis (Khan 2011; Anckar 2006).7
Better understanding the political economy of Pacific island countries might support more holistic
and effective interventions. Further political economy and institutional analysis could be undertaken to
ensure that expectations regarding the likely impact of standard accountability and transparency measures
in Pacific island countries are accurate. Such work might also usefully inform the design of less
conventional mechanisms by which sought-after accountability relationships between policy-makers, the
bureaucracy, and citizens could be established over time. Previous evaluations of political economy analysis
suggest that it would likely be most effective if integrated into the PFM reform planning process (Booth,
Harris, and Wild 2016), perhaps through the inclusion of a governance expert (either local or international)
with a specific mandate to consider political economy issues as a member of PFM reform planning teams.
Regional bodies could play an important role in developing context-specific approaches to PFM.
Bodies such as the University of the South Pacific (USP), Pacific Island Center for Public Administration
(PICPA), PFTAC, the Pacific Island Forum (PIF), and the Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions
(PASAI) play an important role in capacity building through training and peer learning. They are also
mostly staffed by Pacific islanders with deep country and regional knowledge. Development partners could
further support these institutions in developing and disseminating context-specific solutions to common
PFM problems, including through: i) facilitating representation on PFM reform planning teams; ii)
sponsoring knowledge exchange with countries beyond the Pacific at similar levels of development or
facing similar challenges; and iii) linking such agencies with leading global academic and policy institutions
developing (and providing training on) innovative approaches to PFM reform.
Recommendation 5: Adopt coordination mechanisms to support good practices
Case studies demonstrated that institutional incentives can drive proliferation and excessive
complexity of PFM reform interventions. Development agencies and staff sometimes individually face
incentives to implement more projects that adhere to internationally familiar designs, even when a smaller
number of context-specific interventions might have the greatest positive impact. The collective goal of
improved Pacific PFM systems might therefore be served by instituting mechanisms to bind development
agencies to collective restraint and coordinated action.
Development partners could jointly adopt a set of good practice principles. In June 2014, a number of
Pacific donors agreed ten “Good Practice Principles for Multi -Donor Budget Support”. This document
codified existing productive working practices and helped ensure institutional buy-in and commitment.
Similar good practice principles for PFM reform could be introduced. The principles could draw on
collective experience and focus on three broad areas: coordination, prioritization and implementation.
Coordination principles could commit development partners to practices that promote better information
sharing between donors and strengthen the dialogue between development partners and the government.
Prioritization principles could commit development partners to developing reforms that are realistic,
appropriate and solve real problems. Implementation principles could commit development partners to
longer-term engagement, flexibility to adapt to changing priorities and problems and a greater variety of

 A recent literature on “islandness” suggests that small island states have particular governance and political economy
characteristics, including small populations and resulting closer personal relationships between individuals that
exacerbate challenges associated with establishing an ‘impersonal’ bureaucracy (See Anckar 2006).

reform interventions for governments to choose from. A draft of these principles is attached as an annex to
this report.
Under these principles, development partners could commit to providing opportunities for mutual
review of project design documents, consultant terms of reference, and training plans. Through mutual
review, development partners can seek to ensure coordination and broad agreement on the appropriateness
of reforms being pursued. Development partners could collectively consider whether or not the proposals
adequately reflected the priorities agreed in the country working groups and the capacity of the government
to support or implement the proposed deliverables.
These principles could be discussed, adopted, and monitored at the annual ‘Heptagon’ meeting of
major donors. Alternatively, and more formally, the principles could be submitted to the Pacific Islands
Forum for formal endorsement, with the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat playing an ongoing role in
monitoring compliance. This would help ensure shared commitment to the principles among donors and
governments.

Box 9: The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre and Pacific PFM Roadmap Development

PEFA assessments have been carried out in fourteen Pacific island countries since 2005, with many of
these undertaking repeat assessments. On the basis of these assessments, at least ten governments in
the region have now prepared PFM roadmaps to address the challenges highlighted in the PEFA reports.
The IMF PFTAC has responsibility for providing coordination and quality control under a strategy for PFM
in Pacific Island Forum member countries adopted by the 2009 Pacific Island Forum Economic Ministers’
Meeting (FEMM). In a 2012 update to the regional Public Financial Management Reform Roadmap,
PFTAC provided several recommendations regarding the development of country PFM roadmaps.
Messages from this PFTAC document are entirely consistent with this reports recommendations
regarding roadmap development, and include:

    It is important for countries to take ownership of the PEFA assessment and PFM Roadmap.
     This will ensure that the assessments contribute to the reform process. This requires engagement
     from senior and middle level staff in their preparation – not just as information providers, but as
     partners in the preparation of PEFAs and Roadmaps. This not only creates ownership, but also
     provides an educational opportunity, developing country staff so that over time they will be able to
     take more responsibility for driving PFM reform.
    This requires time and careful planning. PEFAs and Roadmaps should only be started at a time
     of the year when key staff will be least distracted by other matters. A PEFA will require at least 4-5
     weeks (2 weeks for a self-assessment and 2-3 weeks for a formal assessment) of fairly intense staff
     involvement.
    Formal assessment teams should be appropriately staffed. Teams should be composed of
     around 3-4 people, with at least one member from the Government and one from a regional agency
     or peer country. Two experts will also normally be required (one of whom will probably have facilitated
     the self-assessment exercise). Additional expertise may also be required for additional assessments
     in areas such as procurement.
    Consultation with donors is also important. It should come both beforehand, through review of
     the terms of reference and team briefing, and also at the end of the process. The government should
     be in the lead in the consultation process.
    A “low” PEFA score does not necessarily require action . PEFAs only tell a government how
     they are performing relative to what is generally considered best practice. Countries may not
     consider it appropriate to move to better practice across the whole range of PEFA scores. This may
     be because of constrained resources/capacity or because a country does not consider a higher
     PEFA rating to be desirable.
    Roadmaps should be about much more than just raising PEFA scores or meeting a donor
     requirement. They should not become just another plan-- created, published, and delivered to fulfil
     a donor requirement. Roadmaps should only be prepared if Government believes that improved PFM
     is important to improved delivery of public services; and they are committed to implementation. A
     properly prepared Roadmap will clearly indicate the actions that can and will be taken to arrive at the
     desired state and the timing of those actions. It should also identify the type of development partner
     support that will be required to achieve sustainable improvements —engaging key partners during
     drafting is therefore critical.
    Sound and disciplined PFM is not just a technical matter. Many of its most significant aspects
     hinge on how Cabinets and Legislatures deliberate on fiscal and policy issues, and in particular on
     how they integrate thinking about public service policies, budgets, and revenue constraints in arriving
     at decisions. PFM Reform Roadmaps should address these issues and should be formally approved
     by Cabinets.

    Annex 1: Proposed PFM Good Practice Principles
Public financial management (PFM) is a core part of the state, and its capability to deliver public services
to citizens. Effective PFM systems help support macroeconomic stability, the efficient allocation of
resources, and efficient use of those resources for service delivery. Effective PFM also provides assurance
to donors that aid delivered through country systems will be used for its intended purpose. For this reason,
countries across the Pacific are implementing reforms to address weaknesses in their PFM systems with
financial and technical support from development partners.

The following principles are intended to capture what we have found to work best when developing and
implementing programs that support PFM reforms. These ‘good practice’ principles will guide our actions
in future so that lessons do not have to be relearned and positive impacts can be maximised.

     1. All development partners support a common set of PFM reforms agreed jointly with the
        government. Experience from budget support is that the prioritisation and implementation of
        reforms between the government and development partners works best when a single process is
        used to negotiate actions, monitor and verify progress and coordinate technical assistance. This
        ensures coordination and avoids large costs of dealing with different development partners. Any
        exceptions, to allow parallel PFM support from development partners, would be on the basis of
        principles agreed as part of this same process.

     2. PFM diagnostics are considered together with evidence of problems with macroeconomic
        management and service delivery. PFM diagnostics, such as the Public Expenditure and Financial
        Accountability (PEFA) framework, are good high-level indicators, but should be accompanied by
        a short note clearly explain which scores matter, and why. The government and development
        partners should discuss how these relate to broader challenges with macroeconomic management
        and service delivery, before PFM reform actions are agreed. To the extent possible, this should
        include consultations with the providers of politically important public services.

     3. Options for reform are jointly examined and the government and development partners
        share a clear understanding of the theory of change. Development partners and governments
        need to work together to ensure proposed reforms are addressing a relevant and high priority
        problem. The government and development partners should examine the problem, options for
        addressing the problem, and the space for reform.8 Where other countries are serving as a
        benchmark, the institutional context and history should be explained. The theory of change for the
        reform should be clearly understood, and monitored during implementation.

     4. The number of PFM reforms requiring strong coordination between government entities is
        limited. Reforms are more likely to be successful if they are more “concentrated”, with fewer actors
        involved, even within a relatively small government establishment. In contrast, coordinative,


8 Adapting from Andrews et al. (2015), key questions in examining the problem include: What is the problem? Why is it important?
To whom does it matter? Who needs to care more? Why don’t they care more? How do we get them to give it more attention?
What will the problem look like if it is solved? Who has the authority to engage? How much acceptance is there to engage among
those affected? Is there capacity to support reform?

i
         integrated reforms are more difficult to implement successfully. Therefore, governments need to
         consider carefully how many coordinative reforms they can take on at the same time. The
         experience from OECD countries suggests that even in capacity-rich environments, governments
         rarely carry out one or two complex reforms in the same sector, outside of major national crises
         (Hood et al, 2014). It is not possible to state definitively how many is too many, but as a rule of
         thumb, any more than one affecting the same ministry, and any more than three overall, should be
         carefully scrutinised.

     5. Timetables for reform are realistic. For institutional reforms in PFM to take root, experience
        from advanced countries suggests that decades or even longer time periods are the unit of
        measurement, not months or years. Even more specifically targeted technical reforms often take 5,
        10, or 15 years, usually involving processes of iteration. Furthermore, it is the nature of public
        finance that many processes are based on regularity and repetition, usually based on the annual
        budget. For certain processes, such as a new way of calculating the annual spending envelope to be
        “in use” for three years, may still only mean it has been practiced three times. While it is not realistic
        or helpful to try and impose time limits or artificial schedules on reforms, great care should be taken
        to approach timetables with realism and humility. It would also be advisable to consider “cooling
        off” periods of at least three budget cycles (or even five), in areas of PFM where significant reforms
        have taken place, so that changes can become somewhat embedded, before other major changes in
        the same area are undertaken. Such a limit would also incentivise stakeholders to consider
        prioritization more carefully.

     6. Consultants have time to understand the local context and flexibility to adapt their inputs. A
        large proportion of PFM assistance is delivered through contractors who need time to understand
        the context they are working in and the problem that is being addressed. Without this space, there
        is a greater incentive to replicate activities from previous assignments. Development partners and
        the government should support regular opportunities for feedback from consultants and those
        affected by any reforms.

     7. Development partners are given the opportunity to scrutinise terms of reference and other
        materials produced by other development partners. Through mutual review, development
        partners can seek to ensure coordination and broad agreement on the appropriateness of reforms
        being pursued. Comments will focus on whether or not the proposals adequately reflect the
        priorities agreed in the country working groups and the capacity of the government to support or
        implement the proposed deliverables.
