About the Networked Carbon Markets Initiative
         The World Bank Group’s Networked Carbon Markets (NCM) initiative is developing the services and
         institutions needed to enable a connected international carbon market that is liquid and delivers
         climate-smart financing more efficiently.

Networked Carbon Markets Knowledge Series
The World Bank Group’s Climate and Carbon Finance Unit has
launched a Networked Carbon Markets (NCM) knowledge
series in order to contribute to the technical and analytical
foundations of the NCM initiative. The objective of this series
is to inform ongoing discussion among key stakeholders within
international financial institutions, governments, think tanks,
and nongovernmental organizations. The papers published as
part of the series will present recent findings from the initia-
tive’s analytical work. It is expected that the proposed con-
cepts and components will evolve based on consultations and
discussions with stakeholders.

may help to lower the need for reserves in the participating

institutional, and regulatory resources. In particularly, smaller
and less affluent countries may not be in a position to de-

schemes to stabilize their emissions trading systems. This
would be particularly relevant for smaller standalone emis-

                                       Following the start of the pilot ETSs in Beijing, Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Tianjin in 2013, and
                                       in Chongqing and Hubei in 2014, the designs of some of these schemes are rapidly evolving. Until March

                                       A nationwide ETS may be launched by the end of 2016 and be fully implemented in the course of 2019.

                                       Full implementation of the Kazakhstan’s ETS started in 2014, including enforcement and trading. The trading
            Kazakhstan                 volume was low, with only 35 transactions representing a total of 1.3 MtCO2. The average price of allowances in
                                       2014 was KZT406 (US$2).

            Republic of Korea          to 2017—ETS installations will receive a free allocation of 100 percent of their average 2011–13 GHG emissions.
                                       No auctioning will take place.

                                       In Portugal, a carbon tax of €5 per tCO2e (US$5 per tCO2e) was approved in November 2014, which entered
                                       into force on January 1, 2015. It applies to non-EU ETS sectors and covers approximately 26 percent of the

                                       country’s GHG emissions. The tax is expected to generate revenues of over €95 million (US$104 million) in
                                       2015.

                                       In Switzerland, the first two auctions of allowances in its ETS took place in May and November 2014. Allowances
                                       in these auctions were sold at two different prices: CHF40 (US$42) and CHF20 (US$21), respectively.

The administrative implementation of this mechanism
has been delegated to the Western Climate Initiative. The
WCI organizes sales from the Quebec reserve on a mutual
agreement between applicants and the WCI. As a result, the
reserve mechanism is rule based, since sales only take place if
demand for reserve units exists. In addition, there are regula-
tions in place specifying who is eligible to buy reserve units. All
requests for registration must be approved by a minister (simi-
lar to the reserve sale administrator in California). The minister
may also choose to use the reserve allowances to adjust the
amount of free allowances allocated to emitters.

B.3.3.	 New Zealand
The New Zealand emissions trading system has been in
operation since 2008; it covers emissions from forestry,
stationary energy, industrial processes, and liquid fossil fuels.
The price ceiling is set at NZ$25. Under the emissions trading
system, compliance entities may import an unlimited number
of CERs to fulfil their compliance obligations (New Zealand
Government 2013).

by major industrial countries in response to the 1973 oil crisis      taken by the IEA’s governing board, supported by advice

•	 The planning and operation of an emergency instrument
   to stabilize oil markets through an international agency
   requires extensive information and data on oil production

   of data, information, and analysis on energy markets and
