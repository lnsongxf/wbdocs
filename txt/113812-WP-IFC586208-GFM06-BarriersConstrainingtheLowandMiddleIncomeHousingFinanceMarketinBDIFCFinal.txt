EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The lack of available and accessible housing finance has been identified by the Government of Bangladesh
(GOB) as one of the biggest hurdles in improving the housing conditions for lower and middle income
households. Poor living conditions, particularly in urban areas, continue to undermine economic growth and
poverty reduction efforts. The need for improvement in the existing housing finance system and expanding
access to underserved segments has been highlighted in several studies by different government and
international agencies. The Finance and Markets Global Practice at the World Bank Group (WBG) has been
consistently working in partnership with GOB, regulatory and apex institutions and private sector players in
financial services. This study is a continuation of WBG’s past efforts towards improving and deepening the
housing finance markets in Bangladesh.

The specific objectives of this study are: (a) assessing current and future demand for low and middle-
income housing finance (LMIHF) in Bangladesh, (b) identifying constraints impeding the development of
LMIHF market with recommendations to address the barriers identified and (c) developing a roadmap of
interventions that can be adopted by various development financial institutions (DFIs) to create an enabling
environment for improving access to housing finance.

For the purpose of this study, low and middle income households have been defined as those whose monthly
household income is within the upper ceiling of BDT 60,000 (USD 760). In the mortgage refinance scheme of
2008-2009, Bangladesh Bank used a similar definition for monthly household income with an income ceiling
of BDT 50,000 (USD 633).

Chapter I provides the study methodology, the economic context and an overview of the financial sector
situation in Bangladesh including the latest trends in housing finance. Over last two decades, Bangladesh
has made significant gains in economic growth, development and poverty reduction. Average annual GDP
growth has exceeded 6% a year on average during the past five years despite adverse impacts from the global
recession, political turmoil, structural constraints and frequent natural disasters. The economy, however,
still faces several challenges, such as a growing infrastructure deficit and skill shortages, a weak business
environment and a de-facto onerous regulatory regime. While financial markets have steadily evolved
over the years, concerns remain when it comes to strengthening financial stability and enhancing financial
intermediation. Only 31% of adults in Bangladesh have access to a bank account. Further, under-developed
insurance and pensions markets, mortgage market (mortgage debt to GDP is about 3%) and long term
capital markets, means that sources of long term financing are limited and constitute severe impediments to
financing Bangladesh’s development needs.

Chapter II of this report captures the housing conditions, construction costs and the supply side situation
in Bangladesh. The urbanization process in the country is as yet unsaturated, and rapid urban growth shall
continue in the coming decades fuelled by growth in metros. Dhaka, being a megacity, is the most urbanized
district by virtue of its agglomeration economy, which provides diverse opportunities and hence attracts most
of the rural out-migrants. Dhaka City is set to grow from a population of 18.9 million in 2011 to a projected
27.4 million by 2030, with an implied growth rate of 4.3%. While other cities will also grow, their proportion
of the total urban population is expected to decline or remain static.

 Barriers Constraining the Low and Middle Income Housing Finance Market in Bangladesh 2016




Over 85% of all rural, and over 70% of urban dwelling units fall under inadequate / deficient categories, which
signifies the scale of housing needs in the form of housing upgrades, improvements or new construction.
Bangladesh will need to construct approximately 8.5 million new houses in the next five years to overcome the
existing shortage in urban areas and meet the future demands of housing. Most of the need is concentrated
in the lower and lower-middle income groups. Against this demand, REHAB (Real Estate and Housing
Association of Bangladesh) estimates that currently around 25,000 units are supplied each year, of which its
member developers are supplying around 15,000 units.

On the supply side, the real estate sector in Bangladesh is still recovering from the setback it suffered in
2011-2012. Private developers cater only to the upper and upper-middle income groups, while the middle
and low income segments are still largely untapped. The development of affordable housing is in a very
nascent stage, with volumes of barely 2% of all newly constructed apartments. The sluggish and stagnant
sales situation is continuing for over four years now. The current price levels, which have seen a 20-25%
correction in recent years, are still high.

Based on extensive research and analysis of secondary data, this study has estimated the housing finance
demand over the next four years. The analysis in Chapter III shows that the gross projected housing finance
demand arising from low and middle income segments (urban, rural and microfinance borrowers) is estimated
at BDT 205 billion (USD 2.6 billion) annually, which translates into BDT 820 billion (USD 10.4 billion) over the
next four years. To put these consolidated figures into perspective, the cumulative demand projected over
the next four years is 167% of the total 2015 housing loan outstanding across Bangladesh’s financial sector
and possibly 6-7 times the total housing loan disbursements per annum. These figures represent only the
additional demand over and above the formal housing finance being accessed by higher income segments.

Chapter IV details various suppliers of housing finance and the structure of the existing housing finance
market. It delves into different categories of lenders including commercial banks, non-bank finance
companies (NBFCs), specialised financial institutions such as the House Building Finance Corporation (HBFC),
microfinance institutions and government funded housing schemes and programs. The total outstanding
housing loans as of June 2015 stood at BDT 490 billion (USD 6.2 billion) which represents only 8.8% of total
credit to the private sector. In recent years, significant changes have taken place in gross housing loan
portfolios. Commercial banks have a dominating presence, with a market share of 75-80%. The banks have
gained at the expense of specialised housing finance providers such as HBFC and Delta Brac Housing (DBH,
a leading private NBFC). Within the banking sector, private sector banks have been expanding their housing
loan portfolios and now have the largest exposure of BDT 266.0 billion (USD 3.37 billion) in outstanding
housing loans as of June 2015. The state owned commercial banks had the second largest exposure of BDT
108.5 billion (USD 1.37 billion).

Due to overheating of urban property markets during 2010-2012, the portfolio quality of most banks suffered
and their exposure in mortgages and real estate was identified as one of the principal reasons for stress
in the financial sector. Consequently, Bangladesh Bank imposed stiff regulatory restrictions on banks and
even NBFCs to discourage further exposure in mortgage loans, including retail home loans. While the retail
housing loan portfolios of NBFCs have performed reasonably well, with gross non-performing loans (NPLs)
at 1.87% in 2015, their exposure in real estate and construction finance to developers indicates a relatively
difficult situation with NPLs rising to an unsustainable level 10.7% in FY15. This deterioration in asset quality
is a direct consequence of the crisis in the real estate sector in 2011-12.

The traditional housing lender, the state owned HBFC, is in a precarious financial situation and currently
relies on loan recoveries to support its lending activity. Despite noticeable efforts, HBFC’s market share fell
from 48% to 17% from 2001 to 2011 and is now much below 10%. The HBFC, which is charged with provision
of housing and financial assistance for the lower income population, is short of funding resources, exposed
to an excessive level of nonperforming loans, and crippled by improper procedures and systems. Besides,
HBFC’s governance and administration is largely with the Ministry of Finance and it is not regulated by the
Bangladesh Bank, which possibly has an adverse effect on its operating and financial performance.

Primary mortgage lenders including banks and non-banks are constrained to rely on short-term financing

for loans, and as a result, mortgage finance is available only to higher income households. The government
subsidized housing finance and intermediation by specialised financial institutions (e.g. HBFC) also does not
succeed in targeting lower and lower-middle income groups. Micro-lenders such as Grameen Bank have
been scaling back their housing loan portfolio, and as on date, there are hardly any housing microfinance
products on offer in spite of a well-entrenched and thriving microfinance sector in Bangladesh. While the
penetration of traditional mortgage finance market in Bangladesh is already miniscule, the penetration of
low income housing finance is almost non-existent.

Chapter V outlines in detail the prevailing policy, regulatory and legal environment in the area of housing and
housing finance, and identifies different issues and constraints that limit the growth and expansion of LMIHF
in terms of policy aspects, supply side challenges and concerns relating to the financial sector and operating
environment for the primary lenders. Further, the chapter goes on to suggest some avenues for reforms,
recommendations and strategies that could be considered by GOB and other stakeholders to suitably address
these barriers. Broadly the issues are categorised under the following:

	 Low-income housing and infrastructure access for urban poor residing in slums
	 Underdeveloped real estate market and supply side constraints in affordable housing
	 Financial sector weakness and lack of depth in the mortgage market
	 Operating and enabling environment for primary lenders
Among various impediments that the housing and housing finance sectors are facing is the inefficiency
of the regulatory regime, including foreclosure, land administration frameworks, poor legal infrastructure,
deficient financial systems, a dearth of long-term funding and limited avenues for developer finance.
Insufficient developed land and inappropriate land planning and urban development policies are driving
up real estate prices. Land and titling procedures, registration procedures and costs, and a poor regulatory
framework for real estate stifle the market, as does the lack of an organized database and key information
on the housing sector. Sound and balanced prudential regulations for housing finance, innovative housing
finance products, and increased mortgage affordability will contribute to an expanded market for housing
and to vibrant and fast-growing housing finance systems. Islamic housing finance is an area that could match
demand in underserved market segments, and it needs to be developed. A sharper focus on secondary
market finance will be appropriate and mortgage refinancing could be key to the provision of long-term
funding, standardization, and stabilization of mortgage markets.

For Bangladesh to develop its housing and housing finance markets such that these are both sound and
accessible, the markets would need balanced funding models and a diversified toolbox of instruments for
different categories of lenders. Based on the study’s findings, Chapter VI – which is the final chapter of this
report, proposes a roadmap of strategic interventions in the form of project initiatives and investments that
could be undertaken by the Government with support from international DFIs and donor institutions.

      CHAPTER 1


BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT

1.1 Introduction and Objectives
The lack of available and accessible housing finance has been identified by the Government of Bangladesh
(GOB) as one of the biggest hurdles in improving housing conditions for low and middle income households.
Poor living conditions, particularly in urban areas, continue to undermine economic growth and poverty
reduction efforts. The need for improvement in the existing housing finance system and expanding access
to underserved segments has been highlighted in several studies by different government and international
agencies.

Despite a multitude of factors driving an increase in the demand for affordable housing and housing finance
such as high population density, continued economic growth, rapid urbanization and a young demographic
profile, this has unfortunately not been matched by a corresponding increase in the supply of affordable
housing and improved access to housing finance. The enabling environment presents several bottlenecks that
impede the facilitation of housing finance among low and middle income groups, particularly those who do
not have a formal source of income. For the purpose of this study, low and middle income households have
been defined as those whose monthly household income is within the upper ceiling of BDT 60,000 (USD 760).

In this context, IFC-World Bank Group conducted an assessment of the housing finance sector in Bangladesh
to identify interventions across multiple stakeholders that can be implemented to develop and grow the low
and middle-income housing finance (LMIHF) markets. The specific objectives of the present study are:

 	 Assess the current level and future trajectory of demand for LMIHF in Bangladesh
 	 Identify constraints impeding the development of the LMIHF market, and develop recommendations
      for multiple stakeholders to address the barriers identified
 	 Develop a roadmap of interventions that can be adopted by various DFIs to create an enabling
      environment for improving access to LMIHF in Bangladesh

The present study intends to build on the past and ongoing efforts of various public sector institutions, and
multilateral and bi-lateral DFIs operating in Bangladesh. The recommendations aim for expanding access to
housing finance, with particular emphasis on improving the enabling environment for both primary lenders
as well as suppliers of affordable housing so as to build their presence among the lower and middle-income
segments of population.

1.2 The Macro-economic Context
Over the past twenty years, Bangladesh has made significant gains in economic growth, development and
poverty reduction. Average annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth has risen steadily (see figure
below), and grew by more than 6 percent a year on average during the past 5 years despite adverse impacts
of the global recession, political turmoil, structural constraints and frequent natural disasters. Factors such as
the evolving structure of the economy explain its resilience to global and domestic shocks so far, including
good macroeconomic fundamentals, resilience of exports and remittances, relatively under-developed and
insulated financial markets, and a pre-emptive policy posture.



                                                                                                                   13

 Figure 1: GDP Growth Trend




Since 1990, Bangladesh’s GDP has been growing at around 5% in real terms, and the number of people
living below the poverty line has reduced from 49% in 2000 to 32% in 2010. Bangladesh has also made
noteworthy gains in education and health. Despite these gains, Bangladesh remains a poor country,
with a GDP per capita of USD 958 (2013). Favourable international commodity price trends, a stable
nominal exchange rate and prudent monetary policy have helped contain inflation. The 12-monthly-
moving average inflation decreased from 7.6% in February 2014 to 6.8% in February 2015. On the
other hand, fiscal policy has remained consistent with macroeconomic stability. The fiscal deficit
was held in check at 3.1% of GDP in FY14. The shortfall in tax revenue due to the adverse impact
of political turmoil was offset by better control of recurrent expenditures, particularly subsidies.


 Figure 2: Inflation                                          Figure 3: Govt. Revenue and Expenditure




Among recent economic developments, job-friendly growth gained momentum in Bangladesh in 2014 until
the recurrence of political turmoil in January 2015. However growth was resilient in FY2015 despite political
protests that hindered exports and private investment. GDP growth in FY2015 picked up to 6.6% from 6.1% in
FY2014. Global headwinds notwithstanding, growth is expected to inch up to 6.7% in FY2016, underpinned
by stronger garment exports and rising private consumption.

Foreign direct investment (FDI) though remains below 1.0% of GDP and 3.0% of total investment. The
political dynamics seem to be the main uncertainty for Bangladesh’s otherwise favourable economy and only
continued domestic political calm will help in building confidence in consumers and investors to support the
growth momentum.

Bangladesh’s economy faces several challenges apart from political uncertainty: such as a growing infrastructure
deficit and skill shortages, a weak business environment and a de-facto onerous regulatory regime. The goal
of graduating from low to middle-income status requires much higher growth and investment, and thorough
reforms to improve the business environment, boost budget revenue and strengthen financial discipline.

At the time of independence (in 1971), Bangladesh was largely an agricultural economy with a very low level
of urbanisation (about 8%). Today, over 25% of the population is urban and the urban sector contributes to
over 70% of the national GDP. This shift has translated into rapid migration to urban areas and metropolitan
cities. Growth experiences in Bangladesh also demonstrate a tendency towards urbanization as well as
uneven regional growth. The GOB in its Seventh 5-year Plan has made specific efforts to address both these
dimensions of growth. On the inclusive growth front, GOB has identified reform of the financial system to
provide easy access of rural households and small savers to formal financial institutions; and maintaining low
inflation to facilitate more savings, as among its key priorities.

1.3 The Financial Sector in Bangladesh
The financial system of Bangladesh comprises three broad fragmented sectors: (i) The formal Sector, (ii) the
semi-formal sector and (iii) the informal sector. In the context of this report, it is important to understand their
distinguishing aspects as all the mortgage lenders and other providers of housing finance in Bangladesh
belong to either of these sectors.

The categorization is based on the extent of regulation in the sectors. The formal financial sector is comprised
of money market (comprising operations of the banking system, microcredit institutions, nonbank financial
institutions, inter-bank foreign exchange market), the capital market (stock market operations), bond market
and the insurance market.

The formal financial sector includes:
   a)	 56 banks and 31 non-bank financial institutions regulated by Bangladesh Bank
   b)	 693 micro-finance institutions regulated by Microcredit Regulatory Authority
   c)	 Life insurance companies regulated by Insurance Development & Regulatory Authority
   d)	 Capital market intermediaries regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission

The Ministry of Finance also has some oversight role in certain aspects. The current size of the respective
sectors measured in terms of their asset base is shown in Table 1 below.

The financial market is dominated by the banking sector. The capital market makes up the second most
significant segment of the financial system. This is followed by the bond market, dominated by treasury bills



                                                                                                                        15

and saving instruments issued by the National Saving Directorate. The insurance sector is quite old, but its
size is still relatively small.

The semi-formal financial sector includes those institutions which are regulated otherwise but do not
fall under the jurisdiction of Central Bank or any other enacted financial regulator. This sector is mainly
represented by Specialized Financial Institutions like House Building Finance Corporation (HBFC), Palli Karma
Sahayak Foundation (PKSF), Samabay (Cooperative) Bank, Grameen Bank, and financial activities/programs
(lending and deposit taking) of various Non-Governmental Microcredit Organizations. The informal financial
sector includes private intermediaries and money lenders which are completely unregulated and sometimes
engaged in financial transactions that are not legally permitted.

The major participants in the money market are scheduled banks, development financial institutions (DFI),
non-bank financial companies (NBFC) and Microfinance Institutions (MFI). Of the 56 scheduled banks
operating in Bangladesh, 4 are state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs), 4 are government-owned specialized
banks (SCBs), 9 are foreign commercial banks (FCBs) and 39 are domestic private commercial banks (PCBs)
which comprise 31 conventional private commercial banks and 8 Islamic banks. The major source of funding
for banks is deposits in the form of demand and time deposits from households, the corporate and non-
corporate private sector, public sector entities and the government.

There are currently 29 NBFCs, of which, one is owned by the government, 15 are privately owned local
initiatives and 13 were initiated as joint ventures with foreign participation. Major source of funding for
NBFCs are term deposits (at least six months or more), credit facilities from commercial banks, access to the
call money market, as well as securitization. As of June 2013, the NBFCs comprised only 4.8% of the total
Money Market assets and their investment in different sectors included industry (43.8%), real estate (16.7%),
margin loans (5.0%), trade and commerce (11.3%), merchant banking (4.0%), and others (17.7%).

The number of MFIs has grown phenomenally over the years and at present there are 693 such institutions
that have been licensed by the MRA. Grameen Bank is out of the jurisdiction of MRA as it operates under
Grameen Bank Ordinance, 1983. Microcredit programs in Bangladesh are being implemented by formal
financial institutions, specialized government organizations, as well as NGOs. Despite the fact that more than
a thousand institutions are operating microcredit programs, the 10 largest MFIs and Grameen Bank together
account for 87% of total savings and 81% of total outstanding loans in the sector.

Among the biggest concerns in the overall financial system of Bangladesh is the financial health of state-
owned commercial banks, which remains fragile. The financial sector has been adversely affected by a series
of financial scams (mostly in the SOCBs) and this has contributed to an increase in loan defaults over the past
2-3 years. While the authorities have taken some disciplinary actions, in most cases neither the management
nor the Boards of these banks have been held accountable. The overall NPL levels and other financial
indicators are however better than the situation prevailing in 1999 (comparator year), although worse than
2011, as can be observed in the Tables 2 and 3 below.

For Bangladesh, a well-functioning financial sector is critical - whether it is access to finance for its exporting
and small and medium sized businesses that account for a significant share of employment; savings, credit
and insurance services for its farmers or improving access to mainstream housing finance for the lower and
middle income households. While financial markets have developed over the years, key concerns remain,
in particular - strengthening financial stability, enhancing financial intermediation and improving the tax
system to make it more efficient, transparent and fair. With over 70% of financial system assets in the banking
system, banking assets to GDP at 77% and deposits to GDP at 60%, the prevalent risks in the SOCBs are
systemically significant. The overall governance and asset quality also pose a threat to the stability of the
financial sector in Bangladesh.

Alongside poorly performing public banks, access to credit has been identified as one of the top barriers
for doing business in Bangladesh (Doing Business 2015). Only 31% of adults in Bangladesh have access to a
bank account (Findex, 2014). In addition, financial inclusion remains particularly daunting for certain groups
including women, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and farmers. Further, under-developed insurance
(insurance premiums are only 0.94% of GDP) and pensions markets, mortgage market (mortgage debt to
GDP is about 3%) and long term capital markets, means that sources of long term financing are limited
and constitute severe impediments to financing Bangladesh’s infrastructure deficit and public investments
needed to create jobs and manage risks and vulnerabilities.

1.4 Housing Finance Trends in South Asia and Emerging Markets
High economic growth coupled with demographic changes and growing urbanization trends signify the
immense potential for housing and housing finance growth in South Asia. Household sizes are shrinking and
the growing middle class comprises mostly young people who are eager to own their homes. This increasing
demand is adding to the already existing urban housing shortage. The attitudes towards consumer debt
have changed and there is much less aversion to borrowing for home ownership. Migration, job growth in
services and manufacturing sectors and remittance flows have led to a plentiful middle class, willing and able
to pay for a home; but these factors also have pushed up urban property prices.

Compared to the advanced economies of Europe and America, the Asian mortgage market is rather
heterogeneous, so it is difficult to summarise its characteristics and ongoing trends.




                                                                                                                    17

In most Asian countries the mortgage markets are under-developed though changing rapidly. In terms of
market depth and penetration, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and Korea have mortgage debt to GDP
ratios of 30% - 40% while China, Thailand and Mongolia are in the 18% - 21% range (refer Figure 4 above).
For most South Asian (SA) countries, this ratio is in single digits which can be attributed to their stage of
economic development.

In emerging economies there is usually a correlation between outstanding mortgage to GDP and GDP per
capita (which is significantly below USD 10,000 for most of Asia). Consequently, the mortgage market in
Bangladesh is also relatively underdeveloped. The mortgage debt to GDP is just over 3% compared with
8-9% in India and 50-70% in developed countries. In the region, the housing finance ecosystem in India has
developed steadily over the past few decades and its mortgage market has performed better as compared
to its South Asia peers. In comparison, Bangladesh’s mortgage debt to GDP peaked at 3.51% in 2013 and has
since declined to 3.28% in 2014 and 3.23% in 2015. This is partly due to Bangladesh Bank, which has been
wary of a housing bubble developing in the metropolitan city of Dhaka and has imposed stiff regulatory
measures to pre-empt any mortgage or sub-prime crisis.

Four key dimensions of housing finance that affect the mortgage market development include housing
availability, financial instruments and institutions, low-income housing and mortgage market infrastructure.
Several countries in the region are developing reform agendas that would strengthen their housing finance
systems. The present housing finance system in Bangladesh is however extremely small and highly segmented.
The table below illustrates the recent movement in outstanding housing loans across different lenders.

The primary mortgage lenders including banks and non-banks (NBFCs) are constrained to rely on short-term
financing for loans, and as a result, mortgage finance is available only to higher income households. The
government subsidized housing finance and intermediation by specialised financial institutions also does
not succeed in adequately targeting lower and lower-middle income groups. Micro-lenders such as Grameen
Bank have been scaling down their housing loan portfolio and as on date there are hardly any housing
microfinance products on offer in spite of a well-entrenched and thriving microfinance sector in Bangladesh.
While the penetration of traditional mortgage finance market in Bangladesh is already miniscule, the
penetration of low income housing finance is almost non-existent. Further analysis of Bangladesh’s housing
finance trends and growth prospects is presented in Chapter 4.

1.5 Study Methodology
The study methodology primarily comprised holding in-depth interviews and one-on-one discussions with
different stakeholder groups which constitute the housing and housing finance markets in Bangladesh.
The idea was to initiate and / or deepen the dialogue with leading institutions and organisations in the
public sector as well as private sector which would impact and determine the future trajectory of housing
finance supply and in particular, improved access for the low, informal and middle income segments of the
population. Following are the different stakeholder groups that were interviewed (on the basis of customised
questionnaires) during the course of this study:
      -	    Government Authorities under the Ministry of Housing
      -	    Regulatory Institutions
      -	    Donors and Multi-lateral Institutions
      -	    Specialised and Apex Financial Institutions
      -	    Non-bank Financial Institutions
      -	    Microfinance Institutions
      -	    Private and Foreign Banks
      -	    State Owned Commercial Banks
      -	    Real Estate Developers and Brokers
      -	    Lawyers specialising in Mortgages and Real Estate
      -	    Association of Real Estate Developers
      -	    Statistical & Research Organisations
      -	    Internal Stakeholders: F&M GP team, Global Product Specialist (Housing Finance)

The discussions held with various stakeholders were complemented with research and desk-based review
of qualitative sector data and information gathered from various secondary sources. This was followed by
sending data requests to select organisations and institutions and doing trend analysis and forecasting using
data obtained. Based on the above, the report identified the key gaps, bottlenecks and barriers that afflict
the housing finance markets in Bangladesh and has proposed certain recommendations to address these
constraints. Further to this, a roadmap has been suggested for the various DFIs and GOB to undertake certain
strategic interventions in the near future, and potential implementation partners have been identified for
these interventions.

2.1 Trends in Urbanisation in Bangladesh
Bangladesh has experienced rapid urbanization during the last few decades. Between 1961 and 2011, the
country’s total population increased from 55 million to about 150 million (about 273%) while the urban
population increased from 2.6 million to about 43 million, registering a growth of nearly 1600% (source:
BBS). Of the total urban population, 60% reside in City Corporations with the remainder in Pourashavas
(Municipalities) and small towns. Various projections estimate the urban population in 2020 to be anywhere
from 60 to 80 million, that is, one and half to nearly two times of its current number.

Despite the fact that majority of Bangladesh’s population lives in rural areas, the importance of the traditional
rural sector has been declining over the years. The share of the agricultural sector in GDP has come down
from about 50 percent in 1972 to only 16 percent in 2015 (BBS, 2015).The rural population reached a peak of
107.8 million in 2011 and is projected to decline to 89.5 million by 2050. Conversely, the urban population,
which was 43 million in 2011 is projected to reach 112 million by 2050 and would still be growing.

*AEGR: Annual Exponential Growth Rate
Source: Population Census and GED estimations

The annual exponential growth rates (AEGR) of population in urban areas of Bangladesh have consistently
outpaced the growth rate in the rural areas. In effect, all future population growth in Bangladesh will be
urban. This implies that all natural increase in rural areas will be offset by net rural-urban migration. Thus,
Bangladesh, a small and predominantly rural country, is undergoing a transformation towards urbanization
at a remarkable pace.




                                                                                                                          21
  Barriers Constraining the Low and Middle Income Housing Finance Market in Bangladesh 2016




The components of such rapid urban growth are the following:
      	 A persistently high natural increase of native urban population
      	 Territorial extension of existing urban areas with conversion of nearby rural centres
      	 Rural to urban migration (which has been the most dominant component)
Rural-urban migration has a profound effect on redistribution of population in Bangladesh. The subsequent
result is that the urban areas have become overburdened with problems of unemployment, shortage of
housing, sanitation facilities and creation of slums. While the pull and push factors are operative, Dhaka’s
agglomeration economy provides diverse opportunities and hence, attracts most of the rural out-migrants.
There is, however, a significant variation in the level of urbanisation by districts or administrative regions.
Dhaka is the most urbanized district of the country. Other than Dhaka, the four most urbanized districts are
Narayangonj, Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi.

Bangladesh has some 570 urban centres, of which Dhaka is a megacity, Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi and
Sylhet are metropolitan areas, 25 urban centres are cities (with population of over 100,000 each) and the rest
are smaller towns. There are 11 City Corporations and over 322 Pourashavas (Municipalities). The distribution
of large and medium size cities and towns throughout the country offers reasonable access to urban services
to most areas in the country. However, the primacy of Dhaka is very prominent with over 44% of the total
urban population and 12.56% of the total population. Dhaka’s population with respect to the sum of the
second, third and fourth largest cities in Bangladesh, which are Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi respectively,
has increased from 1.50 times in 1981 to 2.26 times in 2011. In fact, population of Dhaka has multiplied
almost 6 times in this 30 year period. About 80% of the garments industry in Bangladesh is located in and
around Dhaka.

In absolute numbers, Dhaka City is projected to reach 27.4 million by 2030. This implies an average annual
growth rate of 4.3 percent. While other cities will also grow, their proportion of the total urban population is
expected to decline or remain static.

Increasing Metropolisation - The four metros of Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi, together they
account for 63.87% of the total urban population in 2011. The domination of business services, particularly
finance and real estate services is considerably higher in these four major cities relative to the rest of the
country. The growth rate of metropolitan cities has been more than the urban population growth rate as
a whole, underlining the fact that urbanization process is as yet unsaturated and rapid urban growth shall
continue in the coming decades mainly fuelled by the growth in the metros of Bangladesh.

It is therefore apparent that urbanization in Bangladesh is characterized by predominance of a few
metropolitan centres resulting in an uneven distribution of urban population and also development in the
country. Despite the challenges, urban areas demonstrate immense economic potential to generate growth
in the country. While urban dwellers constitute about 29% of the total population of the country, their
contribution to GDP is more than 45%.

2.2 Current Housing Stock and Housing Shortage Estimates
Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. The pressure of rapidly growing
urban population has had a major impact on the scarcity and costs of urban land for housing and other
purposes. Land prices are high and permanent housing is rare —barely 4% in rural areas and 28% in urban
centres. Bangladesh will need to construct approximately 8.5 million new houses in the next five years to
overcome the existing shortage in urban areas and meet the future demand of housing. Most of the need is
concentrated in the lower and lower-middle income groups.

Note that in Bangladesh, housing is classified into four categories:
1) Jhuprie (temporary): are shacks made from branches, bags, tarpaulin, jute, etc.
2) Kutcha (temporary): made of mud, bamboo, wood and corrugated iron sheets (CIS) as roofs
3) Semi-pucca (semi-permanent): where walls are made partially of bricks, floors are made from cement, and
roofs from corrugated iron sheets.
4) Pucca (permanent): will walls of bricks and roofs of concrete.

Urban poverty is invariably associated with poor quality housing. Most urban poor live in slums and squatter
settlements characterized by substandard living conditions. The rural poor, often landless or with negligible
land holding, struggle to afford residential land which is generally not inexpensive owing to high population
density across the country. The average housing quality is an even bigger concern in rural areas as over 85%
of the dwelling units are either inadequate (i.e. semi-pucca) or temporary structures (katcha, jhuprie). BBS has
categorized housing types by roof and wall material into cement/brick, corrugated iron/metal sheet, mud/
un-burnt brick/wood and straw/bamboo (See Table 9).

The highlighted figures in the table above represent houses which could be considered as inadequate or
deficient and could possibly be classified as “semi-pucca”, “katcha” (durable and non-durable) and “jhuprie”.
Over 85% of all rural dwelling units would therefore fall under such deficient categories, which signifies the
scale of housing need in rural areas either in the form of housing upgrades, improvements or new construction.

The Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES, 2010) undertaken by the BBS has analysed the data
on type of dwelling units of rural households and size of land owned by them (see Table 10). The highest i.e.
41.89% of rural households lived in katcha durable housing structure in which the wall and roof are made of
tin/CI sheet. The percentage of houses with katcha non-durable materials accounts for 34.18% where roof are
made of CI sheet/wood and wall is made of non-durable material like jute stalks/straw etc. The poorest lived
in jhuprie made of temporary materials like sack, polythene, straw etc.

In the urban areas, housing deficit grew from 1.13 million units in 2001 to 4.6 million units in 2010. This deficit
is projected to reach 8.5 million units in 2021 (See Table 11).

Nearly 44% of the urban households live in purely temporary structures while 29% live in semi-permanent
structures. The overwhelming majority live in poor quality houses and only 28% of urban households live in
pucca structures. So, in terms of both quantity (housing deficit) and quality, urban housing presents a major
policy challenge for Bangladesh.

In urban areas, approximately 35% of the low-income housing units are in slums: informal settlements that
include both private rental and private ownership housing, built on either privately owned land or illegally
occupied public land. Other categories of low-income housing include pavement dwellers and government-
provided squatter resettlement camps - plots of land with basic services that are provided on a leasehold
basis. Overcrowding has increased at these settlements due to an influx of rural migrants to work in the
expanding garment industry. E.g. 89% of poor households in Dhaka live in one-roomed homes where the
floor area per person is as small as 1.2 Sq.m. Slums are usually vulnerable to floods as they are located in low-
lying areas near rivers or on stilts over drainage channels.

Both Dhaka and Chittagong suffer from acute shortages in housing stock. Over 3 million people in Dhaka are
estimated to live in slums, and over a million in Chittagong. 60% of housing in Dhaka is classified as informal
or illegal, and therefore ineligible for government and donor sponsored funding for home improvement and
retrofitting. This is mainly because the current building standards are not affordable for majority of urban
residents.

Sanitation: Most urban residents in Bangladesh (including Dhaka and Chittagong) do not have a connection
to a public sewerage system. The simple latrine connected to septic tank system is the most widely used
form of sanitation. However, the use of sanitary toilet facilities in urban areas has increased quite significantly
during the last three decades, from 32.4% of urban households using sanitary toilet in 1981 to 76.12% in
2010.

2.3 Housing Supply from Developers / Public Sector / Individuals
The urban housing delivery system consists of mainly two groups - the formal sector and the informal sector.
An array of subsystems together makeup the delivery system:

Public Housing Subsystem: In urban areas the public sector has probably contributed directly and indirectly
to more than 10% of all urban housing activity during the last 40 years. The Public Works Department under
the Ministry of Housing and Public Works (MHPW) supplies rental housing to government employees. This
is in the form of readymade apartments, independent houses, or duplex housing units. The housing is
categorized by salary grades and supply is small compared to the demand. A lot of prime urban land is taken
up by the government for its staff housing throughout the country.

The former Housing and Settlements Directorate (HSD) and now National Housing Authority (NHA) in the
past supplied various types of housing to low and middle income households such as refugees, squatters and
general public. Activities included site and services schemes, slum upgrading, resettlement, infrastructure
improvement, and supply of core houses and flats. After construction, NHA and other development
authorities transfer the leasehold rights to the beneficiaries. The local development authorities in Dhaka
(Rajuk), Chittagong (CDA), Khulna (KDA) and Rajshahi (RDA) supply serviced plots among city dwellers, which
although subsidized, can be afforded only by middle and high income groups.

Cooperative Housing Subsystem: These are associations of groups registered under the Cooperatives Act,
1985, for those who wish to invest in land and housing. Cooperatives are usually formed by a group of people
with similar economic and occupation status. Housing cooperatives normally buy land in urban fringe areas
where large tracts of undeveloped land are available at low cost. In Bangladesh, cooperative housing has not
succeeded as they did not receive any support in the form of funds for land and infrastructure development.

Slum and Squatter Housing Subsystem: Slums are created by individuals and owners of private land to supply
low cost rental accommodations to the urban poor. With growth in informal and unorganised sector activity,
the business of slum housing is thriving. Squatting occurs on public or semi-public land by very poor migrants.
Squatters typically settle on road and railway sides, open spaces, vacant plots, embankments etc. Services are
non-existent, though in a few big settlements common services are provided by NGOs and Pourashavas.

Private Formal Subsystem: This includes middle and high income group housing (mostly apartments), led
by private developer initiatives mainly in Dhaka and metropolitan cities. In Dhaka there are about 1000+
companies registered under REHAB which have built about 0.15 million units till date. There is a growing
demand for such housing and the range of type, size and price is quite varied depending upon the location
and price of land. Often these residential projects are undertaken in joint venture with private land-owners.

Private Informal Subsystem: This is a process by which individuals construct their own houses through
procurement of land. Land is getting fragmented to meet the demand for housing in Dhaka and other cities.
A lot of informal housing development can be seen by way of extension, redevelopment and conversion of
old private houses into apartments.

The formal private sector has become visible recently but its presence is mostly limited to Dhaka and
Chittagong. Real estate business took off in Bangladesh in 1970 with only five registered firms and by 1988
there were 42 developers in business. At present, more than 1500 real estate firms/companies are active
with 1081 of them registered with REHAB. Over the past four decades, private developers have supplied
approximately 150,000 apartments (see chart above) and they will add another 50,000 units in the next three
years. The market though is highly segmented, based on location, price of land and size of apartments.

REHAB claims that currently about 25,000 units are supplied each year of which the private developers
(members) are supplying around 15,000 units. Among REHAB members, the top 20 companies hold 80% of


                                                                                                                            27

the market share. The rest of the units are built by individual land owners and independent developers who
are not members of REHAB.

2.4 Real Estate Market and Price Trends (Land & Apartments in Dhaka)
The real estate sector in Bangladesh is still recovering from the setback it suffered in 2011-2012. Private
developers have traditionally been catering to the upper and upper-middle income segments while the
middle and low income households are still largely untapped. The development of affordable housing is in a
very nascent stage. The sector had been performing well from 2004 to 2009 but the prices started to increase
sharply in 2009-10 due to influx of huge undisclosed monies, mostly from the capital market. After the stock
market crash in 2010-11, the sector was severely impacted in terms of expansion, new development and
turnover. The stagnant situation is continuing for over four years now. While genuine demand is still high, the
volatile political situation has reduced the investment appetite in the sector. Also, the prevailing price levels,
which have seen a 20-25% correction in recent years, are considered high in terms of affordability of middle
income households. Interest rates on housing loans have come down significantly in 2015 and the reduced
prices coupled with lower interest rates have revived buyer interest to some extent. However, in anticipation
of further price correction most customers are still holding back.

In case of joint venture projects, developers are either renegotiating the terms of under construction projects
or offering lower consideration to the landowners for new projects in their quest to reduce the price of the
apartments. But landowners are not agreeing to such proposals, owing to which ongoing projects are either
stuck or have slowed down and the number of new projects has vastly reduced. The developers are mostly
involved in completing and selling unsold apartments of the projects they have signed earlier. They are
facing difficulty in matching the prevailing market rate compared to the high consideration they have paid
or committed to the landowners to entice them to these projects.

Trends in recent housing prices can be observed in the context of Dhaka and its suburbs where market data
is more easily accessible and price trends in the capital city are generally advance indicators of trends across
Bangladesh. In the decade of 2000-2010, the percentage increase in per square feet price of apartments in
Dhaka was exponentially high, compared to the price increase in the earlier decade of 1990-2000 (See Table 13).

Correspondingly, during 2000-2010, the land prices increased very steeply across Dhaka city. Compared to
the increase in previous decade, the prices almost doubled, and in some areas the prices went up by three
to ten times. There is no direct government control over the increase in land prices within the city. This sharp
increase has had a direct bearing on prices of finished apartments and consequently on the purchasing
power of potential buyers.

Note that in South Asia, including in Bangladesh, land is measured in units known as ‘katha’. 1 katha is
approximately equal to 720 square feet (sq. ft.) in the Bangladeshi real estate market. However, in other South

As a result of the depressed property market from 2012 onwards, realtors were compelled to slash apartment
prices during 2013-2015. According to a study by Sheltech, a leading private developer, apartment prices in
Dhaka are nearly 25% cheaper than three years ago, when they were at their peak. In 2012, each square foot
of a flat in Dhaka sold for BDT 12,273 (USD 155) on average. The average prices came down to BDT 11,136
(USD 141) in 2013, BDT 10,182 (USD 129) in 2014 and BDT 9,091 (USD 115) in 2015. However even such
reduced prices have not been sufficient to reinvigorate the market.

Sheltech, which conducted the study in 2015, after obtaining data from leading real estate companies, found
that Dhaka has an unsold inventory of around 20,000 flats. The highest numbers of unsold flats are in Uttara,
followed by Mirpur. Banani saw the highest fall in prices over the previous year (2014), by 15%, followed by
Uttara and Shantinagar at 14%, and Mohammadpur and Kalabagan at 12.5%. The table and chart shown
below illustrate the downward trend in apartment prices in Dhaka across different suburbs and it is evident
that in most residential areas the 2015 prices are closer to the price level in 2010.

At present, Mirpur and Shyamoli are the most affordable locations with an average price of BDT 5,500 (USD
70) per sq ft. Baridhara is at the other end of the spectrum, the average price being BDT 18,000 (USD 228) per
sq ft. Land prices in Dhaka also fell on an average by 14% year-on-year, according to the study. The average
land price in 2015 was at BDT 19.4 m (USD 245,570) per katha, down from BDT 22.6 m (USD 286,076) in 2014.
Baridhara has the highest land price of around BDT 45 m (USD 569,620) per katha.

The recent fall in apartment prices has significantly eroded the profit margins of developers in their under
construction residential projects. According to REHAB, the sales figures fell by as much as 60% in 2013 and

the sluggish sales trend continues unabated till date. These developments have prompted some developers
to move towards the mid-market segment by reducing apartment sizes and opting for lesser standards in
finishing, fittings and fixtures so that they can bring down the prices of the finished unit to make it more
affordable. Nearly half of the finished apartments in Dhaka are in the range of 1,000 sq ft. to 1,600 sq ft., with
2-3 bedrooms, which seems to be the preferred size for most buyer households. On the other hand, only 2%
of the apartments are less than 700 sq ft., which indicates that the real estate sector has not quite been able
to address the huge unmet demand for affordable housing. Although the developers are focusing more on
economies of scale, they find it challenging to build smaller sized low-cost apartments in the capital due to
the exponential rise in land prices and the steady increase in the cost of construction materials.

2.5 Construction Costs in Dhaka and Other Metropolitan Cities
The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) in their annual survey for 2014 (BBS Statistical Pocketbook) has
assessed the increase in average building construction costs in Bangladesh over the past 12 years by indexing
it to the cost in 1998-99 (base year). The components of building material cost, transport cost and labour cost
add up to the general index which has seen an increase of nearly 250% over the past 10 years (See Table 16).

In the case of self-construction of an independent house undertaken by individual landowners, the average
construction cost (structure only) for a brick and concrete pucca house is currently in the range of BDT 1200
– 1500 (USD 15 – 19) per sq. ft. The construction of a typical low cost core house admeasuring 400 sq. ft.
(comprising two rooms, kitchen, toilet and bath) would cost approximately BDT 0.6 million (about USD 7,500).

        CHAPTER 3

DEMAND FOR LOW AND MIDDLE
INCOME HOUSING FINANCE

3.1 Household Income and Expenditure Pattern
The demand for housing finance among low and middle income households is directly linked to their
“affordability” in terms of disposable income available for payment of monthly instalments and surplus
assets which can be liquidated to meet the down-payment costs. The level of household income effectively
determines the borrowing household’s capacity to pay and therefore has a direct bearing on how much
housing finance they can afford.The table below provides monthly income per household, number of
members / earners per household and monthly per capita income. Average monthly income per household
at current prices was estimated at BDT 11,479 (USD 145) at the national level in 2010 with per capita monthly
income being BDT 2,553 (USD 32). The 2016 estimates in the table have been derived assuming the same
income growth as that of 2010 over the 2005 survey data. In 2016, the average monthly household income
for rural households is estimated at BDT 15,347 (USD 194) and for urban households at BDT 26,360 (USD 334).

  Barriers Constraining the Low and Middle Income Housing Finance Market in Bangladesh 2016




The Household Income and Expenditure Survey (2010) conducted by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics
(BBS) has estimated the total monthly expenditure and consumption expenditure per household by place
of residence (urban and rural) and also by divisions. At the national level, average monthly expenditure per
household was estimated at BDT 11,200 (USD 142) at current prices in 2010. It was BDT 9,612 (USD 122) in
rural areas and BDT 15,531 (USD 197) in urban areas. The average monthly consumption expenditure in 2010
stood at 98% of the total household expenditure at the national level. The estimates for 2016 consumption
expenditures have been derived assuming a 50% hike in the consumption expenditure level of 2010 (factoring
inflation trends over the past 6 years). The average monthly consumption expenditure is estimated at BDT
14,154 (USD 179) for rural households and BDT 22,914 (USD 290) for urban households.

The housing and house rent expenditure is the average monthly amount spent towards housing costs
including electricity, water, maintenance, upkeep and house rent in case of tenant households. The figure
as a percentage of consumption expenditure (see table below) appears to be low as it is an average of both
owner and tenant households.

The highest average monthly consumption expenditure in 2010 was recorded in Chittagong Division at BDT
14,360 (USD 182) [2016 estimate BDT 21,540 (USD 273)] followed by Sylhet Division at BDT 12,003 (USD 152)
[2016 estimate BDT 18,005 (USD 228)] and Dhaka Division at BDT 11,643 (USD 147) [2016 estimate BDT 17,465
(USD 221)].

3.2 Income distribution by Deciles and Affordability
Table 21 below shows the pattern of distribution of income from percentage share of income of households.
It is evident that the gap between the poorest of the poor (bottom 5%) and the richest of the rich (top 5%) is
extremely high. The income accruing to top 5% of the household was 24.61%, whereas, the same was 0.78%
for the bottom 5% households. The households belonging to Deciles 1-5 share only 20.33% of total income,
although they comprise 50% of the population. The food expenditure as percentage of total expenditure
is more than 60% for Deciles 1-6 which indicates their diminished capacity to service a housing loan from
formal sources. The low and middle income households in rural as well as urban areas who can afford formal
housing finance would possibly belong to Deciles 7-9.

In order to assess the affordability for formal housing finance it is important to determine the average
household income against each decile in rural and urban areas. Based on the average household monthly
income (2010) for urban and rural areas and the respective income distribution, the average incomes against
each decile have been derived in the Table 22 below and correspondingly the 2016 income values have also
been estimated.

Considering the 2016 estimates for household income the decile groups can be narrowed down to the
following subset (which represent the low and middle income segments) based on their affordability for
formal housing finance in both urban and rural geographies.

3.3 Housing Finance Demand Estimates for Dhaka, Metros and Cities (Formal – Urban)
The urban population of Bangladesh is growing at 4.4%, well above the national population growth rate
of 2.6% per annum. Currently 34% of the population lives in urban areas, and it is projected to reach 112
million or 55% of total population by 2050. The cities and towns, numbering more than 525, suffer from acute
problems of deteriorating infrastructure in the form of poor housing. Estimates of annual requirements for
housing in urban areas vary from 300,000 to 550,000 units. Bangladesh’s urban life is clearly dominated by
lower-middle and low-income population and majority of them are employed in the informal sector.

In the current housing market, it is considered impossible for these low-income segments to own affordable
houses. Hence, the only accommodation choice left to them is to rent houses and apartments that are supplied
by private individuals and landowners. Table 24 below illustrates the movement of house rent indices over
the past 14 years in the major urban centres of Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi. It can be observed
that in the past four years i.e. from 2010-11 to 2013-14, the rents have gone up steeply, by as much as 60% in
Dhaka and by around 50% in the three metropolitan cities.

In the six city corporations, an estimated one million plus households live in 9,000 plus densely populated
slum settlements (see Table 25 below). 87% of the slums are on private land but only 14.5% of them have any
land tenure security or rights. As such, almost all urban low-income households residing in slums are excluded
from mainstream sources of housing finance. The “owner” households, who can evidence tenure, might be
considered eligible for housing microfinance provided the lenders are comfortable with their income.

  Barriers Constraining the Low and Middle Income Housing Finance Market in Bangladesh 2016




In the above context, it can be inferred that while a large proportion of tenant households would have
ambitions to move into their own homes, only some of them would have the requisite means (income and
assets) to afford a housing loan. Moreover, the large tenant population residing in slum settlements would
not be able to avail housing loans for acquiring or upgrading their rented properties, owing to lack of tenure.
Purchase in the formal property market is also ruled out due to lack of supply of affordable housing.

Therefore, the housing finance demand for low and middle income households residing in urban areas from
formal institutional sources (including Banks, HFCs, NBFCs etc.) can be broadly determined through one of
the following two different approaches:

(i)	 a “supply side” approach would entail estimating the supply of new urban housing and apartments
     from public sector and private developers over, say, next 3-5 years and assessing the housing finance
     requirements for purchase of new properties and making suitable assumptions for costs of upgradation
     and improvement of existing houses;

(ii)	 an “income – affordability” method in which the demand is derived on the basis of the average disposable
      household income available at each income decile; the quantum of borrowing for housing needs is a
      factor of affordability in terms of repayment capacity, while assuming certain minimum loan parameters
      applied by the lenders.

Given the small capacity and limited presence of the formal real estate sector in Bangladesh, which caters
mainly to the upper income segments with virtually non-existent supply of affordable housing, adopting a
“supply side” approach is likely to provide an unreliable estimate of housing finance demand in urban areas.
Hence the “income – affordability” method has been used for the demand assessment as can be seen in the
Table 26 below.

The above table depicts the annualised housing finance demand for low and middle income urban households
(income deciles 7, 8, 9, 9.5) for the next four years i.e. FY2017 – FY2020. The average housing loan eligibility
has been arrived at by assuming the typical terms (debt to income, repayment term and interest rates) offered
by primary lenders in Bangladesh. The number of borrowing households has been conservatively estimated
assuming that only 10% of all urban households in each decile will seek (or draw upon) a housing loan over
the next four years (the table provides the no. of borrowing households per annum).

The projected housing finance demand for urban low and middle income households is BDT 103.17 billion
(USD 1.31 billion) p.a. for the next four years, the cumulative demand estimate being BDT 412.68 billion (USD
5.22 billion, approximately 2.72% of 2015 GDP).

This figure has to be seen in the context of the total housing loan outstanding in Bangladesh which stood
at BDT 489.9 billion (USD 6.2 billion) in June 2015. Further, it is important to note that this forecast pertains
only to the urban low income and lower middle income segments which have largely been excluded by

mainstream mortgage lenders. Therefore the derived figure reflects only additional demand for housing
finance, over and above existing demand from higher income households (belonging to Decile 10).

Since this is a conservative estimate, the impact of inflation, rising population and growing urbanisation has
not been taken into account. In any case, the urban housing shortage, current housing conditions, prospect
of tenant households aspiring to become owners and the emergence of Dhaka and other metropolitan cities
as rapidly growing economic centres would collectively imply that the assumption of only 10% of urban
households (as prospective housing loan borrowers) spread over the next four years is much on the lower
side. However, even this modest number would likely prove to be a huge stretch on the capacities of all
primary lenders including banks, NBFCs and specialised FIs.

3.4 Housing Finance Demand Estimates for Semi-urban and Rural Centres (Formal – Rural)
The average household income in rural areas is significantly lower than in urban areas and so the affordability
for housing finance is also diminished. An added challenge is the quality of title documents to the house
property which may not be considered sound enough for security purpose owing to legal imperfections.
Besides, rural houses may not have a ready resale market which adds to the discomfort of the lenders. The
eligibility for a housing loan would hinge more on the assessed income of the applicant/s and the size of
(agricultural) land owned by rural households directly impacts the stability of household income.

Table 27 below provides information on monthly household income, expenditure, family size and number of
earners by size of own land in rural areas. The average income (in 2010) of the households owning land of 7.50
acres and above was BDT 29,673 (USD 376) which was 5.2 times higher than the average income of landless
group. Average monthly income per household in rural areas increased with the increase in landholding. It
can be observed that the largest percentage, 37.76%, owned a mere 0.05-0.49 acres, whereas 79.63% owned
0.01-1.49 acres. This suggests that typically farm sizes are very small in Bangladesh.

accessing formal housing finance (refer Table 23), it can be concluded that only households with a minimum
landholding of half an acre or more (i.e. higher income deciles) would have the requisite income affordability
to service a housing loan. In order to have consistency, the same “income affordability” method can be
adopted with slightly different assumptions to determine the rural housing finance demand (See Table 28
below).

In estimating the rural housing finance demand, the Decile 7 households have not been included as their
income levels (average monthly income is about BDT 14,000) might be considered too low by the mainstream
primary lenders. However, households in Deciles 5-7 should potentially qualify for housing microfinance
loans offered by MFIs.

By applying similar assumptions (as in the case of urban housing finance demand) the total annual housing
finance demand from low and middle income rural households (Deciles 8, 9, 9.5) is estimated at BDT 51.23
billion (USD 0.65 billion) and over the next four years (i.e. FY17 – FY20) the cumulative demand is likely to be
BDT 204.91 billion (USD 2.6 billion). This figure is approximately 50% of the housing finance demand from
urban areas. Since this is a conservative estimate, it is assumed that only 10% of rural households in each of
the eligible deciles will seek or draw upon a housing loan over the next four years.

3.5 Demand Estimates for Housing Microfinance (HMF) - Urban and Rural
As described in Chapter I, access to the formal financial system in Bangladesh is limited mostly to upper-
income groups. However, market outreach in housing finance can be stretched down the income scale
through innovation and enabling regulation. But there would still be some income groups at the bottom of
the scale for whom mortgages and new home purchases will remain unaffordable, even in developed markets.
Microfinance institutions (MFIs) could target some of these clients for home improvement, incremental
construction, and new construction housing loans. Among potential finance providers, MFIs have several
comparative advantages in serving low-income clients, including prior experience and knowledge of their
borrowers and access to their savings.

Some of the biggest MFIs in Bangladesh have made progressive forays into housing microfinance. In 1987,
Grameen introduced its first housing loan following a devastating flood. Grameen Bank’s housing portfolio
exceeded BDT 0.2 billion in 2009-10, with 89% repayment rates, having cumulatively financed over 600,000
homes. Several other MFIs, such as BRAC, Proshika and ASA Bangladesh, have launched long- and short-term
credit products for housing (both urban and rural), however with mixed success. Some of these products
have been scaled down or even discontinued (e.g. Grameen and BRAC). Some of PKSF’s partner MFIs have
participated in the Grihayan Tahibil scheme of Bangladesh Bank but PKSF itself does not have a housing
product or any special funding arrangement. PKSF is however making a fresh foray in 2016 by accessing a
World Bank credit line for housing microfinance under the Low Income Community Housing Support Project
(LICHSP).

Housing microfinance loans are usually made on the basis of established membership in MFIs lending
program and a sound track record of repayment of previous loans, instead of collateral. Group pressure and
mutual support (joint liability) are used as guarantees for loan repayment. The only recourse in the case of
default is the persuasive and quasi legal means to recover the loan and the possible threat of future exclusion
of the borrower from the credit program. The interest rates for housing microfinance are often lower than
income-generating loans and are internally cross-subsidized within the MFI. This is done for the following
reasons: (a) housing is considered a social good and a basic need worthy of subsidization; and (b) without
subsidy the poor would not be able to afford a housing loan.

Housing loan products offered by MFIs from their own funding sources typically carried flat interest rates
ranging from 10% – 15% and the effective annualised rates are 15% - 25%. These loans had relatively
simple application and approval procedures and some products came bundled with construction technical
assistance. As these products evolved, a few MFIs tested individual lending with mortgage of house property
as security akin to their SME finance offering (home equity product). However, owing to funding and other
constraints at the MFIs and issues relating to portfolio performance, these initiatives often got curtailed and
could not grow into a significant component of the MFI lending activity.Nevertheless, given the tremendous
success and growth of microfinance over the past four decades and the vast infrastructure and presence of
MFIs across the length and breadth of Bangladesh, it can be easily concluded that housing microfinance has
immense potential in addressing the challenge of housing finance access among low-income households.

It would therefore be appropriate to follow the same income-affordability method in determining the annual
demand for housing microfinance in rural and urban areas. The two tables below (Table 29 - HMF Rural)
and (Table 30 - HMF Urban) show the calculation for different income deciles based on their average 2016
incomes and certain assumptions in respect of the typical lending terms that MFIs might consider offering
to their HMF clients.

It is likely that HMF loans with ticket sizes below BDT 100,000 (USD 1,266) would be offered as group / joint
liability loans as in the case of lower income deciles and the bigger ticket loans for higher income deciles
could be offered as individual loans. As can be seen in these two tables, the annual housing microfinance
demand has been estimated at BDT 32.87 billion (USD 0.42 billion) in rural areas and BDT 17.27 billion (USD
0.22 billion) in urban areas and over the next four years the total housing microfinance demand is expected
to be in excess of BDT 200 billion (USD 2.54 billion). The assumptions in respect of interest rates, tenor and

debt to income ratio may appear to be somewhat simplistic and not sufficiently nuanced. However, these
assumptions reflect the prevailing market conditions and are based on inputs received from different MFIs,
PKSF and MRA. This limitation exists as the housing microfinance sector in Bangladesh is very nascent and
still evolving.

3.6 Consolidated Demand Forecasting (2017 – 2020)
The overall demand for housing finance among low and middle income segments can be broken down by
geography (urban and rural) and by sources (formal i.e. mainstream primary lenders and informal i.e. MFIs
and NGOs). The above sections of this Chapter provide the detailed calculations and methods for assessing
the demand for each sub-segment. Table 31 below summarises the figures from the previous tables and
presents the consolidated demand projections for the next four years (2017 – 2020).

Source: Author’s estimates

The gross projected housing finance demand arising from low and middle income segments is estimated at
BDT 204.54 billion (USD 2.59 billion) annually, which translates into BDT 818.16 billion (USD 10.36 billion) over
the next four years. To put these consolidated figures into perspective, the cumulative additional demand
projected over the next four years is 167% of the total 2015 housing loan outstanding across Bangladesh’s
financial sector and possibly 6 – 7 times the current total housing loan disbursements per annum.

It is important to understand that these figures represent additional demand over and above the formal
housing finance and mortgages being currently accessed by upper income segments and ultra-rich.
Therefore, the challenge will be for the financial sector as a whole, including the microfinance players, to
augment their capacities and geographical presence so as to meet the housing finance requirements of low
and middle income households.

      CHAPTER 4

PRIMARY LENDERS AND STRUCTURE
OF HOUSING FINANCE MARKET

4.1 Primary Mortgage Lenders and Suppliers of Housing Finance
Much of the funds for house construction in Bangladesh come from informal sources that include cash savings,
loans (and gifts) from relatives, moneylenders, shopkeepers and so forth. This sourcing can be attributed to
the inadequacies of the existing formal financing system. Commercial banks and housing finance NBFCs
provide the majority of formal housing finance to the “creditworthy” borrowers. Lending criteria generally
reflect cautiousness, particularly through restrictive loan-to-cost maximums (generally capped at 70%, but
averaging 50% in practice), a loan ceiling of BDT 12 million (USD 151,900) for all commercial banks and
relatively small average loan amounts, typically in the range of BDT 2.5–3.0 million (USD 31,500 – 38,000) for
many lenders. The tenor for housing loans is generally in the range of 10–20 years. Interest rates are fixed, but
loan agreements typically stipulate that the lenders can change the rates at their discretion during the life of
the loan and some lenders do adjust the rates in the event of money market fluctuations.

The total outstanding housing loans from banks and financial institutions as of end of June 2015 amounted
to BDT 489.9 billion (USD 6.2 billion) [see Tables 32 and 33 below], which amounted to 8.8% of total credit to
the private sector. The total mortgage debt to GDP had risen from 2.72% in 2010 to 3.51% in 2013 but has
since fallen to 3.23% (June 2015). In recent years, significant changes have taken place in total housing loan
portfolios. Commercial banks now have a dominating presence with a market share of 75% - 80%. This has
happened at the expense of specialised housing finance providers such as BHBFC and Delta Brac Housing
(leading private NBFC) which have been steadily losing market share.

                                                                                                                   43
 Barriers Constraining the Low and Middle Income Housing Finance Market in Bangladesh 2016




  Table 33: Total Housing Loan Outstanding for Different Lender Categories (FY10 – FY12)




Within the banking sector, private sector banks have been expanding their housing loan portfolios and now
have the largest exposure of BDT 266.0 billion (USD 3.37 billion) in outstanding housing loans as of June 2015.
The state owned commercial banks had the second largest exposure of BDT 108.5 billion (USD 1.37 billion)
and ‘other’ banks had BDT 21.0 billion (USD 0.27 billion) in outstanding housing loans as of end of June 2015.

The portfolio of ‘Other’ banks (which comprise foreign and specialised banks) has been steadily falling from
BDT 46.1 billion (USD 0.58 billion) in June 2013 to BDT 21 billion (USD 0.27 billion) in June 2015 and this
is also the case with Grameen Bank, the only significant microcredit lender. Its housing loan portfolio has
been shrinking over the past 6-7 years to almost nil level in June 2015. Foreign banks such as ‘The Standard
Chartered Bank’ traditionally had a significant mortgage loan exposure among high net-worth individuals
and non-resident Bangladeshis. Although it has been losing market share in the past few years, in 2015-
16 the bank has begun an aggressive campaign to take over housing loans of other mortgage lenders at
attractive interest rates (as low as 9% p.a. and nil fees).

4.2 Non-Bank Financial Companies (NBFCs)
Among the NBFCs, two specialised housing finance companies viz. Delta Brac Housing (DBH) and National
Housing Finance and Investments (NHFIL) have been traditionally among the biggest private lenders in
housing finance. They raise funds by accepting long term public deposits including some contractual deposit
schemes and through bank borrowings.

DBH with over 39% market share among NBFCs, has enjoyed the status of an industry leader by virtue of
its single product focus, high operating standards and consistent performance in terms of growth and
profitability over the past two decades. DBH has a strong marketing liaison with most builders, and gets a
major portion of its business from large-size residential projects. With its vigilant loan surveillance system, it
is maintaining its non-performing loans at the level of about 0.5-0.7%. DBH has a diversified funding base,
including credit from multilateral agencies and local commercial banks, public deposits and access to the
Bangladesh Bank refinance window. It has a business focus of around 80% in Dhaka and 20% in Chittagong
and Sylhet. During FY15, DBH opened new sales oﬃces at Gazipur, Savar, Mirpur and Narayanganj. However,
since 2010, growth at DBH has been slowing down year after year at the cost of declining market share and
this suggests a conservative outlook as well as risks afflicting the real estate market.

NHFIL started operations in 1998 and it holds twin licenses – as a housing finance company and a lease

finance company, with the requirement to maintain housing finance as its core business (more than 51% of
its loan book). NHFIL funds its lending operations mainly from deposits, which occasionally results in a term
mismatch of assets and liabilities. Since average loan size in leasing is higher than housing, and it yields better
returns, there is a tendency at NHFIL to shift lending emphasis from housing to leasing. NHFIL had slowed its
housing finance operations during 2010-2012 when it experienced a sudden spike in NPLs. However, it has
grown well in the period 2013-2015 with a CAGR of about 33%.

The above data indicates a steady rise in annual disbursements for retail home loans and a corresponding
increase in the total loan outstanding which has nearly doubled during the five year period. The average loan
outstanding figure has however increased only marginally and this probably reflects the slowdown in the
real estate market and reduced apartment prices. It is noteworthy that the gross non-performing loan (NPL)
figure has worsened year-on-year and in 2015 (1.87%), it is more than twice the level of 2011 (0.89%). Yet,
an NPL of 1.87% on the total NBFC exposure indicates reasonably well performing housing loan portfolios,
particularly in the context of the adverse market conditions.

Similar data was obtained for the real estate and developer finance exposure (corporate loans) of NBFCs as
shown in Table 35 below. It is likely that bulk of this exposure is towards residential projects. The consolidated
figures for the period FY11 – FY15 indicate a relatively difficult situation with NPLs rising to an unsustainable
level 10.7% in FY15. This deterioration in asset quality is a direct consequence of the crisis in the real estate
sector in 2011-12 and it is unlikely that NBFCs will regain their confidence in the sector in the near future.

Among NBFCs, recently IDLC Finance (formerly Industrial Development Leasing Company) has emerged as a
strong and competitive player in housing finance with a fast growing loan book and monthly disbursements
at nearly the same level as DBH. IDLC has ambitious growth plans and is keen to emerge as the largest private
lender in housing finance. It is currently the second largest lender with approximately 22% market share
among NBFCs.

Another niche player is United Finance (formerly United Leasing Company), which received IFC’s support
in the form of Advisory Services for the launch and expansion of its low-income housing finance product.
The product is now offered across 33 districts through 12 branches and as at January 2016, the company’s
housing loan portfolio was BDT 53.5 million (USD 0.68 million) with an average ticket size of only BDT 0.12
million (USD 1,519).

4.3 Bangladesh House Building Finance Corporation
The state-owned Bangladesh House Building Finance Corporation (HBFC) is a specialised financial institution
and the oldest housing finance provider from the pre-independence era. HBFC had BDT 30.2 billion (USD 0.38
billion) in outstanding housing loans as of June 2015. The sources of HBFC’s funds are primarily its paid-up
capital and the proceeds from issuance of Government guaranteed low interest bearing debentures to state
owned commercial banks and Bangladesh Bank. The second mode of funding has however been unavailable
in recent years owing to the gradual decline in HBFC’s financial health (see Table 36).

HBFC is therefore constrained to rely upon recoveries of past loans for new lending after defraying operating
and debt servicing costs. Consequently, the flows available for fresh lending have declined (See Table 37
below). In FY14 and FY15, Taka 3.9 billion and 2.7 billion (USD 49.37 million and USD 34.18 million) were
disbursed out of recoveries of Taka 4.6 billion and Taka 4.8 billion respectively (USD 58.23 million and USD
60.76 million).

The HBFC, being a state enterprise, is operationally, financially and administratively regulated by the Ministry
of Finance through issue of Rules, Regulations and Directives. For “classification” of its non-performing
portfolio, HBFC is following the guidelines of the Ministry of Finance, which are not as stringent as those
imposed by Bangladesh Bank on banks and NBFCs. The percentage of classified loans in the above table
would be much higher if the Bangladesh Bank’s norms for NBFCs were to be applied. These disadvantages
make it harder for HBFC to source debt funding and compete in an increasingly competitive housing finance
market. HBFC’s loan disbursements are falling year on year. Although HBFC faces challenges stemming from
its governance structure and high NPLs, it remains the only institution of its kind serving the low- and middle-
income segment with a wider geographic coverage beyond Dhaka and a few larger cities.

4.4 Scheduled Commercial Banks
Most commercial banks in Bangladesh, both public and private, have well established in-house mortgage
finance departments. State owned commercial banks (SCBs) are the second largest source of housing finance
following private banks, though banks in general are subject to more restrictive and stringent regulations that
are intended to curtail their exposure in housing finance and mortgages. Table 37 below gives consolidated
mortgage data from 2010 and 2015. As can be seen, banks have a much larger exposure in residential self-
construction as against purchase of apartments / land / house repair loans.

Tables 38 and 39 below provide the number of live accounts by loan purpose and the average loan outstanding
per loan account in both rural and urban areas.

Surprisingly, the number of loan accounts in rural Bangladesh has dropped by a third during 2010 to 2015 and
the average outstanding exposure has gone up from BDT 0.48 million (USD 6,076) to BDT 1.58 million (USD
20,000). The combined average loan outstanding across rural and urban Bangladesh stood at BDT 1.75 million
(USD 22,152) as compared to BDT 5.73 million (USD 72,532) in case of NBFCs. This suggests that the banks,
specifically SCBs seem to be catering largely to the middle-income segments as compared to the private
NBFCs, which are more focused on the upper income segments. Islamic banking, including Sharia compliant
mortgage lending is also a fast growing product in Bangladesh. The Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited (IBBL)


 48
                            Barriers Constraining the Low and Middle Income Housing Finance Market in Bangladesh 2016




is the leading Islamic commercial bank with a significant presence in housing finance, especially in rural and
urban markets outside Dhaka.

The state owned commercial banks (SCBs) typically have a lower cost of funds because they receive bulk
of their deposits from government entities, which are statutorily required to deposit at least 75% of their
funds with SCBs. Nonetheless, the SCBs suffer from term mismatch because they are constrained by the
maturities of their deposits (generally 1-3 years). The SCBs thus give priority to corporate short-term lending,
and they set a low ceiling on the amount of mortgage loans they wish to extend annually (typically 3–6% of
their outstanding portfolios). Housing finance is only part of their mortgage portfolios, a significant portion
of which is allocated to commercial real estate. The SCBs follow a policy of slightly higher intermediation
spreads for housing, particularly as they seek to offset the poor profitability of their other assets and make
up for inadequate provisioning. Despite low loan-to-value ratios, the rate of delinquency is high. Private and
foreign commercial banks have grown as providers of housing finance overtaking the SCBs, with housing
loans making up 5–10% of their loan portfolios. They use the same deposit-based funding as do the SCBs, but
they are less handicapped by delinquencies. These banks do not enjoy the privileges of the SCBs, but they
are more efficient and provide better service quality, better product options, and expanded branch networks.
However, their impact on the market is likely to remain marginal because they target only upper-income
borrowers.

Due to overheating of urban property markets during 2010-2012, the portfolio quality of most banks suffered
and their exposure in mortgages and real estate was identified as one of the principal reasons for the stress
in the financial sector. Consequently, Bangladesh Bank imposed stiff regulatory restrictions on banks and
even NBFCs to discourage further exposure in mortgage loans, including retail home loans. SCBs continue to
remain stressed till date with very high NPLs on account of various irregularities related to their industrial and
corporate lending portfolios. Banking sector NPLs stood at 10.5% at the end of Q3FY15.

Among private sector banks, BRAC Bank is emerging as the fastest growing player in housing finance and
it’s month on month disbursements now exceed all other banks (as well as DBH). Therefore BRAC Bank seems
to command the highest market share in annual disbursements. However, the mortgage exposure of BRAC
Bank is reaching around 8% of its total loan book and since the regulatory ceiling is 10%, the bank does not
have much room for growth unless it can grow its loan book at the same pace. Among other banks, IFIC Bank
and IBBL are more active in the market, while Prime Bank and Eastern Bank have a conservative outlook and a
steady portfolio. Other private banks such as The City Bank and AB Bank are largely absent in retail mortgages
as they focus on corporate lending.

4.5 Government Funded Housing Schemes and Programs
Government funded housing programs comprise a “Housing Fund” called Grihayan Tahbil (detailed
description given below) and occasional refinance facilities that have been funded by the Government and
/ or multilateral institutions and administered by the central bank. In July 2007, Bangladesh Bank started a
refinance scheme to assist middle-income households to buy homes in cities and to encourage banks and
NBFCs to lower their interest rates on home loans. Initially, a fund of BDT 3 billion (USD 38 million) was created
for this scheme; later, it was enhanced to BDT 7 billion (USD 88.6 million).

People earning less than BDT 50,000 (USD 633) a month were eligible under the refinance scheme to get
housing loans from any participating FIs (up to a maximum of BDT 2 million, i.e. USD 25,316). The loan was for
purchase of an apartment not larger than 1,250 square feet, located in one of six divisional cities or in Gazipur,
Narayanganj, Savar, or Tongi. The loan period was up to 20 years (with a 1-year grace period) at a subsidised
interest rate of 9% p.a. The scheme benefited only the formal middle income borrowers and DBH absorbed
nearly 70% of the total funds made available. The scheme was untenable over the long term at concessional
interest rates, given the huge funding gap and unmet demand for housing finance in the target income
segments and as such, the facility was discontinued.

In 1998, the Bangladesh government started Grihayan Tahbil, a housing fund intended for the low-income
groups. The fund is housed within Bangladesh Bank and provides loans to NGOs and MFIs at an interest
rate of 2% p.a., which in turn extend housing credit to the rural poor at the rate of 6% p.a. with a repayment
period of up to 10 years. A similar government program called Asrayan, funds the construction of low-income
barrack-type houses. Up to June 2015, Grihayan Tahbil released BDT 1.9 billion (USD 24.05 million) against
allocation of BDT 2.9 billion (USD 36.71 million) through 513 NGOs which covered 450 upazilas across 64



                                                                                                                   49
  Barriers Constraining the Low and Middle Income Housing Finance Market in Bangladesh 2016




districts resulting in the construction of over 60,000 houses. Until June 2015, Tahbil could recover BDT 1.2
billion (USD 15.19 million) against total recoverable amount of BDT 1.3 billion (USD 16.46 million) and the
recovery rate was 91.9%.

The participating MFIs find it difficult to impose the conditions relating to certain type and minimum size of
houses which are defined under the Grihayan Tahbil program. Besides, the maximum loan amount of up to
BDT 60,000 (USD 759) is often inadequate in relation to the construction cost. These challenges contribute to
the unutilized funds remaining under the scheme. A part of the fund is being used to construct a dormitory
for women garment workers at Ashulia.

4.6 Housing Microfinance (HMF) Products offered by NGO-MFIs
There are only a few examples of successful housing microfinance models around the world. However, there is
enough experience and lessons from past and ongoing efforts at providing finance for low income housing via
microfinance and similar channels. MFIs in Bangladesh currently provide small, short-maturity loans (typically
BDT 5,000–25,000 [USD 65-325] for six months to two years) for livelihood and consumption purposes and
some of these loans are inadvertently diverted towards housing needs. Very few MFIs are offering loans in
the microcredit range for incremental construction, home repair or sanitation (i.e. construction of toilet /
bath). Several conditions need to be met to ensure effectiveness in extending such informal housing loans
and to develop a sound HMF portfolio: detailed knowledge of the housing microfinance market, capacity
building in loan appraisal techniques, effective guarantee mechanisms to limit risks, lending methodologies
and policies designed for high-risk areas, and cost-effective ways to reach rural/informal sector clients.

                                  Barriers Constraining the Low and Middle Income Housing Finance Market in Bangladesh 2016




The Microcredit Regulatory Authority (MRA) presently regulates 697 licensed MFIs across Bangladesh. In
addition, MRA has provided temporary approval to 205 new MFIs and NGOs on a conditional basis. Broadly,
there are three categories of MFIs from a regulatory perspective: Large, Mid-sized and Small. In the Large
category there are only four MFIs - BRAC, ASA, TMSS and BURO (together they have 70-75% market share).
In the Mid-range there are approximately 250 MFIs and the remaining 400+ are in the Small category. This
excludes Grameen Bank which is directly regulated by the Bangladesh Bank.

Table 40 above presents the operational and financial summary of all licensed MFIs in Bangladesh and their
consolidated figures, including data from Grameen Bank. The figures suggest a growth of around 33% in loan
disbursements and about 20% in loans outstanding in FY2015 (over 2014), which is similar to the growth
experienced in FY2012 (over 2011). However, the total number of active borrowers has not changed during
2011 - 2015, holding at approximately 29 million, including those from Grameen Bank. The average loan
outstanding per borrower has risen from BDT 8,480 (USD 107) to BDT 15,254 (USD 193) during the past five
years, but the current level is still low enough to accommodate further exposure in housing microfinance if
made available to the same set of borrowers.

Any diversification into a new housing microfinance product can be undertaken only on the basis of a
rigorous demand and market assessment. The product design must be flexible and should reflect the needs
and preferences of the low-income clientele in terms of loan amount, interest rates and tenor, and loan
repayment should be aligned with their actual affordability. Currently, microcredit borrowers are only used
to small ticket sizes of BDT 20-30,000 (USD 253-380) with multiple loan cycles and so the transition to larger
tickets and longer tenor has to be gradual with an incremental approach.

Large MFIs such as Grameen and BRAC which had initiated housing loans in the past have not had a good
experience with their portfolio performance and hence they are hesitant in undertaking a new housing
microfinance product. BRAC has started to develop a sanitation loan product with tickets of up to BDT 18,000
(USD 228) and tenor of 6-12 months, however it is not keen to try a longer tenor of 24/36 months due to the
perceived difficulty in managing portfolio quality. Proshika, which is another large category MFI, has been
accessing funding for its housing loan product under the Grihayan Tahbil program.

As can be seen in Table 41 below, the pricing of housing microfinance loans depends a great deal on the
source of funding and varies from low subsidised rates of 6-8% (donor funded) to commercial rates of up to
25% (self-funded).

In order to offer larger ticket housing loans e.g. for new construction housing, MFIs would need the comfort
of mortgaging the house property. If these are individual loans, then in the absence of peer pressure, the
security arrangement alone will act as a deterrent to wilful default. Traditionally, the spirit of microcredit in
Bangladesh has been to offer collateral free loans to the borrowers. Although there is no regulatory restriction
on mortgage of house property for the purpose of housing loans by an MFI, there is a legal issue that needs
to be studied. An ordinance from 1984 does not permit any charge to be created on homesteads in rural
areas. Even if a house property can be mortgaged, it may only serve as a paper security as any attempt to
evict a poor household by enforcing the mortgage would lead to negative publicity and adversely affect the
reputation of the lender.

In respect of micro-enterprise loans which MRA stipulates to be in the range of minimum BDT 50,000 (USD
633) to maximum BDT 1 million (USD 12,658), MFIs are allowed hypothecation of any movable asset funded
out of the loan. BRAC has a large loan portfolio for a micro-enterprise product called “Progoti”, under which it
usually insists on equitable mortgage of rural / urban properties, as a security measure. Till date the product
has performed well and the portfolio has grown to nearly 20% of BRAC’s total loan book. A similar approach
could be followed by other MFIs for initiating housing microfinance loans. However, the legal validity of
equitable mortgage needs to be understood further. Other considerations might include: whether the MFI
insists on a prior bank account (to facilitate disbursement and loan repayment via electronic clearing service)
and security arrangements such as personal guarantees, post-dated cheques and security cheques.

In the consolidated microcredit portfolio of all MFIs, the share of micro-enterprise loans is at around 28%.
MFIs are allowed to offer other products and services to their member clients, so long as the core microcredit
loans outstanding is at a minimum of 50% of the total loan book (funded from members’ savings and external
borrowings). Hence, any HMF product portfolio should be part of this maximum limit of 50% along with
micro-enterprise loans and other loan products. However, in the case of PKSF administered credit line or a
donor funded separate project and for loans made under Grihayan Tahbil, the MFI can obtain a waiver on this
50% ceiling being applied on the portfolio generated from such funding.

Most MFIs have few funding mechanisms at their disposal and hence they either rely on their own funding
(which includes members’ savings and internal surplus) and funding mobilised from donors. There are
however no commercial sources of longer-term (three- to five-year) funding, which constrains MFIs in
making the larger-ticket, longer tenor loans needed for home construction and renovations, without causing
asset-liability mismatches. The proposed PKSF administered credit line of US$ 16 million funded by the
World Bank under its Low Income Community Housing Support Project (LICHSP) is expected to address the
funding issue in a limited way as it will cater to select MFIs offering urban housing microfinance products.
Habitat for Humanity, Bangladesh, an international NGO, is also planning a foray into housing microfinance
by partnering with a few leading MFIs in 6-7 districts, which are expected to facilitate housing loans funded
out of Habitat’s resources.

         CHAPTER 5

IMPEDIMENTS TO SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
OF HOUSING FINANCE MARKET


5.1 Policy, Regulatory and Legal Environment for Housing Finance
The mortgage market in Bangladesh has grown in size over the years and has become more competitive.
Yet, public sector housing programs and government initiatives have fallen short of the growing demand for
affordable housing. Overall, the size of the combined public housing programs has remained extremely small
in relation to housing demand. On the other hand, private sector housing development and housing finance
is unable to meet the needs of most middle and low income households. The urban poor whose incomes are
predominantly informal are almost excluded from access to housing finance.

The policy framework for housing and housing finance should ideally encompass policies that relate to
(i) various supply side aspects such as land use, urban development, real estate and affordable housing; (ii)
financial sector policies which should comprise banking, microfinance, insurance, retail housing finance
and construction finance (i.e. project finance to developers); along with (iii) an enabling financial and legal
infrastructure that would include credit information bureau, collateral registry and legal / judicial system
which facilitates a fast track foreclosure process. Government of Bangladesh has put in the public domain (a)
well intentioned policies that look into supply side and development challenges and (b) planning commission
documents and central bank reports that discuss the financial sector situation and outline the Government’s
approach and priorities:

    -	   The National Housing Policy, 2008
    -	   The National Urban Sector Policy, 2010
    -	   The National Land Use Policy, 2001
    -	   The National Rural Development Policy, 2001
    -	   The Seventh Five Year Plan 2016-2020
    -	   Financial Market Developments and Challenges in Bangladesh (Research Paper in preparation of the
         Seventh Five Year Plan)
    -	   Financial Stability Report, 2015 (Bangladesh Bank)

However, the country is still lacking a comprehensive housing and housing finance policy framework that
fully addresses the challenges and opportunities of its rapidly urbanising and growing economy. The existing
policies have not been put into proper effect and the implementation is poor. Another issue is that the
policies have not been updated from time to time and some are still draft policies for which the cabinet
approval is delayed. E.g., the national physical plan or land use plan which is long pending and the draft
National Housing Policy of 2014 which has recently been approved in April 2016.

For sustained growth, the market needs balanced funding models and a diversified toolbox of instruments
for different lenders. The present regulatory, legal and funding environment is however not quite supportive
in this regard. The economic factors influencing the supply side and demand side are often interrelated
and also mutually dependent as is evident in the following example. Private developers in Bangladesh
are increasingly participating in housing supply in major towns and cities. A key barrier for large-scale
construction market development, especially for low-income housing, has been the dearth of developer


                                                                                                                   53

financing. Funding for builders is limited because of the underlying risks involved and so land acquisition
for housing development is mostly funded by equity. That in turn confines new development projects to an
inefficiently small scale. Although construction loans are available, they have low loan to-value ratios and
carry such high rates of interest that developers consider them to have little value. Owing to the lack of
robust construction financing, the ultimate buyer of the property usually finances the construction costs
through instalment payments. Even if used, construction loans to developers can run into titling transfer
problems among the parties involved viz. land-owner (in case of joint venture projects), developer, mortgage
lender and the home-buyer. As construction progresses, mortgage lenders move the construction loan
liability to the account of individual homebuyers in the project who have been sanctioned a housing loan.
This transfers the lender’s risk from the developer to retail homebuyers since the latter have to pay significant
advances to the developer at each stage of construction before the possession is granted. The buyer bears
the interest burden on these advances which reduces his affordability and this further limits the market for
new construction to clients who can pay fully upfront—the upper-income groups. As a result, developers
are more focused on the premium segment and are not very keen to undertake mass affordable housing
projects, thereby constraining the market opportunity for primary lenders in low-income housing finance.

Bangladesh Bank presently imposes stiff regulatory restrictions on commercial banks to limit their exposure
in housing finance and in real estate/developer finance. As such, growth in retail home loans or in mortgage
lending to developers can be achieved only at the cost of one over the other. Banks’ general preference for
growing retail assets (considered less risky) directly impacts the availability of construction and developer
finance.

In the retail segment, the central bank does not have any special regulatory guidelines/ specific norms
pertaining to housing loans and these are treated as part of Consumer Finance and thus covered under the
Prudential Regulations applicable to consumer finance. However the regulations differ among commercial
banks (governed by the Banking Regulation and Policy Department) and non-bank financial institutions
(governed by the Department of Financial Institutions and Markets) as illustrated in Table 40 below:

As can be observed from the above table, prudential regulations are much in favour of NBFCs and specialised
HFCs (except HBFC which is directly regulated by MOF). The irony is that most NBFCs, owing to their legal
form and smaller balance sheets have limited capacity for fund raising and thus can build only smaller
portfolios. The banks on the other hand have a much larger retail presence and branch infrastructure and
access to savings accounts, which unfortunately are not sufficiently leveraged due to excessive restrictions. It
is important that the central bank considers amending the prudential norms to some extent to create a more
level playing field between commercial banks and NBFCs.

High land prices and scarcity of buildable land increases the cost of housing and has a direct bearing on
residential prices. The government policy towards real estate and land use should ideally facilitate land
prices to be established at a sustainable level. This shall require local government initiatives to improve the
connectivity of peripheral areas with the city centre, expansion of civic services and provision of infrastructure
linkages to reduce the load on city centre areas. There are however several challenges associated with making
urban land available for large scale affordable housing development. These include:

                            Barriers Constraining the Low and Middle Income Housing Finance Market in Bangladesh 2016




    (i)	     Land administration and titling procedures (including title deficiencies)
    (ii)	    Registration procedure and registration costs
    (iii)	   Inordinate delay / non-transparent process in granting building permits
    (iv)	    Occupation of large tracts of land by public entities
    (v)	     Added cost of filling in low elevation terrain
    (vi)	    Inadequate urban infrastructure and lack of public transport
    (vii)	   No public private partnership framework/policy for allocating land to developers

In recent years, the Government of Bangladesh has taken some steps to simplify the titling and registration of
property by initiating computerization of land records management, but these efforts need to be accelerated.
If real estate were to be declared as a productive sector, it could lead to prospects for separate prudential
regulations for real estate lending thereby opening up avenues for institutional financing. Further, the
government should actively consider adopting a model legislation for real estate development and setting
up a distinct real estate regulatory authority. These confidence building measures could help in protecting
consumer interest and revive the market for genuine buyers.

Absence of clearly articulated urban sector policies, weaknesses in institutional capacities and lack of
comprehensive development planning and implementation / execution are the key challenges to planned
urbanisation. In the absence of proper institutional and legal framework to guide and control physical
development in urban areas, urban development in most cities has been haphazard. The involvement of
multiple organizations in the urban development process results in uncoordinated and overlapping
activities. For e.g., within Dhaka mega city, housing development projects are being undertaken by the
Dhaka City Corporations (DCCs), the Capital City Development Authority (Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha
or RAJUK), the National Housing Authority (NHA) and other public sector entities that provide staff housing
quarters for their employees. Similar situations exist among all the city corporations and development
authorities for metropolitan cities. It is to be noted that RAJUK, NHA and other development authorities have
varying rules for allocation of their flats/ houses and they even maintain credit portfolios on their own books
in respect of long term housing credit granted to the allottees / buyers; for which they do not have adequate
internal systems and controls, loan accounting software and trained staff.

The prevailing legal environment is also not quite conducive to the needs of the housing finance sector. The
biggest concern is with the laws and procedures relating to foreclosure and the lack of a fast track mechanism
to enforce security interest. Bangladesh has special courts called “Artha Rin Adalat” which are dedicated to
matters relating to financing and security arrangements, however the process for invoking the security
interest for mortgage loans is still long and cumbersome, and therefore becomes favourable to the borrower.

A well-functioning mortgage market infrastructure should also ideally include a well performing and
deeply entrenched credit information bureau. In Bangladesh the credit information bureau (CIB) is housed
within Bangladesh Bank and it caters to only its bank and non-bank regulated entities. All Banks and NBFCs
are expected to carry out CIB check on their prospective housing clients as part of due-diligence. While
the participating lenders can access the central database to generate credit reports, they cannot upload
credit information of their clients through the online system, currently this remains a manual process. The
CIB currently does not capture data from specialised FIs and other financial intermediaries such as credit
cooperatives and microfinance institutions that are not under the direct regulatory purview of Bangladesh
Bank. Also, CIB does not have any provision for corporate and individual clients to directly access or request
for their own credit reports.

There have been some recent efforts in setting up a separate CIB for MFIs. This was first attempted with the
idea that the MF-CIB could be housed at PKSF. However, this could not materialise. Some donors are currently
working towards having the MF-CIB housed under the MRA and the Bangladesh Bank has been approached
to provide necessary technical assistance. MF-CIB would add great value to the housing microfinance lending
operations as it could help tackle issues relating to multiple lending and over-indebtedness. To get the
maximum benefit of such a bureau, there banks/NBFCs regulated by Bangladesh Bank need access to the
MF-CIB for their potential borrowers, and vice versa.

(A)	 Legal: The            Despite the creation of Money Loan Courts          The Ministry of Finance and the Law Ministry should consider undertaking a

                           Costs and procedures associated with property      Laws should be reviewed and reform measures undertaken (including

(B)	 Regulatory            There is a growing concern regarding the           Bangladesh Bank should consider setting up a task force with representation of

                           and NBFCs are meant for consumer lending           practices) should be taken up for review and suitably amended.

      CHAPTER 6
A FEW STRATEGIC INTERVENTIONS FOR
CONSIDERATION OF GOVERNMENT,
INTERNATIONAL DFIs AND DONOR INSTITUTIONS

6.1 Context for Evaluating Opportunities to Engage with Public and Private Sector Institutions
and Primary Lenders in the Short and Medium Term
As outlined in the previous chapters of this report, the mortgage market in Bangladesh is very small and
nascent and therefore it should not be seen merely from a “development lens” with a limited focus on low
and informal income households. Most of the urban working population including lower and middle income
salaried / self-employed households remain completely out-priced in the current real estate market and
are unfortunately destined to live most of their lives in a rented house. The government and multi-lateral
/ bi-lateral donor institutions and development finance institutions (collectively referred to as interested
stakeholders) need to channel their efforts in developing the mortgage market as a whole and address
various issues and challenges at the sector level, including the real estate supply side situation. The vision
should not be constrained with only segment level priorities at this stage. Listed below are some ideas in the
form of a roadmap for possible short and medium term interventions for creating an appropriate enabling
environment that would enhance the access to middle and low Income housing finance.

6.2 Roadmap for Improved Access to Housing Finance for Low and Middle Income Segments
in Bangladesh – Proposed Interventions
I.	 Setting up of an ‘apex housing finance institution’ – say, Bangladesh National Housing Bank (BNHB),
    with equity support from GOB and International DFIs
	The idea of promoting an apex housing bank like BNHB which is expected to build a robust, fast growing
   and inclusive mortgage market in Bangladesh could be developed on the lines of similar institutions in
   other countries, which have successfully impacted the housing and housing finance trajectories after they
   were created.
	GOB should consider constituting a high level task force to carry out an in-depth study of different national
   housing finance systems in a few emerging economies, which should ideally include countries following
   different approaches, such as:
      	The Housing Ministry leading the housing and housing finance initiatives (e.g., Ministry of Public
        Works and Housing in Indonesia)
      	Housing finance and housing microfinance initiatives led by the central bank / regulator (e.g.
        Central Bank of Nigeria, Central Bank of Kenya)
      	Government owned / promoted apex level housing finance institutions set up at a national level
        either as a bank / regulator / refinance agency, e.g.:

              	 National Housing Bank (NHB), India (established 1988, wholly owned subsidiary of India’s
                   central bank, the Reserve Bank of India)
              	 National Housing Finance Corporation (NHFC), South Africa, promoted in the year 1996 by
                   the Department of Housing as a state-owned DFI
              	 Japan Housing Finance Agency (JHFA), 100% owned by the government (previously Govt.
                   Housing Loan Co., restructured in 2007 as JHFA)



                                                                                                                   63
 Barriers Constraining the Low and Middle Income Housing Finance Market in Bangladesh 2016




The Indian example of NHB is perhaps among the more successful initiatives where the apex institution has played
a regulatory as well as promotional role in housing finance, alongside refinancing and facilitation of secondary
market operations with the issuance of mortgage backed securities (MBS). Interestingly, the above-mentioned
examples have generally followed a twin-pronged strategy to address both supply side and demand side issues
that limit access to affordable housing, including engaging in public private partnerships.

	BNHB could be possibly constituted as a subsidiary of Bangladesh Bank with deputation of some of its
   senior staff and equity investment from the GOB and international DFIs
	The proposed BNHB could have multiple roles, some of which are listed below:
      (a)	 Regulator for mortgage portfolios of all Banks, NBFCs and Specialised FIs
      (b)	 Regulator for all Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) – introduced as a new category of licensed NBFCs
           by BNHB with existing players e.g. DBH, NHFIL and HBFC being encouraged to transition into HFCs;
           some banks may consider setting up HFC subsidiaries and transferring their mortgage portfolios to
           the new vehicle
      (c)	 Operate as a mortgage refinance agency channelling all government funding and budgetary
           resources for housing; augmenting sources of long term debt capital
      (d)	 Develop secondary mortgage market by facilitating issue of MBS and covered bonds
      (e)	 Promotional role with a mandate to selectively consider equity investment in existing and new HFCs
           and provide concessional debt funding
      (f)	 Mobilise long term domestic resources and tap into household savings through issue of tax friendly
           bonds, deposit schemes, NCDs and other instruments
      (g)	 Facilitate necessary financial infrastructure including mortgage guarantee company, collateral
           registry, setting up of debt recovery tribunals and strengthening of CIB
      (h)	 Revive the depressed real estate market by propagating affordable housing and possibly extending
           project finance and regulating construction finance to developers
      (i)	 Provide thought leadership in housing and housing finance and help innovate new products e.g.
           reverse mortgage, Islamic housing finance, green mortgages etc.
      (j)	 Assist in policy formulation relating to affordable housing, real estate, rental housing, housing
           microfinance and low-income housing finance
      (k)	 Operate special subsidy schemes (preferably use of down-payment subsidy) for deserving segments
           e.g. informal income, rural and urban poor etc.

The setting up of BNHB can be regarded as a medium term strategy as the preparatory work and promotional
efforts to be undertaken could take up to 3-4 years. The first step could be the setting up of a task force
comprising various stakeholders and experts to evaluate different approaches and recommend the preferred
structure, followed by a steering committee comprising GOB, BB and Ministry officials to chart the way
forward.

II.	 Setting up a Liquidity Facility at Bangladesh Bank to refinance LMIHF loans (Urban)
	 As a short term measure, GOB should consider a liquidity facility at Bangladesh Bank with an initial size of
      about USD 200 million, with a maturity of 10 – 12 years. The facility could leverage available government
      funding with borrowings from International DFIs. In the first phase the facility should target lenders–
      banks and non-bank lenders, subject to their qualifying certain minimum eligibility criteria.
	 The facility should be available for financing housing loans to the target income segments with a thrust
      on lending in non-metropolitan cities and towns
	 The facility should have a component reserved for informal income borrowers
	 The liquidity facility should be accompanied with a comprehensive Technical Assistance (TA) component
      which can be funded by donor institutions:
              (a)	 TA to help build capacity of primary lenders to enter new markets and launch new products,
                   assessing informal incomes, risk management, responsible lending etc.

            (b)	 Capacity building at Bangladesh Bank – BRPD, DFIM, other concerned departments
            (c)	 TA to set up a national training academy and certification program for building talent pool
                 and skilled manpower in mortgage lending (sales/ credit/ technical etc.)
            (d)	 Initiate a dialogue / forum among participating lenders, Bangladesh Bank and other key
                 stakeholders for the setting up of an apex housing bank.

GOB / Ministry can consider initiating a consultative process for the design and structure of the liquidity
facility and TA component and invite International DFIs and donor institutions to participate.

III.	 Credit Line at Bangladesh Bank to finance informal sector borrowers and rural poor
	 A similar arrangement for public sector primary lenders (comprising state owned banks and HBFC) could
    be in the form of a credit line of about USD 100 million with Bangladesh Bank as a financial intermediary.
    The facility should include a TA component as well.
	The selection process to be eligible for the credit line should include banks’ due-diligence and qualifying
   criteria, and must lay emphasis on reforms to ensure their financial health
	The credit line should cover the financing of housing loans to the target income segments with a thrust
   on lending in smaller towns and rural areas
	The facility should have separate components for lending to informal income borrowers and a (Islamic)
   Sharia compliant housing finance product
	TA component for reforms needed in HBFC and capacity building of public sector banks
	TA for enabling environment – urgent need to address various issues / gaps in the policy framework
   including supply side constraints, registration of ownership and mortgage, legal environment and
   enforcement, lack of coherence in government interventions etc.

GOB / Ministry can initiate a consultation workshop with donors and international DFIs interested in funding
the credit line along with technical assistance. The TA component for capacity building of qualified banks /
HBFC could be undertaken first, following which the credit line facility could be operationalized.

IV.	 Market Study to determine potential for ‘Project Finance for Worker Housing’
Housing initiatives such as dormitories and rental accommodation for employees of MSMEs and garment
factory workers have proved to be woefully inadequate, which leaves bulk of the workers to make their own
arrangements, ultimately leading to proliferation of slums and squatter settlements. There is a significant
opportunity in providing safe and durable housing with basic services by private developers, provided
an acceptable financing and ownership arrangement is negotiated among employers, employees and
developers. The direct benefit would be in addressing the acute housing shortage for migrant workers and
ensuring worker loyalty with quality housing offered as a staff incentive.

This requires approaching banks and NBFCs for extending project finance to the employers and / or developers
as the case may be. There is scope to develop a Liquidity Facility for the wholesale lending institutions, which
may be willing to drive this initiative.
	 The GOB could as a first step initiate a study to understand the market aspects, potential demand from
    MSMEs and manufacturing industry and quantify the opportunity, and map suitable locations for pilots.
	Facility meant to refinance construction finance loans made by NBFCs and Banks to MSME owners /
   employers and developers for the purpose of building dormitories / residential quarters for their workers
   either on rental basis or on a “rent to own” basis
	Such funding should not be included as part of real estate exposure of NBFCs and Banks as developers
   shall likely be engaged only as contractors
	The study should evaluate and recommend a few business models (financing arrangements and ownership
   structure) and suggest ways to incentivise employers to create worker housing with appropriate social
   and environmental safeguards.

V.	 PKSF administered Credit Line to select MFIs for expanding Housing Microfinance
The World Bank funded the Low Income Community Housing Support Project (LICHSP) provides for a USD 16
million credit line to PKSF covering 10-12 non-metropolitan cities. Each location (pourushava) is mapped to
a single partner MFI, which has been carefully selected for launching housing microfinance (HMF) operations
by accessing funds under the credit line. In addition, the LICHSP has a USD 2 million Technical Assistance
component to build the necessary capacities at PKSF and participating MFIs.

This credit line, which will be operational during 2016-2021, is an excellent initiative to test the market for HMF
products. It attempts a community and neighbourhood approach with complementary infrastructure upgrades
and provision of tenure by the National Housing Authority (NHA). The TA is intended to build capacities of PKSF’s
partner MFIs to sustain the HMF product and operations beyond the World Bank assisted project.

Based on the experience gained under this credit line, and subject to well-performing HMF loan portfolios at
the time of mid-term review of LICHSP (in 2019), there is an opportunity to scale up this initiative or launch
an expanded intervention under a similar arrangement. The second round of funding for scaling up HMF
lending operations may come into play in FY21.
	 The new Credit Line should cover a wider market that may include non-LICHSP towns, semi-urban and
      rural areas and also consider selecting non-LICHSP MFIs subject to their qualification under the minimum
      eligibility criteria; the TA component should provide for: (a) capacity building of MFIs and (b) addressing
      enabling environment challenges
	 Evaluate the opportunity to offer improved and larger ticket Individual loan products for various housing
      needs based on the LICHSP credit line experience
	 Test new HMF products arising from the climate resilient housing business models (developed by IFC)
      with construction technical assistance towards climate proofing
	 Build capacity through a TA program that complements the LICHSP approach; the MFIs need help in
      upgrading their MIS and IT systems and reduce dependence on cash by adopting mobile banking and
      digital payment systems to lower operating costs
	 The TA component for enabling environment should cover the following:
   (a)	 Supporting the development of a high quality MF-CIB by working with MRA and BB
   (b)	 Institutionalising the NHA tenure arrangement for all towns and cities and resolving legal issues that
        restrict mortgage of rural properties
   (c)	 Acceptance of building codes / guidelines proposed under LICHSP.

VI.	‘Universal Sanitation Finance Facility’ administered through MFIs
Among various human development indicators, Bangladesh has done well in improving sanitation in urban
areas with over 76% of urban population using a sanitary toilet. GOB can now pursue the goal of universal
sanitation by encouraging construction of toilets among individual house-owners in urban as well as rural areas.

Small-ticket home upgradation / toilet construction loans of up to BDT 25,000 (USD 316) administered
through joint liability groups as an extension of housing microfinance through the vast network of MFIs
could help in achieving universal sanitation.
	The Universal Sanitation Finance Facility could be administered via PKSF by involving all partner MFIs
   (including Category C institutions) subject to minimum eligibility criteria
	The facility should be aligned with the WASH / WSP program of other donors e.g. Habitat for Humanity,
      International and Water.org
	Incorporate global best practices in product design and credit administration
	Preferably avoid individual lending as the transaction costs of MFIs would go up and this would be passed
      on to the end-borrowers
	Build appropriate technical supervision for construction quality checks for ensuring minimum standards
      (particularly regarding functionality of the toilets), environmental and social safeguards and client
      awareness and participation.
