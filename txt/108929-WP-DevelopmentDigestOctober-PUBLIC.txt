SELAMAT DATANG ! [WELCOME!]
The team at the World Bank Group Global Knowledge and Research Hub in Malaysia is honored to present the inaugural
issue of the Development Digest. This publication will feature some of the key work coming out from the Hub, gathered
from the various practice and research teams based in Kuala Lumpur every six months.

We commence this issue with a dedication to the memory of the late Datuk Dr. Sundaran Annamalai. Dr. Sundaran was
and remains a key figure, both in Malaysia and in the World Bank Group, having played a pivotal role in the setting up
of the Hub. We pay tribute to his life, his fruitful career and his profound contributions to Malaysia and the World Bank
Group.

The first part touches on the new and unique Hub in Malaysia–the first global center of the World Bank Group that unites
its operational practices with its global research and indicators groups. The remainder of the digest highlights emerging
new research on key topics of interest, both in Malaysia and globally.

This publication adds a comprehensive editorial dimension to the rich work of the World Bank Group Global Knowledge
and Research Hub in Malaysia. This diverse body of work ranges from matters related to unlocking new dimensions of
economic growth, to new generations of trade agreements, to the impacts of sectoral transformation and the importance
of human capital development.

Looking forward, the Malaysia Hub will continue to scale up its work, with its diverse team of experts and leveraging new
local and international partners, including academic institutions and think tanks.

We hope that this publication will serve as a bridge to connect minds and ideas, promote knowledge sharing and build a
network of discourse on key areas of economic development.

A GLOBAL HUB FOR
DEVELOPMENT SOLUTIONS
The World Bank Group Global Knowledge and Research
Hub in Malaysia is the first office of its kind for the World
Bank. It is a Knowledge and Research Hub that serves
as a global platform to share Malaysia’s development
experience by leveraging local and international expertise
and a network of partners.

The Hub in Malaysia was officially opened on March 28,
2016 and marked a new beginning in the relationship
between the organization and the host country.

Necessary Reforms

These trade agreements can facilitate reforms to support
Malaysia’s transition to become a high income nation.
Achieving high income status will involve advances in
overcoming key constraints, such as the following:

Services: In terms of services contribution to GDP
and exports, Malaysia still trails many EAP countries.
An efficient services market is essential in enhancing the
country’s competitiveness by supporting other export
sectors.

Investment: Improved investment policies can further
support Malaysia’s business environment and help to attract
a new wave of FDI that supports the country’s economic
diversification. Furthermore, as Malaysia becomes
more integrated with the global economy, the new trade
agreements do provide additional investment safeguards
for domestic firms investing abroad. For example, the
Investor State Dispute Resolution mechanism.

Competition: A more open and level playing field in the
domestic economy facilitates the entry of new firms, and
a reallocation of resources to more productive companies.
Competition provides strong incentives to innovate, raise
productivity and create jobs- issues at the core of the 11th        Increasing liberalization, competitiveness and

What does the empirical evidence suggest?

Much analytical effort has been focused on deliberating
on why so few middle-income countries have transitioned
into high-income status and what the proper policy
approaches are. However, analyses vary considerably and
in many cases point to opposite conclusions.

Some support the existence of a middle-income trap by
finding empirical evidence that growth slowdowns are
more likely at middle-income levels.

Others question the existence of a trap altogether. Close
examination of countries’ transitions between income
levels shows that per capita incomes have grown steadily
in majority of countries in the past six decades. This does
not suggest a trap-like pattern and casts doubt on the
notion that high growth was a temporary phenomenon of
any particular era.

The “trap” literature is further complicated by lack of any
consensus on methodology or definition. Similarly, there
is no consensus on what length of time would constitute
a trap.

Some studies seek to address these issues with enhanced             income status is rare, difficult, and requires different

Conclusion

The middle-income trap is a narrative of growth stagnation
that reflects (and exacerbates) current and long-standing
anxieties about slow growth. This anxiety is perhaps only
growing more acute amid the prevailing notion of a global
growth slowdown.

Education

A strong education system can elevate the human capacity
and capability to participate in valuable economic
activities.

The comparison of indicators of education systems shows
that Singapore scores the highest in all relevant factors
including school enrollment, quality of primary education,
adaptability of higher education to economic needs, and
company investment in staff training and development.
This is followed by Malaysia, Chile, Vietnam, Mexico, and
Peru.

In terms of equity in access to educational opportunities,
a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) indicates that equity in the
allocation of resources between socioeconomically
advantaged and disadvantaged schools is the highest in              stable in Chile; reduction in Singapore, particularly since

The rapid increase in agricultural productivity resulting
from the Green Revolution came from an impressive
increase in yields. Global total factor productivity for
agriculture nearly doubled from the 1970–89 period (0.87
percent) to 1.56 percent for the 1990–2006 period. The
decrease in time to maturity allowed for an increase in
cropping intensity.

This inadvertently led to a change in agriculture
production composition. Access to technology influences
choices in crop allocation. Modern production depends
on purchased inputs; thus effective input supply systems
are essential. On the ground, farmers supported the
shift from traditional to modern and market-oriented
agriculture, responding positively to the promotion of
extension services offering new and available technology.

Public goods

farmers, enabling them to integrate in regional and global
markets.

This stated relationship is far from uniform – it varies
sharply between industry sectors (garments and textiles

That is, the positive relationship between women’s

industries vs. the rest of manufacturing, among the
relatively larger firms, and among the relatively younger
firms.

necessary because this variation can itself be a valuable
source of intra-project learning; discerning where and
for whom a particular intervention is working (or not)
can be a basis on which mid-course corrections are made
(e.g., with regard to resource allocation and personnel
deployment). Moreover, a second defining feature of
complex interventions is that it is virtually impossible
to specify or anticipate exactly the precise problems and
solutions that are likely to emerge during implementation;
as such, having high quality monitoring systems in place
can help to identify problems before they get too severe,
and locate specific examples of where and how such
problems have been solved.

Explaining variation is difficult, however, because it is likely
to remain even after controlling for observable factors.
Household survey instruments are crucial for mapping the
nature and extent of variation, and for enabling observable
factors to be incorporated into explanations of it. But a
third defining feature of complex interventions is that
they are highly susceptible to the influence of statistically
‘unobservable’ factors, such as those stemming from
