I. Why Financial Inclusion as a Development Objective?
The relevance of implementing a nation-wide program to promote financial inclusion has become
indisputable. Numerous impact studies have shown the benefits of financial inclusion and helped to
better understand its limits. Public authorities are paying more attention to the risks linked with
financial exclusion and its negative impact on economic, social and political stability. In effect, the
G20 has recognized financial inclusion as one of the global development pillars, the World Bank has
established an objective of universal access to financial services by 2020, and the General Secretary
of the United Nations appointed Queen Máxima of the Netherlands as its Special Advocate for
financial inclusion. Since 2011, more than 60 countries have initiated reforms to improve financial
inclusion.

Financial inclusion has several positive effects on an economy. First of all, it improves the
effectiveness of financial intermediation by increasing the number of actors in the financial system,
together with the volume and value of transactions. At the macroeconomic level, a developed
financial system, measured by its level of financial intermediation, has a positive correlation with
growth, employment, poverty and, through this, a reduction in inequality.5 Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) growth is also positively correlated with access to credit and the opening of bank branches. As
a result, countries with advanced levels of financial development have seen the proportion of those
living in poverty decrease more rapidly and their Gini6 coefficient improve (see Figure 1).

In addition, partly due to risk diversification (e.g. wide and varied deposit base, portfolio of small and
lowly volatile loans), financial inclusion contributes directly to financial stability.7 It also positively
impacts stability as it leads to the formalization of businesses, which in turn improves the
effectiveness of monetary policy and reduces the use of informal or unregulated financial services,
themselves a source of instability (e.g. through fraud and over-indebtedness). In addition, financial
inclusion promotes the rise of new economic models, which pushes the entire financial system to
professionalize. Financial stability is of particular concern to central banks, particularly since the 2008
financial crisis.

5 There is a two-way causal relationship between the financial system development and economic growth. According to
economic theory, financial system development impact growth through increased capital accumulation and improved
productivity, two key elements of GDP growth. In addition, access to savings promotes investment. The resulting economic
growth stimulates employment and reduces poverty. See Where is the Cheese? Synthesizing a Giant Literature on the
Causes and Consequences of Financial Sector Development, Pasali, World Bank, 2013.

ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 100 (perfect inequality).

At the microeconomic level, access to financial services has a positive effect on employment and on
household consumption, and stimulates the local economy. In Morocco, access to credit led to a
52% increase in the number of days worked outside of the household and a 10% increase in the in-
kind savings and consumption levels.8 Access to savings allows people with low, and frequently
irregular, incomes to better manage emergencies and spikes in spending, and therefore maintain a
more stable level of consumption over time. Additionally, access to finance is an essential growth
driver for very small, small, and medium-sized enterprises (VSSMEs), which is of particular
importance since the most dynamic small and medium-sized businesses have been demonstrated to
create the largest number of jobs in an economy.

Finally, financial inclusion allows for a cost-effective implementation of social policies, such as
government-to-person payments. In Brazil, the administration costs of the Bolsa Família (family
allowances) program have fallen by more than 80% following the introduction of prepaid cards and
the payment of several allowances at once.9

In sum, the empirical evidence shows that financial inclusion, even if it does not eradicate poverty
on its own, helps to achieve the goal of social and economic inclusion, in conjunction with other
public policies. At household level, this is achieved by expanding income-generating opportunities
and by improving risk management. For businesses and the wider economy, it is through more
efficient capital mobilization for investment and growth (see Table 2). This is especially important in a
country like Tunisia, which has an unemployment rate above 15% (42% among young people)10 and a
large number of informal businesses.

Capturing the benefits of financial inclusion is in line with the Coordinated Vision for the
Development of Microfinance, published by the Tunisian Finance Ministry in 2011 and aimed at
developing a “socially responsible and durable microfinance sector that, by promoting access for as
many people as possible to quality financial services, would contribute to the fight against financial
exclusion, to harmonious regional development, and to the strengthening of the national economic
structure.”

Since November 2013, the Finance Ministry and the microfinance supervisory authority (ACM or
Autorité de Contrôle de la Microfinance)11 have been members of the Alliance for Financial
Inclusion (AFI), 12 an international network of policy-makers, central banks, supervisory and

12 Created in 2008, the AFI works to advance financial inclusion through knowledge exchange. Since the Maya declaration of

2011, under which its members recognized the importance of financial inclusion and committed to achieving concrete
results, AFI has 47 institutional commitments across the world, of which 27 are quantitative.

II. The Demand for Financial Services13
Today, there is significant demand for financial services in                                81% of Tunisians
Tunisia stemming from both private individuals (2.5 to 3.5 million)                    interested in microsavings
and businesses (245,000 to 425,000 micro and very small
enterprises). These figures are approximate.                                         Tunisians seek access to a product
                                                                                    that would allow them to put aside

resources, low-income populations have very active financial
lives: they save, borrow, manage different cash in-flows and outflows and lend money—often all at
the same time. They fall back on social solidarity mechanisms in case of problems. The financial
services they use, however, are not always reliable and could be insufficient, risky and/or expensive
(e.g. family, friends, money-lenders, in-kind or under the mattress savings). This underscores the
importance of developing formal financial services that respond to their needs.

In Tunisia, although the supply of inclusive financial services is more advanced than in other
countries in the region—not least thanks to the postal network—it remains far from comprehensive.
The World Bank/CAWTAR study identified a level of financial inclusion of just 36% of the adult
population (see Box 1 below). Recent efforts by the government and private sector have focused on
                                                              DRAFT




certain microcredit products (see section III), and have not responded to the demand for savings
services,14 insurance, and payment services. Various studies have highlighted a demand falling
between 950,000 and 1.4 million individuals for microcredit, but an even larger demand of 2.5 to
3.5 million individuals for a wider range of microfinance services, equivalent to 30% to 40% of the
adult population (see Table 3).15

Similarly, many enterprises have financing needs that are far from being met by existing supply. It is
estimated that 245,000 to 425,000 micro and very small enterprises require a specific range of
financial services, equivalent to 37% to 65% of those registered in the national business registry
(RNE). 16 The 2014 IFC study estimated that approximately 15,000 small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) should be added to this figure17. It found that only 15% of very small, small, or
medium-sized enterprises (VSSMEs) have taken out bank loans whereas 58% have expressed the
need for financing in order to make investments or for working capital. This gap is significant enough
to indicate a lack of supply, even if not all of this demand was credit-worthy. It may be explained by a

13 This section is based on different studies carried out on microcredit demand and financial services in Tunisia. These
include: IBM Belgium 2009; Finance Ministry, 2011; Mercy Corps, 2012; Coopération Luxembourgeoise-ADA-EIB, 2013 and
2014; IFC 2014; World Bank/CAWTAR 2015.
14 The demand for savings services is generally higher than for credit. At the global level, including the Arab world,

specialized microfinance institutions serve between 4 and 10 times more savers than borrowers.
15 For a comparison, the number of adults living on less than 4 TND per day (or 1,500 TND per year) is estimated at around

2.7 million adults (Source: Study on Financial Inclusion in Tunisia, MicroMED, February 2014).
16
   Formal enterprises are those that have a tax identification number and are registered with the RNE. There were 654,000
formal enterprises in 2013. By conservative estimates, 245,000 is the number of enterprises that reported their sales.
Informal enterprises are included in the demand for individual persons since lending to an informal enterprise, in practice,
means lending to an individual.
17
   The frontier between micro, very small, small, and medium-sized enterprises remains vague given the lack of a national
definition.

However, quantifying this demand was based on secondary sources and gives rise to the possibility of
significant margins of error, since the data is 5 or even 10 years old. Tunisia currently lacks the data
required to properly understand the market demand for financial services and hence create
appropriate financial inclusion policies and conducive legislative frameworks. Market players,
including financial service providers, also lack this data, which could be used to refine their growth
strategies and avoid focusing on narrow market segments.

Detailed studies analyzing financial behavior and use of financial services have never been carried
                                                                    DRAFT




out in Tunisia. This prevents a solid understanding of the varied financial needs of key market
segments, including employees, temporary workers, unemployed people, students, farmers, micro-
entrepreneurs, and registered businesses. For example, it is not known why, according to Findex
2014 data, less than 10% of adults save in a formal account while more than 27% indicate having
access to a formal financial account (bank or postal account). Qualitative studies suggest that
Tunisians do not plan their expenses and can quickly find themselves in financial difficulty in cases of
unexpected events or illness. This suggests the need for savings and insurance services, as well as the
necessity to encourage a better savings culture over the long term.

Islamic financial services appear to be a niche market in Tunisia. According to a study by the
European Union,19 only 1.4% of the people interviewed had voluntarily excluded themselves from
microcredit for religious reasons. Findex indicators corroborate this point, with only 5% of people
interviewed stating they do not have an account for religious reasons.

In terms of geographic distribution, the target population is divided into two regions: the interior
region for low-income households, and the coastal region—where the majority of economic
activity is concentrated—for enterprises. The distribution of the financial services market broadly
follows this geographic division, with banks mainly concentrated in coastal areas, while the post
office and microcredit associations, though spread throughout the country, particularly well-
developed in the interior.

                               Box 1. Access to and Use of Financial Services in Tunisia

In 2015 the World Bank and the Center of Arab Women for Training and Research (CAWTAR) launched a
market study on digital finance in Tunisia. This study was based on a survey of 1,200 Tunisians over 15-year
old in 17 governorates across the country, and allowed data to be gathered on the use of traditional non-
mobile financial services as well. It concluded that 64% of the Tunisian population over the age of 15 either
does not have access or has very limited access to formal financial services (segments 1 and 2 below).
The rate of financial inclusion thus stands at 36%.


                                    64% excluded or under-served                                    36% included

Snapshot of Financial Inclusion in Tunisia – September 2015



                                        Box 2. Financial Inclusion of SMEs

Financial inclusion efforts are often targeted to low-income households and micro-enterprises—the focus of
this document—however also concerns very small, small, and medium-size enterprises (VSSMEs). This second
segment was the subject of a market study led by the IFC in 2014, which comprised a survey of approximately
1,400 VSSMEs and interviews with 17 financial institutions. The primary conclusions of this study are
summarized below.

The IFC study focused on formal enterprises having between 1 to 199 employees, or nearly 80,000 enterprises
in Tunisia, of which 15,000 are SMEs. Half of the commercial banks and nearly all leasing firms view these
VSSMEs as a priority segment. 71% of these VSSMEs are considered financially included and 80% of those that
applied for banking financing were successful in receiving it.

However, access to finance for VSSMEs is far from simple: 29% of the VSSMEs examined had never attempted
to open a bank account; 37% reported needing financing although never entering into contact with a financial
institution; 78% used cash to pay their supplier and 91% to pay their employees. The gap between supply and
demand is explained by a combination of shortcomings and inadequacies at the level of VSSMEs (often
incomplete financial information), financial institutions (products and systems not entirely suitable to serve
this segment), and infrastructure (limited effectiveness of guarantee funds and public banks; underutilized
credit registry data; training and supervision of VSSMES not sufficiently effective).

The study recommends several improvement areas for both financial institutions and authorities, and stresses
on three key principles: the need for a more organized national coordination, the development of the entire
range of financial services beyond credit (insurance, payment methods—salaries, suppliers, cash management
tools—debt collection, financial education, etc.), and recognition of the segment’ diversity (by sector but also
by profitability profile for the financial institution—four strategic segments are identified in the study).

III. The Legislative and Regulatory Framework
Financial inclusion in Tunisia is regulated by a series of specific laws governing each type of actor.

    Banks are regulated by law no. 2001-65, dated July 10, 2001 relating to credit establishments,
     which recognizes leasing and factoring as credit operations.20 It was amended and completed by
     law no. 2006-19 of May 2, 2006. Banks have the exclusive right on payment operations. Banking
     law is currently under review.

    Leasing companies are regulated by law no. 94-89, dated July 26, 1994.

    The National Post Office (“the Post Office” or “Post”) is a public industrial and commercial
     enterprise, created by decree no. 98-1305, dated June 15, 1998, which established its
     administrative and financial organization and operational model. This decree conferred it with,
     among others, the responsibility for managing postal savings and current accounts, which are
     regulated by law no. 90-97, dated November 1, 1990. The Post is the only non-bank institution
     authorized to collect savings, and to provide means of payment.21 It is not, however, authorized
     to grant credit.


20 Banks must adhere to the Code of Obligations and Contracts (COC). In the absence of a specific legislation, this text also
applies to Islamic financial products. Offshore banks are subject to law no. 2009-64 dated August 12, 2009 (financial
services for non-residents).
21 Postal current accounts have existed since 1918. The national savings bank was created in 1956.

Snapshot of Financial Inclusion in Tunisia – September 2015



    Microfinance institutions (MFIs) are regulated by decree-law no. 2011-117, dated November 5,
     2011, amended by law no. 46 of July 24, 2014,22 and by five consecutive orders issued between
     2012 and 2014 (box 3 below provides a timeline and implementation details pertaining to the
     regulatory framework for microfinance). In this document, “MFI” refers to associations and
     companies authorized in the context of the decree, together with associations created earlier
     and currently operating in the context of the compliance period.

    Insurance companies are regulated by the Insurance Code created by law no. 92-24, dated
     March 9, 1992.

At present, legislation places limits on the outsourcing of banking operations. Only some operations,
such as gathering customer data or currency exchange, can be outsourced under certain conditions
and with the prior agreement of the Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT). The CBT circular dated January,
2011 sets out a framework for the development of mobile financial services, permitting SIM cards to
be linked to a bank account or to a prepaid card (see part on digital finance under Section IV).

Supervision
Table 4 below presents an overview of how Tunisian financial institutions are supervised. In line with
the 2011 Concerted Vision, the ACM now supervises the microfinance sector. This is an interim
arrangement prior to a secondary stage where monitoring would be transferred, at least in part, to
the CBT. The ACM’s general management has been in place since November 2012 and employs a
team of 9. Its board of directors is made up of 8 members who meet regularly.23

Laws no. 2003-75 of December 10, 2003 and no. 2009-65 of August 12, 2009, as well as the order of
January 24, 2014, govern anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism
(CFT) efforts, and apply to all financial institutions, including MFIs.

Consumer protection
Tunisia has a general framework for consumer rights and a Consumer Protection Association but no
specific law or organization related to financial services. For credit institutions, since 2006, the law
provides for a mediation service to resolve disputes between banks and their clients. This service is
free for the client, and the Banking Services Observatory (BSO), created by law no. 2006-26 of
May 15, 2006 to ensure the quality of banking services, issues an annual report on the subject.
Decree no. 2000-462 of February 21, 2000 established the methods of calculating the Annual
Percentage Rate (APR) and the average interest rate, as well as their method of publication, while the
BSO carries out publically-available studies of banking charges. For MFIs, article 8 of law no. 99-67
makes it compulsory to publish lending conditions in the branches. Publishing the APR is not

22 Associations are also regulated by decree-law no. 2011-88 of September 24, 2011. The decree-law no. 2011-118 dated

mandatory, however this may change in light of the forthcoming order on fair treatment of clients.
Articles 34 and 36 of decree-law no. 2011-117 detail the relationship between MFIs and their clients
in terms of information about products, avoiding over-indebtedness, and handling client complaints.
A code of ethics is being written, in parallel with the creation of a professional association for MFIs.


               Box 3. History and Legislative Context Related to Microfinance Institutions
 1995: Enda, an association operational since 1990, first introduces microcredit in Tunisia. The legislation of
 the time did not provide a legal structure suited for non-bank financial institutions.

 1997: The Tunisian Solidarity Bank (BTS) is created.

 1999: The first law on microcredit, law no. 99-67 dated July 15, created the status of Microcredit Association
 (AMC), and established the BTS as the national refinancing organization (at 0% interest provided 80% of the
 amount is repaid) and the National Guarantee Fund (NGF) as a risk-protection mechanism (covering 90% of
 bad debt from AMC and BTS clients). The order of August 27 defines the maximum microcredit amount
 (1,000 TND, which will progressively increase to reach 5,000 TND in 2009) and places a cap on interest rates
 (5% on a declining balance, to which commissions capped at 2.5% will later be added).

 2005: Enda obtains special authorization from the Ministry of Finance to charge a rate that covers its costs,
 which de facto exempts it from the interest rate cap.

 2010: An order dated September 29 frees the portion of the microcredit portfolio not refinanced by the BTS
 from the interest rate cap.

 2011-2013: Decree-law no. 2011-117 of 2011 and the subsequent orders lay the foundation for a sound
 development of the sector by: authorizing the emergence of new actors and the restructuring of existing
 ones under the status of either associations or limited liabilities companies (LLCs); defining working
 standards; creating the Microfinance Supervisory Authority (ACM), which provides advice on licensing and
 oversees the sector; and authorizing MFIs to act as agents for insurance companies. This legal framework
                                                              DRAFT




 also established the maximum loan amount (5,000 TND for associations and 20,000 TND for LLCs) and
 confirmed an interest rate cap for loans refinanced through budgetary resources. Decree-law no. 2011-117
 gives associations a one-year deadline to comply with these new measures. In November 2012, the vast
 majority of AMCs were not yet in compliance and find themselves outside of the legal framework. This leads
 the BTS to suspend its financing, causing a considerable contraction of the microcredit market. The AMCs
 subsequently jointly defend their cause at the National Constituent Assembly, in addition to organizing
 protests in May 2013.

 2014: Law no. 2014-46, issued in July, lowered the minimum capital required for AMCs (from 200,000 to
 50,000 TND), but not the minimum capital requirement for LLCs (3 M TND). For loans refinanced outside of
 budgetary resources, the law introduces a cap on interest rates, which remains to be defined by ministerial
 order. This cap could follow the method used in calculating the banking cap and be based on the average of
 the microcredit market, excluding loans refinanced through budgetary resources. Differentiation by product
 or customer segment is also being studied. The law postponed the deadline for compliance to December
 2016, potentially extendable by decree, which means ACMs will have had in total over 5 years to reorganize
 themselves. 24 An order dated November 17, 2014 established the external audit modalities for MFI
 accounts.

 It is expected that the microfinance regulatory framework will be completed by forthcoming legislation
 covering accounting norms, loan loss provisioning policies, authorized micro-insurance products,
 governance, financial transparency, audit committees, contractual conditions between MFIs and their
 clients, and contributions to the ACM.




24By following well-documented and often publically available international good practices, it is currently possible to set up
a microcredit institution and make it sustainable within 5 years. This supposes that the institution can cover its costs
(operations, risk, financing) with its income (interest, commissions).

IV. The Current Supply of Financial Services
The Tunisian financial sector is dominated by banks, with         Tunisians frequently make use of
assets equal to approximately 100% of GDP.25 This figure               informal financial services
is somewhat lower than in other countries of the region
such as Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Morocco. More than  16% of adults have borrowed from family

accounting for only 0.2% of overall financial sector assets.    Source: Findex 2014.
Despite the size of the untapped market, for the majority
of services, it is clear that supply is not adapted to existing demand, as suggested by the frequent
use of informal financial services, both for savings and for credit.

                                                                       DRAFT




                                              informal enterprises)

Note: The total market is estimated as follows: 1) Savings: total = adult population or 8.4 million individuals; 2) Credit to individuals =
estimate of 950,000 for microcredit only (2014 study); 3) Credit to formal enterprises = all businesses in the national registry RNE (654,200
in 2013). Further studies are required to better quantify the numbers and relevant amounts, especially for credit.


Banks
The Tunisian banking market comprises 21 commercial banks and has seen an 8% growth since 2010,
reaching 1,449 branches and 1,857 ATMs as of December 31, 2013. Even if these figures put Tunisia
ahead of its peers in the Arab world in terms of coverage per inhabitant, the geographic distribution
of these branches remains uneven. There is a heavy concentration in larger cities and the most
productive regions (North-East and Center-East; the Greater Tunis area and the coastal region
comprise the majority of bank branches). Banks have not developed a range of services adapted to
low-income populations, micro-entrepreneurs, or small businesses. For example, fees for holding an
account can be in excess of 80 TND/year, and significant guarantees are required for credit.

The number of fixed-term deposits (FTD) in banks saw an increase of 18% between 2010 and
September 2013. In the absence of a market study, it is difficult to know if this represents a cultural
change in attitudes towards savings or demonstrates a greater propensity to save during periods of
economic slowdown, or if it is simply a reaction to a temporary improvement in the conditions
offered by banks seeking liquidity.

Snapshot of Financial Inclusion in Tunisia – September 2015



Banks have low portfolio quality (around 15% of loans in arrears) and lend primarily to:

      Individuals, particularly salaried workers who can legally borrow up to 40% of their income (1.3
       million borrowers for 16 billion TND outstanding in 2013 according to the CBT, with an increase
       of 17% per year since 2010 but a stable average loan size of around 13,000 TND per borrower
       and a borrowing period of 3 years; 85% of the outstanding loans are used for housing and/or
       home improvement).
      Formal businesses (338,000 financed businesses in 2013, i.e. around 50% of formal Tunisian
       businesses, with an outstanding total of 41 billion TND) and in particular medium-sized and large
       businesses (less than 1,500 businesses account for nearly 70% of total outstanding loans to
       companies; 50% of the outstanding amount is for large groups).

The majority of financial institutions consider the VSSME market risky and opaque, but inevitable
given its importance in the Tunisian economy. VSSMEs already represent a significant part of leasing
companies’ portfolios. However, apart from the two banks specialized in VSSME financing (see Box
4), no Tunisian financial institution has a strategy dedicated to this market (IFC, 2014).

                                                 Box 4. Specialized Banks

Tunisia Solidarity Bank (BTS)
Besides refinancing AMCs, the BTS directly provides credit for enterprise creation or expansion, with
amounts going up to 150,000 TND for university graduates (average loan size of 10,000 TNS and
arrears above 30% in 2014). Its direct outreach has been increasing over the past few years (112 000
active clients and 620 M TND of outstanding portfolio in 2014 according to the BTS, as compared to
~47,000 and 422 M TND in 2010 according to the Concerted Vision).
                                                                DRAFT




Investment Bank for Small and Medium Enterprises (BFPME)
Created in 2005, the BFPME is focused on financing existing and new SMEs, by granting credit under
favorable conditions (100,000 to 5 million TND, over 2 to 12 years, with a 7% rate and a public
guarantee). In 2013, it adopted a co-financing rule with other local banks. Its impact remains very
limited (2,000 projects financed between 2005 and 2012) and the quality of its portfolio is very weak
(over 30% of loans in arrears).

National Agricultural Bank (NAB)
The NAB is a State bank created in 1959 to respond to agricultural financing needs, and now one of
the most important universal banks in Tunisia. It finances around 20% of the food and agriculture
industry, but does not reach all farmers, notably due to its bureaucratic procedures. In addition, the
majority of the 110,000 smallholders to whom it has granted credit are in arrears. As a result, the
bank no longer serves this sector and focuses on providing loans over 4,000 TND.26

Islamic Banks
The Tunisian financial system currently includes two universal banks offering products compliant
with the principles of Islamic finance. Al Baraka was created in 1985 (12 branches, subsidiary of the
Bahraini banking group) and Zitouna in 2009 (~50 branches). The Tunisian State is a minority
shareholder in the former and a majority shareholder in the latter. Little information is available on
the number and profile of their clients.

The Tunisian Post Office
With 1,051 branches (offices and mobile branches) in 2014, the postal network is almost as extensive
as that of the entire banking sector, but far more evenly spread across Tunisia. This network makes
it a key player when it comes to financial inclusion. The Tunisian Post offers a wide range of
financial services (deposits, transfers, insurance, payment means) with the exception of credit. Its
fees and rates are deemed reasonable for the low-income population and it offers favorable
conditions, particularly for current and savings accounts where the average balance is under
1,000 TND (e.g. no account fees, free operations, availability of savings, flexibility of payments and
withdrawals). This helps explain the Post’s 45% market share in terms of accounts number. As with
the banks, the total number of postal accounts and their amount have grown steadily in recent years.

However, with only 178 ATMs, a quarter of its branches not connected to a central server, relatively
limited opening hours, and minimum payment amounts, the Post does not yet offer easy-to-use
micro-savings solutions (regular withdrawals and deposits of very small amounts) or payment means.
Over 50% of postal accounts are inactive (no movement for 2 years).

Microfinance Institutions (MFIs)
The regulatory framework authorizes MFIs to offer microcredit services to finance income-
generating activities and improvements to living conditions (see Table 7 for loan conditions),
together with training or support services. MFIs can also enter into micro-insurance contracts in the
name and on behalf of insurance companies. The sale of micro-insurance products is however
subject to a framework agreement between the professional insurance and microfinance
associations.27


27Since the professional association for MFIs has not yet been officially constituted, MFIs cannot yet offer micro-insurance
products. In the event of death or invalidity, Enda offers its clients a premium that covers the remainder of the loan, as well
as a 500 TND compensation for the families.

    First created in 1999, AMCs cover the entire country, and particularly inner regions, but they
     remain very modest in size (850 clients on average in 2010) as compared to MFIs within the
     region and globally (2013 median of over 21,000 clients for MFIs in the Arab world, and 13,500 in
     the world).28 As of 2011, 289 AMCs were registered in Tunisia, the majority created between
     2004 and 2007.29 Their 3-month Non-Performing Loans (NPL) was estimated at 27% in December
     2010, according to the Concerted Vision. However, despite strong support from the State and
     local authorities, 30 AMCs were restricted by a stringent interest rate cap. 31 No longer in
     compliance with the new legal framework at the beginning of 2013, AMCs lost their access to BTS
     financing and had to limit or cease their lending operations. Their number of active borrowers is
     estimated to have fallen from 237,000 in 2010 to around 150,000. This situation remained until
     August 2014, when the deadline to achieve compliance was extended. Since then, around 147
     AMCs have renewed their activities and the Ministry of Employment has allocated one million
     TND to support their restructuring. The Kairouan Association for Integrated Development (AKDI)
     has received its certificate of compliance with decree-law no. 2011-117, and the Association to
     Support Self-Development (ASAD) received the authorization to transfer its microfinance
     activities to a subsidiary. The AMCs in the Bizerte and Siliana regions have taken steps to merge
     in their respective governorates.

    With 78 branches and in operation since 1995, Enda covers practically all regions in Tunisia, even
                                                              DRAFT




     if its network is less dense than that of all AMCs taken together. Thanks to the special
     authorization that has allowed it to cover its operating costs with higher interest rates (yet still in
     line with the international average), and thanks also to its strong organization and good
     management practices, Enda has witnessed faster growth (on average twice that of AMCs) and
     better repayment rates (less than 2% in arrears). Enda has now reached a size making it a crucial
     player in the microcredit market (246,788 borrowers and over 240 million TND of assets as of
     December 2014). Its market share has increased from 30% to near 50% in the wake of the
     reduction in AMCs’ services. Enda has already obtained a certificate of compliance with decree-
     law no. 2011-117 and has begun the necessary steps to transfer its microfinance activities to a
     subsidiary company.

    In the framework of decree-law no. 2011-117, authorizations have been granted to newly-
     created companies, Taysir, Microcred Tunisia, Advans Tunisia, and CFE (Entrepreneur Financial
     Center). Taysir and Microcred disbursed their first loans in June and November 2014,
     respectively. Taysir’s majority shareholders are Tunisians and it counts the French NGO Adie
     International as a shareholder and operator. It has taken the decision not rely on cashiers in its
     branches and to make all disbursements and reimbursements in partnership with the Tunisian
     Post, using prepaid e-Dinar cards and the MobiFlouss service offered jointly with the mobile

29 However, eight of these were never involved in microcredit activity.
30 Notably: activity-related subsidies provided by the State through the BTS, equivalent to 3% of the interest rate paid by

the client according to the Concerted Vision; several employees supported by the State through apprenticeship programs;
and the provision of equipment and premises through local authorities.
31 Annual rate of 5% on a declining balance and 2.5% of commissions, equivalent to an APR below 10% for loans with a

12-month term. For a comparison, according to the 2013 MixMarket figures, the average MFI portfolio yield, which reflects
the APR, was over 30% in the region, and over 26% globally for MFIs able to cover their operating costs.

     Microcred Tunisia. Advans Group holds a majority stake in Advans Tunisia, which disbursed its
     first loans in March 2015. CFE, created by Desjardins International Development (DID) and
     Tuninvest, disbursed its first loans in July 2015.

Other financial operators
Financial service providers in Tunisia also include 10 leasing companies, 3 factoring companies, and
several dozen venture capital firms. National funds also grant social loans of up to 15,000 TND for
those they insure (the National Social Security Fund—CNSS, and the National Pension and Social
Security Fund—CNRPS).33 Meanwhile, many micro-entrepreneurs and VSEs have recourse to credit
from suppliers, and public companies that distribute water, electricity and gas (SONEDE and STEG)
extend payment terms that can be compared to small loans.

Insurance companies
Private insurance services are not widespread in Tunisia, in part because of a lack of insurance
culture in the country across all socio-professional categories. The premiums written by all the 19
insurance companies operating in Tunisia represent less than 2% of GDP (the average insurance
premium per inhabitant was around 120 TND in 2012). Even with the increasing volume of insurance
policies provided by the Post, this figure remains extremely low in comparison with the population.
Car insurance, which is obligatory, is most prevalent (46% of written premiums), followed by life
insurance (16% of written premiums). The Ministry of Social Affairs and the CNSS provide minimal
social coverage but not to the entire population. A mobile network operator and an insurance
company are about to launch a micro-health insurance product aimed at students, with monthly
online payment of the premium.

Money transfer companies                                      DRAFT




According to the World Bank, the international person-to-person transfer of money into Tunisia,
which has an expatriate population of over 1 million, amounted to 3.7 billion TND in 2012 (5.3% of
GDP in 2009). Western Union (1,600 points of service) and Money Gram (500 points of service) are
primary providers. The Post processes the majority of domestic money transfers, which in 2012
totaled 785 million TND in 3.3 million transactions. Social transfers represent between 15% and 20%
of GDP, including subsidies for more than 120,000 disadvantaged families. The majority of these
transfers are conducted through the Post.

Digital finance
The regulatory framework for digital finance in Tunisia is bank-led, and falls under the supervision of
the CBT. Partnerships between banks and non-banking institutions may be authorized, notably in
order to facilitate the opening of electronic wallets and the implementation of networks to purchase
or sell electronic money. In practical terms, implementation of these partnerships remains difficult.
To date, only one has emerged (BIAT/Via Mobile for the m-Dinar service) and has seen little uptake.
The four services currently on the market (the three postal services—MobiFlouss, MobiDinar, and
Mobimoney—and the m-Dinar service) offer limited services and lack interoperability. There are,
however, several projects underway led by either mobile network operators, the Post, or the
government, which could change the digital finance landscape in Tunisia.




32 Customers receive an Ooredoo SIM card, and must acquire an e-Dinar card from the Tunisian Post, which will allow them
to withdraw the loan amount from a postal ATM. Repayment is made through the e-Dinar card, either at a postal branch or
through a Mobiflouss transfer.
33 Due to its financial situation, the CNRPS only grants two types of loans: personal loans (to cover urgent social needs) and

university loans.

V. Market Infrastructure
Market infrastructure in Tunisia has improved since 2011, but remains under-developed, although
                                                                     DRAFT




it is key to harnessing the healthy growth of the financial sector and to developing the market when
needed.

Credit Bureau
Created in 1977, the CBT credit registry provides positive and negative information on loans to
registered businesses and individuals granted by banks and leasing companies.34 It includes 30% of
adults in Tunisia35 although it does not comprise all financial products (e.g. suppliers’ loans) or client
history. It is not yet possible to use the registry data to conduct analysis (e.g. market segmentation by
enterprise size). The CBT and the ACM are currently in discussion to develop a credit registry for
MFIs, linked to the existing registry. This platform should be operational by the end of 2015.

National Guarantee Fund (NGF)
The NGF is funded by 1% of the amount of each loan provided by AMCs. In theory, this fund should
cover up to 90% of loan in arrears. It has never been used for several reasons, in particular due to the
legal procedures required, which are too costly as compared to the loan amount.

Professional associations
The Tunisian financial sector includes several professional associations.
     APTBEF is the professional association for banks and financial institutions (24 universal and
        investment banks, 9 leasing companies, and 2 factoring companies).


34 Information is said to be positive when it involves outstanding debt and negative when it involves payment problems
(e.g. late loans, unpaid checks). The credit registry allows regulated financial institutions to measure the level and quality of
a potential client’s debt before financing him or her, which prevents both risky loans and clients’ over-indebtedness.

           For MFIs, decree-law no. 2011-117 (article 54) makes membership in a professional
            association compulsory. The scope of such association is limited to representing the sector
            and ensuring it operates ethically. The professional association is in the process of being
            created and must be approved by the Ministry of Finance following consultation with the
            ACM.
           The Tunisian Federation of Insurance companies (FTUSA) represents all insurance companies.

The Financial Inclusion Observatory
In line with the 2011 Concerted Vision, a scoping mission for the creation of an observatory took
place in December 2012. It confirmed the need to improve the quality of available information
related to financial inclusion, both from the supply and demand sides, as well as the coordination of
data gathering. Initially housing the Observatory within the ACM was considered appropriate. The
creation of the Observatory is pending the publication of a relevant ministerial decree.

Training, audit, advisory, and support services
Although these services are available on the Tunisian market, including from international firms,
none are offered specifically in relation to microfinance. There is, however, a significant need for
financial education (for clients), advice and technical support (for associations), and training (for
human resources in financial institutions).


VI. Key Financial Inclusion Challenges
The opportunities for financial inclusion in Tunisia are significant. There remains, however, a
number of structural and short-term challenges to overcome in order to offer financial services to
the largest number of individuals and businesses, and through this channel, contribute to bringing
                                                                  DRAFT




growth and dynamism to the Tunisian economy. While work has been initiated in a number of
important areas, particularly those dealing with market infrastructure, other significant projects have
yet to be initiated.

1. The designation of a champion

A financial inclusion strategy requires a strong commitment on behalf of at least one public
stakeholder. The Ministry of Finance has to date played this role, and the creation of the ACM is an
important step forward to continue advancing financial inclusion in Tunisia. In more than 70% of
cases around the world, however, financial inclusion strategies are led by central banks,36 which have
the mandate and the technical skills to deal with key elements of supporting financial inclusion,
including the regulation of financial activity in all of its aspects, the management of financial
infrastructure systems, and the supervision of financial institutions. These areas are beyond the
current mandate of the ACM. It is therefore necessary to identify the future champion of financial
inclusion in Tunisia, which must possess the ability to bring together a wide diversity of public and
private institutions and allow the development of a varied range of financial services, beyond
microcredit. In December 2013, aware of the need to pursue current reforms and develop a financial
inclusion strategy over the long term, the Tunisian authorities and donor agencies discussed the idea
of a national coordination committee. However, this has not yet been implemented.

2. A better understanding of client needs

Tunisia is critically short of up-to-date information on demand, supply, and behavior related to
financial services. Current segmentation is insufficient and lacks precision. A representative market

study would be particularly useful for putting in place appropriate public policies, developing
adapted financial services, and for modifying the culture around financial services.37 International
donors have offered financing such a study and assisting the government in the coordination work of
the various stakeholders.

3. A better vision of the role of various actors

A restructuring of the microcredit sector is underway, with new operators emerging and established
operators undergoing change, but the future remains unclear, particularly because of the confusion
generated by the successive legislative changes since 2011, which encourage the consolidation of
the sector on the one hand, and the status quo on the other.

    Legal ambiguities concerning unions, mergers, and setting up subsidiaries of associations have
     not been resolved (e.g. the impossibility for a parent association to continue its credit activities,
     which prevents it from gradually transferring its portfolio; the complexity and practical
     difficulties of implementing unions of associations, notably because of a refinancing problem of
     tax and social arrears).
    The future of AMCs is uncertain, given that the majority of them do not have the means or even
     the will to update their operational systems (IT, governance and internal controls).
    Enda and the new entrants seem to be on the right path to increase microcredit penetration in
     Tunisia. However, the reworking of the law in 2014 opened the door to other changes,
     particularly regarding the interest rate cap. Such cap could jeopardize MFIs sustainability if its
     calculation method was not suitable.

In this context, the role of the BTS is yet to be determined. Since 2011, several strategic options
have been discussed but no decision has been taken. The final choice is particularly sensitive, in light
                                                              DRAFT




of the BTS weight (735 million TND of assets in 2012), its traditional role as key supporter for AMCs,
and the challenges of reforming a public institution.

The Post already plays a very important role in financial inclusion. It could however do more by
developing savings services that are better adapted to demand. To achieve this, it must choose the
strategy to reach its full potential and implement the significant organizational reforms that this
would require. Further analysis on the regulatory and supervisory framework underpinning the Post
would be a first step towards broader organizational reforms.

Mobile phone payments and digital financial services represent unique opportunities for swiftly
expanding access to financial services, but their development requires a more enabling legislation
and infrastructure (e.g. legislation facilitating the development of alternative distribution channels,
national switching system for interbank payments).

Different institutions (e.g. donors, AFI) could support Tunisia’s efforts to develop a genuine strategy
for financial inclusion, detailing the long-term vision of the financial landscape and clarifying the roles
of each type of actor.




37Additional studies would allow, for example, better understanding the financial needs of individuals, particularly the low-
income, and enterprises, particularly VSSMEs. What perception do they have of formal financial services and why do only
5% of adults save in a formal way while 25% save informally? What use do they make of financial services, both formal and
informal? Why do 53% of businesses appear to have a loan in the credit registry, while access to finance seems to be a
major impediment to the growth of Tunisian businesses?

4. Access to liquidity

Until 2011, AMCs were mainly financed by the State through the BTS, while Enda benefited from
local and foreign funding. The situation is expected to come under strain, however, given the lack of
liquidity troubling the Tunisian financial sector on the one hand, and the entry into the market of
new companies seeking funding on the other. If the lack of liquidity in the Tunisian banking sector
was to continue, it would impact the refinancing of MFIs and force them to refinance themselves in
foreign currency, at a significantly higher cost than local funding. Alternative solutions should then be
considered, such as revisiting the role of the BTS, the creation of a new dedicated refinancing
institution (commonly called Apex) and/or temporary and value-added mechanisms to support
liquidity (e.g. credit lines, partial credit guarantee programs).


Conclusion
Tunisia stands at a crossroad in terms of financial inclusion, with on the one hand a supply that
covers the most basic needs for savings and credit, but on the other a significant unmet or under-
served demand. Opportunities to improve financial inclusion are many. Some have already been set
in motion with the support of international donors, including the African Development Bank (AfDB),
the European Investment Bank (EIB), the World Bank Group/IFC, the French Development Agency
(AFD)/Proparco Group, German development aid (KfW and GIZ), and the European Union. By building
on financial inclusion as a key development pillar, beyond the limited scope of microcredit as it is
currently defined, Tunisia would be in a position to both stimulate economic growth and improve the
living conditions of its most disadvantaged citizens.
