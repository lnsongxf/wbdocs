Trade and integration are critical to achieving the                 Nepal's integration performance over the last two decades
Government of Nepal’s ambitious objective of                        has been lackluster. Many factors aﬀect Nepal’s trade

        Box 1: A summary of the main objectives outlined in the Nepal Trade and Integration Strategy (2015)




              The Government of Nepal has recognized the importance of integration into the global marketplace as a
              means of growth and inclusive development. Nepal began actively pursuing regional and global economic
              integration eﬀorts when it open up its economy in the late 1980s. These eﬀorts resulted in Nepal joining the
              World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2004 and signing 17 trade and 2 transit agreements. Moreover, the Govern-
              ment of Nepal has been seeking to identify constraints to export growth and interventions to alleviate them
              through diﬀerent trade integration studies.

              The Nepal Trade Integration Strategy 2015 (NTIS) is the third successive trade integration strategy, with the
              ﬁrst one being drafted in 2004 and the second in 2010. Its preparation includes wide consultations among
              various stakeholders including line agencies, the private sector, development partners (including the World Bank
              Group), and others. A national steering committee has been constituted and chaired by the Chief Secretary of the
              Government of Nepal. The steering committee membership includes the following Ministries: Finance, Industry,
              Law, Justice, Constitutional Assembly and Parliamentary Aﬀairs, Agricultural Development, Foreign Aﬀairs, and
              Commerce and Supplies. The committee membership also includes the National Planning Commission, Nepal’s
              Rastra Bank, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industries, the Confederation of Nepalese
              Industries, the Chamber of Commerce, the Planning and International Trade Cooperation Division of the Ministry
              of Commerce and Supplies, and the Donor Facilitator for Nepal.

              The NTIS covers four cross-cutting areas and three “priority export potential sector.” The cross-cutting areas
              are: (i) transport and trade facilitation; (ii) standards and technical regulations; (iii) sanitary and phyto-sanitary
              measures; and (iv) intellectual property rights. The priority export sectors, identiﬁed on the basis of export poten-
              tial and development impact, are grouped into three broad sectors (i) agro-food goods (cardamom, ginger, tea,
              medicinal and aromatic plants); (ii) craft and manufacturing goods (fabrics, textiles, yarn and rope, leather,
              footwear, pashminas, and carpets); and (iii) services (semi-skilled and skilled professional services, information
              technology (IT), business process outsourcing (BPO) and IT engineering, and tourism).

              Focusing on the four cross-cutting areas and priority sectors, and based on identiﬁed constraints, the NTIS
              deﬁnes key performance indicators and an action plan to achieve the set objectives. The key performance
              indicators focus on increased foreign direct investment (FDI), implementation of actions pending from previous
              strategies, improvements in logistics performance, and export performance of the priority sectors. The action
              plan, in turn, introduces short- and medium-term interventions in the cross-cutting areas identiﬁed as relevant.
              Further interventions are aimed at improving export performance of the priority sectors, including capacity
              building, development of sector-speciﬁc export strategies, public sector institutional strengthening, export and
              investment policy interventions, intellectual property rights enforcement, market access, quality certiﬁcations,
              and branding among others (for the complete NTIS action plan, see Government of Nepal 2015b).

      Box 2: Political Instability in Nepal




            For over 20 years, Nepal has been facing substantial political instability aﬀecting its growth
            prospects. In 2006, a decade-long conﬂict came to an end when key stakeholders reached the
            Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The country successfully held the Constituent Assembly in 2008,
            just after the Parliament approved the abolishment of monarchy in December 2007, and the country
            became a republic in May 2008. Since then, Nepal has been making eﬀorts to establish inclusive and
            accountable governance structures.

            The transition to peace and democracy has been complex and lengthy. Stakeholders took eight
            years of deliberations on a new government structure. The new federal constitution was only
            completed and adopted on September 20, 2015, soon after the April/May 2015 earthquakes had
            caused a huge loss of lives and assets. However, the rapid close of the constitutional process itself
            brought about violent protests and clashes across the country’s southern belt bordering with India,
            which further intensiﬁed after September 20. Major disruptions in cross-border trade with India
            resulted in shortages of essential supplies across the country. These disruptions lasted more than four
            months and have added to the diﬃculties that the private sector faces in Nepal to remain competitive
            in global markets.

            This political instability has aﬀected Nepal’s growth prospects through two channels. First, it has
            added to uncertainty, which acts as a brake on private sector investment and innovation. Second, it
            has diverted attention of policy makers away from diﬃcult and important reforms. Political stability
            is in fact a key element in Nepal’s path to become a middle-income country as envisioned in the
            country’s long-term development strategy.

Introduction
The ﬁve policy notes, prepared as a response to a direct request of the
Government of Nepal, carefully examine the following topics:



    Policy Note 1 examines the sustainability of                      Policy Note 2 looks into the challenges that
    Nepal’s trade imbalances, their underlying drivers,               Nepalese ﬁrms face when integrating in value

    exports and as a provider of key inputs for other                 growth and diversiﬁcation. It addresses two broad
    sectors of the economy. It identiﬁes sources of poten-            questions: (i) Is the incentive reaching the ﬁrms it

    Policy Note 5 stresses the importance of
    supporting the internationalization process of
    Nepal’s ﬁrms, as well as setting up the right
    infrastructure to attract, retain, and connect FDI.
    This note looks into the functioning of institutions to
    promote trade and investment in Nepal and propos-

becoming a powerful platform for ﬁrms producing high-quali-

Yet, Nepal’s current remittance-driven growth
model is introducing an anti-export bias, adding
barriers to reaping full gains from integration.

Remittances are a key source of income of foreign exchange in
Nepal. They help alleviate ﬁnancial constraints of households,
lifting many out of poverty. However, from a macroeconomic
perspective, remittances are also helping to grow current
large trade deﬁcits, and are contributing to an appreciation of
the real exchange rate. Results presented in Policy Note 1
suggest that an increase in remittances by 10 percent leads to
a 0.5 percent appreciation of the real exchange rate in the
long run. Remittances put upward pressure on the prices of
nontradable goods, and with a nominal exchange rate regime
that is pegged to the Indian rupee, the result is an apprecia-
tion of the real exchange rate. As remittances have grown fast




1 See Policy Note 1 for a detailed description of the analysis. With the average quarterly change in remittances over the period 1995Q1 to 2015Q1

being at 5.8 percent, the estimated appreciation of the real exchange rate due to this channel is of 22 percent. The magnitude of the eﬀect is
broadly in line with what is observed in the literature.

Services export performance has been better than
that observed in goods, but there are still untapped
opportunities.

Services exports are an important source of foreign exchange
and value added. In gross, services exports reached US$1.2
billion and represented 54 percent of Nepal’s export basket in
2014. In value added, the services sector accounted for 44
percent of all domestic value added exported from Nepal. This
ﬁgure includes not only direct exports, but also the value
added the services sector demands from other sectors for its
exports (that is, the backward linkages). Most of these exports
are in the travel and telecommunications sectors (80 percent),
although there is a nascent, largely informal, but ﬂourishing
software and BPO sector. However, in the largest services
export sector, travel and tourism, low-value activities predom-
inate. For example, daily tourist expenditures per day in 2012
were US$38, at the lower end of the distribution, and the
tourism oﬀering is relatively concentrated in trekking (see a
more detailed analysis in Policy Note 3).

3.3 percent of eligible ﬁrms received the incentive. This increased to
above 6 percent in 2013 and 14 percent in 2014, but remained low.
Most ﬁrms exporting eligible products do not receive any incentive,
and those that are receiving it are substantially larger, and tend to
receive it systematically. In fact, the conditional probability of receiv-

year before was 50–70 percent. Changes in the scheme introduced
in 2013 do not seem to have been fully implemented. This is
observed both in the analysis of data and from conducting ﬁeld
interviews with eligible ﬁrms. The fast-track system introduced in
2013, by which ﬁrms exporting priority products would not need to
certify domestic value addition, reﬂect the systematic feedback of
the private sector on the complexity of proving that value added
