     5. Approaches to Estimating Benefits of Routine Climate for Specific Users/Sectors
     A survey of the literature indicates that there have                        studies attempt to replicate real-world deci-

     4 There are also sectoral-like approaches that rely on conjoint analysis, although these have been applied infrequently to estimate country-lev-
     el benefits of hydromet modernization (an example is Leviäkangas et al. 2007). Conjoint analysis uses the survey method common in contingent
     valuation but also an additional survey where users of forecast information and experts in selected sectors are asked to rank alternatives or attri-
     butes associated with different hydromet investment scenarios and outcomes. The results of these expert assessments are then used to adjust
     benefits estimated by contingent valuation, and the results are used to extend the contingent valuation estimates of willingness to pay for users
     from a specific sector to other sectors. Conjoint analysis is therefore a combination of the contingent valuation approach with further sociological
     surveys aimed to refine and map the use of better forecast and climate information for the country in question.

5 Hallegate (2012) proposes a specific approach, risk management analysis, for loss transfer and modification. His work details a procedure to
use losses from European countries in terms of saved lives and reduced economic losses from weather data, and then transfer this information
to estimate losses in developing countries. He is therefore able to provide a layer of additional sophistication and data quality to estimating ben-
efits of hydromet modernization in developing countries that lack sufficient data for analysis. His procedure is based on asset losses, and he also
details several necessary modifications to making sectoral analysis more rigorous in these contexts. Finally, he argues that benefit estimation
must be sensitive to five needs in developing country contexts: local observation systems, forecasting capacity, interpretation capacity, commu-
nication tools, and user decision-making capabilities. Finally, this approach compares only annual benefits and costs and therefore does not de-
pend on a discount rate.

  Short-range forecasts are forecasts beyond 12 hours and up to 72 hours. Medium-range forecasts are forecasts beyond 72 hours and up
to 240 hours. Seasonal forecasts are descriptions of averaged weather parameters over the next 3 to 6 months, excluding individual events.
