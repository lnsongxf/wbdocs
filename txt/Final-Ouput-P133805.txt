 1.2 Overview of country’s GHG emissions (1)

    India’s GHG Emissions- 2007 level
    2007, India’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by sources and removal by sinks
     were 1,727.71 million tons of CO2 equivalents (or 1,904.73 million tons of CO2
     equivalents without land use, land use change and forestry), with the largest
     shares from electricity generation (38%), agriculture (18%) and other energy
     industries (12%).

 2.1 Taking stock of relevant sectors (and/or target area)

     By 2020, 1,452 to 1,620 million tonnes of CO2e are projected to emit only from
      the power sector due to the increase of power demand from 172 to 377 GW.
     Further efforts on introduction of renewable energies or reduction of the
      demand have the potential to reduce GHGs emissions against business as usual
      scenario.
     Energy efficiency measures must be also promoted and brought up to a scale
      that permits significant reductions in energy intensity of India’s GDP growth.
     Hence, India intends to propose the following Market Readiness Components:

        Market based instruments beyond REC mechanism for Off-grid renewable
         and Net-metering
        Expansion of the Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT)
        Mitigation plan to clean up the Ganga river basin

 2.2 Core Readiness Components (1) – with Off-grid Renewable and Net-Metering


 Key objective is include the off-grid renewable power application within the REC
 fold


   Key challenges and issues to be addressed through the PMR support are:
         Renewable energy is presently promoted through a regulatory (REC) mechanism
          under which States have Renewable Portfolio Obligation (RPO). The renewables
          based power purchased by utilities in excess of RPO can be traded as Renewable
          Energy Certificates (REC). However, the REC caters to only the grid connected
          utilities. Off-grid renewable power and net metering is out of its purview.
         However, decentralized electrification using RE technologies are perceived as an
          economic options for meeting unmet demand in electrified villages.
         The challenge is how to include off-grid renewable power applications within REC
          fold.
         Off-grid regime will require putting in place a robust MRV guidelines.

 2.2 Core Readiness Components (1) – with Offgrid-REC mechanism

 Background

         Off-grid REC regime will on one hand help in creating a parallel
          electricity market based on decentralized distributed RE based
          generation. On the other hand, it will help in reducing direct
          subsidy component from Govt of India for such projects.

         Further, creation of a REC market for off-grid will help reduce
          demand for grid connected power. In addition, as REC is linked
          with actual power generation, it will ensure continued
          operation and maintenance of the RE systems

 2.2 Core Readiness Components (2) – with energy efficiency measures under PAT

 The PAT is an existing market based mechanism that was developed to enhance the cost
 effectiveness of improving energy efficiency through certification of energy saving which
 can be traded.

 PMR Support would explore the feasibility of expanding the PAT scheme:
 Domestically - to add new energy intensive sectors not currently covered by the Scheme;
 and
 Internationally - by establishing a mechanism to promote the international fungibility of
 an Escert in the global carbon market.

 Key areas to be addressed:
 The key challenge for domestic expansion is for the Bureau of Energy Efficiency to set
 targets that avoid penalizing already efficient industries and going easy on non-compliant
 ones; and
 The key challenge for international market expansion is to set up a system that is
 transparent and that links with the global market without any market distortion or double
 counting.

 PMR Support is also intended to explore the feasibility of expanding the PAT Scheme
 to the international market. This would involve establishing a mechanism to
 promote international fungibility of an Escert based on the level of environmental
 bundling and GHG emission reductions associated with the PAT.

 PMR support is envisioned/planned for the following activities:
 Development of a methodology to evaluate the global carbon market benefit of a
 registered Energy savings project under the PAT mechanism. To avoid double
 counting, this benefit would be in addition to any domestic benefits (e.g., energy
 and environmental);
 Development of a reporting guideline for energy efficiency; and
 Development of a domestic verification procedure and capacity building for a
 Compliance Auditor.

 2.2 Core Readiness Components (2) – with energy efficiency measures under PAT

 In expanding the PAT, India proposes to expand the Monitoring and Reporting
 guidelines to cover the new sectors. In this regard, PMR support will help to
 address:
 •Monitoring, measurement and reporting guidelines/standards: Development of
 guidelines/standards.
 •Domestic verification procedures: plans for developing/implementing a system of
 independent verification.

 In expanding the PAT, India proposes to expand the existing registry system in
 order to keep track of the additional energy savings, GHG emissions, allocation,
 compliance status, etc. In this regard, PMR support will help to address:
 • Identifying existing system for tracking energy savings;
 •Establishing broad objectives for tracking energy savings and subsequent GHG
 reductions in the covered sectors; and
 •Identifying technical, system and capacity gaps for tracking energy savings and
 emissions.

 2.2 Core Readiness Components (3) – Ganga Wastewater treatment project

 PMR support is intended to support a plan for wastewater treatment to clean up
 the Ganga river basin with mitigation as a co-benefit, by promoting the
 implementation of wastewater treatment projects, including both greenfield and
 existing, that will capture or avoid methane gases generated from wastewater
  Waste water treatment installations (or their absence) in the Ganga River
        Basin not only constitute a significant source of GHG emissions, but can
        also pose serious health risks
  Untreated sewage and industrial wastewater represents the primary
        sources of pollution, with only one-third of the sewage generated in the
        main-stem towns and cities receiving treatment before being discharged in
        the river
  Previous efforts to clean up the Ganga have not been sustainable
 New , comprehensive vision for clean-up and conservation of the Ganga
         National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA) established in 2009
         National Ganga Mission launched in 2010 by MoEF

 2.2 Core Readiness Components (3) – Ganga Wastewater treatment project

 Ganga River Basin Wastewater Treatment
       Objective: Ganga river clean-up and                   Type of action: Wastewater
 resulting emissions reductions through               treatment coupled with avoidance
 treatment of wastewater                              or capture of GHG emissions
       Motive: The Ganga has high                    (initially mainstem, then basin-
 economic, environmental and cultural                 wide)
 value in India, but extreme pollution
 pressures threaten sustainability of the
 river
       Rationale:
 (1)    Sizeable gap between sewage
 generation and treatment capacity;
 (2)    Limited regulation or enforcement
 for wastewater treatment and none for
 methane recovery or avoidance, and;
 (3)    Substantial GHG mitigation potential

threat to the sustainability of the river. Key Ganga River Basin Characteristics:

• 26% of country’s landmass          • 40% of India’s population (close to       • Average population density is 551
• 30% of its water resources         500 million)                                people per square kilometer, more than 10
• One of India’s holiest rivers      • < 70% live on less than $2 a day          times the global average

 Assessment of historic and projected emissions trends, and key drivers of sector GHG emissions

  • There is a large gap between sewage generation and
      treatment in India; 38,000 MLD of municipal sewage
      generated in Class-I Cities and Class-II Towns, treatment
      capacity exists for only about 120,000 MLD*
  •   181 Class-I (< 100,000) and Class-II (< 50,000) cities
      dispose 12410 MLD of wastewater directly into Ganga or
      its tributaries
  •   Operations and maintenance of existing plants and sewage
      pumping stations is also an issue with 39 percent not
      adhering to general standards/ regs*
  •   Phase I of the World Bank’s 1 billion USD implementation
      support projects will initially focus on the Class-I Cities
      mainstem, treating 3,000 MLD
  •   Based on current wastewater treatment projects, potential
      mitigation is around 180,000 tons ktCO2e of by the year
      2050 when gross wastewater generation is projected to
      be 120,000 MLD*

Regulatory and institutional framework
 Regulation exists for wastewater treatment but, none is in place for the recovery or avoidance of methane from wastewater. The
 existing regulation can be improved; only 60 percent of industrial and [26] percent of municipal wastewater is treated. Giving the
 growing demands, business as usual is not a sustainable option.
 The Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) have the primary responsibility for wastewater, solid waste and river front management, but
 actual devolution of functions and responsibilities has been limited, and the responsibilities for urban services overlap
 considerably across state and local agencies.
 However, the GoI has developed a new and comprehensive vision for clean-up and conservation of the Ganga. The National
 Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA) was established in 2009. The NGRBA has been given the mandate to develop a multi-sector
 program (“the NGRBA Program”) for ensuring pollution abatement in the Ganga.

Scope
On a basin-wide level, this Mitigation Plan condones the implementation of wastewater treatment projects, including greenfield
and existing, that will capture or avoid the methane generated from wastewater and thus avoid GHG emissions. The recovered
biogas may also be potentially combusted in an energy generating facility, constituting a renewable energy source. Such activities
will contribute to the further sustainable development of India with regards to environmental, economic, social and
technological sustainability.




Boundary
Activities under this Mitigation Plan will be restricted to wastewater treatment with methane recovery or avoidance in the Ganga
river basin.

Recognizing that the Ganga clean-up will take a long time and significant resource commitments, the NGRBA intends to develop
a program that balances institutional development and capacity building at an increasing scale:
‒ Program launch: Set up the NGRBA’s operational-level institutions, address the critical knowledge needs, design the
investments program and implement the obvious priority investments (most likely Class-I Cities on the mainstem)
‒ Phase I: Extensive wastewater networks and treatment infrastructure will primarily focus on the mainstem
‒ Phase II: This phase will have a broader range, allowing for basin-level activities involving Class-II Towns on the Ganga’s many
tributaries

Definitive clean-up of the Ganga will also require addressing the multiple other sources of pollution in addition to wastewater,
such as, solid waste and non-point sources. It would also require maintaining adequate in-stream flows and other measures for
ecological restoration of the river.

Mitigation potential
Projects will involve the installation of anaerobic digester(s) with methane recovery systems. Typical wastewater
treatment (industrial or domestic) projects will either include:
 - Replacing an existing wastewater treatment system with a new treatment system coupled with methane recovery
- A greenfield wastewater treatment system coupled with methane recovery
- Wastewater treatment system capacity addition coupled the methane recovery

As of 2008, 232 Class-I Cities (< 100,000) in the Ganga river basin generated 11,387 MLD of municipal sewage, but only
had a capacity of 44 percent (4991 MLD). Class-II Towns 149 (<50,000) generated 1,024 MLD and had the capacity to treat
8 percent (79MLD). This gap of nearly 41 percent represents very large mitigation potential.*

It is estimated that municipal wastewater will be around 120,000 MLD by 2051. This will have a profound impact on the
decreasing per capita water availability as the population grows.*

MRV Issues
Initial MRV will be done at the individual project level, but a centralized authority will be responsible for final verification
of emissions reductions. A centralized record keeping system will record important project elements such as: name of
implementing entity; technology description; location; date of commissioning; information pertaining to applicable
baseline and how baseline was determined, and; data regarding all parameters required for baseline emissions, projects
emissions and leakage calculation, including data source.

Each project activity will also verify that it does not result in negative impacts to the environment and that it will provide
the following environmental benefits: reduction of methane emissions; potential performance improvement of existing
wastewater treatment system (in the case of replacement projects); reduction of risk of water contamination; generation
of energy from renewable sources (i.e. methane) which may be put to use rather than flared or released into the
atmosphere, and; reduction of fossil fuel use due to potential use of methane in energy generation

Identification of successes, failures, challenges and lessons learned to date
One major problem that has been identified is previous attempts to clean up the Ganga is that, while the GoI is generally able to
find the necessary finances to support capital costs, no further provision is made for operation and maintenance after project
completion. Local authorities (i.e. ULBs) do not have the means to meet operating expenses and are not as of yet able to collect
user fees to this end.
Lessons learned from previous efforts are reflected in the NGRBA Program. Some relevant features include:
‒ A comprehensive, basin-level, multi-sectoral approach in contrast to earlier “town-centric” and “end-of-the-pipeline” efforts
‒ Access to the necessary budgetary and financial resources, supplemented by international sources such as carbon markets
(Additional resources to be provided by central and state governments, as well as international development partners; urban
renewal programs to address infrastructure needs)
‒ Emphasis on the long-term sustainability of investments, through operational mechanisms and capacity building of local
providers
‒ Support investments in improving the regulatory and enforcement capacity of environmental management institutions in the
basin
