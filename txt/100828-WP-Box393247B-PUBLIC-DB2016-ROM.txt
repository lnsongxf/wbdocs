THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 19,910,995

by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 37

frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 37*
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

        Obtain urban planning certificate

        Pursuant to Order No. 839/2009 issued by the Ministry of
        Regional Development and Housing (“Order 839”), approving the
        Methodological Norms to the Construction Law, the following
        urban planning documents are required:
        • The general urban plan (PUG) and the related local regulation
        • The (zone) urban plan (PUZ) and the related local regulation
        • The detailed urban plan (PUD)

        The urban planning certificate provides information on the
        ownership, the public utility service availability, the location
        within (intravilan) and outside (extravilan) the city limits, the
        urban planning requirements, the land use at the time, the
        allowed uses, and so forth.

        From a technical point of view, the certificate shows the
        percentage of land occupation, the coefficient of land use, the              30 days               RON 17

        built-up area, utilities, and access, necessary parking, alignment
        of the land and buildings with the adjacent streets, and the
        maximum and minimum construction height allowed.

        This certificate does not grant the right to build. Its validity
        period varies but cannot exceed 12 months. Construction must
        start during that 12-month period.

        The urban planning certificate enumerates all the necessary
        project clearances applicable to the warehouse case considered
        here. The municipality has the right to decide which project
        clearances are needed.

      Obtain project clearance from Bucharest Regional
      Environmental Protection Agency

      According to the Order of the Ministry of the Environment and
      the Climacteric Changes no. 865 / 2014 regarding the
      amendment of certain regulations in the environment protection
      field, the cost in case the application requires no assessment (the
      project can be built without environmental permit) is of Ron 100.
      In this case, the application will be responded in 10 days;           21 days       RON 500

      days.

      Agency: Apa Nova SA



      * Obtain project clearance from General Inspectorate for
      Emergency Situations

      The relevant legal provisions in force are Methodological Norms
      for the Endorsement and Permitting regarding Fire Security and
      Civil Protection, approved by Order no. 3/2011 of the Ministry of

      According to the amendments to the Construction Law, if the 15-
      day term provided by the law for issuing the clearance is not
      observed by the General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations,
      the legal provisions referring to tacit approval shall be applied.

      Agency: General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations



      * Obtain project clearance from Health Department

      The maximum term to respond to the application for project

      * Sign contract with the solid waste authority (REBU SA)

      Through the certificate of urbanization the municipality requests
      that a contract be signed with a waste disposal company to clear
      construction debris from the construction site. There are two
      companies that provide services in this area: ROSAL S.A. and
      REBU S.A. The latter is a larger player with a wider network. The
      fees are RON 93 (RON 75.00 + 24% VAT) per cubic meter of
6     waste (although VAT is not taken into account in the Doing            1 day       RON 5,292
      Business case study). Additionally, for the surface of the land in
      question, a tax of RON 42.00 would also be applicable. The
      minimum of 35 cubic meters must be contracted according to
      the requirements of company.

      Agency: REBU SA



      * Notarize statement about nonexistence of land disputes

      The company must notarize a statement (in this case, BuildCo is
      both the company and the applicant) stating that there are no
      disputes related to the land. This procedure is not a standard
      requirement by law but is often requested in practice.

7     Each notary charges a different fee, but the fee cannot exceed        1 day         RON 15
      RON 30.00 (equivalent to USD 10.00), the maximum notary fee
      established by the National Notaries Union.

      BuildCo must apply for a building permit by submitting the
      following documents:
      • City-planning certificate

      recent the title must be)
      • Technical documentation which replaced former plans for the
      authorization of construction                                        30 days      RON 16,414

      construction permit is issued by the General Mayor of Bucharest
      if the construction is outside the buildable area or if it exceeds a
      district area; or by the relevant district mayor if the construction
      is located in one of the six districts of Bucharest.

      The cost of the building permit is 1% of the value of the
      construction work.


      Agency: City Hall



      Receive foundations work inspection

      The schedule of inspections is described in the building permit.
      By law, BuildCo must pay 0.1% of the authorized value to the
      competent territorial inspectorate for construction. In addition,
      the investors or owners must pay the State Inspectorate for
9     Construction a monthly payment equivalent to 0.70% of the               1 day       RON 13,131
      value of the expenses incurred in that month for the execution of
      the construction work.

      Agency: Bucharest Construction Inspectorate



      Receive frame inspection

      The examination of the building is performed in all cases
      through inspection of the building and by analyzing the
10    documents contained in the technical book of the construction.          1 day        no charge

      Agency: Bucharest Construction Inspectorate



      Request final assessment of the construction from the
      Acceptance Commission

      BuildCo notifies the local public administration and other
      relevant authorities of the date of completion of construction so
11    that the Acceptance Commission may be convened and a final              1 day        no charge
      assessment can be carried out.

      Agency: Acceptance Commission



      Receive final inspection from the Acceptance Commission

      The final acceptance commission will analyse: (i) the protocol(s)
      signed upon completion of the works, (ii) the manner the
      remaining works [mentioned by the initial protocol(s)] were
12    performed and (iii) the report on the construction performance          1 day        RON 150
      in time.

      Although prescribed by the law, in practice, the final inspection
      hardly ever takes place (especially in cases where the investor is
      also the construction company).

      Agency: Acceptance Commission




      Obtain final assessment of the construction from the
      Acceptance Commission

      BuildCo notifies the local public administration and other
      relevant authorities of the date of completion of construction so
      that the Acceptance Commission may be convened. The
      Acceptance Commission is a body made up of the construction
      beneficiary (BuildCo), officials from local public administration,
      and technical experts. It is legally required to meet and
      determine that the construction meets all applicable legal
      requirements.

      The Commission must be convened within 15 days from the date
13    of completion of works. The utility connections would have been      90 days       RON 350
      made at this stage. The final assessment can take several days
      and includes an on-site inspection. Within 3 working days from
      the end of the assessment, the Acceptance Commission must
      submit the notes and conclusions to the beneficiary of
      construction and recommend approval (with or without
      reservations), postponement, or rejection of the construction. In
      the event that the reception is accepted with objections,
      considering that some corrections/additional works are
      necessary, the procedure may last 90 days.

      Agency: Acceptance Commission



      Obtain water and sewage connection (Apa Nova SA)

      According to the water and sewage authority (Apa Nova S.A.),
      this procedure takes approximately 2 -- 3 months due to a
      significant increase in demand and backlog. The associated costs
      were increased to RON 520.00 for connection fee, RON 62.00 for
14    application fee and 64.18% VAT (VAT is not taken into account in     75 days       RON 582
      the Doing Business case study). Inspections for utilities occur at
      the same time as the connection.

      Register the building with the Real Estate Registry

      The building can be registered once it has been completed and
      approved. There are two stages of approval, and for that reason,
      the building can be registered twice. The first stage is after the
15    Acceptance Commission, and the second is when the warranty            7 days       RON 480
      period has expired, after the approval by the Acceptance
      Commission. The second approval applies only when the owner
      and the builder are different entities. Therefore, in the case
      considered here, it is assumed that only one registration is done.

        Pursuant to Order no. 700/2014 for the approval of the
        regulation regarding the endorsement, the reception and the
        registration with the Real Estate Registry, the standard
        registration time is 15 days but, if the applicant pays an
        additional fee, the registration time will be reduced to 5 business
        days. According to Order No. 39/2009 on the approval of fees for
        performing services by the National Agency for Cadastre and
        Land Registration ("Order 39"), the standard registration fee is
        RON 120 and the fast-track fee is 4-times the standard fee.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

      Register the title with the Land Registry Office

      The same public notary applies for registration of the property title at the
      Land Book Office, by sending the application and the original notary
      deed, directly or by fax, to the district Land Book Office where the real
      estate is placed. Therefore, the registration is performed ex officio by the
      notary, based on the authenticated sale purchase act. An expedited
      option is available given that an extra fee of 4 times the normal fee will
      be added. The extra fee can not be more than RON 5,000. Registration
      fees are 0.5% of property value with a minimum of RON 60 according to
      Order no 39/06.04.2009, for a Procedure that takes 9 days. An expedited
      Procedure is available (3 days) for an additional fee of 2% of property                            0.5% of the

        Registration of work place with the Trade Register Office

        The buyer should apply for registration with the Trade Register Office of
        the work place located at the newly acquired property. If the property is
        a working unit of the company, it has to be registered, as it is mentioned
        in the Commercial Registration Law (Law Number 26 1990). The
        registration includes, among others, environment, sanitary, fire
        protection, labor approvals from various relevant authorities, all located
        in a one-stop shop. The registration is not necessary for the transfer of
        title, but only for making it opposable to third parties and for registration
        as a place of business. The concrete use of the property as a work place
        is not required but the evidences necessary for using it as such are
        needed for obtaining the authorizations within the corporate registration
        process. Stamp tax and registration fees are lump-sum taxes and do not
        depend on the property value. The Trade Register tax and fees could be
        paid either directly to the Trade Register or through special bank
        accounts organized for such purposes. In summary, the total amount to
        be paid for the registration of a working place is made up of several                      RON 350 - RON
   8    taxes. When the application is filed only for the establishment of the           5 days

PAYING TAXES
Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes
faster, easier and less costly for businesses—such as by          have brought concrete results. Some economies
consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business

years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

the nonlinear transformation, an increase in the total tax
rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier
score for the total tax rate—and therefore on the
distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
