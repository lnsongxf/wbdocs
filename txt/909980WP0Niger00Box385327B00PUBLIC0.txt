Executive Summary
(providing the main conclusions and full policy
recommendations)‎


Niger has seen significant progress in economic development and in the reduction of extreme
‎
poverty. The economy grew by over 11% in 2012, thanks to oil, uranium and agricultural
production. ‎
            The percentage of people living on less than USD 1.25/day has been reduced from
66% in 2005 to 44% in ‎   2008, scoring above the sub Saharan African average of 49%. Average
‎
income has increased from USD 586 in 2000 to USD 701 in 2012 (expressed as the gross
national income [GNI] per capita in purchasing power parity [PPP] ‎        terms, constant 2005
international dollar). The positive changes are mirrored by the improved life ‎
                                                                              expectancy at birth,
growing from 39.5 years in 1980 to 48.3 years in 2000 and 55.1 years in 2012.‎

Despite of these encouraging statistics, living conditions for Nigeriens remain challenging. Food
insecurity persists even in years when production yields a surplus. About 60% of households are
only able to cover their food requirements for three months, and in periods of food shortages, half
of the population suffers from malnutrition. Adults, on average, have a mere 1.4 ‎   years of formal
school education, and as a consequence, Niger has ‎   one of the lowest literacy rates in the world in
spite of a massive expansion of the education system. ‎

The provision of health services is dominated by the public sector whose services are provided
through 829 Integrated Health ‎      Centers linked to 2,000 health posts that are managed by
community health workers. Higher ‎    level care is delivered by 33 district hospitals spread across 42
health districts, nine regional ‎ public health departments and six regional hospitals, including
several reference hospitals and ‎    maternity centers. Approximately 47% of the population lives
within five kilometers of a health ‎
                                   facility, but in some of the rural health districts access to a health
facility is much lower. In Niamey, the capital city, nearly 100% ‎        of the population has good
geographical access to public sector health provision, which translates ‎      into comparatively better
service-use statistics than elsewhere. Overall, health sector ‎        capacity is insufficient, and is
compounded by the doubling of the ‎    population every 23 years.‎

In 2011, health spending accounted for 5.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) (Euro 225 million
or (United States Dollar [USD] 303 million), and was ‎ dominated by public sector heath spending
(57% of total) and private out-of-pocket spending (39% of total). ‎
                                                                  External financing accounted for
almost one-third of all health spending (World Health Organization [WHO], 2014). ‎    Spending on
HIV care and treatment accounted for about 1.6% of total health spending, and 2.7% of public
health spending in 2011, while HIV/AIDS was responsible for an estimated 1.4% of all Years-of-
life-lost in 2010 according to the Burden of Disease Study.‎
As Niger progresses on its development path, it has an opportunity to review the scale and
‎
trajectory of the HIV epidemic, and the investment needed today to appropriately address the
‎
current and future disease burden of HIV/AIDS; and to ensure that HIV investments are high-
impact, sustainable, and can best ‎  support‎ Niger’s‎ overall‎ health‎ system‎ and‎ development‎
priorities.




                                                                                                        v
vi   Niger’s‎HIV‎response: Targeted investments for a healthy future



Equally, it is important to explore‎how‎the‎Niger‎government‎can‎contribute‎its‎“fair‎share”‎to‎the‎
HIV response, in agreement with the 2013 resolutions made by political leaders at the Abuja
Summit: to step up the mobilization of domestic resources to strengthen the health system and
ensuring diversified and sustainable financing for health.

The HIV allocative efficiency and financial sustainability
study ‎
The main objective of the study was to provide the Government of Niger with a comprehensive
‎
analysis of HIV and health financing needs, investment opportunities, and health system
development in the context of its HIV National ‎      Strategic Plan (NSP) 2013–17. ‎   The analysis
provides support for HIV policy decision-making, investment scenarios and ‎             programmatic
targeting and prioritization. In addition, the analysis helps Niger build the case for HIV ‎
                                                                                           and health
impact investment including delivering estimates of health care savings as a result of these
investments. ‎

This analysis was implemented by the World Bank in collaboration with UNAIDS from a request
‎
for analytical support from the Government of Niger. The study involved a desk review of HIV-
and ‎health-related evidence, epidemic trends and financial modeling. The Optima model ‎
                                                                                       (formerly
Prevtool) was used to estimate optimal resource allocation during the NSP, and the ‎impact and
cost-effectiveness of past HIV investments. A financial commitment framework was ‎       used to
estimate longer-term costs and savings of the HIV program and the fiscal dimension of HIV ‎   in
Niger. ‎

In this executive summary, we summarized the main conclusions, insights and the policy
recommendations emanating from this analysis.‎
‎


1.        Health and development challenges in Niger
Conclusion: The health transition in Niger is in its early stage, with communicable
diseases and ‎
             poverty-related conditions dominating the disease statistics, while malaria
and HIV/AIDS are the ‎
                     leading emerging diseases

In Niger, newborn, nutritional and maternal causes such as diarrheal diseases, lower respiratory
‎
infections, and protein-energy malnutrition as well as several communicable diseases including
‎
malaria, meningitis, measles, and tetanus are leading causes of health loss. Non-communicable
‎
diseases are a minor but emerging health issue, responsible for 18% of all disability adjusted life
years (DALYs), according to the ‎comprehensive international 2010 Burden of Disease Study. ‎

Rapid‎demographic‎growth‎is‎a‎central‎issue‎in‎Niger’s‎development‎process.‎The‎rate‎of‎growth‎
‎
has changed very little in the last 20 years and was 3.9% in 2012. On ‎
                                                                      average, women give birth
to 5.6 children in urban areas compared to 8.1 children in rural areas. Women who have
secondary education ‎ have an average of 3.1 fewer births than women who do not, highlighting
                  education‎plays‎in‎Niger’s‎demography.‎‎
the profound role ‎

HIV/AIDS has, together with malaria, been the leading cause of emerging disease burden ‎   over
the last 20 years. However, compared to other African countries, the burden of HIV/AIDS is
relatively ‎
           small (see Figure 1, combining HIV/AIDS and TB), and is therefore a more manageable
public health ‎ issue. Nevertheless, several top causes of local disease burden—iron deficiency
anemia, ‎  malnutrition, TB and diarrhea—interact with the immunocompromised status of HIV-
positive ‎
         individuals and are likely to accelerate disease progression and morbidity.

most YLDs in 2010. Causes are ‎  aggregated.‎



2.          HIV
            ‎        epidemic dynamics
Conclusion: The low grade HIV epidemic is in decline, but unless strong action is taken to
intervene, ‎
           there is a possibility that new economic growth-related co-factors such as
mining, urbanization, ‎economic development, and migration could result in increases in
new infections in future years

Empirical data from HIV surveys suggest a contracting HIV epidemic in Niger: HIV prevalence has
‎
decreased rapidly, both in the general population and in key populations. The modest HIV
‎
prevalence decreases in urban females may be linked to a combination of risk behaviors in towns
‎
(leading to new infections), and the relatively good access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) keeping
HIV-positive women ‎   alive. The stable HIV prevalence in prisoners suggests a sub-epidemic in
correctional facilities with ‎continuing high risk behaviours among prisoners and the possible
influence of ART on HIV ‎     prevalence levels. The cultural practice of circumcising males has
spared Niger from a generalized ‎     epidemic, and will continue to reduce the probability of HIV
transmission from men to women (this ‎      analysis estimated that over 200 million unprotected
sexual acts occur every year, or 90% of all sexual ‎acts in Niger). ‎
viii   Niger’s‎HIV‎response: Targeted investments for a healthy future



Modeled epidemic trajectories―which are developed using empirical HIV prevalence
data―‎ suggest that HIV transmission has declined sharply, from 8,470 new HIV infections at its
peak in ‎
        2000 to 1,450 in 2013 (Spectrum 2013). The Optima model predicts that the past HIV
incidence decline will continue into the future, provided that that current HIV response is
maintained, and that there are no changes in exogenous factors that could influence HIV
transmission dynamics ‎(Figure 2, by sub-population). ‎

Note: Graph shows estimated new HIV infections per year.‎


However, the wider context of the HIV epidemic in Niger is changing: ‎
i.     Urbanization: Niger’s‎epidemic‎has‎always‎been‎of‎an‎urban‎type,‎‎      and the urban population
       is growing at 6.2% (significantly higher than the national average of 3.9%). ‎  Urbanization is
       often linked to risk behaviours outside the controlling village context, to disrupted ‎
                                                                                             family life,
       poor living conditions and transactional sex for survival or for affording modern ‎ consumer
       goods, especially among young females.‎
ii.    Rapid economic growth: The changing wealth levels, with economic growth at 11%, is
       associated with higher income levels and the availability of disposable income, which among
       Niger’s‎men is ‎
                      linked to buying sex (note that HIV is now concentrated in among the
       wealthiest 40% ‎ of men).‎
iii. Mining sector development: The development of the petroleum and mining sector has
     ‎
     resulted in sex workers (SWs) relocating from Niamey―where‎there‎are specialist HIV
     services‎available‎for‎them―to the mining zones and petrol fields. The availability of jobs,
     infrastructure development and ‎  growing economic opportunities encourage migration and
                                                   HIV‎(survey‎data‎show‎a‎clear‎link‎between‎men’s‎
     mobility, which also create risk contexts for ‎
     sexual risk behaviors to mobility and being ‎away from home).‎
iv. Low literacy: Meanwhile, a key factor for protection from HIV risk―school education―has
    ‎
    stagnated in Niger, largely due to the very rapid increase in children of school going age. In
    2012, HIV ‎
              prevalence was lowest in the most educated population segment (secondary
    education or above) ‎with only 0.1% of men and 0.2% of women being HIV infected.‎
These evolving contextual factors could put past HIV gains at risk if concerted HIV prevention
        are not maintained.‎

Recommended policy actions ‎
1. The government must continue to undertake strategic HIV monitoring activities,
   especially in key ‎ populations at higher risk—this includes female sex workers (FSWs),
   sex work clients in the mining areas and young urban ‎     females. Only if HIV prevalence in
   these populations is well tracked can the risks of mining industries, urban and economic
   development be assessed and specific interventions be designed. There is a necessity for
   vigilance and for excellent strategic information on the epidemic dynamics. HIV ‎
                                                                                   prevalence in
   sex workers should be a key performance indicator of the HIV program.‎

2. Social sector investments, especially those in the education sector and in family
   ‎
   planning/reproductive health will greatly benefit the HIV program and should be seen
               part of a broad and powerful response toward mitigating future HIV risks—
   as integral ‎
   improved literacy, better ‎employment opportunities for females, reduced fertility and better
                               closely linked with the future trajectory of the epidemic. ‎
   reproductive health are all ‎


3.                             Retrospective
                               ‎            impact and cost-effectiveness of past
                               HIV investments
Conclusion: Past HIV investments have contributed significantly to the decline in HIV
incidence ‎

The impact of historical HIV expenditures on the prevention of new HIV infections was estimated
using the Optima model. It was estimated that HIV spending from 2007–12 averted close to 3,900
‎
‎
infections in those six years (Figure 3). Furthermore, the downstream impact of these prevented
‎
infections was much larger, since secondary HIV infections and onward transmission were ‎       also
averted. By 2035, the spending from 2007–12 will have averted an estimated total of 12,600
‎
infections, at a cost of Euro 3,500 (USD 4,700) per infection if only HIV program spending is
considered, and Euro 4,600 (USD 6,200) if all HIV spending—including management and
‎
coordination costs—is included. This is slightly higher than some cost-effectiveness ratios in other
‎
‎
countries (e.g., men who have sex with men (MSM) program in Thailand, ‎     USD 1,600–USD 6,400,
and Vietnam HIV program USD 890–USD 1,200 per infection averted), suggesting that it might be
possible in future to implement the same programs ‎     at a lower cost without compromising their
effectiveness.

relationships between funding, HIV outcomes, and program coverage (Annex ‎
x   Niger’s‎HIV‎response: Targeted investments for a healthy future



Based on the common understanding of how epidemics spread from core groups, second-order
‎
investment benefits are particularly high when HIV programs target high HIV incidence
populations ‎like FSWs. The modeling findings suggest that incidence reductions were indeed
greatest in FSWs ‎ (from 3.5% annual HIV incidence in 2000 to 1.1% in 2012), but also had knock-
on effects in ‎ other populations like sex-work clients and even in low-risk populations. In the
‎
absence of other major programs being implemented, it can be reasonably assumed that HIV
incidence reduction in FSWs after 2000 can in part be attributed to the regional STI/HIV program
in 9 West African countries (SIDA-3) and the Multisectoral STI/HIV/AIDS project 2003-2009
supported by the World Bank1. However, no evaluation of SIDA-3’s‎impact‎has been conducted in
Niger.‎

Recommended policy action
3. Strengthen capacity for the country to undertake analytical work on the impact and
   cost-effectiveness ‎   of HIV investments through partnerships and capacity building—
   Niger disposes a large body of ‎   HIV monitoring data and needs to prioritize evaluation and
   learning to strive for high-‎
                               impact, high-return HIV strategies in a resource-constrained health
   funding environment. Cost-‎    effectiveness and return-on-investment data build powerful
   economic arguments for HIV ‎      investments, and increase our understanding of the best
   investment choices in a changing epidemic context.‎


4.       Increasing
         ‎          the future impact of Niger’s HIV
         response—“More health for the money”— through
         more efficient allocation of funds to priority
         ‎
         programs
Conclusion:‎Niger’s‎HIV‎response‎can‎achieve‎more‎value‎for‎money;‎with‎the‎resources‎
already ‎
        committed until 2017, the country can achieve an estimated additional 12%
reduction in HIV ‎
                 incidence if HIV resources are optimally allocated

Better allocation of HIV resources could increase the number of new HIV infections
averted: The ‎  modeling analysis on optimal resource allocation during the NSP period of 2013–17
for best HIV ‎ incidence reduction was based on the amount of funding already acquired by end
2013 for the four ‎  remaining years of the NSP (annual average Euro 4.8 million or USD 6.5
million). Although this ‎
                        amount is lower than the 2012 expenditure of Euro 12.5 million or USD 16.3
million, the optimization ‎
                          predicts that an additional 12% reduction in new HIV infections could be
achieved from ‎  2014–25, if resources were allocated differently than in 2012 (Figure 4).

Note: No spending = a continuation of 2012 spending, and optimized spending at various budget levels ‎   relative to expected funds available,
2014–17; 2012 budget = 2012 expenditure pattern; 100% budget = Euro 4      ‎ .8 m/USD 6.5 m per year, based on acquired funding by end 2013;
                             over time, other costs increase in line with GDP per capita.‎
Drug costs are kept constant ‎


This analysis recommends higher funding allocations for ART, prevention of mother-to-child
transmission (PMTCT) and FSW programs; and lower ‎        allocations for untargeted activities for low-
                                                    management costs forecast‎in‎Niger’s‎resource‎
risk populations (Figure 5). The rapidly escalating ‎
needs model are higher than inflation (currency ‎    inflation at 3% plus population growth at 4%
combined). An efficiency of about Euro 1.7 million ‎  (USD 2.3 million) could be gained from 2014–
17 if management costs grew at the inflation rate only. If the cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)
treatment ‎threshold was raised to 500, an ‎ approximate estimate of additional resources needed
over the four years is 12%. However, this would require more in-depth analysis using ‎         detailed
program data, unit costs and assumptions on delivery models. ‎

An HIV incidence reduction of 50% is only feasible in the longer-term, according to this
analysis ‎
 Halving HIV incidence during the NSP period would be very costly. It is estimated that
   achieving this ‎
                  HIV prevention goal by the end of 2017 would cost Euro 24 million (USD 32.3
   million) per year—500% of ‎  the currently acquired budget of an average of Euro 4.8 million
   (USD 6.5 million) annually from 2014–17- and with optimized program allocations ‎

    In contrast, halving HIV incidence by 2025 is more feasible. It is estimated that this would cost
     Euro ‎5.52 million (USD 7.42 million) per year—115% of the average acquired budget of
     2014–17, and ‎  substantially lower than the total 2012 expenditure of Euro 12.5 million (USD
     16.3 million)‎
Better program (technical) efficiency could save even more funds: there is a large difference
in antiretroviral (ARV) prices between the Global Fund procurement system and the government
tender system. ‎  This is currently not increasing costs by much since most ARVs are purchased by
the Global Fund ‎  system, and only a small volume of ARVs are purchased via the government
system (the small size of ‎ these orders is partly responsible for the higher pricing).‎

Recommended policy actions‎
4. Use the epidemic and programmatic ‎     intelligence and analytical approaches to identify
   savings, efficiencies and higher-impact scenarios, to strive towards better value for
   money in the HIV program—Niger is unlikely to be able to close its NSP resource gap of
   almost Euro 45 million (USD 60 million) ‎  for the four remaining NSP years. However, this
   analysis suggests that a greater impact can be ‎   obtained from optimal resource allocation
   across priority programs, and from data-informed geographical ‎targeting. Resource allocation
   towards the highest risk population—female sex workers—undoubtedly provides value for
   money. Management and coordination costs need to be contained and functions integrated
   with HIV and health administration where possible.

5. Funding needs to be shifted towards ART, PMTCT and FSW programs, and away from
   untargeted ‎activities for low-risk populations, with budget splits depending on total
   resource availability. ‎Based on empirical data and impact modeling, SW-related investment
                           increased to approximately 4% of the annual HIV budget—this is likely
   should be significantly ‎
   to prevent an extra 7,000 new HIV ‎  infections over 10 years (with the already acquired NSP
   resources of Euro 4.8 million/USD 6.5 ‎million annually).

6. Review the government procurement system for ARVs to gain efficiency—although

        ‎                            targeting of priority programs
Conclusion:‎Niger’s‎HIV‎response‎can‎ capitalize better by targeting resources to areas of
         burden and transmission ‎
high HIV ‎                       hotspots

As HIV epidemics contract, data-informed HIV intervention targeting becomes highly important in
order to continue to drive down HIV transmission. Although people on ART are ‎        less infectious
overall (lower viral load), they represent a HIV reservoir that is growing ‎annually as more people
enter the ART program. Some resources must therefore be targeted ‎         towards maximizing viral
suppression in the ART patient population (such as treatment adherence, and ‎        drug resistance
monitoring). This analysis estimated that within six years, the number of people ‎    living with HIV
(PLHIV) in Niamey will increase from under 9,000 to about 12,000, partly due to ‎     ART improving
the life expectancy of PLHIV.‎

About 70% of PLHIV live in one of four regions in the South-West covering only one ‎  quarter of the
country surface area. Agadez and Diffa probably had the lowest PLHIV numbers in ‎              2012
compared to the other regions. Over one half of all PLHIV reside in Niamey, ‎    Dosso or Tahoua
with circa 26% of these living in Niamey (according to the 2012 study). In the scale-up of PMTCT,
a phased approach may be ‎    recommended, considering the regional distribution of PLHIV and the
urban nature of the epidemic. ‎   Data support a PMTCT first phase scale-up in the South-West
portion of the country and in towns. ‎

With HIV prevalence at 17% in female sex workers compared to HIV prevalence of below 1% in
most ‎populations, targeting areas where sex work takes place is a prerequisite to the success of
HIV ‎prevention in Niger (towns, petrol/mining zones, infrastructure construction areas, etc.). There
is ‎
   an estimated 2.3 million unprotected commercial/paid sexual acts each year in Niger
(compared to ‎  over 200 million regular sexual acts). Condom promotion needs to prioritize this
programming gap first, given the disproportionate contribution of sex work to ongoing HIV
transmission. ‎

Epidemiological data from prisons suggest that there is increased HIV transmission in these
settings with HIV ‎prevalence levels at 2.7%, thus targeting HIV and health resources toward
prison populations remains important. There is a ‎  lack of data to effectively direct services that
target men who have sex with men (MSM), however, it is possible to improve the targeting of
male sex workers as a first step. The UNAIDS Investment Framework recognizes that targeting
key ‎ populations is done in the larger context of reducing stigma and discrimination2.‎ The
‎
strengthening of an enabling environment is necessary to support the effectiveness and efficiency
of program activities which can be affected by barriers to service use due to social ‎
‎                                                                                         exclusion,
marginalization and criminalization of key populations.‎

8. HIV testing and case identification must be targeted where yield is likely to be high—

Conclusion: Sex work-related interventions have lacked focus and investment, despite
their ‎
      epidemiological, cost-prevention and humanitarian importance. Improvements in the
implementation of FSW ‎ programs woud increase quality, coverage and reach.‎

An estimated 28,000 FSWs operate in Niger, but there is consensus that the real number may be
‎
higher, with hidden SWs remaining uncounted (mapping in four regions counted a mere‎ ‎          3,200
FSWs, illustrating the challenge of understanding the true size of this heterogeneous ‎  population).
FSWs are 43 times more likely to be HIV-infected than females in the general ‎      population—the
previous sections have made it clear that HIV prevention services must focus on ‎               these
populations. According to expenditure statistics, less than 1% of HIV expenditure was for sex
‎
work-related interventions. Budget optimization with Optima suggests that if about 4% of the
annual budget could be spent on comprehensive, quality‎ services‎ for‎ FSWs,‎ Niger’s‎ future‎ HIV‎
‎
‎
incidence,‎ AIDS‎ morbidity‎ and‎ mortality‎ could‎ be‎ minimized‎ and‎ the‎ Government’s‎ HIV‎ policy‎
objectives could be achieved.‎
‎

In the past, especially within the regional SIDA-3 project, FSW HIV prevention service provision
and ‎medical follow-up was provided through specialized, adapted services. One such service site
has ‎remained, and is in Niamey, and while integration and mainstreaming of services for key
populations is a ‎reasonable policy, it has not worked well in Niger. Only 41% of FSW in Niamey
are enrolled in the ‎  “Suivi‎ medical”,‎ and‎ these‎ are‎ predominantly‎ foreigners‎ who‎ enroll for
administrative purposes. ‎ The‎variation‎in‎FSW’s‎HIV‎prevalence‎in‎different‎geographical‎areas,‎
ranging from zero to 31%, is ‎  largely unexplained, although proximity to Nigeria seems to be an
important risk factor. A history of ‎
                                    violence is associated with highly increased HIV risk (32%), and
perpetrators can even include the police who should protect FSWs. Well over half of surveyed

FSWs are divorced (others are widowed or separated), pointing to sex work as a livelihood option
                                     and family support.‎
for women who are lacking protection ‎

Importantly, sex for money or gifts is not limited to FSWs but may be a frequent transaction
among other female key population members, as well as among young females who practice
transactional sex. Female defense ‎   and security personnel are many times more likely to be HIV
positive than their male colleagues ‎ (7.7% versus 0.1%4),and the same increased HIV risk applies
to female teachers, prisoners and ‎  labor migrants. Male circumcision partially protects men from
infection, while women ‎    experience much higher biological vulnerability to HIV. Female
circumcision (2% of adult females have experienced ‎       genital mutilation, according to the Niger
Demographic and Health Survey [NDHS] 2012) can promote the spread of ‎          infections through the
use of contaminated objects, and an increased risk of bleeding during sex ‎     can amplify the risk of
HIV transmission. The increased prevalence of herpes in women who have ‎            undergone female
genital mutilation could also add to the risk of HIV infection.5

FSW data attest to a very rapid acquisition of HIV once females enter the sex industry, with ‎
                                                                                             street
prostitution less safe than brothel-based sex work. Male sex work is little documented, and MSM
are the least understood key population in Niger. Over half of surveyed MSM get paid for sex.
‎
Some MSM are married and some identify as bisexual. The MSM epidemic—of unknown scale—
is not ‎selfcontained and MSM related transmission extends through sexual networks to the
general ‎population.‎

This analysis shows that SWs are a population which is currently underserved and concludes that
more investment is required for SW-related interventions. An investment toward preventing not
only direct ‎
            but also downstream infections linked to sex work is expected to have a large impact
       future course of the HIV epidemic, as well as on the human and financial cost of AIDS. ‎

Recommended policy actions
10. In order to guide programming and targeting of SW interventions, better strategic
    information on ‎ FSW, female key population members, and high risk (soliciting) MSM
    should be collected—‎   ongoing FSW mapping and site identification work needs to be further
    strengthened by taking a ‎ programmatic science approach. More needs to be known about
    FSW typologies, the ‎ venue profiles where they find clients, hard-to-reach FSW, sexual risk
    behaviors—including ‎ transactional sex among female defense and security personnel, female
    teachers, female ‎prisoners and female labor migrants (through oversampling of females in
    bio-behavioral surveys ‎and qualitative studies), as well as young urban women.‎

11. The government, in partnership with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the
    private sector, should offer evidence-informed ‎    services that meet the specific needs of
    sex workers—an important part of improved service ‎   provision is demand creation among SW
    through strategies such as specially trained peer ‎
                                                      educators who can gain access to harder-to-

                                      young age, working conditions as clandestines, and lack of
    protection). The ongoing scale-up of SW ‎  interventions must work towards ambitious service
    targets that extend beyond the numbers of SWs ‎     known at the outset, reflecting successful
    demand creation and outreach to clandestine SWs. ‎        Police and security forces play an

7.        Improving
          ‎           the efficiency of implementing Niger’s
          antiretroviral treatment program through ‎better
          integration with health services
Conclusion: Access to ART is insufficient and AIDS-mortality is high; shifting resources to
the ART ‎
        program will reduce future AIDS deaths and disease, and new HIV infections

By the end of 2012, the estimated ART coverage was 13% in children and 51% in adults,
           that about 14,000–15,000 HIV infected Nigerians who were eligible were not receiving
indicating ‎
ARVs. ART coverage is estimated at only 45% in men and 57% in women suggesting that men
are more ‎likely to miss out on treatment. This is also ‎
                                                        linked to very low HIV testing rates in men of
2–3%, and some demographics indicate that HIV testing is ‎      particularly low despite elevated HIV
prevalence levels in —men in Diffa and Dosso, and in men above 30 ‎      years of age.‎

Low ART access leads to AIDS deaths. The rapid decline of HIV prevalence from 2006 to 2012,
‎
particularly in urban men (1.3% to 0.5%), and rural women and men (0.5% to 0.2%, and 0.6% to
‎
0.3% respectively) indicates high AIDS mortality. In countries with high ART access and retention,
HIV ‎prevalence tends to stabilize or even increase—although decreases in HIV prevalence are
‎
desirable, they should not arise from excessive AIDS mortality. Anecdotal evidence suggests that
people delay accessing ART, especially men, who contact health ‎
‎                                                                   services less frequently. There
may be challenges to the retention of ART patients (no documentation identified), and ‎        ARV
availability at decentralized level has not always been maintained (while there is a surplus of
ARVs at central level). Many ART patients will experience food insecurity and malnutrition—the
‎
result of a vicious cycle of no farming, no harvest—which can impair drug adherence and
treatment ‎ success. According to Spectrum, an estimated 3,360 PLHIV died in 2012 due to an
AIDS-related ‎  cause, and the total cumulative number of AIDS deaths in Niger up to end 2012 is
estimated at ‎ 68,730.

The insufficient scale-up of the ART program and weaknesses in HIV case finding have to be
seen ‎in‎the‎context‎of‎Niger’s‎health‎system.‎Over‎half‎of‎all‎residents‎live‎outside‎the‎ 5 kilometer
‎
catchment area of access to health facilities (however, in Niamey nearly all residents are within a
‎ kilometer-5catchment area). Newborn, nutritional and maternal causes such as diarrheal
diseases, lower ‎  respiratory infections, and protein-energy malnutrition as well as several
communicable diseases ‎    including malaria, meningitis, measles and tetanus, remain the top
causes of morbidity and ‎  mortality. Health sector capacity is insufficient, compounded by the fast
population growth which doubles the population every 23 years. However, AIDS (and malaria) are
the leading ‎emerging diseases in Niger according to the comprehensive international Burden of
Disease Study, ‎and therefore requires attention. ‎

The Optima analysis supports a 50% HIV budget allocation to the ART program (which includes
‎
ARVs, laboratory monitoring, psychological and nutrition support, out-patient and in-patient
‎
services), almost double the 26% allocation in 2012. While the roll-out of the ART program must
be ‎
   national, a phased scale-up may be justified given the large concentration of PLHIV in four
        (circa 70% of PLHIV in the four regions covering a quarter of the country surface area).‎

Recommended policy actions
12. More resources need to be allocated to the ART program to optimize the impact of
    treatment ‎on HIV incidence and DALYs—allocating half of the budget to the ART program
    would allow for investment in program infrastructure (like diagnostic equipment); human
    resources (including ‎capacity building, and task shifting activities); supply chain strengthening
    (including management ‎    information systems, and ARV prescription decentralization); and
    patient and adherence monitoring ‎   through community-based health workers. ART program
    efficiency will be greatly improved through closing these resource gaps and through better
    data along the ART cascade‎    .‎

13. With more investment in the ART program, pre-ART services could be innovated and
    strengthened, and the treatment threshold could be raised to initiate more PLHIV on
    treatment, ‎ especially men—diagnosing people as HIV positive and then losing them again
    until their health has ‎
                           seriously deteriorated is a great inefficiency, and contributes to ongoing
    HIV transmission. There ‎  are good linkage and retention practices in pre-ART care6 that are
    documented internationally which can be‎applied‎to‎Niger’s‎context. Gradually switching from
    the prevention of mother-to-child-transmission (PMTCT) options A and B to option B+ will
    ‎
    further help scale up ART.‎

14. Institute systematic monitoring of CD4 count at treatment initiation, separately for men
    and ‎women, to track progress in the implementation of treatment policy (threshold 350
    or potentially ‎500)—although CD4 capacity is still being strengthened (and is a priority
    action), ‎
             systematic recording of this key ART access indicator must be started when CD4
    counting is ‎done at treatment initiation, and the indicator must be used for performance
    monitoring (an ‎ increasing CD4 count at initiation shows earlier and better access to
    treatment). Resolving the technical bottlenecks that are associated with low testing numbers,
    such as handling the test machine capacity, is an ‎
                                                      important efficiency improvement.

15. Provider-initiated counseling and testing must be selectively scaled up for HIV case
    finding—this ‎primarily concerns services for STI clients, where HIV yields are higher than in
    the ‎
        general population (TB clients are already being tested for co-infection). Once a person
    has been identified as ‎   HIV positive, post-test counseling should focus on getting a
    commitment from the client for periodic ‎ monitoring visits so that the client can be initiated on
    treatment in agreement with ART eligibility ‎  guidelines (a higher CD4 treatment threshold
                                                   PLHIV earlier).‎

Conclusion: Elimination of vertical transmission is challenged by poor health-seeking

Approximately half of all new HIV infections are vertically transmitted. Niger ‎

and elsewhere. ‎

Achieving the virtual elimination of MTCT in Niger has considerable challenges—the MTCT rate
needs ‎to be reduced from the rate of approximately 27% in 2013 to below 5%. Although Niger
had 651 ‎PMTCT sites in 2012 and saw positive ‎  growth in the use of antenatal services (CPN1 at
83%) and assisted deliveries (29%), less than half of pregnant mothers in need of ARVs received
the drugs in 2013. HIV‎diagnosis of exposed infants is almost nonexistent at 1%. There are many
missed family ‎
              planning (FP) opportunities that are also missed opportunities to reduce the vertical
transmission of HIV. ‎More than one-third of all non-users of FP visited a health facility over the
past 12 months, but did not discuss FP during that visit. These missed FP opportunities are
especially a concern in women ‎     aged 30–44 years (who have an elevated HIV prevalence
compared to younger women), and women living in ‎   Niamey (female HIV prevalence of 1.5%).‎

The success of PMTCT in Niger relies heavily on improving the demand of pregnant women for
maternal ‎and neonatal health services. The causes of the high number of those lost-to-follow-up
    multifaceted and complex: many women‎are‎dependent‎on‎their‎husband’s‎approval‎to‎seek‎
are ‎
and ‎ obtain health services; cultural reasons can prevent ‎     both men and women from seeing
pregnancy as a “disease”‎state‎that‎warrants‎the‎‎   intervention of health care providers; the stigma
of being HIV positive can prevent women from ‎        getting their HIV test results or obtaining the
treatment for themselves or their baby; and the cost of ‎     accessing antenatal care and assisted
delivery—costs can be overwhelming even if is just for transport or a lost day ‎         of work, and
especially if the perceived benefits are seen as limited. One field study on ‎        maternal health
services in Niger also noted that staff attitudes towards patients were often ‎demeaning.7

The Government has reviewed the PMTCT situation in detail and identified inefficiencies,
‎
constraints and priority actions. One of the main delivery solutions was a scheme where female
health workers were assigned at the community level (“médiatrices‎communautaires”), such as for
example, in the Arlit district. The recent positive Rwanda experience that involved 15,000
‎
community health workers suggests that investing in linking people to services provides direct
‎
health outcomes. Community based workers and community networks can play a role in
information, ‎
             education, demand creation, mobilization and in the provision of basic services.

The optimization analysis suggests that increased investment in PMTCT will help minimize new
HIV ‎infections, AIDS deaths and disease. Spending 18%–20% of the HIV budget on PMTCT
instead of 11% as spent in 2012, will lead to best reductions in vertically transmitted infections
and avert the maximum amount of‎ ‎    DALYs. It is estimated that an additional 1,400 vertical HIV
infections could be averted over a ten year period if ‎  the currently acquired NSP resources were
optimally allocated. Using the Option B+ PMTCT ‎     regimen could help simplify the service cascade
and improve the uptake of PMTCT by removing ‎      the need for CD4 counting for treatment initiation.
By decreasing the number of ‎   necessary interactions with the health system, it theoretically helps
to scale-up PMTCT (and would directly ‎        contribute to ART targets). The simplified infant
prophylaxis protocol and a unified regimen that ‎ can be used for the entire adult population would
also simplify procurement and supply chain ‎  management.8 Of course, switching to Option B+ also
entails significant financial and ‎
                                  organizational investments that need to be thoroughly assessed
and costed. ‎

    family planning—advancement in PMTCT largely relies on progress in the provision of
    maternal, newborn and child health ‎ (MNCH) and family planning. Unless more women use
    antenatal care (ANC) and delivery services, PMTCT cannot ‎       be significantly scaled up.
    Therefore PMTCT resources must contribute to the broader attempt toward ‎    providing better
    services and building greater demand. A particularly promising shared resource are
    ‎
    community-based health workers (médiatrices) who are tasked with the identification of risk
    ‎
    pregnancies, and who accompany women, children and families enrolled in treatments
    ‎
    (PMTCT regimens, ART, FP, tuberculosis [TB], etc.). The Malawi experience has shown that
    peer support and ‎ defaulter-tracking are important for minimizing loss-to-follow-up, as are
    extended counseling and ‎   ongoing support of women, and effective use of the patient
                    9
    monitoring data.‎

17. Use the knowledge about the barriers, bottlenecks and inefficiencies of the current
    PMTCT ‎  intervention to make strategic investments, including a phased introduction of
    the B+ option—more evaluation of demand creation strategies in‎ MNCH and FP need to be
    done, bearing in mind ‎ that intervention effects will be heterogeneous10‎ (e.g., by literacy level,
    order of pregnancy, and previous service-user‎ ‎     experience). Regular quality monitoring of
    services is essential toward retaining women ‎     during antenatal care and throughout their
    reproductive years. PMTCT option A should be ‎      completely phased out in favor of the more
    effective option B. Pilot studies of the B+ regimen—a promising ‎  option in settings with scarce
    CD4 cell count testing capacity and high fertility—should be ‎         conducted together with
    systematic and ongoing reviews of retention, using medical record data. Option B+ ‎        needs to
    be fully costed, including community-based activities deemed necessary to make ‎            life-long
    treatment of HIV-infected mothers work over time.‎

18. The PMTCT program must expand its integration at all levels—this study found that
    PMTCT ‎    services would benefit from a higher level of integration with other services and
    initiatives, ‎
                 especially at the community level: to improve access to services for women; better
    facilitate referrals and ‎ follow-up between services; increase efficiency across the PMTCT
    cascade; and for health supervision services‎ to fully integrate PMTCT into the broader
    supervision visits. Finally, an ‎ improved and integrated supply chain management for ARVs
    and for HIV test reagents is required ‎   to ensure ANC clients can be diagnosed for HIV and
    treated at all PMTCT sites without ‎ interruptions due to shortages. ‎

9.       Financing the future HIV response in Niger
Conclusion: There is not sufficient funding for implementing the national HIV strategy,
however, the total ‎
                   funding needed is not as much as anticipated provided that the funds
are directed to the most ‎    allocatively-efficient programs, that the programs are
implemented in the most technically efficient manner, and that they are integratedwithin‎ ‎
the broader health systems ‎

Even if HIV resources were optimally allocated (as suggested in 2.), a financing gap would still
remain. For‎Niger’s‎NSP,‎the‎Government’s‎anticipated‎financing‎shortfall will be Euro 44.9 million
(USD 60.4 million) for the remaining 2014–17 period. This implies that by December 2013, only
‎
35% of the total ‎
                 NSP-projected funding for the four year period was committed from either internal
   external sources. But, if funding was optimally allocated, the Government ‎
or ‎                                                                            may not need this
amount of funding in the future.‎

In the past and from 2007 to 2011, 90% of the financing response to HIV was driven by external
funding, with the most important sources in recent years being the Global Fund, UNICEF, the
Government of Germany (Kreditanstalt ‎     für Wiederaufbau KfW) and World Bank. In 2012, the
share of external funding declined to 67% ‎  and public spending dramatically increased through a
World Bank IDA loan, which is ‎counted‎asGovernment of Niger funding. The average costs of the
national HIV response (2007–12 data) ‎  was Euro 9.7 million (USD 12.6 million), or 0.24% of GDP,
                                                           years.‎
bearing in mind that there were large fluctuations between ‎

Annual spending under the provisional NSP budget and the 2012 resource needs model is
‎
projected to increase steeply from Euro 10.5 million (USD 14.1 million) in 2014 to Euro 20.2
million ‎(USD 27.2 million) in 2017. The scaling-up of HIV prevention and treatment envisaged
under these ‎ provisional investment plans would result in a steep decline in HIV incidence and
mortality, and an ‎ increasing number of people on ART. The decline in HIV incidence would
‎
contribute substantially toward containing the long-term costs of the HIV program. It is estimated
that one new HIV ‎ infection in 2013 results in a future cost of about Euro 2,500 (USD 3,400). This
                        level of mortality on ART. HIV incidence declines in 2013–17 alone would
cost will vary with the ‎
result in reduced ‎ long-term spending commitments equivalent to a saving of Euro 6.3 million
(USD 8.4 million). The ‎ estimates in this analysis imply that—in addition to the obvious health and
social gains—the ‎ financial savings achieved by increased HIV investments per the current NSP
would offset about ‎ one-third of the additional costs of the scaling-up of prevention and treatment
efforts. While the ‎costs of the national HIV response per the NSP are projected to increase in
absolute terms, the ‎ costs are expected to peak at 0.29% of GDP in 2017, and decline to 0.22% of
GDP in 2030. ‎

Private out-of-pocket health spending is relatively large, considering the low level of wealth in
‎
Niger. In 2011, health spending accounted for 5.1% of GDP (Euro 225 million or USD 303 million)
(see Figure 6), which was dominated by the public sector (57% of total) and private out-of pocket
spending ‎ (39% of total). Out-of-pocket spending accounted for 95% of household health
spending. About ‎one-third of all health spending in Niger is externally financed (which is a lower
external dependency than ‎HIV spending). ‎

Figure 6.   Health expenditure by source of financing, Niger (1995–2011)‎




In 2011, spending on HIV care and treatment accounted for about 2.7% of public health spending
‎
(1.6% of total health spending), which is a considerable share given the many competing
          needs of Niger’s‎health‎sector.‎A‎recent‎World‎Bank‎report‎on‎financing‎for‎‎

Recommended policy actions‎
19. Review the NSP budget in the light of this analysis and acquired HIV funding—it is
    ‎
    recommended that budget adjustments be made to ensure financing of high impact
    ‎
    interventions. The Government should plan for budget adjustments now in 2014, identify
    savings and ‎alternative financing mechanisms, and plan for a gradual decrease in ‎
                                                                                      funding of
    HIV interventions which have low epidemic impact.‎

20. Evaluate alternative funding sources especially those that generate permanent
    resource streams and leverage the private sector—the feasibility and potential revenue
    from additional resource ‎streams should be investigated, for example: intensify private sector
    mainstreaming (comprehensive ‎     HIV/AIDS workplace programs initiated by HIV business
    coalition members); explore growing the ‎ existing social health insurance (SHI) further, where
    appropriate, to create fiscal capacity by shifting expenditure ‎  from the Government budget
    (almost 3% of Niamey residents are already members of a SHI); ‎        reinforcing public sector
    mainstreaming; and other measures. The results based financing (RBF) scheme planned for
    the ‎health sector represents an important opportunity to ensure financing for ARV-based
    ‎
    interventions, and to stimulate both demand and supply (see Burundi ‎  experience).‎

21. The burgeoning private sector is creating tax revenue (but also new or increased risk
    contexts), so the ‎
                      Government should consider reinvesting a percentage of these fiscal
    revenues into HIV and health ‎programs—this process has started, and current analysis
    demonstrates the importance of a ‎ predictable and sustainable resource base for HIV

       increase domestic financing could be investigated to sustain the HIV response.‎

22. Integrate HIV/AIDS into any future health schemes such as Results Based Financing
    (with PMTCT and ‎   ART in the essential service package), or any future Universal Health
    Coverage scheme—while ‎     HIV/AIDS is not a leading cause of burden of disease in Niger, it is

Section 1. Introduction
What is the context of this analysis?‎
Niger’s‎ morbidity‎ and‎ mortality‎ statistics‎ are‎ still‎ dominated‎ by‎ communicable‎ diseases‎ while‎
there ‎
      is, until now, a relatively low burden of disease attributable to non-communicable diseases.
The ‎macroeconomy is experiencing positive development, however, a large part of ‎        the population
are still living in poverty (56% were living on less than USD $1.25/day in 2008). The majority of the
population has poor access to health facilities (53% live further than 5 kilometers from a health
service). 40% of all health spending is out-of pocket, despite the low income levels of most
people.

Despite Niger being a low HIV prevalence and comparatively low HIV/AIDS burden country,
HIV/AIDS is an emerging and significant cause of DALYs in recent years —see Figure 7 ‎
‎

    The only rapidly growing cause of DALYs between 1990 and 2010, other than HIV/AIDS, was
     ‎
     malaria ‎

    TB is still a public health problem. However, latest World Health Organization (WHO)
     statistics show a falling incidence trend of 104/100,00012.

2    Niger’s‎HIV‎response: Targeted investments for a healthy future



In 2011, HIV/AIDS consumed an estimated 2.7% of public health spending (2011 data), and has
therefore become a significant cause of health expenditure in Niger.‎
‎

At the international level, the HIV funding landscape—and indeed the HIV financing
paradigm—has changed ‎
 After a decade of unprecedented HIV investment, external HIV financing has plateaued
   leading increasingly to domestic resources being expected to sustain and scale-up national
   responses13
             ‎ ‎‎

    Over the last three decades, it has become apparent that structural factors—such as ‎
                                                                                         poverty,
     limited livelihood options, inequality, and violence—as well as inadequacies in the health
     system,‎ have compounded and sustained the HIV epidemic, undermining the effectiveness
     and scale-up of proven ‎HIV interventions14‎

    Concurrently, HIV investments have had spill-over effects that have impacted well beyond
     HIV, having contributed to health sector strengthening and non-HIV outcomes15
                                                                                ‎

    As a consequence, current discussion has shifted from whether an investment is within (or
     ‎
     beyond) the remit of the HIV program, to a broader view on the multiple interactions between
          health, and development outcomes‎
     HIV, ‎

    Beyond 2015, future international efforts will increasingly be directed towards achieving
     maximum ‎  attainable health outcomes equitably and‎ through universal coverage approaches.
     The thought is that effectively embedding ‎
                                               HIV responses into broader national priorities, will
     further encourage ‎domestic ownership and sustainability16
                                                              ‎

    This report adopted some of these new insights by relating Niger’s‎ HIV‎ response‎ and‎
                  the health sector context and its financing, and included the DALY17‎metric in the
     financing to ‎
     optimal HIV ‎resource allocation modeling ‎

Why is this analysis needed?‎
Although HIV is not the major burden of disease in Niger, it is an important emerging source of
disease ‎ burden. Implementing, integrating, and allocating resources more effectively will
potentially save time and money, and free up resources to address other key development
challenges.‎

      DALY (Disability adjusted life years) is a metric which allows comparison across diseases. One DALY can be
      thought of as one lost year of "healthy" life. The method uses disability weights, discounting and age weighting.

Niger’s‎HIV‎response‎is‎heavily‎dependent‎on‎external‎funding
 Niger has been heavily reliant on international support, with 95% in 2009, 93% in 2010 and
   2011 and 67% in 2012 of HIV program funds covered by external finance (the decrease in
   2012 is largely due to the World Bank loan)

    The primary source of international funding in Niger has been the Global Fund. However, in
                       Niger’s‎HIV‎expenditure‎was‎ supported by the Global Fund compared to
     2012, only 18% of ‎
     37%–51% in the three years prior to 2012

Niger may face shortfalls in HIV funding during the NSP period
 The African Union Special Summit in Abuja in July 2013 led to a renewed commitment by
   ‎
   Member States to take decisive action toward the elimination of HIV/AIDS by 2030, through
   increased ‎
             access to prevention programs, eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV
                                                                            18

   while keeping ‎

    In line with its commitments,‎Niger’s‎NSP‎2013–17 envisages enacting a service ‎
                                                                                    scale-up to
     meet ambitious HIV service coverage targets, however, the funding that has been acquired‎
     ‎
     falls well short of estimated resource needs

    Niger’s‎Global‎Fund‎support‎is‎based‎on‎the‎Transitional‎Funding‎Mechanism‎until‎2015,‎and‎
     the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) ‎
                                              funding is only assured until 2014. The World Bank
     support project 2012–16 focuses its ‎investments in specific geographical and service areas
     (prevention of HIV among sex workers and ‎  their clients, HIV testing and treatment, PMTCT,
     as well as management and coordination of the ‎     HIV response, and piloting output-based
     financing of HIV services)

Even though HIV incidence has fallen, AIDS care and support costs are considerable in a
              that has multiple investment priorities ‎
health system ‎
 In 2011, health spending accounted for 5.1% of GDP (Euro 225 million/USD 303 million), and
   about ‎
         one-third of all health spending was externally financed (WHO, 2014)

    HIV care and treatment spending accounted‎for‎about‎2.7%‎of‎Niger’s‎public‎health‎spending‎
        2011‎
     in ‎

    There is an incessant flow of new HIV infections and it is estimated that Niger had 46,910
     ‎
     people living with HIV in 2012 (Spectrum, 2013) and spent Euro 3.38 million (2.22 billion
     CFA/USD ‎  4.41 million) on HIV/AIDS treatment in the same year

    The global goal of eliminating mother-to-child HIV transmission requires a significant scaling
     up of ‎
           HIV services accompanied by intensified sexual and reproductive health interventions,
     community ‎mobilization and rural service deployment‎




18
     In April 2001, heads of state of African Union countries met in Abuja and pledged to set a target toward allocating at
     least 15% of their total annual budget to health. At the same time, they urged donor countries to "fulfil the yet-to-be
     met target of channeling 0.7% of their Gross National Product as official Development Assistance to developing
     countries".
4    Niger’s‎HIV‎response: Targeted investments for a healthy future



Now is the right time to promote a smart and sustained investment into Niger’s‎ HIV
response that strengthens, integrates with, and complements Niger’s‎ broader‎ health‎
priorities
 Globally‎ the‎ notion‎ of‎ “shared‎ responsibility”‎ in funding the HIV response has gained
    momentum. ‎   While the Global Fund has restructured its grant mechanisms towards strategic
    investment ‎for maximum impact, political leaders have agreed to scale up the mobilization of
    domestic ‎resources to strengthen the health system, and ensure diversified and sustainable
                  health (July 2013 Abuja Summit) ‎

       The New Funding Model of the Global Fund is designed to produce a greater impact on the
       three ‎ diseases, to improve funding predictability and reward ambitious vision. Funding
                   is‎ determined‎ by‎ a‎ country’s‎ income‎ level‎and‎ official‎ disease‎burden‎ data.‎ The‎
       eligibility ‎
       level of allocations ‎ are predetermined based on disease burden, income levels and other
       criteria such as previous ‎       grant performance, impact, increasing rates of infection,

       absorptive capacity, and risk.‎ ‎‎

     in 2012, thanks to oil, uranium and agricultural production (International Monetary Fund [IMF]
                                              increased in 2012 relative to 2011, ‎As‎part‎of‎Niger’s‎
     data), and the country’s‎fiscal‎revenues ‎
     current economic strategy, the government intends to ‎    create fiscal space for development
     spending (IMF, April 2013). The new national HIV strategy ‎         emphasizes the need for
     diversified revenue streams to finance the growing HIV response, but ‎      much of this may
     depend on whether HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and support are deemed to be smart
     investments ‎

What were the objectives of the analysis?‎
The overarching objective was to provide the Government of Niger with a comprehensive
‎
investment case analysis of HIV financing needs, and investment opportunities in the context of
‎
burden of disease priorities, health financing and health system strengthening, in order to apprise
a‎HIV response that is efficient, impactful, cost-effective, and financially sustainable.‎

The specific objectives were: ‎

    Understand the broader health priorities and health financing landscape

    Within the health priority context, estimate the impacts, cost-effectiveness and returns on
     ‎
     investment of past HIV expenditure

    Review evidence of HIV implementation efficiencies and determine where efficiency gains
     ‎
     could be made to save costs, or scope increased without compromising quality‎

    Provide an integrated analysis of how, during the ‎current NSP, HIV financing can be best
     allocated in a way that minimizes HIV incidence, AIDS morbidity and mortality, and reach the
     2017 epidemic/health impact targets ‎

    Link the evidence on allocative and programmatic efficiency and intervention effectiveness to
     an analysis ‎ of‎ thefinancial sustainability of the HIV response, based on domestic fiscal
     resources and ‎evolving availability of external funding

    Determine what the long-term financial consequences and savings of HIV interventions in
     Niger are, and ‎
                    potentially what future health care costs can be saved through different policy
                                makers‎
     scenarios, to guide policy-‎

Using the Optima model, the analysis (see below) posed the following questions:‎

1.   What‎is‎the‎cost‎of‎meeting‎Niger’s‎2017‎coverage‎targets?‎

2. How much money is required to reduce HIV ‎
                                            incidence by 50% in the mid-term, if allocated
   optimally among the basic programs?‎

3. With the available 2014–17 budget, what is the optimal allocation among the basic HIV
   programs for best reduction in HIV incidence and DALYs over that period, including follow-on
                 2025? ‎
   effects until ‎

      a.   Could accelerated ART scale-up contribute to the 2017 goal? ‎

      b.   Could a change in PMTCT protocol to B+ contribute to the 2017 goal?‎

What methods were used?‎
    A Desk review of available data and literature was conducted, comprising: HIV resource
     tracking data (NASA); ‎ National health account data; macroeconomic data; HIV prevalence
     and sexual behavior reports; ‎
                                  Spectrum estimations; data from the Resource Needs Modeling;
     reports on key populations; HIV ‎
                                     policy documents; and HIV program implementation data

    Optima (formerly Prevtool), a mathematical model developed by the University of ‎ New South
     Wales (UNSW) and the World Bank (WB) for estimating HIV incidence in sub-populations
     was used to calculate the HIV impact and ‎   cost-effectiveness of HIV spending; and optimal
     resource ‎allocation toward achieving best results in the prevention of new HIV infection and
     HIV-related morbidity and ‎mortality—see Annex 1 for details ‎

    Implementation of a financial commitment analysis that has three building blocks: (1) an
     ‎
     epidemiological component; (2) a costing framework for projecting the costs of the national
     response ‎ to HIV; and (3) an economic framework to estimate the costs incurred by new
     infections. The ‎
                     epidemiological component is harmonized with Spectrum for consistency. The
     costing framework projects the costs of the national response to HIV/AIDS through
     calculating the epidemiological estimates and specified coverage rates and the number of
     people ‎receiving HIV/AIDS services. ‎
                                          Unit costs are informed by past expenditure patterns (as
     documented in the national AIDS spending assessment [NASA] report), budget ‎       data, and
     data from the Resource Needs Model—see Annex 2 for details

    Monetary amounts were expressed in Euros, using the fixed exchange rate of 1 Euro =
                  and using 503.1 for CFA/USD ‎
     655.957 CFA, ‎

How are the study findings presented in this report?‎
    The Executive summary presents the main findings by theme and provides the full
     conclusions and ‎
                     recommendations that are derived from this analysis. The recommendations
     cover eight areas: (1) ‎
                            Epidemic dynamics; (2) Impact and cost-effectiveness of past HIV

                                                   treatment program; (7) Improving the efficiency of
    the prevention of mother-to-child-transmission ‎    program; and (8) Financing the future HIV
    response in Niger

   Section 1 (Introduction) presents the context and rationale of the analysis, the objectives and
    the ‎
        methodological approach taken

   Section 2 (Development context, health priorities and health system challenges in Niger)
    ‎
    summarizes the economic and human development state of affairs, national development

                    services.‎
    reach of health ‎

   Section 3 (The state of the HIV epidemic) reviews the epidemic situation, course and drivers,
    and ‎the distribution of HIV across population strata. Section 3 provides a brief
    characterization of key ‎ populations with population sizes and locations, and provides
    comments on risk factors and vulnerability. It ‎
                                                   presents model estimations on HIV incidence
    and sources of new infections.‎

   Section 4 (HIV financing, HIV services and programs, and their efficiency) reviews the data
    on HIV ‎
           expenditure and funding sources, and what these investments have delivered in terms
    of HIV ‎
           program development and scale-up. It reviews service linkage and integration, unit
              service utilization. ‎

   Section 5 (Impacts from past HIV expenditures and best resource allocations in the current
    ‎
    strategic plan period) presents modeling results of the HIV impact and cost-effectiveness of
    six ‎years of HIV investments covering 2007–12. It then presents modeling results for
    optimized ‎resource allocation until 2017, including scenarios for best HIV incidence reduction
    and maximum ‎  number of DALYs averted. The analysis makes assumptions that are based on
    a range of total HIV resources available, while taking savings from possible efficiency gains
    into account.‎

   Section 6 (Financing needs and fiscal space implications of HIV investments) presents
    results from ‎
                 the fiscal model that was applied to Niger. It summarizes the financing needs and
    gaps until 2017, the HIV ‎ prevention and mortality impacts of investments under the current
    NSP, and the longer-term fiscal ‎effects of HIV investments. ‎

           priorities and health system
           challenges in Niger
What is the state of economic and human development?‎
Macroeconomic situation
Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world with a largely agrarian and subsistence-
based ‎economy that is frequently disrupted by extended droughts common to the Sahel
region of Africa
 Niger is landlocked, arid and vast, covering an area of 1,267,000 km2. The closest port is the
            Cotonou (in Benin) about‎ 1,000‎ km‎ away.‎ Thus,‎ most‎ of‎ Niger’s‎ foreign‎ trade‎ is‎
    Port of ‎
                                      transport corridors being Benin,‎Togo‎and‎Côte‎d’Ivoire‎via‎
    conducted overland, with the main ‎
    Burkina Faso ‎

    The economy is dependent on the agro-pastoral sector (40%) and the tertiary service sector
     (43%)‎

    After a year of food shortages, good harvests in 2010 helped the economy recover and grow,
     but this was interrupted by another ‎  period of drought in late 2011. However, growth was
     sustained by sizeable ‎investments in the mining and oil sector ‎

Following the trend in the region, Niger has benefitted from positive economic growth and
‎
increased fiscal revenues thanks to new mineral resources
 Over the past decade, extractive industries have fuelled economic growth in Africa which,
    together with ‎continuous demand from China has inflated export prices.20‎ In‎ 2011,‎ Africa’s‎
    production accounted for ‎three-quarters‎ of‎ the‎ world’s‎ platinum‎ supply,‎ half‎ of‎ its‎ diamonds
                                      of global gold and uranium supplies.21 New exploration has
    and chromium, and up to one-fifth ‎
    identified larger reserves than previously known ‎       which is attracting additional foreign
    investment ‎

    The IMF reported that‎Niger’s‎ economic growth had reached 11% in 2012, thanks to an oil
     project coming on-stream, higher uranium production and a rebound in agricultural harvest.
     Over the ‎next 5 years, average real GDP growth is projected to be 6.3% annually (and at
     3.1% GDP per ‎ capita)—see Table 1

    Fiscal revenues increased in 2012 relative to 2011 but, due to weaknesses in customs and oil
     revenue, were expected to fall short of program targets (IMF, April 2013)‎
     ‎

GDP per capita is on an upward trend, and inflation is below 3%‎
 In 2013, per capita GDP was at Euro 330 or USD 440‎

    Despite fluctuations in farm production, inflation, on average, was under control at 2.1%,
     below the regional limit of 3% ‎
     ‎

    IMF and World Bank (2013) suggest that Niger faces a moderate risk-of-debt distress. Public
     debt ‎has declined since 2006 due to restructuring arrangements obtained from the creditor
     members of ‎  the Paris Club, as part of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the
     Multilateral Debt ‎
                       Relief Initiative. However, over the last few years, public external debt has
     increased due to the ‎financing of large resource extraction projects

    As‎part‎of‎Niger’s‎current‎economic‎strategy,‎the‎government‎intends‎to‎create‎fiscal‎space‎
     for ‎
         development spending while tackling revenue weaknesses, implementing multiple
     measures ‎ to rebuild government deposits, employing structural reforms, improving financial
     development ‎ and maintaining debt sustainability‎

The political and administrative landscape is characterized by a multiparty system and

decentralization
 There are 10 major political parties, a president who is elected by popular vote and a prime
   minister who is appointed by the president. The new constitution was adopted in October
   2010‎

    Niger has established a process of decentralization that has transformed the former ‎

Human development
The Nigerien population, estimated at 17.13 million inhabitants in 2012, continues to grow
at a very ‎rapid rate of 3.9% (average intercensus 10-year rate), with a total fertility index of
7.6 children per ‎ woman in 2012‎
 The rate of demographic growth has remained virtually unchanged in the last 20 years, and at
    that rate, the population is expected to double every 23 years

    In rural areas, women give birth to 8.1 children on average, and in urban areas, 5.6 children
     (NDHS ‎  2012). Zinder and Maradi have exceptionally high indices of 8.5 and 8.4 births per
     woman ‎  respectively. Women with secondary education have on average 3.1 fewer births than
     women ‎  without education

    ‎
     23% of births are spaced at less than 24 months (NDHS 2012)‎

    Women have their first child on average at age 18.6 years, 2.9 years on average after
     ‎
     entering their first union

Poverty levels are improving while living conditions remain challenging
 The World Bank poverty indicator shows a positive trend in poverty reduction with a poverty
   ‎
   headcount ratio of USD 1.25 a day for 43.6% in 2008, down from 65.9% of the population in
   2005, ‎placing Niger above the sub-Saharan Africa average of 49.2% in 2008. However, living
   conditions ‎remain challenging ‎

Recurring food crises mean that many households, especially in rural areas, are severely
affected by ‎under-nutrition
 Food insecurity persists even in years when agricultural production yields a surplus. About
    60% of households ‎ are only able to cover their food requirements for three months. In periods
    of food shortages, half ‎
                            of the population suffers from malnutrition

    The situation is often dramatic for children under the age of five with about four out of ten
     children suffering from ‎chronic under-nutrition and one out of ten children suffering acute
     under-nutrition. During the 2009–10 food ‎     crisis, some 7.1 million people needed food
     assistance ‎

    The principle challenge is to transition from the cyclical management ‎   of recurring food crises
     to more structured responses,‎particularly‎through‎the‎“Nigeriens‎ ‎   nourishing‎Nigeriens”‎(3N)‎
                                                                          development‎
     initiative, for promoting sustainable food security and agricultural ‎

Urban centers are growing and standards of housing and living are mostly inadequate ‎
 The urbanization rate has risen from 16.3% in 2001 to 17.5% in 2005 and to 20.4% in 2010.
   The city of ‎Niamey had 1.3 million inhabitants in 2011, almost double the number in 2001
             22
   (708,000). An ‎ estimated 57% of the country’s‎urban population lives in Niamey‎

    The annual growth rate in urban areas (6.2% per year) is about twice the growth rate for the
     ‎
     population as a whole. If the current trend continues, the urban population will represent more
     ‎
     than 40% of the total population by 2030‎

    The last ten years were marked by progress made in establishing the institutional and legal
     ‎
     framework for urban development in a context of decentralized management. However, major
     ‎
     challenges remain in the area of urban planning, housing and habitat

Sustainable access to drinking water has improved, but remains challenging, especially in
rural and ‎  periurban areas, while there is considerable under-investment of sanitation
facilities in towns
 The‎percentage‎of‎Niger’s‎population‎using‎a‎potable‎water‎source‎increased‎from‎22.3%‎in‎
    1992 to 50.1% in 2008 (National Survey on Budget and Household Consumption)

    Coverage of drinking water needs increased gradually to 66.5% in 2011, a level still well
     below the millennium development goal (MDG) target of 80% in 2015‎

    Principal constraints in this important sector are low investment levels, insufficient
     maintenance ‎efforts, and lack of water, or poor quality water, or water at great depth in some
     areas

    More generally, there is an enormous unmet need for the supply of hygiene and sanitation
     ‎
     services including garbage collection, and disposal of rain and wastewater

Radio is the only medium able to reach a significant proportion of the population
 ‎42% of men and 36% of women listen to the radio at least once a week (61% of urban men
   and 53% ‎ of urban women) (NDHS 2012)‎

    ‎ 3% of men and 59% of women are not using any of the main media (radio, television, print)
     5
     ‎
     regularly (63% of rural men and 66% of rural women)‎

Niger’s‎2012‎human‎development‎index‎(HDI)‎is‎0.304,‎ ranking Niger at 186 in this global
ranking comparison (UNDP, 2013)
 The index is a composite statistic of education, life expectancy, and ‎
                                                                        income indices that rank

   from below 0.2 in 1980 to exceed 0.3 by 2010

HDI/Education: Niger’s‎education‎system‎has‎experienced considerable expansion, but the
average duration ‎ of schooling of adults is only 1.4 years which negatively impacts the

 At the basic cycle 1 level of instruction, the number of pupils increased from 210,000 in 1979
   to 1,901,115 in 2010. ‎
                         The gross attendance rate (GAR) has risen to 76% in 2010/11 with a
   large disparity between boys ‎  (85%) and girls (67%), and between urban (99%) and rural
   (70%) settings

    At the basic cycle 2 level of instruction, the GAR decreases, especially for girls (about 18% in
            and‎there‎are‎large‎disparities‎between‎Niger’s‎regions‎‎
     2010), ‎

    Attendance also remains low in the secondary cycle. The GAR was 4% in 2010, at 5.3% for
          and 2.5% for girls (the average GAR for sub-region countries was 16% in 2006)‎
     boys ‎

    In the NDHS 2012, 60% of males and 80% of females had no education, and only 19.5% of
     males and 8.5% of females had started or completed secondary school

Niger’s‎literacy‎levels‎have consistently been very low, due to low school enrolment and
‎
poor teaching quality, with only a minority of teachers being appropriately trained
 In 2012, 42% of males and 14% of females were classified as literate (NDHS 2012). In rural
   areas, ‎ only 32% of males and 7% of females were literate (70% males and 45% females in
   urban areas). ‎ Niger has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world ‎

   There is an urgent need to stimulate demand among vulnerable groups (girls, women, rural
    ‎

    suitable school ‎infrastructure (IMF April 2013) ‎

The life expectancy at birth indicator, the health component of the HDI, shows a positive
      over the last 30 years‎
trend ‎
 In 1980, life expectancy at birth was 39.5 years in Niger. This increased to 48.3 years in 2000
        55.1 years in 2012‎
    and ‎

The average per capita income (the economic component of the HDI) is moving in a
                    but remains at modest levels ‎
positive direction, ‎
 According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) database, the average
   income has increased from USD 586 in 2000 to USD 701 in 2012 ‎      (expressed as the gross
   national income [GNI] per capita in purchasing power parity [PPP] terms, constant 2005
   international $). The Gini index, that ‎
                                          measures income inequality, was 34.6 in 2008, which is
   similar to Togo and Algeria‎

   Two recent poverty profiles indicated that poverty affects rural areas more than urban areas,
    and ‎
        is more pronounced among the female population. In addition, the phenomenon takes on
    ‎
    endemic dimensions in the Maradi, Dosso, and Tillaberry regions. Although the depth and
    severity ‎
             of poverty, as well as social inequities, declined slightly in recent years, they still
                   levels‎
    remain at high ‎

National development policy framework
There are three principal strategic documents that are relevant‎to‎Niger’s‎future‎HIV‎investment‎
strategy ‎
         and broader social-sector development: the Sustainable Development and Inclusive
Growth ‎Strategy‎ (SDDCI NIGER 2035), the Economic and Social Development Plan 2012–15
(PDES), and the Health ‎Sector Development Plan 2011–15 (PDS).‎

The PDES, adopted in September 2012, is the frame of reference for interventions under
    government’s‎medium-term development agenda and is aligned with the MDGs ‎
the ‎
 It capitalizes on goals and progress attained when implementing the Accelerated
    Development and ‎
                    Poverty Reduction Strategy, the sectoral strategies, and ministerial action
    plans‎

   The PDES forms the basis for the execution of important structural projects, including the
    Kandadji ‎
             hydroelectric dam, the exploitation and processing of coal from Salkadamna mines,
        investment in transport infrastructure ‎
    and ‎

   Improvements in rail and road infrastructure will reduce economic seclusion by better linking
    Niger to its neighboring countries. This progress‎ can‎ put‎ Niger’s‎ successes‎ in‎ reducing‎ the‎
    transmission of HIV epidemic at risk—through creating hotspots where infrastructure is
    located, and intensifying the ‎
                                  movement of people between low HIV prevalence areas and
    areas of higher HIV prevalence‎
12   Niger’s‎HIV‎response: Targeted investments for a healthy future



A core objective of the PDES is the improvement in the standard of living by reducing
             and the growth of the middle class ‎
inequalities ‎
 The middle class is regarded as the most active population in terms of available skilled labor
    ‎
    and increased domestic demand, and in particular, household consumption‎

    However, epidemic statistics also show that ‎ HIV takes hold in the wealthier segments of the
     population first. The association is likely because of the availability of disposable income
     which ‎
           can be used for pleasure-seeking purposes, including commercial sex

The Health Sector Development Plan 2011–15 (PDS) that was adopted in January 2011, has
as its overall ‎objective to contribute toward both the‎ improvement‎ of‎ the‎ population’s‎
health status and the attainment of the health MDGs
 The PDS is based on a detailed analysis of the gaps and weaknesses in the public health
    sector. The ‎
                insufficient coverage of quality SRH services is identified as a major shortfall, and
    urgent ‎
           improvements to services of family planning, maternal health, immunization, integrated
    ‎
    management of the sick child, nutrition and PMTCT, feature prominently

    HIV prevalence is a key outcome indicator in the PDS results framework (target level <0.7%
           has been achieved in 2012 and needs to be maintained)‎
     which ‎

    PMTCT is presented as a high-impact intervention for both maternal/newborn health and
     child ‎
           health, with a 2015 coverage target of 65%

    ART coverage targets are 30% for children and 75% for adults with advanced infections, and
     30% for ‎
             pregnant women identified as seropositive

How much is spent on health and where does the money
come from?‎
    In 2011, health spending accounted for 5.1% of GDP (Euro 225 million or USD 303 million),
     and was dominated by the public sector (57% of total) and private out-of pocket spending
     (39% of total)—‎Figure 8‎

    According to the NDHS 2012, only 2% of men and women are covered by some medical or
     social ‎
            insurance, however, 10% of women in Agadez and Niamey Regions reported having
                    insurance ‎
     medical/social ‎

    Out-of pocket spending accounted for 95% of household health spending‎

    External financing accounted for about one-third of all health spending (WHO, 2014)‎

    Spending on HIV care and treatment accounted for about 1.6% of total health spending, and
     2.7% ‎
          of public health spending in 2011

Note: GDP = gross domestic product.


    According to the PDS, the government intends to develop alternative health financing
     mechanisms, ‎  including the promotion of social health insurance (mutuelles de santé), and
                    support for the elderly and destitute ‎
     social welfare ‎

    The free provision of some services is enshrined in laws: pediatric services for children aged
     0–5 prevention‎ services‎ ;years (family planning, antenatal care); services for patients with
     cancer, TB and ‎ HIV/AIDS; and caesarean section (kit payable). Minimum and maximum
                              are also regulated ‎
     amounts for service fees ‎

    In three regions, child delivery at health facilities is also free of charge (UNFPA support). In
          regions, services for sex workers are free (World Bank support) ‎
     four ‎

What are the health priorities?‎
Burden of disease
Communicable, newborn, nutritional and maternal causes such as diarrheal diseases, lower
‎
respiratory infections, and protein-energy malnutrition remained the top drivers of health loss
in ‎
   Niger (IHME/WB)
 However, in comparison with 46 Sub-Saharan African countries, Niger has progressed
                      burden of disease indicators and regional ranking—see Figure 9 (left and
     significantly in ‎
                                 best, and rank 46 is worst) ‎
     middle; note that rank 1 is ‎

    Niger is the country in the whole region with the lowest percentage of DALYs attributable to
     ‎
     non-communicable diseases (only 18%). However, the STEPS study results suggest that
     there has been a rapid increase ‎in hypertension and diabetes over the last few years (PDS p.
     29) ‎

    Despite progress, Niger had very poor rankings in the regional comparison for years-of-life-
     ‎

     in 2010 ‎

What is the provision and reach of health services in
Niger? ‎
Niger has a policy approach that is focused on primary health care and on
                    system ‎
the district health ‎
The provision of health services is dominated by the public sector (Health Sector Strategy,
      with: ‎
HSS), ‎
 ‎829 Integrated Health Centers, each managed by a nurse, and linked to a total of 2,160
   health posts ‎
                managed by community health workers

     ‎
      33 district hospitals, spread across 42 health districts‎

     ‎ regional public health departments with 6 regional hospitals, 2 regional maternity reference
      9
      centers and 7 mother-child centers ‎
      ‎

     ‎ national reference hospitals and a national maternity reference center, of which 3 are in
      3
      Niamey ‎and one is in Zinder

Approximately 47% of the population lives within 5 kilometers of a health facility (Figure 10)‎
 In rural and in remote areas, transport costs arising from medical emergencies are a
                challenge‎
   considerable ‎

Service provision by a male nurse is regarded as a barrier for females who use health services‎
 However, according to the Ministry of Health (MOH) Human Resources Development Plan
   (2011–20), an increasing ‎percentage of health workers are female—75% of those working
   and aged under 35 years, and 85% of those who are still in training‎

The provision of health services is significantly limited by infrastructure and resource
constraints—‎
            the following coverage levels were reported in 2011:‎
 The geographical coverage of the provision of basic health care was estimated at 71% (HSS)24

      The treatment of malnutrition was estimated at 22% (HSS Annex 1)‎

      Antenatal care consultation CPN4+ was reported at 26%‎

      Anti-parasite treatment of pregnant women was estimated at 21%‎

      Detection and treatment of syphilis during pregnancy was reported at 6%‎

      Assisted delivery was at 29% in 2012 (e-MTCT plan) ‎

      Management of neonatal infection was at 11%‎

      Diagnosis and treatment of STIs was reported at 37%‎

      Directly observed treatment supervision for TB was at 58%‎

Prevalence of modern contraceptive use has increased by about 1% every 5 years among
women living in Niamey, in other urban zones, and in rural areas, but remains low overall
(NDHS ‎1998, 2006, 2012)‎
 Overall, prevalence of modern contraceptives was calculated to be 11% in 2012, and 12% in
   women who were in a union (married or cohabiting). In ‎   urban areas, 27% used modern
   contraceptives compared to 10% in rural areas. Regionally, contraceptive use was highest in
   Niamey (32%) and ‎lowest in Tahoua (6%)‎

      Women obtained modern contraceptives mainly from public sector Integrated Health ‎
                                                                                        Centers
       and health posts, but also from public and private sector pharmacies and mobile chemists

      (especially the pill); condoms played a very minor role in contraception with less than 0.1% of
      women who were ‎    in a union reporting using condoms for contraception (DHS 2012) ‎

     The majority of pill users use products that are socially marketed‎

‎ 0% of all women in a union and aged 15–49 years old expressed a demand for family
3
planning (FP), of which just less than ‎ half (14%) are satisfied (with contraceptive use) and
just over half (16%) are not satisfied (unmet need) ‎(NDHS 2012)‎
 In 2012, there were 3.1 million women between 15–49 years old who were in union (married
    or cohabiting), and ‎
                        an estimated 930,000 of these considered themselves to be in need of FP

     An estimated 498,000 women in a union have an unmet FP need (estimations based on NDHS 2012)

     ‎ 5% of women and 59% of men have heard a message about FP on the radio within the last
      5
      month ‎(only 41% of rural women) (NDHS 2012)‎

There are significant missed opportunities in health care contacts with non-users of family

planning ‎
 ‎ 86% of non-users of FP report not having spoken about FP in the last 12 months, neither with
    a‎
     community health worker nor a clinic staff member

     ‎ 6% of all non-users of FP have visited a health facility in the past 12 months, but have not
      3
      discussed FP during that visit (missed FP opportunity)—see Figure 11 (dotted areas)‎
      ‎

These missed FP opportunities are also missed opportunities to reduce vertical
transmission of HIV ‎ (PMTCT prong of family planning)—see Figure 11 (dotted orange areas

What has been the historical course and scale of the
epidemic?‎
                           Niger’s‎HIV‎epidemic‎is‎contracting. HIV prevalence data from the general population and
                            key ‎
                                populations at higher risk suggest that the epidemic has become more concentrated over
                            the last ‎
                                     ten years. HIV prevalence levels have been decreasing in almost all surveyed
                            populations (Figure ‎
                                                12). Sentinel surveillance data from antenatal care services corroborate
                            the contracting nature of ‎the epidemic, with HIV prevalence in pregnant women declining
                            from 1.7% in 2009 to 0.9% in 2012

                           The epidemic trend is decreasing in both urban and rural areas (Figure 13). HIV
                            prevalence has ‎ declined least in urban females who are five times more likely to be HIV
                            positive than females who live in rural areas (a higher HIV prevalence prevails in Niamey-
                            based females). ART may play a ‎     role in elevated female HIV prevalence, especially in
                            Niamey where there are six ART treatment ‎  centers. In 2012, there were nationally 40% more
                            females on ART than males (Rapport annuel ULSS ‎    2012, T8, page 21) ‎

            Niger shares national borders with several countries which report higher HIV
             prevalence ‎ levels in their populations: Nigeria, Mali, Benin and Burkina Faso. The first
             three listed countries also report higher ‎prevalence levels in female sex workers (UNAIDS
             2013 global report and aidsinfo.com, stat compiler ‎  for DHS data, UNGASS 2012 country
             reports). Cross-border traffic interactions and mobile ‎populations will impact HIV epidemic
             dynamics in Niger

            Near-universal male circumcision (at 99%) contains the epidemic (male circumcision
             data from ‎ 2006 DHS). The chief role of male circumcision toward reducing the transmission
             of HIV from females to ‎ males has been established beyond any doubt. The Niger experience
             supports the claim that very high ‎levels of male circumcision prevent a generalized epidemic,
             despite high risk sexual behaviors and ‎  vulnerability of its people. HIV infections are largely
             contained within females as a result of low transmission ‎   efficiency to their male partners that
             is attributable to male circumcision

            ‎ ccording to model estimations, HIV incidence has decreased over time from the peak
             A
             level of ‎8,470 new HIV infections in 2000 to 1,447 in 2013 (Spectrum 2013). This has
             resulted in reduced HIV ‎
                                     prevalence, that is determined by the incidence of new HIV infections
             and by AIDS-related ‎mortality‎

            Until recently, decreasing HIV incidence has been accompanied by high AIDS-related
                       due to low access to ARV treatment (Figure 14) ‎
             mortality ‎

             -            Since 2004, ART coverage has been scaled up and in 2012 had reached 51% coverage
                                            in children below 15 years of age (Spectrum 2013) ‎
                          in adults and 13% ‎

             -            In 2012, an estimated 3,360 PLHIV died due to an AIDS-related cause, and the total
                          cumulative ‎number of AIDS deaths in Niger up to the end of 2012 is estimated at 68,730.
                          High AIDS-related mortality ‎ is also suggested by successive demographic and health
                          survey (DHS) data, where a large part of HIV prevalent cases in the 2006 ‎ survey are not
                          present in the respective age cohort of the 2012 survey (see also Figure 16) ‎

             -            Conditions like iron deficiency anemia and malnutrition and diseases such as diarrhea

How is HIV distributed in the population of Niger?‎
                       The two key populations that continue to have elevated HIV prevalence are female sex
                                (FSW) and prisoners ‎
                        workers ‎

                       Overall HIV infections are concentrated within certain segments of the female
                        population: in female ‎   sex workers, female members within key populations at higher risk
                        (including female prisoners), and ‎specific female demographics within the general population
                        (see below). Epidemiological data suggest that male circumcision is likely to prevent
                        transmission events from HIV-‎  infected females to males (including from female sex workers
                        [FSWs] to their clients) ‎

Female sex workers (FSWs)
 Niger has an estimated 28,000 FSWs who are concentrated in urban and industrial
   zones such as ‎   mining areas and petrol fields (SSG 2011). Despite declining HIV levels in
   FSWs, the prevalence ‎  differential between FSW and females from the general population is
   still large (17.3% versus 0.4%, ‎see Figure 12). In 2011/12, HIV infection was 43 times more
   likely to occur in FSWs than in females from the ‎    general population, indicating the high
   exposure to unprotected sexual acts of FSWs and their high ‎ susceptibility to HIV infection ‎

                       Survey data suggests a large regional variation of HIV prevalence in FSWs. In 2011,
                        levels were highest ‎in FSWs surveyed in Tahoua and Maradi (31%), followed by Agadez
                        (23%), Zinder ‎(21%) and Niamey (19%). Sex workers in Dosso and Tillaberi were found to
                        have below-average ‎ HIV prevalence levels (16% and 12%), and there were no HIV infections
                        diagnosed in the 71 FSWs ‎ surveyed in Diffa (also 0% in the 2009 survey) ‎

                       FSWs get infected rapidly once they join the sex industry. FSWs below 20 years of age
                        were as likely ‎
                                       to be HIV infected as older FSWs (p = 0.98) and FSWs with less than one year
                        of sex work experience ‎   had the highest HIV prevalence of all respondents in the 2011
                        survey—see Figure 15. A 2010 study ‎     (CISLS, Cartographie sites prostitutionelles et MSM,
                        2010) indicates that younger FSWs tend to ‎  work on the street, while women up to 50 years of
                        age tend to work in brothels (maison closes). ‎  The number of clients also appears to differ
20     Niger’s‎HIV‎response: Targeted investments for a healthy future



       according to type of site, with bars and restaurants reporting ‎
                                                                      the highest proportion of sex
       workers reporting >20 clients a day‎

      The average duration of sex work is 3 years with 41% of SWs working from 1 to 4 years and
       28% working for over four years25
                                      ‎ ‎

      The majority of women in sex work are divorced (63%, in the 2010 mapping study). Some
                 driven into sex work after becoming widowed, divorced or separated ‎
       women are ‎

      Reported violence is strongly associated with HIV infection. In 2011, FSWs who reported
       being victims of violence had a ‎
                                       HIV prevalence of 32% whereas those not reporting acts of
       violence had a HIV prevalence of 14%. Reported ‎    use of drugs and/or alcohol was not
       associated with HIV status ‎

Prisoners
 There are approximately 11,600 prisoners‎ in‎ Niger’s‎ correctional institutions. It is
                       are female.26‎ ‎
    reported that 3.2% ‎              The average duration of a prison incarceration is 1–2 years.
    Prisons represent a risk context for ‎
                                         HIV, TB and other diseases. One official source reports
    conditions of inadequate ventilation, overcrowding, and incidences of death from AIDS,
    malaria and TB27‎

      HIV prevalence in prisoners has remained stable over the last decade. HIV prevalence
       has leveled off at between 2.7%–2.8%, but ‎ has not followed the decreasing epidemic trend
       seen in other key populations. In Niamey, 6% and in Diffa 4.3% of ‎
                                                                         prisoners surveyed in 2011
       were HIV infected, reminding us that localized ‎ epidemics can ignite in risk settings like
       prisons ‎

Men who have sex with men (MSM) and male sex work
 Homosexuality is not socially accepted in Niger and sexual relationships between men
   are ‎therefore hidden.28 ‎ There are no epidemiological data available on MSM in Niger.
   Mapping and ‎  estimation activities on MSM have assessed the numbers of MSM in individual
   regions: Circa 200 ‎ MSM in Tahoua; circa 150–200 MSM in Zinder; and 89 MSM in Niamey,
   including in bars, brothels and ‎cinemas (Animas 2013). 10 MSM were identified in Maradi but
   could not be interviewed‎

    In one survey, a high proportion of sampled MSM said they were involved in
     commercial sexual ‎  activities (2010 data, MSM identified through snowball sampling). In
     2010, 64% of interviewed ‎MSM said that they receive payment from male sexual partners.
     There is a proportion of MSM who ‎  identify themselves as bisexual, and some are married,
     which links any MSM related HIV transmission to the ‎female population‎

Other key populations that include sex work clients
 HIV in FSW client populations: Periodic surveys have also been conducted in teachers,
   truckers, ‎
             mine workers, labor migrants and the military (see Figure 6 for HIV prevalence
   data). In all males ‎
                       of the key populations combined, HIV prevalence in 2011 was 0.8% (24
   infections per 2,943 men with ‎   bio-behavioral data), which can be considered as the HIV
   prevalence‎of‎“sex‎work‎‎clients”‎‎

    HIV in female members of key populations: In all females of the key populations combined
     ‎
     (excluding FSW), HIV prevalence in 2011 was 1.7% (7 infections in 405 females with bio-
                data) ‎
     behavioral ‎

    Female members of the key populations have a significantly higher HIV prevalence
               members. However, female key population samples are small:‎

General population
 HIV prevalence has declined in almost all of the 5-year age groups as defined by the
   DHS, and in 2012 ‎remained highest in women in their thirties and early forties (up to 0.8%)
   and in men in their late ‎thirties and forties (up to 1.0%)—see Figure 16. Some of the
   prevalent HIV cases in these older age ‎
                                          groups are attributable to ART provided to individuals
   with advanced HIV infections. Some HIV ‎    positive women will have a history of sex work,
   given the demographics of FSW, and the turnover ‎  of women in the sex industry

                      The age and sex pattern of HIV infection reflects the age mixing pattern of sexual
                       relationships in ‎
                                        Niger. Very few young men are infected compared to young women (who
                       tend to have much ‎older partners/spouses)

                      It is estimated that just over a quarter of all PLHIV are in Niamey (an estimated 26% ‎ in
                       2012), and that over half of all PLHIV reside in either Niamey, Dosso or Tahoua (based
                       on the ‎regional population numbers and the regional HIV prevalence levels 2012—see Figure
                       17). Two ‎ regions, Niamey and Dosso, have seen a rise in PLHIV numbers since 2006. It is
                       estimated that ‎Tahoua had the largest decrease in PLHIV numbers and that Agadez and Diffa
                       have the lowest ‎PLHIV numbers in 2012 compared to the other regions ‎

                  education, ‎ wealth and economic activity, suggest a rapidly changing epidemic
                  situation (Figure 18). Even in the ‎
                                                     stratum of highest education, HIV prevalence has declined
                  sharply in both females and males, ‎ presumably through a combination of lower HIV incidence
                  and high AIDS-related mortality (the ‎scale of the ART program was small until circa 2009) ‎

Where do new HIV infections occur?‎ ‎
Incident infections by age and sex ‎
 Niger’s‎epidemic‎is‎fuelled‎by‎both‎vertical‎and‎sexual‎transmission.‎In‎2013, it was estimated
    that 709 ‎
             new HIV infections occurred in children through mother-to-child transmission, and
    738 new ‎infections occurred in adults (Spectrum 2013)—see Figure 19 ‎

    Estimated HIV incidence is similar for males and females, but young females and older males
     have ‎
          slightly higher incidence due to the age pattern of sexual mixing

Incident infections by sub-population
 Using Optima and stratifying the population by demographic, epidemiological and behavioral
    ‎
    characteristics into 14 sub-populations, annual new infections in each sub-population were
    estimated (Figure 20). In 2012, MTCT and new infections in adults aged 25–49, and in
    ‎
    migrants and FSWs, ‎    accounted for an estimated 80% of HIV incidence. The largest
    single contributor to new infections ‎ was MTCT

Incident infections by location
There are no direct estimates of the geographical distribution of HIV incidence available,
however, ‎there are clues as to where HIV transmission may be occurring. ‎

     The geographical distribution of PLHIV suggests that there may be an important percentage
      of HIV ‎transmission occurring in the South-West portion of the country—in 2012, an
      estimated 70% of PLHIV lived in ‎  one of four regions in the South-West covering only a
      quarter of the country surface area (Niamey, ‎ Dosso, Maradi, and Tahoua)—Figure 21. If
      untreated, the infectiousness of PLHIV who are at a more advanced ‎stage of HIV/AIDS can
      perpetuate the onward transmission to sexual contacts

     The role of FSWs in the ongoing transmission of HIV (Figure 20), the geographical
      distribution of sex work ‎sites (Figure 22), and the evidence of an urban HIV epidemic (Figure
      13), all support ‎the notion that urban and industrial zones in Niger remain areas of elevated
      HIV transmission. ‎ In 2013, sex work sites were mapped and characterized into four regions to
      improve the understanding of hotspots of sex work-related HIV transmission. Over 3,200
      FSW were counted in 498 identified sites ‎

Section 4. HIV financing, HIV services and
           programs and their efficiency
How is the HIV response financed, and what has been
                                        programs?‎
spent on the different HIV services and ‎
National spending on HIV and AIDS is well documented in NASA reports covering the years 2007
‎
and 2008 (CISLS, 2009) and 2009–12 (CISLS, 2013), that is summarized in Table 2.‎

Over six years, the costs of the national response to HIV amounted to Euro 58 million (USD
78 ‎
   million), corresponding to an annual average of Euro 9.7 million (USD 12.6 million), or
0.24% of GDP, ‎  over that period, but costs fluctuated dramatically on an annual basis‎
 There is no clear trend in HIV/AIDS-related spending—it declined by almost one-half between
     2007 ‎ (Euro 11.4 million/USD 14.8 million) and 2010 (Euro 5.9 million/USD 7.7 million), but
     has increased ‎steeply since, and had attained the highest level observed so far of (Euro 12.5
     million/USD 16.3 ‎million) in 2012

The financing of the HIV response has been dominated by external funding, accounting for
       90% of HIV spending from 2007 to 2011 ‎
almost ‎
 However, much of the increase in HIV/AIDS spending in 2012 was accounted for by public
   spending ‎(up by Euro 3.4 million/USD 4.5 million) largely due to the new World Bank loan,
                  funding declined by Euro 1.4 million/USD 1.8 million ‎
   while external ‎

    Consequently, the share of external funding has declined to 67%, while public funding
               for 30% of total spending in 2012‎
     accounted ‎

    The most important sources of external support have been the Global Fund (29% of total
     funding ‎in 2007–12), UNICEF, the Government of Germany (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau
                                     from 2012 onwards (2012–16)‎
     [KfW]), and the World Bank loan ‎

    Looking ahead, there is—as per 1 January 2014—some uncertainty regarding the level of
     support ‎
             Niger can obtain from the Global Fund. The current agreement with KfW is expiring in
     April 2014, ‎
                 and at the time of writing only USD 2.6 million in Global Fund commitments
                          HIV/AIDS response remained undisbursed‎
     towards the national ‎

At least since 2009, most HIV/AIDS services are delivered through the public sector (about
two-‎thirds of all spending), while the private sector accounted for about one-quarter, and
              NGOs for one-tenth of the total in 2009–12‎

30   Animas-Sutura is an NGO and social marketing organization established with KfW support. It has become an
     instrument in the implementation of the national population policy and HIV strategy. Its objective is to distribute
     condoms and other contraceptives in a way that makes them accessible country-wide.

28    Niger’s‎HIV‎response: Targeted investments for a healthy future



In 2009–12, most HIV prevention spending was devoted to condom social marketing and
‎
distribution (37%), prevention of mother-to-child transmission (19%), voluntary counseling
and ‎testing (15%), and measures targeting young people (13%) ‎
 Only 7% of prevention spending was targeted toward “accessible‎risk‎populations”, and only
    1% was allocated to ‎
                        sex workers

     Expenditure for sex work programs has been low and has fluctuated, with the majority of
      funding ‎
              coming from international sources (1.9% in 2009 and 0.9% in 2012 of total prevention
      spending). ‎
                 This raises questions with respect to allocative efficiency, sustainability and
      ownership since HIV prevalence among FSW has ‎      historically been and remains very high,
      ‎
      and there has been a substantial decline of SW investment (65% between 2007 and 2008)

What HIV services and programs have been scaled up?‎
Niger’s‎HIV‎prevention‎services‎have‎ focused on reducing unprotected heterosexual acts
    the risk of vertical transmission during pregnancy and birth ‎
and ‎
 Homosexual transmission has had less focus. Although there is evidence that sexual
   transmission ‎between male partners happens, there are no adapted services for MSM of any
   coverage and ‎ scale

    HIV transmission through injecting drugs has not been regarded as a public health issue to
     date, and ‎there are no specific services developed. Drug trafficking is occurring and the first
     ‎
     consultations have been held (e.g., in Agadez) to address the emerging threat of illicit drug
     use in Niger‎

Services for sex workers and their clients
Since the end of SIDA-3 in 2007, a regional bilateral cooperation project, medical follow-up
of sex ‎  workers has been the responsibility of national STI reference centre (Center
National de ‎   Référence des IST). Service delivery essentially consists of community-based
‎
activities (peer education, and condom distribution), linkage to health facilities (STI, HCT),
medical ‎ follow-up of SWs, and communication activities with SW clients. Actual implementation
           recently, been patchy and lacking any scale:‎
has, until ‎

    It is not known what program coverage has been achieved—in 2008, an estimated 75%
     of SWs were ‎ reached with some prevention activities; in 2011, an estimated 54% were
     reached with activities ‎
                             (second generation surveillance [SSG] 2011). It is not known what
     ART coverage has been achieved among HIV-positive SWs‎

    There is no comprehensive, defined standard package with quality-assured, standard
     operating procedures that ‎can be applied in all parts of the country (except peer education
     among SWs, ‎ which is well defined in terms of content and delivery modalities32‎
                                                                                     )‎

    Services planning has historically not been sufficiently based on strategic information
                 migration, site characteristics and the dynamic nature of hotspots) ‎
     (such as SW ‎

    Services have been irregular and some adapted services have abandoned their
     specific ‎
              focus on SWs (the only adapted service that remained was the Center National de
                        which ensures the medical follow-up of SWs)‎
     Référence des IST, ‎

    SWs have to pay fees for their medical card and for each consultation even at the
     adapted service ‎ center. The consultation fee increased from FCFA 200 to FCFA 1,500,
     however, this fee was overturned ‎    in the four World Bank-supported regions where
     consultation is now free for SWs

Only 4 of 10 Niamey sex workers are linked into the medical follow-up program, consisting
   screening and treatment services at a health center33 ‎‎ ‎
of ‎
 The monthly medical monitoring service is only provided for SWs in Niamey. The majority of
         workers accessing the services are foreigners i.e., non-Nigerien‎

    Barriers to using services cited by respondents of the mapping study are the non-proximity of
     the ‎
         health center, poor reception received, slowness of services, and lack of privacy. An
     additional barrier cited ‎
                              anecdotally in the study related to the need to re-purchase a medical
     log book after a missed ‎  appointment‎

    Key informants emphasize the challenge that the vast majority of FSW are clandestine—
         known to the authorities and therefore are difficult to serve and protect ‎

The country has started to systematically define and characterize SW typologies and sites,
which ‎ represents indispensable strategic information toward tailoring services to the
locality and needs ‎

           up to 50 years of age ‎
     women ‎

     highest ‎
             proportions of SWs serving >20 clients a day

Sex‎workers’‎condom‎use‎has‎multiple‎determinants‎and‎barriers
 Client refusal is the chief reason for unprotected commercial sex—client refusal was
   responsible ‎for 85% of all unprotected sex acts in a 2010 SW study in Niamey35. This level of
   client refusal of ‎
                     condom use emphasizes the need to augment risk perception among higher-
   risk men (SWs in Maradi ‎    report that 65% of clients refuse condoms; 72% of SWs permit
   unprotected sex with clients who refuse to use condoms36) ‎

    SW characteristics such as age, length of time involved in sex work, education and affiliation
     to venues, ‎
                determine the motivation to use condoms, and their self-efficacy in defending their
     wish to use ‎condoms

    Condoms are often, but not always available—86% of SW in a recent mapping study say
     condoms ‎
             were always available

    The type of sex partner determines condom use—condom use is highest when with
     commercial partners ‎ and lowest with boyfriends (about 23% of SW report using a condom at
     every sexual act37), and ‎
                     ‎ ‎      this differential indicates a need for risk counseling of SWs

SW interventions appear to offer significant scope for strengthening scale, ‎
                                                                            coverage and
impact. ‎
 Few Nigerien SWs benefit from the full combination package of services ‎

Condom promotion and distribution services ‎
Prevention of HIV and STIs through condom use and promotion has been a focus for many
years with free distribution, and socially-marketed and commercial condoms being made
available. ‎

Summarized results are as follows:‎
 Condom use is only significant in commercial (circa 87% use across several surveys) and
   casual acts ‎(circa 40% use across several surveys), they are virtually excluded from use in
                                        and play a very minor role in FP ‎
   regular partnerships (circa 3% use), ‎

      There are an estimated 2.32 million unprotected commercial sex acts per year in Niger,
       which ‎ represents the top priority for condom targeting (see Table 3). It is also estimated
       that there are ‎over 3 million unprotected casual acts, which is a second priority for the
       targeting of condom promotion activities ‎
                                                for HIV and STI prevention

      Young men increasingly report condom use in casual sex—38% in 2006 (DHS) and 66% in
       2011 (SSG) ‎
                  (very few young females report casual sex)

      Condom use data from key populations suggest that more could be done to make sex safer:
       among ‎  those reporting two or more partners, 40% of prisoners, 45% of migrants, 51% of
                        miners, and 64% of truckers, reported condom use at last sex (SSG 2011)‎
       military, 43% of ‎

      In recent years 85%–95% of sex workers reported using condoms with paying clients,
       however,‎it‎was‎only‎64%‎with‎“petits‎amis”‎(cartographie‎PS/HSH),‎who‎may‎often‎be‎men‎in‎

Services for the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission
In 2011, Niger committed itself to accelerate progress in PMTCT with the goal of virtually
eliminating new pediatric HIV infections by 2015. The e-MTCT strategy for 2013–15
‎
presents a ‎  clear analysis of the bottlenecks and details a series of actions to reduce the
MTCT rate of 27% in ‎  2013 (2013 revised Spectrum data) to less than 5% in 2015. Key results
to date are: ‎
 Moving from 7 PMTCT pilot sites in 2003 to 651 PMTCT sites38‎in 2012‎

    Increased assisted deliveries—a SRH objective—to 29.3% in 2012 (up from 18% in 2006),
     which ‎
           can help women accessing PMTCT offered in maternity care

    There was an increased attendance for the first prenatal visit (CPN1 = 83% up from 46% in
     2006), however, a CPN4 of below 26% in 2012 severely limits PMTCT uptake

    In 2012, 47% of pregnant women in need received ARVs through the PMTCT program
              Spectrum 2013; of 2,847 mothers in need, 1,334 received ARVs—895 for option A
     (revised ‎
                        B)‎
     and 439 for option ‎

    Diagnosis of exposed infants is almost nonexistent at 1% ‎

    The‎“husband‎school/écoles‎des‎maris”‎tested‎with‎United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
     assistance for SRH purposes—this program is expected to help address some of the
                   PMTCT scale-up since expectant mothers’ access to assisted delivery is largely

The roll-out of PMTCT services is, in part, in alignment with epidemic evidence
 Niamey—where DHS-female HIV prevalence is the highest—had reached the highest rollout
      PMTCT in 2012 (89% of eligible health facilities) (e-MTCT strategy 2013)‎
   of ‎

   Diffa—with second highest DHS-female HIV prevalence and third-highest ANC HIV
    prevalence—had achieved a 82% rollout to eligible health facilities

   Tillaberi—with low DHS and ANC female HIV prevalence—had the slowest PMTCT roll-out
    of 44%; ‎Zinder also had relatively slow roll-out at 71% and somewhat lower DHS and ANC
    female HIV ‎ prevalence,‎ and‎ Agadez’‎ roll-out was at 76%, commensurate with its average
    female HIV ‎prevalence level

   However, Dosso—with highest ANC HIV prevalence of 1.3%—had only reached a 70% roll-
    out

   Tahoua—with second highest ANC HIV prevalence of 1.1%—had only reached 71%‎

   Maradi—with 0% DHS-HIV prevalence and <1% ANC HIV prevalence—had reached a high
             of 85%‎
    roll-out ‎

The efficiency of existing PMTCT sites is constrained by numerous organizational,
technical and ‎financial challenges
 Even though 176 new PMTCT sites were created in 2011 within existing integrated health
    centers, ‎
             the number of pregnant women tested for HIV decreased that year due to a 6-month
    shortage of ‎
                testing kits and reagents

   Scale-up of PMTCT services suffers from a limited and irregular availability of human
    resources‎ or/and‎ trained professionals, and insufficient number of CD4 and PCR diagnostic
    tools

   The high rate of utilization of CPN1 (83%) is explained by the additional benefits of the first
    visit—registration of the birth in the administrative system, and receipt of a mosquito net for
    malaria ‎
            prevention. Subsequent attendance for pre-natal care is progressively lower

   Renewed efforts to provide free delivery assistance has raised utilization, but it is still too low,
    and ‎
        also affects the follow-up of HIV-exposed infants (in 2012, only 1%, or 669 children out of
          received the ARV treatment they needed, revised Spectrum data) ‎

Program inefficiencies and bottlenecks have been diagnosed (presented in the e-MTCT strategy)
‎
and a series of actions has been identified to address them (Table 4 provides a summary). The
two main ‎
         avenues to scale up PMTCT are:

    Improve access to treatment through the integration and decentralization of services, the
     delegation of ‎ART prescriptions to primary care providers and improvement of the technical
                           CD4 count) ‎

HIV counseling and testing services
The health sector offers HIV counseling and testing (HCT) in integrated health services, at
PMTCT ‎ sites, blood transfusion centers and sites for TB testing and treatment. In 2008,
there were 172 HCT ‎sites in the country. The following results are summarized:‎

Annual HIV testing is 4–5 percentage points higher in females than males
 HIV testing is reported by 7–8% of females and by 2–3% of males (NDHS 2012)—the higher
   testing ‎rates in females are due to PMTCT-related HCT. Figure 24 illustrates the strata of
   men with high HIV ‎    prevalence and low HCT rates. Such analyses can inform better
   geographic targeting and ‎ promotion of HCT services (e.g., men who reside in Dosso and
   Diffa), and demographics for demand ‎ creation (e.g., older men)

     Key populations have higher testing rates overall, with 76% of sampled FSWs, 61% of
      the military, ‎
                    46% of miners, 41% of prisoners, 39% of truckers and 28% of migrants, reporting
      testing (2011 SSG)‎

     In 2012, the Government allocated dedicated resources for provider-initiated counseling
      and ‎ testing (PICT) demonstrating the intention to target HCT at individuals who are: (a)
      already in contact ‎
                         with the health sector; and (b) may provide high yields of HIV-positive
      individuals, especially when ‎applying provider initiated counseling and testing (PICT) to
      sexually transmitted infection (STIs) and SRH services for adults, and child malnutrition

ART services
Public sector ART provision started in 2004 and was gradually scaled up. ARVs are
provided free-of-‎
                 charge in the public health sector. The change in national ART treatment policy
in 2010 meant that ‎  the‎ number‎ of‎ eligible‎ adults‎ “in‎ need”‎ doubled‎ and‎ relative‎ coverage‎
decreased (change from ‎   CD4 200 to CD4 350 treatment eligibility). The following results are
highlighted:‎

 Retention is similar among male and female ART recipients, and between adult and child
    recipients ‎

     Confirmed deaths among ART patients are 3.9% at 12 months, 5.4% at 24 months and 7.7%

Estimation of drug needs suffer from weak routine data and are often based on program
        instead of actual service data‎
targets ‎
 Supervision documents suggest that at several sites, statistics are not updated, or deaths of
    ART ‎ patients are not reflected in the statistics

     Needs for ARVs, other medicaments and inputs are estimated annually by the APPR group
      which is ‎ technically supported by Solthis. Incomplete data from the ART sites make this
      exercise difficult. ‎However, attempts are being made to understand the number of new
      initiations, those lost-to-follow-up, ‎
                                            mortality, and actual consumption from each site, with the
      largest volume of data coming from the ‎  Niamey-based ART sites

     The resulting estimates are weak and are not supporting correct drug procurements, with
      ‎
      overestimations leading to wastage, and underestimations causing shortages ‎

     Data collection and sharing for informing procurement needs to be urgently strengthened with
      ‎
      better data on ARV consumption and the treatment cohorts from each site

Human resource constraints negatively affect the performance of the ART program

    Personnel in the pharmacies at the decentralized level are insufficiently trained or qualified
     and this ‎
              affects the daily management of the supply chain, as well as limiting a full
                                     of the treatment cohort‎
     understanding of the drug needs ‎

The procurement of ARVs is centrally managed, which allows for a harmonized “drug-
procurement–to-match-identified-needs” approach. However, the purchase of ARVs, other
‎
       and inputs is not harmonized‎
drugs, ‎
 The ONPPC (Office National des Produits Pharmaceutiques et Chimiques) coordinates all
   ‎
   procurements on behalf of the Global Fund, other financial partners and the government‎

    The process of buying ARVs is not unified: Global Fund orders are processed through the
     Voluntary pooled ‎
                      procurement (VPP) service while government-financed orders use a tender
     process

    Proforma invoices reveal a large differential in drug prices between these two purchasing
     ‎
     mechanisms, and between international prices as per the Clinton Initiative

ARV drugs purchased through the government system cost twice as much as the prices
endorsed ‎by the Global Fund, the Clinton Initiative and WHO
 For instance, the cost of one pack of 60 tablets of 3TC/AZT/NVP (150/300/200 mg) costs
   Euro 17.15 (11 260 ‎  FCFA) as per ONPPC proforma invoice, compared with Euro 8.59 as per
   Clinton Initiative. ‎
                       The median cost reported by the Global Fund for West and Central Africa
   (period 2005–12) for ‎ the same pack of tablets is Euro 8.74 (interquartile range, Euro 7.36—
   10.58) or 5 735 FCFA (4 830–‎ 6 943)39
                                 ‎

    The cost of 60 3TC/AZT (150/300 mg) has a proforma invoice price of Euro 13.01 compared
             6.75 as per the Clinton Initiative.‎
     to Euro ‎

    Other comparisons show the same pattern: 60 NVP 200 mg: Euro 4.40 versus Euro 2.30; 120
           Euro 59.17 versus Euro 24.16 (ONPPC compared to Clinton Initiative) ‎
     LVP/r ‎

The ARV distribution systems underperform and sometimes lead to storage problems and
    shortages at the sites ‎
ARV ‎
 ONPPC is responsible for storage and distribution of ARVs, other drugs and reagents (and
   has a ‎
         specific contract with CISLS to ensure the delivery of these commodities to the regions)

    There are, at times, challenges with cold storage of stocks at the central level. Three
                  vehicles‎are‎being‎financed‎by‎the‎Global‎Fund‎to‎reduce‎ONPPC’s‎reliance‎on‎
     refrigerated ‎
     the cold chain ‎
                    partners

    At decentralized level, there are issues with the number of depots (only two, in Tahoua and
     ‎
     Zinder), which means that all other ART sites need to be serviced directly by the central level
     every ‎
           3 months. Due to delays in the reporting of treatment data and drug requirements, ARV
     stock-outs ‎
                have been experienced at the treatment sites. This can occur at times when the
     central depot is ‎
                      over-stocked

Comparison of selected unit costs of HIV services
The bottom-up costing exercise of the Resource Needs Model in 2012 provides an insight into
unit ‎
     costs, which can be compared to other countries using the same methodology (Table 5)
 For some services, the unit costs are higher than for the comparison countries Togo and the
     Democratic Republic of Congo (RDC): The ‎ service package for SWs and MSM is costed at a
     higher level in Niger

    Costs for HCT provision, STI treatment and examination of a woman in PMTCT services are
     lower in ‎
              Niger compared to the other countries

    First line ARV costs are higher in Niger than in Togo, but lower than in the RDC (PMTCT and
     ART services), ‎however, second line ARVs are significantly more expensive in Niger‎

IEC/BCC services
Information- education- communication/behavior change communication (IEC/BCC)
activities are designed to increase risk perception and improve the use of HIV prevention
‎
methods and services such as condoms, HCT, PMTCT and STI care. ‎

IEC and BCC have been targeted at young people in primary and secondary schools and at
youth in ‎
         out-of-school settings for HIV and STI prevention purposes.

IEC/BCC activities have resulted in the following levels of knowledge, norms and
behaviors relating to ‎sexual behaviors:‎
 Among youth aged 15–24, 65% of males and 46% of females cite condom use as a means to
            HIV infection (NDHS 2012) ‎
    prevent ‎
40   Niger’s‎HIV‎response: Targeted investments for a healthy future



    ‎ 0% of young males and 65% of young females know that limiting sexual contacts to one HIV
     8
     ‎
     negative partner reduces the risk of HIV

    ‎ 4% of young females think that it is justified for a woman to refuse sex with her spouse if she
     5
     ‎
     knows he has sex with other women, and 66% think it is justified for a women to ask for
     condom ‎ use if she knows her spouse has an STI

    However, most women marry early, have much older partners and little or no school education—it
     is therefore questionable whether they are in a position to negotiate safe marital sex ‎
     ‎

    Among 15–24 year olds, 1.1% of males and 0.2% of females report having had 2 or more sex
     ‎
     partners in the last 12 months, and 1.3% of young men report having paid for sex

    ‎ he median age at first sexual encounter is 16 years for females and 23 years for males (self-
     T
     reported NDHS data ‎  2012)

To what extent are HIV services integrated or linked? ‎
The authorities are aware that linkage and integration are important, and strategy documents
state ‎ the need for integrated supervision activities and improved integrated monitoring and
reporting. At ‎ the same time, linkage and referral systems are being discussed and proposals for
improvements ‎    have been presented. However, this is not a comprehensive review of integration,
which encompasses: (a) ‎     intra-provider linkages (i.e., integration of services by one provider
during one patient consultation); ‎    (b) intra-facility integration, which encompasses linkages
between services by different providers, ‎    at a facility; and (c) inter-facility integration, which is
about referrals between facilities. At each ‎   health facility (and standalone HIV-service-providing
facility), the real challenge is ‎
                                 how intra-provider, intra-facility and inter-facility integration can be
optimized. In summary, the ‎  following observations are made:‎

General integration of, and linkages with HIV and health programs:‎
 Social marketing of condoms is integrated with malaria and RH commodities through joint
   ‎
   marketing and common sales channels, under the direction of Animas-Sutura

    Free new-born delivery services have raised the assisted delivery rate and have indirectly
     helped raise PMTCT coverage

    The roll-out and promotion of provider initiated counseling and testing (PICT) helps target
     HCT (which is very important in a low grade HIV ‎   epidemic), and provides opportunities for
     linking clients to prevention, treatment and care services ‎
                                                                (functional linkages between HCT
                                                                    earlier)‎
     and pre-ART/ART is a priority for getting PLHIV into treatment ‎

    The offer of selected free-of-charge health services by the public sector (especially family
     planning and ‎antenatal care) holds great potential for increasing the use of HIV and SRH
     services

    Integration of HCT into child malnutrition screening works (3–4% of children were found to be
     HIV+, suggesting ‎that such targeted HCT is an important way to improve HIV case finding
     among children and ‎ eventually increase pediatric ART coverage)‎

    Community-based‎agents‎(such‎as‎the‎“médiatrices‎communautaires”)‎and‎community-based
     ‎
     organizations can help link people to health services and hold great promise in a country
     where ‎ 53% of people live outside the 5 kilometer (km) catchment area of health facilities.
     Priority tasks for such ‎
                             community workers should include the identification of risk pregnancies
     and the accompaniment ‎    of women, children and families enrolled in treatments (PMTCT
                                                       HIV financing, HIV services and programs and their efficiency      41



     regimens, ART, FP, TB, etc.). In ‎ Malawi, peer support and defaulter tracking were important
     for minimizing loss-to-follow-up of ‎
                                         women on ART, as were extended counseling and ongoing
     support of women, and effective use ‎ of the patient monitoring data.40
                                                                          ‎ The Rwanda experience
     with male and female health workers at ‎    community level demonstrates the importance of
     mobilization and demand creation at grassroots ‎  level

    Full‎ integration‎ of‎ the‎ regional‎ HIV‎ coordination‎ into‎ the‎ health‎ sector’s‎ coordination‎
     structures will ‎support the integration agenda and increase sustainability of both HIV
     coordination and HIV ‎   interventions at the decentralized level (delays in resource flow have
     disrupted HIV coordination in the ‎ past) ‎

    Linkage and joint monitoring between public and the private service providers is poor despite
     the ‎country’s‎ multisectoral approach to HIV/AIDS strategy. For instance, 8% of men and
     women in ‎ Agadez and 3% of men and 6% of women in Niamey have medical insurance from
     an employer, ‎  but private sector HIV service provision is not being reported in the national
     statistics

Linkages between a package of services for sex workers: ‎
Although it is more difficult to link a package of HIV services for sex workers to general health
service delivery, the different components of FSW programs—the‎ bedrock‎ of‎ Niger’s‎ HIV‎
‎
response—can and need to be better integrated in the following ways: ‎
‎

    Accessible STI services as a bedrock for ensuring an entry point to service provision for
     FSWs

    The link between community-based activities for SWs and the adapted services at the facility
     level is ‎
              weak, with insufficient collaboration between peer educators and clinic staff. This also
                    link between VCT services and care/treatment ‎
     applies to the ‎

    Structural interventions need to be linked to a comprehensive service package for SWs to
     address ‎stigmatization and discrimination which currently limits service use (this also applies
     to male SWs)‎

    Integrated HIV workplace interventions, especially in mining and oil companies, are seen as
     ‎
     important complementary activities toward making sex work activity safer by providing
     targeted HIV prevention ‎ services to employees (who may be involved in commercial sex due
                                situations) ‎
     to their income and living ‎

    The integrated services for migrants (OIM-Niger) are considered a useful model for delivering
     HIV ‎
         and STI services in an integrated way to key populations by stakeholders in the national
         response.‎
     HIV ‎

PMTCT: ‎
 A strategy of rolling out PMTCT into all of the 857 Integrated Health Centers is being pursued
   (e-MTCT ‎  plan), which is underpinned by the global and regional plans for the virtual
   elimination of vertical ‎
                           transmission (despite low HIV prevalence in the general population, and
   correspondingly high costs ‎ per vertically transmitted HIV infection averted) ‎

    Government documents emphasize the weak integration of maternal, neonatal and infant
     health ‎services (MNIH), SRH, FP, ART and PMTCT services (this includes supervision, i.e.,
     visits by district ‎
                        cadres for supervision purposes miss including PMTCT services adequately)

    This weakness leads to missed opportunities to offer the complete service package, including

     ARV-based interventions, to HIV+ women and children at the same time and in the same
     place ‎

           ‎
           current Strategic Plan period
Impact of historical HIV expenditures ‎
Using Optima, the impact of past HIV investments was estimated by comparing the expected
‎
number of new HIV infections according to actual conditions with the estimated numbers under‎
the‎ counterfactual scenario of no funding for specific HIV programs. Local data were used to
formulate ‎evidence-based assumptions on the relationship between funding, HIV outcomes, and
program ‎ coverage (Annex A1.6). Optima was used to project epidemic trajectories according to
‎
the counterfactual scenarios, and compare these trajectories with the calibrated epidemic
‎
trajectory according to actual conditions, resulting in an estimation of the impact of the HIV
program. ‎

Historical spending over the period 2007–12 helped reduce HIV incidence and therefore
averted new HIV infections (Figure 26) ‎
‎
 Spending from 2007–12 averted close to 3,900 infections just during that period

     The downstream effects of these prevented infections mean that by 2035, the spending from
      2007–12 will have averted a total of 12,600 infections at a cost of Euro 3,500 (USD 4,700)
      ‎
      per ‎
          infection averted if only HIV program spending is considered (see Annex A1.3 for

The HIV incidence decline occurred across sup-populations and was most dramatic in
those with ‎
           highest HIV incidence in the past (Figure 27)
 The largest HIV risk reduction occurred in FSWs, from an estimated 3.5% HIV incidence in
   2000 which dropped to approximately 1.1% in 2012 ‎

                              Using the best available local and regional data on MSM, the estimated HIV incidence was at
                               0.9% ‎ in 2012 (reduced from 1.4% in 2000). This figure is uncertain given the scarcity of MSM
                               data in Niger. However, the Optima-derived estimations point to this key demographic as a

Best resource allocation in the current HIV strategic plan
period
One of the key interests of this analytical study was to use the Optima model to determine the
‎
allocation of HIV resources or spending required that best meet the objectives of HIV incidence or
‎
DALYs reduction (see detailed objectives in Section 1). This optimization was done by combining
the ‎information on the relationship between costs and outcomes (Annex A1.6) with a simple
‎
optimization algorithm that found the best allocation of resources to meet the objective at hand; in
‎
this case, minimization of either HIV incidence or DALYs until 2025 in order to capture longer-
term ‎benefits of investments.‎
                                                                                          ‎ urrent strategic plan period

There are specific shifts in budget allocation that are required to optimize program
impacts on HIV ‎    incidence and morbidity/mortality (DALYs)—Figure 28. Note that condoms
are included in the ‎    intervention packages for the different populations; some community
mobilization activities are ‎part of the PMTCT package; HCT is included in ART, SW and PMTCT
service packages; and SW ‎    interventions include mobilization activities‎
 Compared to the 2012 spending pattern, spending to minimize either incidence or DALYs
    would ‎prioritize ART, PMTCT and FSW spending, while reducing spending on the low-risk
    populations ‎ (primarily the general population) ‎

     In‎Niger’s‎epidemic‎context,‎the optimal spending allocations look virtually the same for best
      ‎
      reductions in HIV incidence or DALYs, i.e.: ‎

      -    Increased spending on ART from 31% currently to circa 50%‎

      -    Increased spending on PMTCT from 11% currently to circa 19%‎

      -    Increased spending on FSW interventions from 1% currently to circa 4%‎

     These shifts in spending reflect better resource targeting to populations where the ‎
                                                                                          majority of
      new HIV infections occur (especially true for FSWs and their sexual contacts); in addition,
      ‎
      they emphasize the relatively high effectiveness of ARV treatment as prevention, since
      PLHIV on ‎treatment have significantly reduced infectiousness.41

       Optima and Spectrum used the factor 0.80 for reduction in HIV transmission when on ART (modified from the
       Spectrum default value of 0.92), based on programmatic effectiveness of ART on viral load reductions in several
       African ART interventions.

Optimization of the 2014–17 budget (annual average of Euro 4.8 million or USD 6.5 million) for
    incidence reduction averts an estimated 8,900 additional HIV infections from 2014–25 ‎
HIV ‎
 Most of the benefit is obtained by increasing funding for FSWs (7,000 extra infections are
    averted, ‎across all population groups, counting direct and indirect/secondary transmission
    events), and by ‎increasing funding for PMTCT (which reduces MTCT by 50%, or 1,400 extra
                                ART (3,400 extra infections are averted) ‎
    infections are averted) and ‎

                  These increases require reducing funding for low-risk populations, leading to 3,000 additional
                   ‎
                   infections, but the net benefit is still very positive (7000 + 1,400 + 3,500 - 3,000 = 8,900
                   infections averted)

If HIV funds are either very limited or more abundant, allocations can be guided by an
investment ‎ cascade which helps prioritize expenditures by HIV impact—Figure 29
 Given limited funds (below that of what has actually been acquired for the NSP period‎ 42‎       ),
    PMTCT and ‎    ART should be given first priority, followed by FSW spending—this explicit
    rationing is not desirable ‎
                               since easily preventable HIV infections will occur within such a tight
    funding context‎

                  With larger budgets (notably larger than the average budget over the period 2014–17),
                   programs ‎ for the low-risk population should be given significant funding with spending
                   patterns similar to the ‎
                                           2012 distribution, except with a far greater proportion being allocated to
                   PMTCT

                   The yearly average of Euro 4.8 million (USD 6.5 million) is skewed toward the earlier NSP years. Very low funding
                   had been acquired for the years 2016–17 at the time of analysis, so the assumptions of 50% or 20% of the yearly
                   average in the investment cascade are relevant. In turn, 2014 had a higher than average amount of acquired
                   funding, and the investment cascade can provide guidance on prioritization in years with a strong availability of
                   funding.

The reallocation of available funds results in a 12% additional reduction in new HIV infections
over ‎the period until 2025 compared to a continuation of the 2012 expenditure pattern, despite
the fact that available funds are only roughly half the 2012 budget—Figure 30.‎

Drug costs are kept constant ‎

Optima modeling also provided some broad estimates of additional costs as a result of raising the
‎
ART eligibility threshold to CD4 500, and of the savings gained with more modest management
cost ‎increases (Figure 31). Compared to the default expenditure for meeting NSP coverage
targets, ‎
         increasing the treatment CD4 threshold to 500 would increase ART coverage cost by an
estimated ‎ 12% over the four NSP years. By 2017, ART coverage cost would be an extra Euro 2.7
million (USD ‎ 3.6 million) annually. Management costs are currently expected to grow far faster
than inflation ‎
               (4% population growth, +3% currency inflation). If these costs grew at the inflation
rate instead, Euro 1.7 ‎  million (USD 2.3 million) could be saved over the four NSP years, as
shown in Figure 31. ‎

NSP 2013–17: Financing needs and gaps
The NSP 2013–17 envisages a reduction in the number of new HIV infections by 50%, and a
further ‎
        expansion in access to ARV treatment to at least 80% of eligible people. Annual spending
‎
under the NSP is projected to increase steeply from Euro 8.8 million (USD 11.7 million) in 2013 to
‎
Euro 18.0 million (USD 23.9 million) in 2017. Table 6 presents the acquired NSP funding,
estimated ‎needs and funding gaps ‎

    For the remaining four years of the NSP, only 35% of the total NSP-projected spending of
     Euro 69.2 ‎
               million/USD 93.1 million had been secured by December 2013 (leaving a funding
                      million/USD 60.4)‎
     gap of Euro 44.9 ‎

    While NSP-projected spending was fully acquired for 2014, only 31%, 6% and 1.5% had been
     acquired for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively ‎

Concerning the longer-term financial consequences of the national response to HIV/AIDS, the
cost projections under the NSP do not provide the long term picture.
 On the expenditure side, the expansion of access to treatment has consequences that
    extend well beyond 2017. Individuals who newly access treatment in 2013–17 will require
    ‎
    treatment well into the future—the expansion in access to treatment therefore commits
    financial ‎
              resources beyond the NSP period

    From the savings side, the increased investments in HIV prevention and treatment
     reduce future ‎  spending needs that would be associated with future incidence. A lower
     number of HIV infections reduce the ‎   demand for HIV/AIDS-related services and resulting
     costs in future years. These future savings need to be taken into ‎
                                                                       account when evaluating the
     consequences‎‎  of the NSP absorbing fiscal space

The projected costs of the national response to HIV/AIDS that are based on the costing of the
NSP ‎estimates provided by authorities through 2017, but are extended through 2030, are

                                  Cost assumptions for prevention spending are aligned with the NSP assumptions through
                                   ‎
                                   2017. Thereafter, prevention spending is assumed to increase in proportion to the size of the
                                   relevant population (e.g., all adults, or—for PMTCT—HIV-positive women), keeping coverage
                                   ‎
                                         of the relevant interventions constant‎
                                   rates ‎

                                  For treatment, unit costs were set at set at Euro 310 (USD 400) for first-line ART and Euro
                                   1,110 ‎(USD 1,430) for second-line ART, based on NASA expenditure data for the ART
                                   program and the ‎ number of patients treated in 2012. This is higher than the assumptions in
                                   the NSP/Resource ‎   Needs Model costing—which covered ARV drug costs only—in order to
                                   include additional costs of a ‎
                                                                 comprehensive ART service such as laboratory monitoring costs,

                                  Social mitigation spending is taken from the NSP costing through 2017, and is assumed to
                                   grow in ‎ proportion to the relevant population (PLHIV and AIDS orphans, respectively)

                                  Overhead expenses are set at 13% of direct costs (or 12% of total costs), in line with the

The projected costs of the national response to HIV/AIDS increase steeply during the NSP

 The largest driver of costs is increasing HIV prevention spending. This reflects increasing
    ‎
    coverage rates of HIV prevention interventions during the NSP, but also high population
    growth ‎(according to the World Population Profile 2012, the adult population (15+ years) of
                          grow by 3.6% annually and 88% overall between 2013 and 2030)‎

              The costs of HIV/AIDS care and treatment increase steeply, as treatment coverage ‎        is
               assumed to increase to 80% during the NSP. Thereafter, the number of people on treatment
                  projected to keep increasing—a consequence of people who newly need and access
               is ‎
               treatment, ‎
                          coupled with low mortality rates when on treatment (see in following section and
               footnote)‎

              While the costs of the national response to HIV/AIDS are projected to increase in absolute
               terms, ‎
                      the costs peak at 0.29% of GDP in 2017, and decline to 0.22% of GDP in 2030
               (assuming that GDP ‎   growth rates above 5%, as projected in the IMF World Economic
               Outlook, until 2018, can be maintained over this period)

Anticipated impacts of the investments under the NSP
2013–17‎
The scaling-up of HIV prevention and treatment envisaged under the NSP results in a steep
decline ‎
        in HIV incidence and mortality (Figure 34). While the number of PLHIV declines overall,
the number ‎of people receiving ARV treatment increases44 (Figure 35).‎




44
                     The emphasis of the analysis is the long-term financial consequences of the HIV/AIDS program and especially of
                     new HIV infections. While access to second-line treatment plays a small role in Niger at present, the importance
                     may increase over the next year, and (because of higher unit costs) contribute significantly to long-term cost. The
                     current projections therefore make a small allowance for transition to second-line treatment (1% of people on first-
                     line treatment annually).

Longer-term costs of responding to HIV and future
savings
Until 2030, the costs of the national response to HIV/AIDS will be dominated by prevention
spending ‎and the demand from people already living with HIV as of 2013 (Figure 36), for three
reasons:‎
 Low mortality on HIV treatment means that people already receiving treatment in 2013 tend
       remain on treatment over a long period ‎
    to ‎
                                                                            Financing needs and fiscal space implications of HIV investments      53



                              HIV infections translate into a demand for HIV/AIDS-related services and spending slowly‎

                              Because the NSP is preceded by a period in which HIV incidence was already in decline, the
                               number of new HIV infections—relative to the number of people who were already HIV

 The estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made for mortality on treatment. The

                               costs ‎resulting from one additional HIV infection would be substantial. An additional 1%
                               annually in AIDS-‎ related mortality reduces the estimated cost resulting from each new HIV

DALYs ‎were included (see main report for research questions). ‎

A1.2. Population groups and transmission pathways
The following populations were defined for the Optima analysis (maximum of 14 are possible):‎

1. Children aged 0–14 years (CHLD)‎

2. Females aged 15–24 years (FYTH)‎

3. Males aged 15–24 years (MYTH)‎

4. Females aged 25–49 years (FAD)‎

5. Males aged 25–49 years (MAD)‎

6. Females aged 50+ years (FOLD)‎

7. Males aged 50+ years (MOLD)‎

8. Female sex workers (FSW)‎

9. Prisoners (PRI)‎

10. Migrants and mobile populations (MIG)‎

11. Men who have sex with men (MSM)‎

12. Uniformed security (UNI)‎

13. Mine workers (MIN)‎

14. Truckers (TRU)‎

We assume HIV transmission between these populations only occurs through sexual
partnerships. ‎
              All male populations were assumed to partner with all female populations, except
that males did ‎not pair with females older than themselves, and males paired with females, at
most, one age ‎ stratification younger than themselves (e.g. males 50+ did not form partnerships
with females <24). ‎MSM partnered only with each other.‎

1.   Targeted FSW intervention package

2. Prevention services targeted at MARPs like prisoners, military personnel, truckers, migrants,
   MSM (IEC, BCC, ‎ condom promotion, HIV counseling and testing)‎

5. Social marketing of condoms

6. PMTCT

7. Antiretroviral treatment services

8. OVC support


A1.4. Overview of the Optima methodology
The Optimization and Prioritization Tool Optima (formerly Prevtool) is an extremely flexible
‎
population-based HIV model. Optima can assess HIV epidemic trends, resource needs, the cost-
‎
effectiveness of past programs, and the impact of potential future programs using a detailed
‎
mathematical model of HIV transmission and disease progression. Optima can perform detailed
‎
country-specific HIV program evaluations, and can build on the results from other models (like
Goals) ‎to assess allocative efficiency and the resources required to achieve complex objectives
     varying periods.‎
over ‎

Up to 14 arbitrarily defined population groups are available within Optima to describe the specific
‎
characteristics of an HIV epidemic. Optima incorporates a model of HIV transmission and
‎
progression using a coupled system of ordinary differential equations to track the movement of
‎
people between health states and population groups. Individuals are assigned to a given
‎
population based on their dominant risk. The model incorporates the effects of different sexual
‎
partnership types, condom use, infection stage, CD4 count categories, homosexual and
‎
heterosexual partnerships, the extent of male circumcision, diagnosis, first and second line anti-
retroviral treatment, and treatment failure, on the transmission of HIV and infection progression.‎
‎

Optima requires detailed demographic, epidemiological, behavioral, clinical, and health economic
‎
data which is entered using an Excel spreadsheet. Data entry is flexible, allowing for everything
from a ‎separate data point for every population for each year, or a single data point for all
populations ‎over the entire simulation period (Optima assumes that parameters with no data are
zero). Using ‎available data, we calibrated Optima to accurately represent past and current trends
in Niger’s‎ HIV‎ ‎
                 epidemic. The model uses healthcare costs and disability-weights specified by
CD4 count to ‎ perform cost-effectiveness and return-on-investment calculations. ‎

Given available coverage, spending and outcome data for implemented HIV prevention and
‎
treatment programs, Optima can determine the optimal allocation of resources or the amount of
‎
spending required to meet specified objectives (e.g., minimizing infections, minimizing AIDS
‎
deaths) or a combination of objectives. The model also enables additional programmatic
scenarios ‎
          representing the potential introduction of new programs or changes to current program
implementation as required. ‎

A1.5. Optima calibration to the HIV epidemic in Niger
We used all available demographic, epidemiological, behavioral, and clinical data to calibrate the
‎
Optima model to the HIV epidemic in Niger (shown in Figure 38 and Figure 39).‎

‎n general, prevalence in Niger is declining rapidly in most population groups, due to both
I
‎
reductions in incidence and deaths of people currently living with HIV. Exceptions include MSM,
‎
migrants, and prisoners, for whom there are not sufficient data to confidently determine epidemic
trends; however, current indications are that prevalence is relatively stable among these groups.‎

A1.6. Comparison between Optima and Spectrum
      estimates
Part of the calibration process involved aligning the future epidemic trends projected by Optima
‎
with estimates from the Spectrum software package. Figure 40 shows how the projections from
‎
Optima compare to Spectrum estimates for overall prevalence, overall incidence, mother-to-child
‎
transmission and AIDS deaths (revised Niger Spectrum version of 2013).‎

Annex Figure 3.                                                                                      annual
                  Comparison of annual new HIV infections, annual mother-to-child transmissions, and ‎
AIDS deaths estimated by Optima and Spectrum over 2000–20




Note: Prevalence from Optima is ‎the prevalence in the overall population while the HIV prevalence from Spectrum is for
      population 15 years old and over. ‎

Optima captures the same epidemiological trends as that obtained from the Spectrum software
‎
package (revised Niger Spectrum version, 2013). There are differences, however, in the
projections ‎
            from each model, particularly for overall HIV prevalence and annual HIV incidence.
The reason for ‎these differences between the models—despite using the same demographic,
                 behavioral and clinical data inputs—is due to differing model structures and
epidemiological, ‎
modeling ‎assumptions. ‎

Both Spectrum and Optima are deterministic population-based models using similar modeling
‎
methods to describe HIV epidemics and assess the effectiveness of HIV prevention programs.
Each ‎model describes the transmission of HIV and the resulting change in CD4 count within
those ‎
      infected. Spectrum uses a greater number of CD4 count categories but Optima includes
60   Annex A1.1–A1.7 | Niger’s‎HIV‎response: Targeted investments for a healthy future



diagnoses ‎ and the impact of testing, first and second line ART and treatment failure, and the
impact of ‎
          treatment on CD4 cot. Mortality of HIV-positive people is dependent on the CD4 count
               with Spectrum using lower death rates than Optima. ‎
in both models ‎

The major difference between Spectrum and Optima is the underlying structure of the models.
‎
Spectrum uses a generic population structure dividing the overall population into low, medium,
‎
and high-risk groups and separate most-at-risk populations with associated partnerships. In this
‎
analysis Optima is set up to directly match the characteristics of the Nigerian HIV epidemic and
‎
include all populations driving the HIV epidemic (many of which cannot be included in
Spectrum)—with transmission able to match the partnership mixing in Niger, rather than using
              partnerships. ‎
pre-specified ‎


A1.7. Relationships between program costs and effects
      on behavior and program coverage‎
A central component of our analyses is the relationships between the cost of HIV prevention
‎
programs and the resulting population coverage and behavioral outcomes. Such relationships are
‎
required to understand how incremental changes in spending ultimately affect HIV epidemics and
‎
determine the optimal funding allocation. For each population, we derived a set of relationships
‎
directly linking estimated funding to coverage and associated behavioral data. To produce these
relationships‎we‎used‎an‎ecological‎“top-down”‎approach‎to‎relate‎program‎cost‎and‎outcomes.‎
‎
‎
Indirect costs have no direct impact on HIV transmission parameters, but changes to HIV
programs ‎  may affect these costs, for example in the supply of additional condoms. The proportion
of funding ‎ allocated to indirect costs is assumed to remain the same as the overall HIV program
budget ‎ changes. A limitation of our approach is the assumption that all changes in behavior are
assumed to ‎  be due to changes in program funding.‎
