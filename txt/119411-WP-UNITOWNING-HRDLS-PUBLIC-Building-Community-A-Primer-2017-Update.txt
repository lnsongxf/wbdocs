INTRODUCTION

This primer provides concrete steps and tools to help you build a community of practitioners and/or online
community in the context of the World Bank Group (WBG). Here when we use the word “community” we mean
either community of practice or online community in the WBG context. We will differentiate between the two
where needed.

The primer is divided into four sections:
• Community Design and Building
• Community Management
• Work Book
• Resources


Community and community building will vary in its audiences—geographically, culturally, linguistically,
politically, historically, and economically—and in its implementation given all these different contexts, but the
principles remain consistent. This primer expands on these principles within the framework of the WBG.

How to Use this Primer
For those of you who have not taken the Community Management Training, and have not had any other formal
community management training or experience, it is recommended that you go through the material in the
order that it is presented.

If you have taken community management training or are an experienced community manager, use this primer
for reference as you go through the process of building your community, dipping into it where and when
appropriate.

Feedback
We would love to hear from you about how you are using the primer, including any errors you find, omissions of
material that you would like to see included, and other suggestions that you might have.

Conducting an Audience
Analysis
The audience analysis helps you get to
know and understand your potential
members—especially what motivates them
and what they value. Why is this important?
A community is made up of the people who
decide to join it and make it come alive. If you
don’t have members who actively participate
in the community, then you don’t have a
community.
But how do you make sure that members              Figure 5: Open Learning Campus
actively participate? This is the biggest
challenge for anyone who has tried to build
a community here at the WBG. You need to
provide value to your members!
Think of yourself: would you take time to
participate in something that doesn’t offer
you any value? Probably not. Your community
members feel the same way! But how do
you know what value you can provide to
your members? Yes, you might have some
ideas, but don’t assume! You might be wrong.
You need to analyze your audience—your
potential members—to understand what
they value that you can offer them.
Community is all about shared value. A
community has to provide value, and this
value is a combination of business value
(what value does the community provide to
the organization?) and member value (what
value does the community provide to its
members?).

Interviewing the Core Group
In order to co-design the community with
the Core Group, you should discuss with the
Team key aspects of the community. In doing
so, you can refer to the “Core Group Interview
Template,” p.53, where you’ll find questions to
discuss divided in three areas:
    Domain
    Community
    Practice

Principles of Good Community Design


Before embarking on the design of your community you should be aware of some of the major principles of community design because
designing a community is not like designing any other organizational structure. A community should not mirror the institutional structure—
even when institutionalized, such as the Global Solution Groups at the WBG. Remember, its membership is voluntary and there are no
reporting relationships.
We recommend that you follow 10 key                      identified are not official positions

                                    Designing the Home Page
Figure 14: Examples of Home Pages   There are many ways you can design your
                                    home page.

                                    Two Contrasting Examples of Home
                                    Pages
                                    Here are examples of the home pages of
                                    two communities of practice set up on a
                                    collaboration platform.
                                    The home page in the first example might
                                    look neater and better organized, but it does
                                    not put members at its center. In fact, it looks
                                    like a web site.
                                    On the other hand, the home page in the
                                    second example is all about its members:
                                    you can see easily and immediately what
                                    the most recent member content is, who
                                    the new members are, what the latest
                                    discussions are with the newest questions,
                                    and who the week’s leaders in the
                                    community are.
                                    It’s true that it looks messy and its layout
                                    can definitely be improved, but what is much
                                    more important is that it puts members at
                                    the center. When you see this home page
                                    you can tell it’s a community! As a result, the
                                    community in the second example has much
                                    more member participation than the first
                                    one.
                                    Many people focus on having a fancy
                                    design for their community’s home page.
                                    While visuals are important and it’s good
                                    to have a well-executed design, that is
                                    not a determining factor for the success
                                    of your community and it definitely should
                                    not supersede member focus. Remember
                                    this: an online community is not a web site!
                                    When members—and, just as importantly,

WBG Home Page Example
Let’s take a look at a WBG example               Figure 15: WBG CoP Example
of a community home page, the
KnowledgeMatters! community.
The KnowledgeMatters! Community is one
of the more active communities at the WBG.
The key elements in the home page design
are:
    Members—Member activity under
      “RECENT ACTIVITY” is visible at the
      center of the home page, signaling
      to visitors that this platform is about
      members
    Relevance and Timeliness—The latest
      content is featured prominently under
      “Recent Activity.”
Note also the call-to-action: “Don’t forget to
@Mention your posts,” a feature that notifies
the person you are referring to directly.
So, three elements make this an eye-
catching home page that will encourage
participation: member activity is front and
center, content is relevant and timely, and
there is a clear call to action.
When designing your community’s home
page, these three elements should be the
core concern. In addition, bear in mind
                                                 Creating the Community Description

Creating a High-Level Community
Calendar
A high-level community calendar helps
you plan the major activities for a specific
timeframe, whether it’s a semester or a year.
This type of calendar should be planned with
the Core Group and should be shared with
them and your team. It can also be shared
with members if you wish, so that they know
what major activities are on the horizon.
The nice thing about this calendar is that
it’s visually very clear and straight-forward,
using icons to indicate e-discussions on the
online platform (the “@” symbol), webinars
(the camera), and face-to-face events (two
people shaking hands).
Also, in this high-level calendar you can see
how the community has an e-discussion
before and after each webinar or face-to-
face event. This shows you how they planned
to leverage webinars and face-to-face

      will learn what each new member is
      interested in so you’ll be able to make
      specific asks. Conversely, if you invite
      too many members at once, you won’t
      be able to focus on them individually,
      and they will be much less likely to
      become active in the community.

Inviting Members en Masse
Of course, if you have a large potential
membership base of, let’s say more than
500 members, you should stop the process
of inviting members in waves and start            “Adding and
doing larger group invitations, or invite

Learning about New Members
There are several ways that you can get to
know new members, especially if they are
WBG staff:
    SkillFinder Profile—For each new
      member who is WBG staff, you can
      do some research online by looking at
      their SkillFinder profile.
                                                     TIP

    LinkedIn—You should also search for

DEFINING AND PLANNING YOUR COMMUNITY
MODULE 1

1. Competitive Analysis
Before starting a community you need to know if there is demand. The first thing to look at is what’s already out there in your domain and
how the community you have in mind might fit into the wider ecosystem. The competitive analysis helps you avoid re-creating what already
exists, and also provides you with valuable insights into how relevant communities, mailing groups, and social gatherings function, which
areas of a domain they do and do not cover, and how they engage their members. This analysis also helps you identify the right niche for your
community.

How to Find Existing Communities
Ask your target audience (potential members) what communities and associations they belong to, what meetings and conferences they
attend and so on. See the “Habits” section of the “Audience Analysis Template.”

Search on CommunityFinder for WBG communities. You can also search Spark (internal) and C4D (external) to find other relevant groups.

NOTE: When using CommunityFinder, note that you can visit the community’s platform by clicking on “Visit Community” in the top right corner.
In case a community doesn’t have a platform, see if it has an e-mail distribution list and if you could join it, or simply contact the community
leader and discuss your questions with her/him.

Use a search engine to search for external communities. Make sure that you search not only for the specific topic but also add key words such
as “community”, “network”, “group”, “forum”, and “professionals.”

Important Note: If you don’t find a community like the one you have in mind, it might not necessarily mean that you have found a niche to fill.
It might also mean that there is no interest in that topic. This is where the Audience Analysis comes in handy.

 What You Need to Know About Existing Communities (online and face-to-face, inside and outside WBG)
 What are the existing communities within the domain?


 How active are they?


 Which are the most successful ones?


 What makes them successful (unique design, top members, culture/
 personality, types of conversations, leader’s involvement, etc.)?


 What type of communities are they (interest, place,
 practice, action, circumstance, or a combination)?

What You Need to Answer About Existing Communities
What niche should I focus on?

How would my community fit within the ecosystem?

Could it develop as a sub-community of a broader
existing one?

What’s the added value my community would bring?

How could my community leverage the existing ones?

How would my community stand out?

2. Audience Analysis - Habits
You need to know both online and offline habits of your target audience, that is, what they do.



Specifically, if you plan to use an online platform, you need to know what potential members do online, what internet tools they use, what they
read, what they do in their spare time, and when they are usually online.



Each answer is essential to creating a practical community development plan and ensuring the community remains relevant to its members’
experiences. Ultimately, the community serves to improve the lives of its members. You need to know as much as possible about the current
lives of members to achieve this.



NOTE: You can write the questions and answers directly into the following template, or create a survey in a survey program (for example,
SurveyMonkey, TypeForm, Google Forms, etc.). Using a survey program enables you to more easily aggregate and analyze the results.

3. Audience Analysis - Psychographics
Most positioning efforts for a community are based upon psychographics: an organization has to thoroughly understand the individuals it is
trying to reach. This helps in segmenting the target audience and conceptualizing the community.



To identify and interview potential members of your community, follow this process:
1.	 Narrow down your target audience using at least two qualifiers (for example, Geophysicists in Latin America)

2.	 Use SkillFinder to identify 10 potential members of the community you have in mind.

3.	 Select 3 potential members.

4.	 Interview them asking at least 3 questions on psychographics (what they think). Ask one question on challenges, one on experiences, and
one on aspirations.

5.	 See if there are any common patterns and try to write a paragraph that represents the psychographic profile of a generic potential member
of your community.

6.	 Record interviews with 5-10% potential members, for no longer than 15 minutes each.

7.	 From these data, several common characteristics should emerge. List these characteristics in each category in order of importance to your
members.

During the interview process, respondents might wander “off topic”. Listen to and respect what they say. You might learn something new
and of value; it might challenge your initial assumptions of who should be in this community and what it is for. Also, if certain themes start
emerging, you might want to refine your questions as you go forward.

4. What’s Your Community’s Pitch to Members?
After having completed the competitive and the audience analysis, you should be able to transform the initial idea you (and/or your manager)
have of the community you would like to create into a short description that is based on what would make your community unique and what
could appeal to its potential members.

You should think of this short description as an “elevator pitch”, no longer than a couple of paragraphs, which you would tell a potential
member if you met her/him in an elevator. Develop a “WOW – HOW – NOW” approach:

• WOW – think of a “WOW” opening that will get their attention.

• HOW – explain briefly how your community addresses a need or solves a problem, and give example(s)

• NOW – what action you or they can take NOW

 Instructions                                                       Your Community Pitch
 1. Think of who the community is for and of a “WOW” opening to get
 their attention

 E.g. Did you know that…? Do you want more X…? The secret of X is… Avoid
 (X problem) once and for all! Imagine if you could… Did you realize that…?
 True or false…? Wouldn’t you agree that...


 2. Identify HOW the community helps its members

   a. State a concrete benefit or value

 E.g. Solve a problem, make a difference, add value, bring result, change a
 process, transform something, provide a benefit


  b. Give an example that illustrates impact or potential impact.
 Make sure the example is relevant to your pitch target group.

 E.g. A community member was able to get feedback on a proposal by
 starting a discussion with and getting response from fellow community
 members.
 3. Call to action: what can they or you do NOW – make it concrete:

 E.g. They can join the community, or refer a colleague to the community.
 You can refer them or connect them with someone, offer a resource, share
 research.

1. Community Value
A community has to provide value to both members and the sponsoring organization, which is the WBG in our case. You also have to think
about value both in the short term and in the long term.

Use the following Value Matrix Template to identify the Short Term value and Long Term value that your community provides or will provide to
both Members and the Organization.

2. Core Group Interview
The purpose of this interview/these interviews is to involve the Core Group in the process of designing the community of practice, so that
they also feel ownership and are more committed to its success. Once the interview is completed, the community charter can be finalized.

This could be a group interview or a series of one-on-one interviews. While more difficult to convene, the group interview is more beneficial
as participants are able to collaborate and start feeling a sense of community from the beginning and to build on each other’s ideas. While the
community manager can help with setting up the interview and with taking notes, the community leader should lead it because of his/her
sectorial knowledge. The questions following are provided to guide you on what should be addressed and are not meant to be exhaustive. Use,
replace, delete, and augment, as appropriate for your community.

3. From Inputs to Outcomes
In order to make sure that a community delivers value, first you have to decide which Outcomes you would like to have as results of your
community’s activities.

Once you have decided the Outcomes, you also have to think clearly about the Inputs and the Outputs that are necessary to obtain those
outcomes.

NOTE: Your Outcomes should be aligned with each Short/Long Term Value you decided on (for Members and the Organization) using the Value
template

(RE)LAUNCHING YOUR COMMUNITY
MODULE 3

1. Convening Venues
Each community uses a combination of convening venues to create opportunities for its members to interact in person and online: email,
audio and video conferencing, webinars, events; BBLs, and online platforms. Choose a combination of convening venues you plan to use for
your community, including how you might combine them so that they reinforce one another, for example, an online Learning Circle after a
training event, or follow-up online discussions and after a conference.

2. Core Group Onboarding Activities
The first members to use the main convening venue you selected should be your Core Group members. This is particularly important when
the convening venue is an online platform. You should make sure that you train your Core Group members to make sure they know how to use
the venue you have selected, particularly the platform.

Together with your Core Group members, you should also select a number of initial activities to make the Core Group comfortable with
the platform and also to create initial content and engagement within your community. These activities should last until the Core Group is
comfortable with the platform (around two weeks). Use the following template to select the activities you are going to use to onboard your
Core Group members. Include why you chose them and how they might be combined. Use, replace, delete, and augment, as appropriate for
your community.

3. Community Description
The community description is the first presentation of your community to a visitor. This is particularly true for closed and private communities
where visitors can see only the community description before becoming members. The goal of the community description is to convert
visitors into members by attracting your target audience to join.

Try to use around 50 words (think of an elevator pitch). Your description should cover three core and possibly two more optional points.

 Guidelines and Examples                                              Your Community Description
 1. Welcome the visitors (OPTIONAL)

 E.g. “WELCOME!” “Welcome to the ACU – the Africa Credit Union commu-
 nity of practice.”


 2. State who your community is for

 E.g. “This is the dedicated space for credit union experts and professionals
 in Africa”


 3. Describer your audience’s specific needs and
 challenges

 E.g. “Here you can find resources and advice from peers and other experts
 that will help you save time and be more efficient with limited resources”


 4. State the concrete benefit the community offers to prospective
 members

 E.g. “As a member of a community of top experts in the field, you will have
 access to the latest innovations that will help you deliver better products
 to your clients”


 5. Outline the big vision? (OPTIONAL – Only if it fits/makes sense)

 E.g. “Together we will make finance more accessible and lift thou-
 sands of people out of poverty,”

PLANNING FOR YOUR NEXT 3 MONTHS
MODULE 4

1. Create your CM Calendar for the First Four Weeks
A high-level community calendar helps you plan the major activities for a specific timeframe like a year or to the end of the financial or
calendar year. This type of calendar should be produced collaboratively by the Core Group.

You should also create a detailed content calendar especially for the first four weeks specifying what activities are going on in the community
and what content is to be produced and distributed, for example, a blog post every Thursday afternoon. As your community progresses, you
should be able to ascertain what content resonates with your members, in what format, and at what times (morning, evenings, weekends, and
so on)

In this phase, the first four weeks, the focus should be on growth, moderation, and influence/relationships in particular. However, feel free
to expand based on your community’s unique characteristics. Events would also be posted on a traditional but shared online community
calendar, where members can advertise other events.

2. Welcome Message
The welcome message is your first interaction with a new member. The goal of the welcome message is to get a member to take a specific
step. Try to use around 50 words (think of an elevator pitch). Your description should cover three, or possibly four points. It’s important that
you know who you are talking to so that you can choose the right tone.


                                                         Welcome Message Template
 Guidelines and Examples                                             Your Message
 1. Address the person personally whether formally or informally

 E.g. “Dear Director Garcia”, “Dear Mr. Jones”, “Dear Maria”, “Hi Camilla”,
 “Ivan!”....”
 2. Welcome the new member to the community and express your
 honor/pleasure/excitement

 E.g. “Welcome to (name of community). I am very pleased that you are
 joining us.” “Welcome! I’m so excited that you are joining us!”
 3. Say something that you know the new member is interested in and
 relate it to the scope of the community (OPTIONAL – Only: in early
 stage/if person matters particularly to the community)

 E.g. “I read your recent blog post on the water sanitation project you
 are working on in Honduras and found it very stimulating. We have
 several members who have experience in this field who might help
 you with some of the challenges you are facing.”
 4. Have a clear call to action (CTA) with a link – Ideally have one call to
 action and not more than two

 E.g. “We are having an engaging e-discussion on water sanitation
 that you will find very interesting. Please, share your experience [link]”
 “Next month/week we will have a conference/webinar on water
 sanitation that you might want to consider attending. Here’s where
 you can find information and sign up [link]” “We have a new members’
 area; here’s where you can find information on how to participate in
 the community [link]”


 5. Ask the new member to introduce herself/himself to the communi-
 ty (OPTIONAL – If you have a “new members section” or an “introduce
 yourself” thread. Do NOT do if you already have two calls of action!)

 E.g. “Please, introduce yourself to the community so that we can get
 to know you [link]”
 6. Let know that you are reachable

 E.g. “If you have questions or need assistance you can always reach
 me at….”

3. Community Charter
After you have analyzed the community landscape for your domain, identified and discussed with your Core Group, your community’s value
and your member characteristics, needs, and motives, you’ll be able to draft your community’s charter.

   Community description
   As countries in South Eastern Europe (SEE) work to develop indicators and targets for inclusive growth as part of the European Union
   accession process, commonalities in economic systems, history and culture provide the basis to learn from each other and for the cross
   fertilization of ideas. Our community serves as a platform to increase the dialogue and coordination across sectors to focus on inclusive
   job growth in the region and to tackle unemployment.

   Uniqueness
   It is the only online community in the region that addresses the unemployment issue through a multi-sector lens.

   Successful engagements in the past fiscal year and measures of success
   The skills conference in Vienna, Austria, brought together members of the community to share findings on survey results looking at
   skills that are in demand from employers and the type of skill sets workers offer in the region. One of the key challenges identified at
   the conference was the lack of robust data and information available for countries in SEE. This underlying challenge among all SEE
   countries provided the evidence for the need to set up a labor market observatory in the region to be able to collect and monitor data and
   information on labor market trends.
   We measured the success of the conference by the number of presentations by country members and how effectively they communicated
   their analysis in illustrating the need for better collection and monitoring of data and information. The members successfully




                                                                                                                                                4
   communicated their findings and we secured additional funding from donors to initiate the process of setting up a labor market
   observatory for the region. The gathering of members at the conference was the catalyst to receiving continued support on activities to
   tackle the unemployment challenge in the region and further project objectives.

   How community has made a difference to members.
   What members are saying?
   The community has provided:
         Invaluable insights into the issues neighboring countries are facing, and how they are confronting them.
         An opportunity to meet and discuss with regional counterparts challenges that we all face.
         Learning about new and creative ways to solve problems.
         Ability to ask questions and get advice from global experts.
         Requests for more knowledge exchange events.

  Community description
  The KnowledgeMatters! Community has three key objectives:
    •	 Collecting and leveraging institutional knowledge & experience around Knowledge Management and Learning,
    •	 Connecting professionals and providing an enabling environment for collaboration.
    •	 Competencies application and professional development.


  Uniqueness
  Although Knowledge Management is of strategic importance and critical to the WBG’s role as a Solutions Bank, the KnowledgeMatters!
  community is the only entity where Knowledge Management & Learning professionals, as well as operational staff, come together and
  discuss how the WBG can efficiently and effectively bring top technical knowledge, expertise and value to their clients from across the
  WBG.

  Successful engagements in the past fiscal year and measures of success
  Although relatively new, the community has a very active Spark group, high attendance at several events, and steep growth in membership.
  One important focus is addressing key knowledge and learning issues faced by members across the WBG. For example, improvements to
  the GP Portals, which many members were dealing with separately, were addressed collectively after a community meeting to aggregate
  the recommendations.
  Success (at this time) is measured by attendance, activity online and feedback from members. The CN has more quantitative metrics linked
  to operational staff.

  How community has made a difference to members.
  What members are saying
  We have become the group that connects KM and Learning staff across the WBG in the absence of a formal structure. Members are very
  satisfied that the community provides them with this opportunity and are voting with their feet as they attend our events in high numbers.

  Community description
  The Social Inclusion Global Support Group (GSG) community of practice connects TTLs, consultants, and various teams working in all
  regions and across many sectors on issues related to social inclusion. Coordination, and connecting practitioners to each other, as
  well as highlighting lessons learned, are important parts of the work of the GSG.


  Uniqueness
  What is social inclusion can be broadly understood. Our community therefore brings together specialists working on such seemingly
  diverging issues as gender in transport and education of indigenous peoples. However, there is a common thread—paying attention to the
  needs of those typically overlooked and excluded from development.

  Successful engagements in the past fiscal year and measures of success
        Learning opportunities: webinar series on social inclusion and podcasts (growing number of participants, follow up queries),
          learning workshops (participation from across GPs and CCSAs, event evaluations, informal feedback] and GSG meetings.
        Online engagement on SPARK—members posting blog posts, comments, and sharing information about events and updates.
          (SPARK membership, number of posts and views).

  How community has made a difference to members.
  What members are saying
  We are working closely with the regions. Members appreciate the opportunity to learn from one another. We recently held a workshop
  where colleagues working on IP issues in LAC and other regions were able to learn from the Roma program in ECA.

  Community description
  SecureNutrition works to bridge the operational knowledge gaps between nutrition and its underlying drivers, across a wide range of
  sectors and GPs. We offer: a curated resource library; original learning events, blogs and newsletters; forum space on LinkedIn, social
  media and email dissemination; and, networking to related partners and initiatives. The 6200 members make up the mailing list. In
  addition, the community encompasses a 550-member LinkedIn group.

  Uniqueness
  We connect GPs and external stakeholders around the multi-sector nutrition agenda, which is included in SDG2, World Health Assembly
  Targets, the SUN Movement, The Lancet, and elsewhere. While the GSGs aim to create this type of community, we already have 4 years of
  experience connecting sectors in the Bank, promoting exchange with other organizations, and developing a range of communication and
  community channels. In addition, we recently re-designed our knowledge management and community engagement strategy to focus
  better on TTLs.

  Successful engagements in the past fiscal year and measures of success
      Global Forum on Nutrition-Sensitive Social Protection Programs: A discussion-oriented forum in Moscow conducted in 6
        languages highlighting innovative projects happening inside and outside the World Bank.
        Success measured by # orgs represented, # WB staff present, # tweets, # learned something new, # likely to speak with
        colleagues afterwards, # likely to use ideas in next project or program.
      Social Protection and Nutrition: Pathways, Systems, and Country Experience: A learning event featuring Save the Children and
        WBG moderators from SP and Health.
        Success measured by # attendees, # orgs represented, # GPs represented, scale of usefulness for current work.

  How community has made a difference to members.
  What members are saying
  Condensing key information and moving implementation agendas forward are what makes a difference. SecureNutrition does this by
  providing bite-size synthesis of key reports, and creating original programming to fill evidence gaps.
