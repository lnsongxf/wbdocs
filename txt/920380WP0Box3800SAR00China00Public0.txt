THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

        In December 2008 a One Stop Center was established for Warehouse
        Construction Permits under the administration of the Efficiency Unit
        (EU) for receiving all relevant building license applications to 6
        government departments and 2 private utilities (i.e. telephone line and
        electricity supply) and coordinating their joint inspections for two-

        approval and consent for commencement of building works from
        Buildings Department, technical audit of water supply connection works
        by Water Supplies Department, and road excavation permit from both
        the Police and Highways Department. This new arrangement simplifies

      At the approval stage for building foundation plans, the Buildings
      Department normally imposes some requirements and conditions for
      the construction of the foundation to ensure that the approved plans
      and the required standards are complied with. Upon the completion of
      the foundation, Form BA 14 and as-built foundation records must be
2     submitted to notify the Buildings Department that the foundation work         2 days       no charge
      has been completed. The form must be approved by the Buildings
      Department before the next stage of construction can begin. The
      construction site is inspected within 7 days of the notification.

      Upon completion of construction, the following
      applications/notifications can be submitted in one visit to the One Stop
      Center for referral:

      (a) Application to the Drainage Services Department for technical audit
      for drainage connection works; HKD 4,340.00
      (b) Application to the Fire Services Department for issue of Fire Services
      Certificate (F.S. 172); HKD 3,440.00
      (c) Application to the Buildings Department for Occupation Permit;
      (d) Application to the Lands Department for issue of Certificate of
      Compliance (certificate is received through OSC)

        Internal wiring works before connection of supply should be carried out
        by a Registered Electrical Worker (REW) or a team of electricians led by a
        REW . When it comes to the stage that supply is connected (e.g. for
        testing or alteration after supply connection), the internal wiring works
        should be carried out by the REW.]

        The Registered Electrical Contractor (REC) and the REW should be
        registered with the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department
        (EMSD) of the Hong Kong SAR Government (www.emsd.gov.hk). The
        clients requesting electricity supply need to complete a supply
        application form and provide a document for identity verification (Copy
        of identity or Business Registration Certificate).                           8 calendar days        HKD 0

        The application form can serve the purpose of a supply contract. If the
        client signs on the application form, it implies that they accept our
        supply conditions. The supply conditions are detailed in the "Supply
        Rule", which can be obtained in our Company website.
        The client can submit the application for electricity connection with CLP

        CLP Power usually keep in close contact with prospective new customers
        so that a lot of supply provision preparation work would have been
        commenced/completed prior to receiving the actual new supply
        application from the new customers, thereby supply is always available
        before the occupant moves in.

      (a) Application for excavation permit

      An excavation permit is required for the excavation of cable trench in the
      public areas. The utility is required to apply to the relevant government
      departments for the permit. The time required depends on the
      responsiveness of government departments.

      The excavation permit will be applied for after the project planning
      stage. Since the permit will specify a limited work period, before applying
      for the permit, the utility will confirm with the client the target supply
      date and the target completion date of the work required by the client
      e.g. duct and draw pit. The excavation permit application cost is paid by
      the company and is not charged to clients as part of their cost for         29 calendar days       HKD 0

      connection.

      Efforts were made to reduce the time to obtain an excavation permit.
      The efforts consisted of setting up a liaison group with representatives of
      four relevant government departments, viz. Highways Department, Hong
      Kong Police Force, Transport Department and Economic Analysis &
      Business Facilitation Unit, and CLP Power Hong Kong Limited to examine
      and rationalize the procedures related to applications for excavation
      permits in connection with supply of electricity for 2-storey warehouses
      or similar industrial buildings. As a result, the following performance
      pledges are publicized
      (http://www.gov.hk/en/theme/bf/smart/efficiency/excavation.htm) :
      • Highways Department to complete initial assessment of an excavation
      proposal and approve an application for excavation permit within 1
      working day respectively;
Doing Business 2015                     Hong Kong SAR, China                                                             35




                                                                                        Time to

                                                                                       complete
      • Transport Department to process a proposed temporary traffic
      arrangement within 21 days; and
      • Highways Department and Hong Kong Police Force to accept advance
      notification of electricity companies 2 working days before the
      commencement of excavation works.

      These efforts were followed by another set of efforts to further reduce
      the time needed to obtain the permit: the government conducted a
      liaison group meeting with the CLP Power Hong Kong Limited to review
      the application process for excavation permits in connection with
      electricity supply for 2-storey warehouses in non-residential areas. As a
      result, the Transport Department has further streamlined its procedures
      and reduced the time for processing temporary traffic arrangement
      proposals from 21 days to 14 days. The relevant Guidance Note for the
      Highways Department, Hong Kong Police Force and Transport
      Department has been revised accordingly:

      ation%20for%20XP%20for%20Supply%20of%20electricity.pdf

      For continual improvement, the liaison group reviewed the application
      process in December 2011. The Hong Kong Police Force reduced the
      time for processing the lighting, signing and guarding proposal from 14
      days to 12 days. The Transport Department further reduced the time for
      processing temporary traffic arrangement proposals from 14 days to 12
      days.

      (b) Installation Work

      Processing time includes LV cable laying and jointing work on a trench
      (150m) with road crossing. (Construction phase)

      It excludes the advance notification for commencement of the works
      submitted to government departments after obtaining the excavation
      permit. This is also a time taken for manpower mobilization and material
      preparation. This is the Resource programming phase.

  No.    Procedure                                                                                Cost to complete
                                                                                       complete
        (Form WR1) by a registered electrical worker and contractor. A copy of
        the Work Completion Certificate (Form WR1) together with copies of
        Certificate of Registration of Electrical Contractor and Certificate of
        Registration of Electrical Worker should be forwarded to the Licensing
        Office as proof of compliance with the electricity safety requirements.”

        The Registered Electrical Worker in charge of the internal installation and
        final inspection signs the WR1 form, and submits it to the utility at the
        appointment for electricity turn-on.
        The client requests a final inspection for meter installation from CLP
        Power through the installation inspection appointment system of the
        utility. The final inspection does not cover the entire internal wiring, but
        only the interface with the external circuit. The WR1 form is enough to
        guarantee the wiring has been done in accordance with the electricity
        regulations.

        The meter will be installed and supply connected after satisfactory
        inspection of the internal wiring (not entire inspection; only for the
        interface with external network). The service pledge is to install the meter
        within the same day of the satisfactory inspection of the internal wiring.

       Purchaser’s solicitor does a land search at the Land Registry

       It is a common Procedure that the Buyer's solicitor will conduct a land
       search before execution of the Agreement for Sale and Purchase (ASP) to
       ensure that the previous registration title of the property is complete and
       that no unusual encumbrance is registered against the property. All
       land records are available for search by the public by doing an online
       search. The service hours of an online search services have been
       extended from 16 to 20 hours daily since August 2010. In 2010/11,
       searches conducted online constituted about 91% of the total search
       volume. It is a common Procedure that the Purchaser’s solicitor             Less than a day
   1   conducts a land search online on the day of execution of the agreement          (online            HKD 25
       for sale and purchase as a due diligence check. The prescribed fee is         procedure)
       HK$25 for a full land search (which provides all historical and current
       data affecting the property) and HK$10 for an up-date land search
       (which provides the current data). This will take about one (1) day and in
       fact, immediately if it is done through the online internet service
       provided by the Land Registry, which many law firms in Hong Kong
       would have subscribed to such service.

      Execution of Sale and Purchase Agreement and filing at the Land
      Registry

      The Purchaser’s solicitor registers the executed agreement for sale and
      purchase with the Land Registry. At this time, the Purchaser usually gives
      a 10% down payment on the property and has time to arrange financing
      for the remainder owed. During the 30-day period, the Purchaser’s
      solicitor prepares an Assignment deed. In addition, during this period of
      time, the Buyer's solicitor will complete perusal of title deeds and clarify      30 days           HKD 210

      executed agreement for sale and purchase has been registered with the
      Land Registry).

      * The Purchaser's solicitor settles the stamp duty payable with the
      Stamp Office via e-stamping

      All necessary forms and documents for stamping can be submitted
      online (www.gov.hk/estamping.) or in paper. The process of submission
      and payment is straight forward, details of the transaction are submitted
      over the internet, a stamp invoice is issued immediately which can be
      printed. After the online payment of stamp duty, solicitors can print the
      stamp certificates and attach them to the instruments as evidence of
      stamping. Payment of the stamp duty can be done using different
      methods, (PPS, MasterCard, and Visa). The current payment limits for
      credit cards are HK$5,000. If the duty amount exceeds the payment              Less than a day 7.5% stamp duty
      limits, payment can be made offline by printing a payment notice for               (online     for non-residential

      Office or Post Offices. After payment of stamp duty, a stamp certificate
      will be issued instantly and available for printing. Each stamp certificate
      will have its own "Stamp Certificate Number".
      For online payments and e-stamping, it is not required to present the
      original instruments to the Stamp Office. Details of the e-Stamping
      service in Hong Kong are available at
      www.ird.gov.hk/eng/tax/e_stamp.htm.

      Both methods fulfill the stamping requirement equally. Under the
      conventional method no stamp certificate is issued, instead, the relevant
      document (e.g. the assignment) would be stamped by the Stamp Office
      with the value of stamp duty paid.
