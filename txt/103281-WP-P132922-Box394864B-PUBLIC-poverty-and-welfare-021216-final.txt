             Analysis of Sri Lanka’s recent progress in reducing poverty and inequality is directly relevant
             to the new government’s development agenda. The newly sworn-in president ran for election
             on a platform that featured, among other goals, inclusive growth and support to the agricultural
             sector. The pursuit of these and other goals of the new administration can be informed by a fuller
             understanding of recent developments in household living standards across the country. Yet
             the World Bank’s most recent poverty assessment in Sri Lanka, covering the period from 1990
             to 2002, was published a decade ago. Since then, domestic economic growth, the end of the
             civil conflict, and fluctuations in global markets have led to substantial changes in Sri Lanka’s
             economic environment.


             To inform the new government’s development policies, this report examines five topics related to
             recent developments in poverty and welfare. Sections II through V of the report focus on (i) trends
             in poverty, welfare, and inequality since 2002, (ii) labor market outcomes associated with the
             observed reduction in poverty, (iii) four potential causes of this poverty reduction, (iv) the state of
             poverty and inequality in 2012/13, and (v) the role of social protection in reducing poverty. Section
             VI concludes by pointing out future implications and remaining knowledge gaps to continue to
             reduce poverty and improve living standards.


             This analysis draws mainly on data from the 2002, 2006/07, 2009/10, and 2012/13 rounds of the
             Household Income and Expenditure Survey, supplemented by annual rounds of the Labor Force
             Survey from 2002 to 2012. Since the surveys could not be conducted in parts of the Northern and
             Eastern provinces before 2011 due to the civil conflict, their geographical coverage varies from
             year to year. To ensure comparability, all historical trends presented in this report correspond to
             the same geographic area. With the exception of figures that are based solely on 2012/13 data,
             the figures exclude Northern and Eastern provinces, which account for about 12.9 percent of the
             total population. A more detailed description of the data is provided in Appendix 1.




                                                                                                                   5

                   Overall, Sri Lanka’s record of poverty reduction has been encouraging, mainly due to increased
                   labor earnings as demand for labor rose across a broad range of sectors. Excluding Northern and
                   Eastern provinces, the poverty headcount rate fell from about 22.7 percent in 2002 to 6.1 percent
                   in 2012/13. Per capita incomes also rose for the poor, corroborated by increases in the share of
                   consumption devoted to non-food items, ownership of durable goods, and school attendance.
                   Wages and employment grew as well, particularly in the manufacturing, construction, commerce,
                   transport, and communication sectors. Sizeable increases in agriculture minimum wages led to
                   higher earnings for agricultural workers.


                   While it is difficult to identify the underlying causes of this poverty reduction, this report focuses
                   on four potential factors. They include (i) the economy’s gradual structural transformation out of
                   agriculture into more productive sectors, (ii) urbanization and agglomeration around key urban
                   areas, (iii) rising international prices for food and tea that raised earnings in agriculture, and (iv)
                   strong domestic aggregate demand that has boosted economic growth.


                   Of these potential factors, a more rapid structural transformation and increased agglomeration
                   have the most potential to sustain poverty reduction in the future. Growth in the agricultural
                   sector during this period largely reflected rising prices and an expansion in arable land, neither
                   of which are likely to be sustained. Domestic aggregate demand, meanwhile, has been led by the
                   construction and transport sectors, spurred in part by public investment in the aftermath of the
                   conflict. These sectors, however, cannot be relied upon to produce sustained growth. This suggests
                   that efforts to further improve living standards of the poor focus on promoting further structural
                   transformation and urbanization.


                   Despite this recent progress, living standards remain low and pockets of severe poverty persist.
                   Around 40 percent of the population subsists on less than twice the poverty line, which was $2.75
                   per capita per day in 2005 PPP terms, or 225 rupees per day. Furthermore, living standards of the
                   near-poor – those above the national poverty line but below the 40th percentile -- are similar to
                   those of the poor. Moreover, low-income households’ ability to access basic services and public
                   facilities has barely improved since 2002. The population in Northern and Eastern provinces
                   is particularly disadvantaged in terms of consumption, labor market outcomes, educational
                   attainment, and housing conditions. Finally, inequality increased sharply from 2009/10 to 2012/13.

Spending on social assistance programs is low and has declined, and therefore contributed little
to poverty reduction. In the short run, more generous social assistance programs, as well as multi-
sectoral interventions targeted to the remaining pockets of poverty, can help support the existing
poor. In the longer term, adjustments to Sri Lanka’s social protection system are necessary to
address challenges related to a growing middle class and an aging population.


Policies can also do more to speed the structural transformation out of rural and peri-urban
agriculture into more productive work. Roughly 30 percent of the workforce, and about half of
the working poor, toil in the agriculture sector. Many of the poor live in peri-urban areas – over half
of the poor are estimated to live within 30 km of a main agglomeration area. Policies that help
connect these workers to productive employment opportunities off the farm can contribute to
sustainable poverty reduction.


Important knowledge gaps remain, however, starting with the relative importance of the four
potential factors described above in explaining the observed poverty reduction. Internal migration
and more detailed information on access to infrastructure have yet to be thoroughly investigated.
Nor does longitudinal data exist to examine how, or how frequently, households enter and exit
poverty. Little is known about the underlying causes of the rise in labor demand – did workers’
skills improve or was technology used more effectively? How much do labor regulations constrain
further growth in wage employment? Bridging these knowledge gaps and documenting how public
policies affect the poor can inform much-needed efforts to further improve their living standards.

                                 Poverty reduction since 2002 has been solid by regional standards. The poverty rate is defined as
                                 the proportion of the population whose household’s per capita expenditure falls below the poverty
                                 line. The current poverty line was set at Rs. 1,423 per person per day in 2002 rupee, and has been
                                 updated since using the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI). A new poverty line for 2012/13,
                                 which will more accurately reflect recent consumption patterns, is currently being developed. But
                                 under the current line, which allows for monitoring poverty trends, headcount poverty fell from
                                 22.7 percent to 6.1 percent between 2002 and 2012/13 in districts outside Northern and Eastern
                                 provinces (Figure 1).


                                 Sri Lanka’s poverty is low by international standards. For cross-country comparisons, the World
                                 Bank currently uses an extreme poverty line of USD 1.25 per person per day (in 2005 PPP terms).
                                 By this measure, extreme poverty in Sri Lanka decreased from 13 percent in 2002 to less than 3
                                 percent in 2012/13, and is lower than many of Sri Lanka’s neighbors, other post-conflict countries,
                                 and other comparable countries (see Figure 2).

                                 Notes: Poverty rates are obtained by inflating the 2002 poverty line to 2006/07 using the base 2002 CCPI and
                                 subsequently inflating the poverty line to 2009/10 and 2012/13 using the base 2006/07 CCPI. This, along with the
                                 exclusion of Northern and Eastern provinces, causes the results reported above to differ slightly from officially reported
                                 estimates.

                                2012/13. During the same period, the poverty severity index, which gives greater weight to those
                                further below the poverty line, also fell rapidly from 1.6 percent to 0.3 percent.

                                The recorded decrease in poverty is robust to a variety of methodological choices in constructing
                                the poverty line. These include the varying geographic coverage of the surveys described above,
                                the selection of the reference group from which the weights of the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
                                are determined, the inclusion of savings and durable goods in the consumption aggregate, and
                                the methods used to inflate the consumption aggregate over space and time. Robustness checks
                                show that these have minor effects on the estimated poverty rate. The most important issue is the
                                CPI, which is used to inflate the poverty line. Using unit values to measure food inflation instead of
                                the food component of the CPI could raise the estimated headcount ratio by a mild but noticeable
                                amount (see Appendix 3).

POvErTy IncIDEncE
The official poverty figures in Sri Lanka refer to the share of individuals whose household per
capita consumption falls below the official poverty line. This indicator is referred to as the
poverty headcount index and is the standard measure of the incidence of poverty.


The consumption aggregate used to calculate the headcount index is the sum of all food
and non-food expenditures collected in the Household Income and Expenditure Survey. The
consumption aggregate is spatially deflated, using unit values of expenditure items from
household survey, to take into account differences in the cost of living across different
districts. To obtain per capita consumption, the spatially deflated consumption aggregate
is divided by the number of household members, excluding those who are members of the
household but usually live elsewhere in the country or abroad. Once per capita household
consumption is calculated, it is then compared to the national poverty line. This line was
defined as the expenditure for a person to meet the daily calorie intake of 2,030 kcal based
on the Cost of Basic Needs approach, and was set at Rs 1,423 in 2002. For more recent
years, this line has been inflated using the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI), to keep the
national poverty line constant in real term since 2002.


To facilitate comparisons across countries, the World Bank uses a common poverty line
of USD 1.25 per person per day in 2005 PPP terms – approximately Rs 100 per day or Rs
3,100 per month in 2012/13 – to measure extreme poverty. This represents the mean of the
poverty lines found in the poorest 15 countries ranked by per capita consumption among 88
surveyed countries over the period 1990-2005 (Ravallion, Chen, and Sangraula, 2009). Other
commonly used poverty lines for international comparisons across middle-income countries
are USD 2.50 a day and USD 4.00 a day (2005 PPP), which correspond to, respectively, Rs
6,058 and Rs 9,692 a month in 2012/13 prices.


Sri Lanka’s national poverty line is equivalent to about USD 1.50 a day in 2005 PPP terms.
This is moderate by regional standards, but below what one might expect from a country at
Sri Lanka’s level of development (see Figure 4). The poverty line is based on consumption
patterns in 2002, which is likely to have changed significantly in the last decade, making it
important to update the current poverty line soon.

                               Although the headcount index is the most common measure of poverty, one shortcoming of
                               this measure is that it does not take into account the intensity of poverty, i.e. how far from the
                               poverty line the poor are. A measure of poverty that overcomes this problem is the poverty
                               gap index. The poverty gap index is the average shortfall of the total population from the
                               poverty line, measured as a percentage of the poverty line itself. A third common measure is
                               the poverty severity index, which is calculated as the average over the total population of the
                               squared shortfall from the poverty line. Since trends in the poverty gap and poverty severity
                               indexes tend to track the headcount index, however, this report focuses on the latter as a
                               measure of changes in poverty.

                               (the threshold below which the poorest 40 percent lays) in 2012 is Rs. 6,771, or approximately
                               USD 2.75 a day in 2005 PPP terms.

                             consumption not only increased, but also adjusted in line with rising living standards. Households
                             in the bottom two quintiles were increasingly able to afford non-food items, as the non-food
                             budget share for this group rose from 33.8 percent in 2002 to 45.1 percent in 2012/13. Shifts in
                             the pattern of food consumption are also consistent with higher living standards, as households

                             Per capita incomes increased, especially for the poor. Because of a change in the way income
                             was calculated starting from 2006, changes in income are only comparable from 2006/07 to
                             2012/2013. During this period, average per capita incomes grew only slightly, about 2 percent
                             overall. But for poorer households with lower per capita consumption, growth in real per capita
                             income was over twice as fast, and was in line with similar growth rates in per capita consumption.2

                             Increased welfare was also reflected in higher ownership rates of durable assets among poorer
                             households. Between 2006/7 and 2012/13, ownership rates of refrigerator, motorcycle, washing
                             machine, computer, and telephone more than doubled among the bottom 40 percent. Most
                             remarkably, the share of the bottom 40 percent that owned a cell phone rose from 13 to 76 percent
                             (see Figure 7).3 This impressive improvement could have resulted from a combination of factors,
                             including rising wages as well as the falling costs of motorcycles, refrigerators, and computers.

                             greater ownership of durables coincided with a considerable expansion in access to electricity.
                             Overall, the share of the population living in households that purchased electricity in the last
                             month expanded from 69 percent in 2002 to 94 percent in 2012/13 (Figure 8)4. This expansion
                             in electricity is reflected in brighter night-time lights (Figure 9) not only in key cities, including
                             Colombo, Kandy, and Jaffna, but also on the south coast of Galle, Matara, and Hambantota.

                             4                         Since 2006, the HIES survey asks households to directly report access to electricity. Unsurprisingly, the share of households report-
                                                       ing access is within a percentage point of the share of households reporting positive expenditure. We report the latter because it is
                                                       also available for 2002.

II. Trends In poverTy, welfare, and InequalITy (conTd.)



                            The reduction in poverty is also reflected in improved education and health outcomes. While little
                            change was observed in primary school attendance and completion, secondary school attendance
                            rose moderately from 2002 to 2012/13. Secondary school completion, measured by the share of
                            17 and 18 year olds who graduated from senior secondary school, saw a much larger increase.
                            Health indicators also improved during this period. The rate of infant mortality fell from 13 to 8
                            children per thousand births, and the rate of under-nutrition, while still high, decreased from 30 to
                            25 percent (see Figure 10).

                            The pace of poverty reduction varied across regions. Figure 11 shows how poverty rates at the
                            DS Divisions changed between 2002 and 2012. Eastern and Northern provinces, marked by gray,
                            were not covered by the 2002 HIES, and are therefore excluded. Of those areas covered by both
                            surveys, poverty reduction was greatest in Kalpitiya, Mundel, and Vanathawilluwa divisions in
                            Puttalam district, as well as in Badulla and Hambantota districts. In contrast, most DS divisions in
                            Monaragala, Colombo, and Gampaha made little progress in reducing poverty.

                            In the Estate sector, living standards remain low despite large declines in consumption poverty.
                            Poverty incidence in the estate sector fell by more than 19 percentage points between 2002 and
                            2012/13, from 30 to 10.9 percent. Most of this impressive decrease occurred between 2006/07
                            and 2012/13 (Figure 12). As a result, the sectoral gaps in poverty headcount rates have narrowed
                            significantly in recent years, even though the estate sector has traditionally lagged behind the
                            rural and urban sectors.

                            Other measures of well-being continue to lag in the Estate sector. Asset ownership rates in
                            the Estate sector, for example, remain well below the national average. Furthermore, more than
                            60 percent of the Estate population falls in the bottom 40 percent of the national per capita
                            consumption distribution, making a large portion of the Estate sector vulnerable to poverty. Box 2
                            contains more details on the reduction in monetary poverty in the Estate sector. Section V below
                            documents in detail how, despite a relatively small difference in headcount poverty, the Estate
                            sector fares much worse than the rural sector along several other dimensions of welfare.

                                  Although the estate sector accounts for only 4.4 percent of the total population – based
                                  on the 2011 Census of Housing and Population – its traditionally acute poverty situation,
                                  geographical remoteness, as well as unique socio-demographic conditions puts the
                                  sector high on the poverty reduction agenda.


                                  As shown in Figure 12, most of the decrease in estate poverty during the period of 2002-
                                  2012/13 occurred between 2006 and 2009 (from 28 to 11 percent), coinciding with
                                  the period when poverty reduction had the highest elasticity with respect to economic
                                  growth (Figure 19). One potential explanation for this sharp decline in estate poverty is
                                  the substantial increase in the price of tea, which is the major output of the estate sector
                                  as well as Sri Lanka’s largest exported commodity by export value. The Colombo auction
                                  price for tea surged from Rs 199/kg in 2006 to Rs 361/kg in 2009 while the quantity
                                  of total tea exports remained stable. This resulted in much higher profit margins and
                                  revenue for the tea industry, as reflected by higher ratio of auction price and production
                                  cost (see Figure 13). The higher profit in the tea industry may have been passed onto
                                  estate workers in the form of increased earnings. As shown in Figure 14, between 2006
                                  and 2009, only real wages of estate workers rose, while those of rural and urban workers
                                  stayed flat.

                             Moreover, the real wages of estate workers continued to rise even more drastically
                             between calendar years 2009 and 2010, promptly responding to the increase in minimum
                             wages set by Wage Board (see Figure 32 and Figure 33). The reported poverty statistics
                             for 2006/07, 2009/10, and 2012/13, on the other hand, are based on consumption data
                             collected between July and Jun of two consecutive years. Thus, the poverty reduction
                             during 2006/07 – 2009/10 might reflect the large wage increases for estate workers
                             during the first half of 2010.


                             The large reduction in estate poverty is corroborated by other welfare indicators, such as
                             the multidimensional welfare index reported by UNDP (2012), which indicates a decline
                             in multidimensional poverty from 21.1 percent to 11.4 percent between 2006 and 2009.
                             Durable asset ownership in the estate sector also increased considerably, particularly
                             in landline and mobile telephones, refrigerators, and televisions, signaling better living
                             conditions and potential time savings, which could in turn further improve earnings
                             capacity (Figure 15 below).

                            (Figure 16). As documented in Section V below, the Estate sector also lags well behind

                            Sustained and pro-poor economic growth from 2002 to 2012/13 was at the root of Sri Lanka’s
                            poverty reduction. Real GDP per capita grew by 5.6 percent per year between 2002 and 2012. More
                            importantly, during this period, growth in real per capita consumption was higher for the bottom
                            half of the distribution than for the top half (see Figure 17). The per capita consumption of the
                            bottom 40 percent of households grew by 3.3 percent per year, a rate that within the South Asia
                            region was only exceeded by Nepal and Bhutan.

                           yet the extent to which growth has reduced poverty has fluctuated considerably. Figure 19 shows
                           that the elasticity of poverty reduction with respect to GDP per capita growth was highest during
                           the final stage of the civil conflict from 2006 to 2009/10. The elasticity during this period, in fact,
                           was exceptionally high by international standards. In contrast, it was only moderate during the
                           previous cease-fire period from 2003 and 2006, and much lower during the postwar period from
                           2009 to 2012/13. These fluctuations were likely influenced by the underlying drivers of growth,
                           which differed considerably between 2002 and 2012/13.

                           Note: The reported countries are selected based on 3 criteria: having similar GDP per capita with Sri Lanka around 2002
                           (Bolivia, Georgia, Indonesia, Nicaragua, Philippines), having similar GDP growth during 2002-2012 (Tajikistan, Vietnam,
                           Lao), countries in South Asia region (Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, India), and countries with recent civil conflicts
                           (Colombia, Peru). For each country we used the closest years to 2002 and 2012 for which poverty information was
                           available.


                           growth in the agricultural sector was particularly beneficial for poverty reduction during this
                           period. Figure 20 illustrates this point by showing how much poverty fell among workers aged 15
                           and above in a particular sector in response to that sector’s growth. For example, poverty among
                           agriculture workers decreased by one percentage point per one percent growth in per capita
                           agriculture output between 2002 and 2006/07, as compared with only 0.2 percentage point per
                           one percent growth in the service sector.

                            As a result, even modest growth in agriculture from 2002 to 2009/10 greatly reduced poverty for
                            agriculture workers. Real growth in the Agricultural sector averaged less than 4 percent between
                            2002 and 2009/10. But during this time, the headcount poverty rate among agriculture workers
                            declined by 18 percentage points, as compared to only 13 and 09 percentage points for workers in
                            the industrial and service sectors (see Figure 21). As will be discussed in more detail in Section IV,
                            this was partly due to the surge in the international prices of food and tea from 2006/07-2009/10
                            being passed on to agricultural workers. Despite robust growth, poverty reduction slowed from
                            2009/10 to 2012/13, and poverty among agriculture workers remained unchanged.

                    Increased labor earnings were the key factor in reducing poverty. A simple framework for analyzing
                    the decline in poverty is to decompose it into portions due to changes in labor income, different
                    components of non-labor income, the employment rate of adults, and the dependency ratio.
                    Between 2002 and 2012/13, increased labor income accounted for about 60 percent of the 16.5
                    percentage point reduction in headcount poverty. This is similar to decomposition results from
                    Bangladesh and Nepal, but labor played a smaller role in Sri Lanka than in other countries in Latin
                    America and Europe. “Non-labor income” accounted for another 27 percent of the reduction in Sri

                    *Increases in international remittances and higher returns to education were important secondary factors
                    accounting for the reduction in poverty.
                    *The decline in Samurdhi transfers, after adjusting for inflation, slowed the rate of poverty reduction by 10 percent.



                    most of the increase in labor income was in turn due to increased returns to work both in and
                    outside agriculture. A more sophisticated decomposition approach can be used to decompose
                    the change in poverty into a portion explained by changes in characteristics on the one hand, and
                    changes in the returns to those characteristics on the other hand. Box 3 describes this approach in
                    greater details, and Figure 23 displays the results. Between 2002 and 2012/13, the role of increased
                    returns to work stands out. Increased returns to agriculture accounted for about 31 percent of the
                    decline, of which roughly two thirds were higher returns to self-employed farmers. The other main
                    factor was an increase in the returns to paid non-farm work, which accounted for 28 percent of the
                    poverty decline. Combined, the increases in the returns to work explain nearly 60 percent of the
                    reported poverty reduction.

                             These higher labor earnings have particularly benefited workers with less education since 2006.
                             As illustrated in Figure 22, real wages of workers with General Certificate of Education (GCE) degrees
                             and above either fell or remained relatively flat between 2006 and 2012. In contrast, the wages of
                             workers with primary schooling or less rose robustly. Moreover, the wages of these workers have
                             risen in line with the increase in minimum agriculture wages since 2010. Given that less educated
                             workers tend to be low-income earners, their rising wages positively contributed to poverty reduction.

                       Comprehensive household surveys such as the Household Income and Expenditure
                       Survey enable a decomposition of changes in poverty according to how different factors
                       changed and how returns to those factors changed. In order to quantify the contribution
                       of each factor to poverty reduction, the decomposition is implemented in four stages.


                       First, the determinants of education level, sectorial and activity choices are separately
                       estimated for each year. Overall, the simulated distributions are close to the true
                       distributions, indicating that the underlying specifications of these models can be used
                       to simulate shifts in the composition and structure of the labor force.


                       As a second step, labor income is separated into farm and non-farm income in order
                       to estimate the earnings equation for each period, estimated separately for household
                       heads and for other household members. Regressions are run for each of five groups of
                       workers in each year: (1) salaried farm; (2) salaried non-farm; (3) self-employed farm;
                       (4) self-employed non-farm; and (5) self-employed mix of farm and non-farm. Salaried
                       employment is modeled at the individual level while self-employed income is at the
                       household level.


                       In the third step, coefficients from the previous step’s regressions are used to simulate
                       counterfactual distributions by changing one variable at a time and by observing the
                       effect of each change on the distribution.


                       Fourth, the counterfactual poverty rates are compared to the observed poverty rates in
                       order to quantify the impact of each element on poverty reduction. Given that changes
                       in multiple factors could have interaction effects, the cumulative effect of these
                       decompositions are computed. This effect is calculated following the methodology
                       proposed by Bourguignon et al. (2008), which entails: (1) sequentially calculating the
                       effects of changes in characteristics of the population like age, gender, region and area,
                       followed by changes in sector, education and activity structure of the population; and
                       (2) using the results from (1) to sequentially calculate changes in farm and non-farm
                       earnings due to changes in the returns to these characteristics; followed by changes in
                       non-labor incomes, and changes in the consumption-to income ratio.

                           The observed increases in labor earnings could have been driven by several complementary
                           factors. Higher labor demand, higher labor productivity, better public infrastructure that improved
                           production efficiency, increasing urbanization, and movement out of agriculture all likely played a
                           role. Although it is difficult to untangle and quantify the impacts of each factor, we focus on four
                           major factors that have potentially contributed to the increases in labor earnings that reduced
                           poverty.

                           Sri Lanka’s economy has become a more industrialized economy since 2002. With the exception
                           of 2008, the annual growth rate of the industrial sector has consistently and increasingly outpaced
                           that of both the agricultural and service sectors (refer to Figure 25). As a result, the industrial
                           sector is becoming a larger contributor to total GDP (Figure 24). At a more disaggregate level,
                           the sectors contributing most to economic growth since 2009 include the manufacturing and
                           construction industries, as well as transportation and communication services (see Figure 26).

                             In contrast, the agriculture sector accounts for a declining share of both gDP and employment.
                             As shown in Figure 27, in 2014 the sector accounted for 28.5 percent of total employed workers in
                             2014, down from 34.4 percent in 2002. Its share of GDP also dropped from 14.3 percent to 10.1
                             percent during the same period.

                             This structural transformation coincided with rising employment and wages in several sectors
                             outside agriculture. Except for the period from 2006 to 2009, real wages in manufacturing,
                             construction, commerce, and to a lesser extent, transport and communication, all increased
                             amidst growing employment shares (Figure 30). This suggests that firms are willing to hire
                             more workers, and pay them more, as the value of their contributions have increased. This is also
                             reflected in increased productivity, as measured by value added per worker outside agriculture.
                             Figure 28 shows that productivity growth in industry has outpaced that in agriculture since 2006,
                             while productivity in the service sector grew rapidly since 2002.

                              The shift out of agriculture has resumed since 2009/10, though at a slower pace for the poor.
                              Figure 29 shows a fall in the share of workers in agriculture from 2009/10 to 2012/13, following
                              a slight increase from 2006/07 to 2009/10. At least part of this increase was due to the surging
                              international prices of food and tea during 2006-2008, which made the agriculture sector
                              temporarily more profitable and attracted low-income workers back into the sector. Interventions
                              that increase the transition of poor workers away from farm works, especially for the poor, will help
                              further improve living standards by shifting workers into more productive and better paid jobs.

                          Sri Lanka has experienced a dynamic process of urbanization leading to greater spatial
                          connectivity. Both night-time lights (Figure 9) and data from human settlement layers (Figure
                          31) show increased density in the corridors from Colombo to Kandy and Galle/Matara corridors,
                          as the area has become a multi-city urban agglomeration. The night-time light image also
                          illustrates that smaller single-city agglomerations have emerged around Trincomalee, Batticaloa-
                          Akkaraipattu, and Jaffna, although they are still poorly connected with the prime agglomeration of
                          Kandy-Colombo-Galle.

                          Peri-urban areas appear to be growing most quickly. Growth in night time lights between 2001
                          and 2011 was concentrated in a few DS divisions. The top 10 percent of the DS divisions accounted
                          for 30 percent of the increase in night-time lights, while the top 20 percent contributed half of the
                          increase. In general, these high-growth DS divisions were moderately built up peri-urban areas in
                          2014, where new settlement and economic activity created brighter and denser night-time light.


                          The colombo-Kandy-galle agglomeration is at the forefront of growth and poverty reduction.
                          The area around this agglomeration, including a 60 km buffer, contains a third of the county’s
                          land mass, but houses 70 percent of the population and over 55 percent of the poor. This area
                          includes all or part of 6 districts: Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Kandy, Kegalle, Kurunegala, and
                          Matara. Combined, these districts account for 83 percent of national value added, and 87 percent
                          of manufacturing value added.

A surge in the international prices of rice and tea from 2006 to 2009 helped boost real wages in
the agricultural sector. The price of rice rose by about 30 percent, and the price of tea – Sri Lanka’s
largest export by value – increased by more than 50 percent, from $2.1 to $3.3 per kilogram (Table
1). Since there was little change in yields and production costs during this period, rice and tea
production became more profitable. This led to slight increases in both the employment share and
real wages in agriculture, which were balanced by declines in the employment share and wages in
manufacturing and commerce sectors. The agriculture sector employs a disproportional number
of poor workers, and as discussed above, this external price shock had a positive impact on poverty
reduction.

Higher rice and tea prices were eventually followed by sharp increases in the agriculture minimum
wages. The minimum wages for agricultural workers set by the Wage Board rose dramatically in
2010 and again in 2012, while minimum wages in other sectors remained flat through the last
decade (Figure 32). Real agricultural wages, unlike those for industrial and service sector wages,
tracked these minimum wage increases almost exactly (Figure 33 below).

Statistics of Sri Lanka 2014   The increase in the agricultural minimum wage in 2010 is consistent with the reduction in poverty
                               among agricultural workers between 2006/07 and 2009/10. While wage data were collected for
                               each calendar year, the consumption data underlying the reported poverty statistics for 2006/07,
                               2009/10, and 2012/13 were collected between July and June of two consecutive years. Thus,
                               the strong poverty reduction observed between 2006/07 and 2009/10 could partly capture the
                               impacts of the higher agriculture wages that occurred during the first half of 2010.


                               Agriculture households benefited during this period regardless of whether they owned land or
                               worked for themselves.


                               Table 2 shows the increase in average per capita consumption, according to whether household
                               members work in agriculture and whether the household owns agricultural land. If increased
                               minimum wages alone were the primary driving factor behind the increase in agricultural returns,
                               one would expect to see a larger increase in consumption among households with agricultural
                               wage employees than self-employed farm households. On the other hand, if the increase in food
                               prices were not passed on to farm laborers, households that owned agricultural land should
                               have seen larger increases in consumption. Between 2006/07 and 2009/10, the increase in
                               consumption was markedly higher among households with members working in agriculture, either
                               as employees, self-employed, or employers, than among households without members working in
                               the sector. But farmers that owned their own land, if anything, saw slightly lower gains between
                               2006/07 and 2012/13 than landless farmers and households with a member working in a salaried
                               agricultural wage job. This suggests that agricultural land and labor markets, perhaps assisted by
                               the increase in the agricultural minimum wage, successfully passed on the gains from rising world
                               food prices to agricultural laborers and landless farmers.

                          GDP growth has been largely led by domestic private consumption. Private consumption made up
                          67 percent of GDP in 2013, having expanded by 6 percent annually during 2002-2013 (Figure 34).
                          The second largest component of Sri Lanka’s GDP has been private investment, which accounted
                          for 23 percent of 2013 GDP after an average annual growth of 9 percent during the same period.
                          Net exports, government consumption, and change in stocks all made minor contributions to total
                          GDP. Public infrastructure spending, while accounting for only 6 percent of GDP in 2013, expanded
                          rapidly by 18 percent per year between 2002 and 2013.

                          Although evidence is lacking, expanded infrastructure investment and access to electricity
                          may have boosted productivity by improving connectivity and access to markets. While still

                   infrastructure investment could have spillover effects in terms of improving production efficiency,
                   reducing transportation costs, connecting remote areas, and ensuring a stable power supply.
                   Moreover, studies from other countries demonstrate that access to electricity led to increased
                   productivity among small-scale informal workers in South Africa and broad-based improvement
                   in labor productivity in Brazil.5 The higher coverage of electricity and increased ownership of such
                   assets as motorcycles and mobile phones that was documented in Section II, therefore, might also
                   have increased labor productivity in Sri Lanka.


                   Among the four factors discussed above, growth in domestic consumption and rises in
                   international food prices are not likely to be sustainable in the years to come. Fiscal constraints
                   preclude further large-scale infrastructure investments, and agriculture workers, especially low-
                   income earners, may be vulnerable to international prices drops. In fact, tea price fell in 2014 in
                   response to declining demand from Middle East countries. While it is unclear, given the available
                   data, how this has affected agricultural and estate workers, policies to speed up the structural
                   transformation can help reduce Sri Lanka’s vulnerability to adverse commodity price shocks from
                   external markets.

                            consumption in 2012/13 remained low for a large share of the population. Figure 35 shows, on
                            the vertical axis, the share of Sri Lankans whose household per capita consumption falls below
                            the expenditure level depicted on the horizontal axis. The intersection of the curve with the green
                            line indicates that roughly a third of Sri Lankans live below the international poverty line of $2.50
                            per day in 2005 PP terms. In fact, the expenditure threshold for the poorest 40 percent of the
                            population, in terms of the per capita consumption, is merely USD 2.75 per day (2005 PPP); and
                            just over 60 percent of the population lives on less than USD 4.00 per day.


                            In light of these low consumption levels, it is useful to identify the characteristics of both the
                            poor and the near-poor. We define the near-poor as individuals living in households with per capita
                            consumption above the national poverty line but below the 40th percentile threshold. The poor
                            and the near-poor are in turn compared with the top 60 percent (henceforth, the non-poor). In
                            particular, the following sub-sections will profile residential location, demographic characteristics,
                            and asset ownership of poor and near-poor Sri Lankans. Special attention is given to those living
                            in the estate sector, which has traditionally been poorer than the urban and rural sectors, as well
                            as the conflict-affected districts in Northern and Eastern provinces. Demographic characteristics
                            and important living standard indicators of different expenditure groups are displayed in Table 6
                            and Table 7 (Refer Appendix 5).

                            Despite the low national poverty rate, geographical pockets of poverty remain a serious concern.
                            Figure 36 shows estimates of poverty at the DS level, based on an updated poverty map that
                            combines the 2011 Census of Population and Housing with the 2012/13 Household Income and
                            Expenditure Survey. The map shows three main pockets of poverty. The first is the former conflict
                            districts in Northern Province, Mullaitivu (28.8 percent), Mannar (20.1 percent), and, to a lesser
                            extent, Kilinochchi district (12.7 percent). The second is Batticaloa district (19.4 percent) in
                            Eastern province, and the last one is Monaragala district (20.8 percent) in Uva province.

                            The near-poor are prevalent in both poor and affluent districts. In general, areas with higher poverty
                            rates tend to have a larger portion of the bottom 40 percent as well, especially in Monaragala,
                            Mannar, and Mullativu. But there are also relatively affluent districts such as Ampara and Nuwara
                            Eliya, where poverty rates are slightly over 8 percent yet over 45 percent of the population belongs
                            to the national’s bottom two quintiles (see Figure 38 below).

                               High poverty incidence does not always coincide with a large concentration of poor people. Most
                               of the poor live in populous and relatively affluent districts such as Kurunegala, Ratnapura, and
                               Kandy. Kurunegala, for instance, is home to 7.7 percent of the country’s poor people even though
                               only 6.5 percent of its population lives under the official poverty line. In contrast, Mullaitivu and
                               Mannar, where estimated poverty rates are very high (28.8 and 20.1 percent, respectively), account
                               for only 3.4 percent of poor people nationwide due to their small populations. The same is true at
                               the DS division level, where large numbers of poor exist in Gampaha, Nuwara Eliya, and Ratnapura
                               districts.

                               The poor are overwhelmingly rural. The rural sector accounted for over three quarters of the
                               country’s population (see Figure 39) and over 85 percent of poor Sri Lankans nationwide in
                               2012/13.6 As a result, much of the poverty reduction observed during the period of 2002-2012/13
                               was driven by the reduction in rural poverty. Specifically, the decrease in rural poverty headcount
                               ratio from 24.7 percent to 6.8 percent during this period is roughly equivalent to a decrease in
                               the number of people living under the poverty line from 19.8 percent to 5.3 percent of the total
                               population.7




                               6                       The official definition of urban and rural is based on areas administered by urban and municipal councils, which underestimates the
                                                       extent of urban areas.

                                                       poverty rates reported in Figure 1. In the 2001 census, which does not cover 7 districts from Northern and Eastern provinces, the
                                                       rural sector accounted for 80 percent of the population.

                           The poor and near-poor are disproportionately young. This is partly because poorer households
                           tend to have larger household sizes. As can be seen in Table 6 (Refer Appendix 5), 45 percent
                           of the bottom 40 percent is below 25 years old, as compared to only 37.8 percent of the top 60
                           percent.


                           The poor and near-poor have lower education attainment. Data from the 2012/13 HIES reveal
                           that about 55.7 percent of adults (aged 21 and above) in the bottom 40 percent did not finish
                           secondary education, as compared to only 46.2 percent of the non-poor. Since most of those
                           adults had stopped attending school when they were interviewed, their reported education levels
                           are a determinant, rather than a result, of low earnings.


                           The poor and near-poor are less likely to be working (see Table 6). More critically, unemployment
                           is exceptionally high among youths in the bottom 40 percent. Young Sri Lankans (15-24 years old)
                           in general are much more disconnected from productive activities than those above 24 years old.
                           Furthermore, the situation is even more acute among near-poor youths.8 If this pool of abundant,
                           young, and cheap labor is not fully utilized, the combination of high youth unemployment and a
                           young poor population has the potential to threaten social stability.


                           Among those poor and near-poor that are employed, a large proportion is engaged in agriculture.
                           In particular, about one in every two poor workers works in the agricultural sector, whereas one in
                           every two non-poor workers in the service sector (Table 6). The agriculture sector also employs a
                           majority of near-poor workers (42.9 percent). This disproportional concentration of low-income
                           Sri Lankans in farm works, which typically have lower value added and wages than the other
                           sectors, reinforces the case to accelerate the structural transformation and shift workers into
                           more productive sectors.




                           8   This is based on analysis of the HIES data, which uses a different definition of unemployment than the LFS data. According to this
                               definition, youth unemployment was 34.2% for the near poor in 2012/13, as opposed to 26.6% for the near-poor and 26.8% for the
                               poor.

                               gender inequality is more apparent in labor outcomes than consumption or educational
                               inequality. Gender inequality in Sri Lanka is in fact quite limited, as reflected in not only per capita
                               consumption but also education outcomes. Sri Lankan girls are as likely as, if not even more
                               likely than, boys to attend and complete primary and secondary school. However, women still face
                               substantially worse labor market outcomes, with much lower labor participation rate and higher
                               unemployment rate than men (see Figure 41).

                               moderate disparities between Tamils and Sinhalese persist. The poor, like the overall population,
                               are largely Buddhist and Sinhalese. But poverty rates for Sri Lankan Tamils are almost twice that of
                               Sinhalese overall, after including Northern and Eastern provinces (see Figure 42). These disparities
                               remain even though nearly a quarter of Sri Lankan Tamils – more than the national average – live
                               in urban areas.

                              Ethnic disparities in poverty can be explained by differences in a few key characteristics. Sri Lankan
                              Tamils tend to live in poorer districts, and after accounting for these geographic differences, the
                              disparity in poverty rates falls from 6.1 to 4.7 percentage points. Further accounting for three key
                              characteristics of the household head – age, education, and gender – reduces the poverty penalty
                              faced by Sri Lankan Tamils to 2.8 percentage points. The penalty falls to merely 1.2 percentage
                              points when differences in household size are taken into account. In other words, while Sri Lankan
                              Tamils are more likely to be poor than Sinhalese, the vast majority of this penalty can be explained
                              by differences in geographic location, the age, gender, and education of the household head, and
                              average household size.

                              The near-poor fare only mildly better than the poor when it comes to consumption patterns and
                              asset ownership. For example, the near-poor spend an average of 61 percent of their budget on
                              food, which is only eight percentage points less than the poor do, as opposed to 42 percent for
                              non-poor households (See Figure 43). Likewise, the near-poor are also far behind the non-poor in
                              terms of ownership of many durable assets (see Figure 44). The difference between the poor and
                              near-poor is slightly more pronounced for housing conditions. About 54.5 percent of the poor lives
                              in a housing unit with permanent walls, floor, and roof. The figure is considerably higher for the
                              near-poor (69.4 percent) and non-poor (84.3 percent).

                            Both the poor and near-poor reported little improvement in their access to basic services since
                            2002. Sri Lanka has made considerable investments in road infrastructure in recent years, and as
                            noted earlier, motorcycles have become more prevalent among the poor. Yet between 2006/07
                            and 2012/13, the bottom 40 percent of Sri Lankans, as did the top 60 percent, reported almost
                            no improvement in travel times to public education and health care facilities, except for access to
                            clinics (see Figure 45). Moreover, it takes the poorest 40 percent longer to reach these facilities
                            than the non-poor. This suggests that infrastructure investment has been concentrated on main
                            roads and highways, rather than the smaller feeder roads that tend to help low-income households
                            reach public facilities.


                            The poor and near-poor have limited access to formal credit markets. The richest 60 percent are
                            far more likely to borrow from banks than retail shops, while the near-poor utilize retails shops
                            nearly as much as the poor do (see Figure 46). Lacking access to formal credits not only leaves
                            poor and near-poor households little room to smooth their consumption in the face of adverse
                            income shocks, but also restricts their ability to invest in business and/or capital to improve their
                            earnings.


                            The children of the poor and near-poor are less likely to pursue secondary and collegiate
                            education. Figure 47 and Figure 48 show attendance and completion rates among children at ages
                            that correspond to each education level. There is little difference for primary and junior secondary
                            schooling. Poor children are actually more likely to attend primary school than more affluent
                            children, even though they are slightly less likely to complete their primary degree. But attendance

                             and completion rates decline significantly for senior secondary and collegiate education across all
                             expenditure groups. Moreover, at these higher levels of education, the gaps between poor, near-
                             poor, and non-poor students are substantial. For example, only 18 percent of poor children aged
                             17 to 18 attended college, as opposed to 60 percent of their non-poor counterparts.

                             The gap between rich and poor in attending secondary and collegiate education is growing. The
                             share of 17 to 18 year olds attending college increased by 13 percentage points for near-poor
                             students, 9 percentage points for non-poor students, but only by one percentage point for poor
                             students. The growing disparity between the poor and near-poor will have long-term consequences
                             and make it more difficult for poor children to escape the cycle of poverty.

poveRTy IN The eSTATe SeCToR
Poverty in the estate sector reflects the unique characteristics of its residents. The poor and
near-poor in the Estate sector are mainly young, Hindu Tamils, working in tea estates in the
agriculture sector, and living in free housing units provided by estate owners. The dominance
of plantation estates as the major employer in the estate sector explains the high employment
rates observed in the Estate sector, whether poor, near-poor, and non-poor. Yet due to low wages,
remoteness, and lack of government-sponsored basic services, these higher employment rates do
not translate into better living standards for poor Estate residents.


As displayed in Table 6 (refer Appendix 5), there are striking gaps between the estate poor
and rural poor in housing conditions. The dependence of estate workers on their employers for
accommodation and basic services means that their housing conditions, sanitation, and water
quality can easily be compromised. For example, only 5.6 percent of the estate poor owned a house
in 2012/13, and only 11.3 percent of the Estate near-poor do. In contrast, 90.4 percent of the rural
poor owned a house. In 2012/13, slightly more than a quarter of the estate poor and also non-poor
lived in a house with a permanent roof, while three quarters of the rural poor did. Moreover, only
55.1 percent of the estate poor and 47.9 percent of the estate near-poor reported to have access
to clean water, substantially lower than 84.3 percent of the rural poor.

The poor in the Estate sector have low education attainment. Only half of the poor adults living in
estate areas had completed primary school, and only 2.3 percent had completed secondary school
in 2012/13. This is significantly less than the corresponding figures in the rural sector, which are
65 percent and 8.8 percent, respectively. Low levels of education make it more difficult for workers
in the rural and especially the estate sector to shift to more productive sectors that reward higher
levels of education.

                             households. Consumption of protein-rich foods improved only slightly from 3.5 to 4.9 percent of

calculation based on HIES    Inequality in both consumption and income has increased since 2009. Inequality in Sri Lanka has
                             traditionally been moderate by the standards of the region and other countries at similar levels
                             of development. Between 2002 and 2009, inequality in both consumption and income declined,
                             as pro-poor growth led to sizeable increases in consumption for the bottom 40 percent of the
                             consumption distribution.9 But between 2009 and 2012/13, inequality in both consumption and
                             income increased. The increase in consumption inequality was particularly sharp between 2009/10
                             and 2012/13, erasing the decline in inequality observed since 2002. Sri Lanka is the only country
                             in the region that experienced this rapid increase in consumption inequality in the last decade
                             (Figure 52). Furthermore, household surveys often underestimate inequality, because the truly
                             wealthy are a tiny share of the population and are less likely to participate in household surveys.
                             While higher inequality may in part be a byproduct of growth, it can strengthen the case for more
                             progressive fiscal policy.

                            most of the increase in inequality between 2009/10 and 2012/13 was driven by changes within
                            population groups. The change in consumption inequality during this period can be decomposed
                            into changes in inequality between and within a variety of groups. In this case, groups are defined
                            based on residential location, education and ethnicity of the individual, and key characteristics of
                            the household head. Among the characteristics considered, changes in inequality across sector
                            of residence (urban/rural/estate) and employment sector of the household head (agriculture/
                            industry/services/not working) contributed most to the overall increase in consumption inequality.
                            This means that changes in the average consumption of households in different residential
                            sectors, and with heads working in different employment sectors, favored better-off households.
                            In contrast, changes in average consumption across education levels, ethnicities, genders of
                            household head, and between post-conflict and non-conflict areas contributed little to the overall
                            increase in inequality.

                            consumption and income inequality is associated with unequal access to health and education
                            services. Since 2006/07, the HIES has asked respondents to report travel times to public facilities.
                            Figure 53 shows, in percentage terms, how much longer poor and near-poor households reported
                            it took to travel to public facilities than non-poor households. Poor households in 2012/13 reported
                            that it took about 20 to 30 percent more time on average to reach education and health facilities
                            than non-poor households. The difference is largest for public dispensaries and secondary/
                            collegiate schools.

                            Lack of accessibility to school may hinder secondary school completion for poor students. Sri
                            Lankan children attend school longer than their counterparts in neighboring countries. In Sri
                            Lanka, almost all 17 and 18 year olds have attended at least one year of secondary school. But as
                            noted above, poor children in Sri Lanka are much less likely than near-poor and non-poor children
                            to complete secondary school.


                            Inequality is also apparent in access to basic housing infrastructure as well as health and
                            nutrition outcomes. The latter is critical to children’s development and future earnings potential.
                            Appendix 4 discusses multi-dimensional inequality among Sri Lankan children in more details.

             Sri Lanka’s social protection system is fragmented and limited. The main social assistance
             program in Sri Lanka is Samurdhi subsidies. These consist of small monthly stamps worth
             between Rs. 200 to Rs. 1,500, given to families identified as poor by community offices. Besides
             Samurdhi subsidies, Sri Lankan households interviewed in the 2012/13 HIES also reported income
             received from five other social assistance programs. They are: fertilizer subsidies; school meals
             program, which provides lunch to students at poor schools; monthly assistance to the disabled;
             assistance for elders over 70 years old with no income; and the Thriposha food program, which
             provides nutritional supplements to women that are pregnant, breastfeeding, or whose children
             are undernourished. These programs are all implemented by different institutions, which may
             hamper administrative coordination. Table 4 displays the benefit level, number of beneficiaries,
             and the implementing institution of each program.

By international standards, social assistance is less generous in Sri Lanka than in many other
comparable countries. The World Bank has conducted a benchmarking exercise that examines the
generosity and targeting of social assistance programs across 40 lower middle-income countries.
One of the main indicators of generosity is the adequacy of benefits for the bottom quintile, which
is defined as the total amount of social assistance transfers received by the bottom quintile,
divided by their total consumption. In other words, this measure indicates the average contribution
of social assistance programs to the budget of the bottom quintile. By this measure, Sri Lanka’s

                               social assistance is tiny, at merely 6.6 percent, significantly below Pakistan, the Philippines, and
                               Bolivia (Figure 54).


                               not only are Sri Lanka’s social assistance programs small, but the budget devoted to social
                               transfers has also fallen in recent years. Spending on social transfers, with the exception
                               of fertilizer subsidies, has declined in real terms (see Figure 55). This accounts for the result,
                               presented in Figure 23 in Section III above, that the fall in the real value of Samurdhi transfers
                               slowed poverty reduction by 9.6 percent between 2002 and 2012/13. Because of the decline in
                               spending, by 2012/13, the six programs listed above combined amounted to only over 3 percent
                               of total household consumption for the bottom consumption quintile (shown in Figure 57 below).

                            Samurdhi has, therefore, had a minor and decreasing impact on poverty reduction. Samurdhi
                            transfers are too small to make a large impact on poor households’ budgets, as they contributed
                            only 1.7 percent to household consumption of the poorest 20 percent of the population in 2012/13
                            (see Figure 56). Based on data from the HIES, subtracting the Samurdhi benefit from household
                            consumption would increase the national poverty rate by 2.1 percentage points in 2002. But in
                            2012/13, the comparable figure had declined to merely 0.6 percentage points (Figure 57).

                            The poverty reduction impacts of other social assistance programs are even smaller. A recent
                            DCS report examines how much the absence of nine programs other than Samurdhi would
                            raise the national poverty rate in 2012/13 (DCS 2015, p. 4). These programs include the school
                            food program, fertilizer subsidies, the Thriposha program, disability and relief, elderly payment,
                            scholarship, health and medical aids, food and other commendation, and disaster relief assistance.
                            Combined, their impact on poverty is almost negligible at 0.5 percentage points.

                               Lack of generosity in Sri Lanka’s social protection programs is a larger problem than poor targeting.
                               The country appears to be moderately well-targeted by international comparison. The international
                               benchmarking analysis mentioned above also examines the share of social assistance programs
                               that reaches the bottom quintile of households. Out of 40 lower middle-income countries included
                               in the exercise, Sri Lanka in 2006 was estimated to transfer the 10th largest share to the bottom
                               quintile, defined on the basis of pre-transfer income. Among countries in South Asia, Sri Lanka’s
                               social assistance programs transferred the largest share to the bottom quintile (Figure 58). As an
                               additional point of comparison, an older meta-analysis of 85 programs from the 1990’s and early
                               2000’s found that the median program transferred 25 percent more resources to the poor than a
                               transfer of a fixed amount to all households.10 Samurdhi’s targeting performance by this measure
                               is respectable, since it transfers 55 percent to the bottom two quintiles, which is 35 percent more
                               than what would be allocated to the bottom two quintiles by an equal transfer.

                               Among Sri Lanka’s social transfer programs, Samurdhi and the school lunch program are better
                               targeted than fertilizer subsidies. Figure 59 shows the percentage of benefits that accrue to each
                               quintile from Samurdhi, school lunch, fertilizer subsidies, and three other programs – old age
                               transfers, disability, and Thriposha – combined. Samurdhi and school lunch programs transfer
                               nearly the same amount to the bottom quintile, and in both cases roughly 55 percent of benefits
                               go to the bottom 40 percent. The other three programs, when considered as a group, distribute
                               53 percent of their transfers to the bottom 40 percent. The fertilizer subsidies are the least well
                               targeted transfer, with only 45 percent of the benefit being devoted to the bottom 40 percent.

                             Samurdhi’s targeting performance has slightly worsened in recent years. Figure 60 shows how
                             Samurdhi’s targeting performance has declined since 2002. In 2002, 42 percent of all transfers
                             reached the bottom quintile and 70 percent reached the bottom 40 percent. But by 2012-13, this
                             had fallen to 39 percent and 65 percent, respectively. Reforming the social assistance programs,
                             including the Samurdhi, to reduce leakage and improve coverage of the disadvantaged can make
                             it more helpful for the poor.

                             Private transfers, including international remittances, are not compensating for the reduction
                             in public assistance. In general, few poor households benefit from international employment
                             opportunities. International migration has increased in recent years, and for households that
                             receive them, remittances from abroad are an important source of income. For these households,
                             remittances account for roughly 30 percent of household consumption. But it is rare for the
                             poor to benefit from remittances – only 4.5 percent of households in the bottom quintile receive
                             them, as opposed to 10.7 percent for the top quintile. Therefore, only 9 percent of the total
                             amount of remittances reaches the bottom quintile. And if remittance income is subtracted from
                             consumption, the poverty headcount rises about only 1.4 percentage points.

                                Sri Lanka’s population is aging rapidly, which will substantially increase the demand for social
                                support for the elderly in a near future. Elderly dependency rates are projected to rise fast, as
                                the number of persons aged 60 years old and above is expected to double from 2011 to 2041.
                                As can be seen in Figure 55 above, the recent bulk of spending on social assistance comes in the
                                form of pensions. Furthermore, the share of employment in the public sector increased from 23
                                to 26 percent between 2002 and 2013, which will place further demands on the pension system
                                going forward. But as of 2012, only about one third of the workforce reported that their employers
                                contributed to a pension. The combination of low population growth and a rapidly aging population
                                will create both financial and operational pressures to provide additional support for the elderly in
                                the future.

                                unemployment insurance may rise. Active labor market programs, if designed and implemented
                                well, can also help social assistance recipients graduate to productive employment.

Poverty and Welfare in Sri Lanka




                             61
VII. CONCLUSIONS

             Sri Lanka can build on a successful recent track record in boosting living standards for the poor.
             Poverty fell substantially from 2002 to 2009/10, and remained low in 2012/13. Household incomes
             also rose for the poor, as did other welfare indicators such as the share of non-food consumption,
             ownership of durable goods, and education attendance. In general, poverty reduction followed
             strong growth. But from 2006 to 2009, poverty fell despite moderate GDP growth, in part because
             of accelerated growth in the agricultural sector as food prices increased. In line with this, poverty
             fell slightly faster for agricultural workers than for non-agricultural workers, especially between
             2006/07 and 2009/10.


             Increased labor earnings, due to a broad-based increase in labor demand, drove poverty
             reduction. When decomposing the drivers of poverty reduction, increased returns to agricultural
             and non-agricultural work each accounted for about a third of the decline. Across different non-
             agricultural sectors, employment and wages both increased, reflecting a broad-based rise in the
             demand for labor. This increased demand was particularly noticeable in construction, commerce,
             and transport and communication, and led to particularly strong earnings increases for less well-
             educated workers.


             While it is difficult to disentangle the underlying causes for the broad increase in the returns to
             work, we focus on four potential causes. First, a gradual structural transformation has led to a
             weakening emphasis on agriculture in the economy. The share of agriculture in GDP has declined,
             and employment in agricultural fell rapidly from 2002 to 2006 and again in 2012. The shift out of
             agricultural employment was particularly notable for youth.


             Second, Sri Lanka has experienced improved agglomeration and spatial connectivity, particularly
             in the main urban center that encompasses Colombo, Kandy, and Galle. Images of night-time
             lights show large increase on the outskirts of this center, as well as the secondary cities in Jaffna
             and Batticaloa-Akkaraipattu. Highly built-up areas along the Colombo-Kandy-Galle corridor
             contributed the most to national value added and manufacturing value added.


             Third, Sri Lanka benefited from increased aggregate demand. The period from 2002 and 2013
             saw strong growth both in private consumption and private investment. Government investment,
             while still accounting for a small share of total aggregate demand, grew fivefold from 2002 to
             2012/13 at a rate of 18 percent per year.


             Finally, agricultural workers profited from increases in food and commodity prices. Increases
             in the domestic price of rice and the world price of tea from 2006/07 to 2009/10 benefited
             agricultural workers and farmland owners alike, and were followed by large increases in minimum
             wages for agricultural workers in 2010. This was reflected in rapid wage growth and strong poverty
             reduction for agricultural workers.

Not all of these potential drivers of growth and labor demand are sustainable in the future.
In particular, fiscal constraints have already led to an announced reduction in government
investment. More generally, the transport infrastructure and construction sectors are not likely
to be strong sources of sustained and consistent growth. In addition, the prices for food and tea
fell significantly from 2009 to 2012, which helped slow the reduction in poverty from 2009/10 to
2012/13. This raises the stakes for accelerating and managing the structural transformation and
agglomeration in the coming years.


Despite the fall in poverty, living standards generally remain low. The near-poor, defined as
those living above the poverty line but below the 40th percentile, subsist on less than twice the
poverty line and appear similar to the poor in terms of various welfare indicators. Furthermore,
spatial inequality is substantial; poverty rates in the poorest DS divisions stayed as high as 30
to 40 percent in 2012/13. Monaragala district and the former conflict areas in Northern and
Eastern provinces also stand out as severely poor. Poverty rates are also disproportionately high
for vulnerable groups such as youth and ethnic minorities; and unemployment is high for youth
and women. Finally, the Estate sector, despite relatively low levels of monetary poverty, is severely
disadvantaged according to alternative welfare indicators such as education attainment, food
consumption, and housing quality.


To ensure continued improvement of living standards and shared prosperity, Sri Lanka can
provide additional support to poor households. Devoting more generous resources to social
assistance, while developing a broader social protection strategy to confront an aging population,
will help poor households invest in the next generation. Support to poor household can take the
form of multi-sectoral interventions to areas with particularly high poverty rates, such as providing
job opportunities to youths through public works or job matching services. Such programs whose
cost increases with the number of beneficiaries can be targeted to areas with high poverty rates.
On the other hand, investment in infrastructure and other public goods may be targeted more
efficiently to urban areas where most of the poor live. Although rural areas account for over 85
percent of the poor, over half the poor are estimated to live within 30 km of the two agglomeration
areas of Colombo-Kandy-Galle and Jaffna-Trincomalee-Batticaloa.


Further progress also depends on accelerating the structural transformation by connecting poor
workers to more productive employment opportunities. To the extent that fiscal constraints allow,
this could include prioritizing infrastructure investment to keep pace with increasing urbanization,
which will place further demands on transportation infrastructure. Although 95 percent of the
population can now access electricity, more cost-effective power generation will be required to
support further productivity growth. Effective governance of cities will also be important to enhance
the ability of workers to take advantage of more productive job opportunities in and around urban
areas.


Several remaining knowledge gaps make it difficult to identify the best approach to speed up
the structural transformation in the Sri Lankan context. We propose six questions where further
rigorous research could provide useful guidance for policy:


                                                                                                   63
VII. CONCLUSIONS



                   •	   How have recent infrastructure investments, including the expansion of access to electricity,
                        affected labor productivity and poverty? Studies on the relationship between infrastructure
                        and labor productivity can shed light on the importance of further spending to increase
                        infrastructure in the future.


                   •	   What are the status and determinants of internal migration? Surprisingly, given the
                        importance of urbanization, there are little data on internal migration. Who is migrating where
                        and why? How do households fare after migrating? Understanding these issues can inform
                        interventions that provide either information or financial incentives to help households make
                        informed choices about where their earnings opportunities are greatest.11


                   •	   To what extent and how do households enter and exit poverty? What adverse shocks are near-
                        poor households most vulnerable to and what government interventions could help mitigate
                        these shocks?


                   •	   What determines labor market outcomes and skill acquisition? In particular, what explains the
                        prevailing low rates of female labor force participation and high rates of youth unemployment?
                        To what extent are labor market regulations enforced? And do they constrain the creation of
                        salaries jobs?


                   •	   How vulnerable are the poor and near-poor to a downturn in food and commodity prices? How
                        important was the recent increase in prices in explaining the poverty reduction in the last
                        decade?


                   Above all, little is known about the beneficiaries and effects of public programs, investment and
                   services. This analysis has drawn extensively on Sri Lanka’s impressive statistical infrastructure,
                   which is well-equipped to monitor trends in poverty and labor market outcomes. It is invaluable
                   for taking stock of the recent past, and providing an informed basis for speculating about the
                   future. But with a few exceptions, this type of broad descriptive monitoring does not lend itself to
                   generating specific policy recommendations and conclusions.


                   Improvements in the statistical infrastructure can support more informed policy-making. This
                   would partly involve a shift of emphasis from monitoring to evaluation. Practical steps could include
                   adding new questions to existing surveys on the quality of services and programs, supporting
                   one-time evaluations of selected programs in particular areas, and establishing a longitudinal
                   household survey. The latter would be particularly valuable as a way to evaluate the benefits of
                   public investments in human capital, as well as the dynamics of households’ participation in public
                   programs. Efforts to fill knowledge gaps on these and other topics can help identify and prioritize
                   the public policies and programs that best support the welfare of poor households.


                   11   For example, in Bangladesh an $8.50 financial incentive to migrate to urban areas during the lean season induced 20 percent of
                        rural households to send a migrate to urban areas, which raised consumption of these poor households and made them 10 per-
                        centage points more likely to re-migrate within 3 years (Bryan, Chaudhury, and Mobarak 2014).

APPENDIX 1: HOUSEHOLD AND LABOR FORCE SURVEYS IN SRI LANKA



                   The analysis in this report is based mainly on Sri Lanka’s two large periodic surveys: the Household
                   Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) and the Labor Force Survey (LFS). On the one hand, these
                   surveys provide extensive data that are representative at the district level and allow for poverty
                   analysis over an extended period. On the other hand, this report needs to take into account several
                   inconsistencies across survey rounds to ensure the reported statistics are chronically comparable.


                   The most prominent issue is inconsistent geographical coverage over time because the surveys
                   could not be implemented in various areas affected by the civil conflict. Table 5 below lists the
                   areas excluded from the surveys’ samples in their most recent rounds.


                   Specifically, the 2002 HIES does not cover Northern and Eastern provinces, which account for 12.9
                   percent of the national population (based on the 2011 Census of Housing and Population). The
                   2006/07 HIES excludes Northern province and Trincomalee district – equivalent to approximately
                   7.1 percent of the population. In the 2009/10 round, the survey excludes only 3 districts, namely
                   Mannar, Kilinochchi, and Mulaitivu, which collectively house about 1.5 percent of the population. A
                   special HIES was carried out in 2005 to record household economic welfare after the country was hit
                   by the Tsunami disaster in December 2004. While this survey round covers all districts nationwide,
                   it interviews only 5,000 households and provides data representative at only the national level. Not
                   until 2012/13 does the HIES collect district representative data for all 25 districts, with 20,540
                   households being interviewed.


                   Similarly, the LFS excluded conflict-affected districts in its earlier rounds. A special nationally
                   representative round of the LFS was also conducted in 2005 to measure impacts of the Tsunami,
                   with 5,350 households being interviewed. Since 2011, the LFS covers all districts and interviews
                   approximately 19,400-20,200 households in each round.

                   Due to the surveys’ inconsistent geographical coverage, Eastern and Northern provinces are
                   excluded in our trend analysis, unless noted otherwise, to ensure the reported statistics are
                   compatible across survey years. A separate analysis is devoted to these conflict-affected areas in
                   Section III. This report does not use data from the 2005 surveys since they capture impacts of the
                   weather shocks and are representative only at the national level.


                   It is also important to note that the HIES and LFS contain similar but unidential questions on
                   employment. In particular, occupation and industrial categories differ between the two surveys,
                   leading to slightly different industrial categorization in the reported labor market outcomes.


                   This report also accounts for the different definitions of working age across HIES rounds. The
                   2002-2009/10 HIES define working age as 10 years old and above, whereas the 2012/13 HIES
                   selects 15 years old and above. The statistics on labor market in this report refer to only individuals
                   aged 15 years old and above.


                   Not all inconcistencies in the data can be harmonized, however. First, the analysis on asset
                   ownership and debt cannot be extended to year 2002 because the 2002 HIES did not include
                   questions on household durable assets and debts. Second, questions on usual employment status
                   and activity in the 2002-2009/10 HIES did not specify any particular reference period. The 2012/13
                   HIES, in contrast, refers to the last one week for employment questions. These issues, fortunately,
                   do not invalidate the report’s analysis.




                                                                                                                        67

                   In Sri Lanka, new poverty estimates are typically released every three years after each new
                   Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) dataset has been collected and processed. In
                   contrast, labor force statistics are based on the labor force survey (LFS), which is fielded every
                   quarter. Since increased labor income is a main driver of poverty reduction in Sri Lanka, combining
                   information from the LFS and HIES could be a logical and cost-effective way to generate more
                   frequent estimates of poverty. This in turn would help make poverty estimates more useful as
                   inputs into the development of economic policies.


                   Generating more frequent poverty estimates by combining two or more surveys is called survey-
                   to-survey imputation, and in the Sri Lankan context involves three steps. The first step is to identify
                   a set of common variables in the HIES and LFS. The second is to generate a prediction model using
                   data from the current round of the HIES. Finally, data from the most recent LFS are plugged into
                   that prediction model to estimate the current levels of poverty.


                   The underlying assumption in this method is that changes in the household characteristics used
                   to predict consumption, such as the household head’s occupation, closely tracks changes in
                   household consumption. But this may not be the case in Sri Lanka.


                   To verify whether the survey-to-survey imputation method could be used to generate more
                   frequent poverty statistics in Sri Lanka, we used data from the LFS and HIES, covering a common
                   geographic area from June to December in both 2006 and 2009. One test is whether prediction
                   models based on the 2006/07 HIES and imputed data from the 2009 LFS can accurately project
                   poverty forward to 2009. Another important test is whether prediction models based on the
                   2009/10 HIES and imputed data from the 2006 LFS can project poverty backwards to 2006.


                   Unfortunately, the LFS data do not accurately track poverty trends in Sri Lanka (Newhouse et al.
                   2014). This is especially true for the estate sector. According to the HIES, estimated poverty in the
                   estate sector fell rapidly from 2006/07 to 2009/10, from about 34 to 10 percent. But predicted
                   poverty based on imputed data from the LFS fell by only 2 percentage points. This is consistent
                   with large numbers of households in the estate sector moving from just below to just above the
                   poverty line, in ways that could not be captured by the explanatory variables in the LFS.

                   For the rural sector, where most poor people live, the forward predictions perform somewhat
                   better. The predictions explain 70 percent of the 6.5 percentage point reduction in rural poverty
                   between 2006/07 and 2009/10. But backward projection does not fare as well. A model from the
                   2009/10 HIES and imputed data from the 2007 LFS predict rural poverty rate in 2006/07 to be only
                   10.3 percent, much lower than the 15.4 percent rate directly estimated from the 2006/07 HIES.
                   Finally, the method produces more accurate poverty predictions for urban areas.


                   There are important differences in the wording of the questions between the LFS and HIES that
                   made the predictions less accurate. This leaves two options to pursue frequent poverty estimation
                   for Sri Lanka in a cost-effective way. The first is to include questions on assets and other welfare
                   indicators to the LFS; but this may detract the survey from its main purpose of measuring labor
                   market outcomes. The other option is to implement a new household survey that has a short
                   questionnaire that includes variables necessary to impute household expenditures accurately.

                    The Household Expenditure and Income Survey (HIES), from which official poverty figures are
                    estimated, cover different populations over time because the survey could not be implemented in
                    conflict-affect areas. The 2002 HIES excludes 8 districts in the Northern and Eastern provinces –
                    about 13-14 percent of the national population – which are generally poorer than the rest of the
                    country. The 2006 and 2009 HIES exclude 5 and 3 districts, respectively. Not until the 2012/13
                    HIES were all districts in Sri Lanka covered. National estimates of poverty typically include all
                    available districts in the survey. Because of this, the 2002 HIES is likely to underestimate national
                    poverty and, consequently, the pace of poverty reduction since 2002. However, limiting the sample
                    to common districts only lowers the poverty rate by 0.6 percentage points.

                    In theory, the consumption aggregate used to calculate poverty statistics should include only items
                    that are welfare-enhancing. Yet Sri Lanka’s official consumption aggregate includes savings, which
                    have ambiguous correlation with welfare but often account for a significant proportion of rich
                    households’ total expenditure. There are also some inconsistencies in the inclusion of durables
                    goods and elder and child care services and their recall periods across different rounds of the
                    HIES.12 We construct a new consumption aggregate from the 2002 and 2009 HIES to eliminate
                    these inconsistencies and finds that the estimated poverty rates for 2002 and 2009 are both
                    0.3 percentage points lower than the official figures, the Gini index also decreases by 5 index
                    points in both years. The estimated poverty reduction between 2002 and 2009, as a result, remains
                    unaffected.


                    INfLATINg The poveRTy LINe oveR TIme
                    Sri Lanka’s poverty line deflator, the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI), is based on retail prices
                    in the capital district of Colombo. This characteristic limits the CCPI’s ability to capture changes
                    in living costs of the poor. The prices actually paid by low-income households are often different
                    from urban retail prices, partly because low-income households often consume commodities of
                    lower quality, and partly because they are more likely to purchase in remote areas or through
                    informal markets. Moreover, the CCPI reflects the consumption pattern of an average Colombo
                    residents and assigns larger weights to richer households when aggregating budget shares across
                    households. Data from the HIES show that poorer households spend a larger budget share on food,
                    with smaller shares going to education, transport, and housing as compared with the shares used
                    in the CCPI. Since food inflation was higher than non-food inflation during the period of 2002-
                    2009, the CCPI might underestimate the increase in living cost of low-income households and,
                    consequently, underestimate the poverty incidence in more recent years. Constructing alternative
                    price indexes to address these issues increases the estimated annual inflation and poverty rates
                    between 2002 and 2009 by a mild but noticeable amount.

                    12   This sensitivity analysis was undertaken before the 2012/13 HIES data became publicly available. Therefore, we were unable to
                         conduct robust check with respect to the official estimated poverty statistics for 2012/13.

                   Specifically, if the bottom decile was selected as the reference group, instead of the Colombo
                   population, annual inflation during 2002-2009/10 rises from the official estimate of 11.39 to 11.97,
                   and the headcount index from 8.2 to 9.7 percent. If equal weights are assigned to households
                   when aggregating household budget shares, annual inflation is estimated at 11.63 and poverty
                   rate at 8.9. Using unit values of expenditure items from the HIES to construct survey-based
                   price indexes, we also obtain higher inflation and higher poverty rates. Since our consumption
                   bundle was restricted by items that are common between the 2002 and 2009/10 HIES, we cannot
                   construct a survey-based index that has the same consumption bundle as the CCPI. Nevertheless,
                   the official food-only price index is similar to our food-only, survey-based indexes. Also, using a
                   weighted average of the official CPI and official food CPI to inflate the poverty line for the bottom 40
                   percent increases national poverty rate for 2012 by 0.8 percentage points. Therefore, the official
                   poverty trend is robust to alternative sources of price data, at least for food items.


                   SpATIAL pRICe AdjuSTmeNTS
                   The spatial price index used by DCS to control for differences in living costs across regions is based
                   on the HIES unit values and disaggregated at the district level. Our sensitivity analysis with regard
                   to the index formula, the population reference group, and the level of disaggregation shows that
                   alternative indexes only have minor impacts on the costs of living and ranking of poverty rate at the
                   district level, but the declining trend in poverty incidence does not change considerably.


                   Overall, although alternative methods of constructing the poverty line and calculating the
                   consumption aggregate result in different poverty estimates, Sri Lanka’s impressive reduction in
                   poverty remains robust.

appendIx 4: mulTI-dImensIonal InequalITy among srI lankan chIldren



                   As pointed out in Section two above, income inequality is associated with unequal access to basic
                   goods and services. Such inequality is particularly concerning among children because their
                   access to such goods and services is often beyond their control. We consider inequality among Sri
                   Lankan children in three critical areas: education, as indicated by secondary school attendance of
                   children aged 12-17 years old and secondary completion by children aged 17-18 years old; health
                   and nutrition, as indicated by the prevalence of diarrhea and stunting, and consumption of iron-
                   rich foods, and household infrastructure (access to permanent housing structure, clean water,
                   electricity, and toilet).


                   Compared to other countries with similar income levels, Sri Lanka has performed relatively well in
                   providing her children with almost universal coverage of primary school (97 percent) and electricity
                   (98 percent), and reducing the prevalence of diarrhea to only 4 percent (Abras 2014). Yet by
                   2012/13 the country still falls short of universal coverage in several areas, specifically secondary
                   school attendance (87 percent) and completion (53 percent), permanent housing structure (77
                   percent), and access to iron-rich foods (51 percent). Stunting rate also remains high (19 percent).


                   These coverage rates, however, do not reveal how access to such goods and services and avoidance
                   of the diseases are distributed across different socio-demographic groups. One measure to access
                   multi-dimensional inequality is the Human Opportunity Index (HOI), in which opportunity is broadly
                   defined as access to basic goods and services that are critical for the physical, mental and social
                   development of children. The HOI is calculated as the difference between the overall coverage
                   rate of an opportunity and a misallocation penalty that represents how much the opportunity is
                   unequally distributed across circumstance groups.13 That means the higher inequality, the larger
                   the misallocation penalty and the difference between HOI and coverage rate.


                   Analysis based on data from the 2002-2012/13 HIES and 2007 DHS shows that among the
                   selected indicators, inequality in opportunity, as reflected by the penalty, is larger in secondary
                   school completion (9 percentage points), access to permanent housing (7 percentage points),
                   and to a lesser extent, the probability of not being stunted (4 percentage points).


                   As shown in Figure 65, household wealth, and education attainment of the household head are two
                   major determinants of unequal opportunities in secondary school attendance and completion,
                   access to electricity and permanent housing structure, and not being stunted. As well, living
                   in conflict-affected areas significantly hinders children’s access to iron-rich foods and safe
                   water, and avoidance of diarrhea. Being stunted is strongly affected by wealth and education of
                   household head, as well as household size. Location plays an important role in determining access
                   to electricity, permanent housing structure, safe water, and toilet.




                   13   Abras (2014) provides a useful discussion on the construction of the HOI.

                            Changes in the HOI can be decomposed into (i) the composition effect, which is due to changes in
                            the distribution of circumstances in the population, (ii) the scale effect, or the proportional change
                            in the overall coverage across different circumstance groups, and (iii) the equalization effect, i.e.
                            change in the coverage of under-covered groups while keeping the overall coverage rate constant.
                            A major proportion of the changes in HOI in Sri Lanka are attributed to the scale effect, suggesting
                            public investment in public facilities would benefit all (see Figure 66). The equalization effect is
                            largest in access to electricity.
