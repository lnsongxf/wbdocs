Sex ratio at birth – the number of boys born for
every 100 girls – has increased in the South
Caucasus in the past decades. A World Bank studyi
sought to produce rigorous and supporting
evidence on the issue of “missing girls” in the South
Caucasus countries—Armenia, Azerbaijan, and
Georgia—to inform and propose policy options.
The findings highlight the causes and
consequences of skewed birth ratios and sex
selection.

respondents across countries, generations, and

once they made up their minds “they would do it

offering financial incentives to have and bring up
girls have not been effective either.
