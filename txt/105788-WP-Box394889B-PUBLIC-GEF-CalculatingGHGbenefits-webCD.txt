The Transport Emissions Evaluation Models for Projects (TEEMP) are excel-based models for estimating GHG
impacts of transport projects. The TEEMP tools were developed by the Clean Air Initiative for Asian Cities
(CAI-Asia) and the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy ( ITDP) for evaluating the emissions
impacts of ADB’s transport projects and were modified and extended for GEF projects by ITDP, CAI-Asia and
Cambridge Systematics, Inc for the GEF-Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP). Models were further
refined through their application to projects of the ADB and the World Bank.

6	Overview for Applying GEF Tools and Methodologies
                             Sequence of the GEF Methodology
   Even though there is a vast variability in the types of GEF projects, there is a consistent sequence that is
   followed in calculating CO2 emission reductions for a GEF application:
   1.	 Establish a baseline: Calculate the estimated baseline emissions of the scenario without a GEF
       intervention. The baseline emissions estimation will be compared against the estimated GHG
       emissions reduction achieved by the GEF project. When using TEEMP models to find direct impact,
       no separate baseline need be established in this step because TEEMP models automatically calculate
       a baseline by using a market-shed analysis approach. Instead, the user should be sure to input all
       dependable local transport data that is available into the TEEMP model. If dependable local data is
       unavailable, default values are provided.
   2.	 Calculate the direct emissions impact for the GEF scenario. This includes all GEF and co-financing
       investments that are tracked in the logframe during the project’s implementation. The difference
       between this GEF project scenario emissions and the baseline emissions equals the direct emission
       impact of the project. If TEEMP models are used, this figure is the model‘s main output.
   3.	 Estimate the direct post-project emission reductions, if any are expected. Direct post-project
       impacts occur beyond the supervised timetable of the project. They result when a financial mechanism,
       established as part of a project, remains in place and keeps providing support for GHG-reducing
       investments beyond the lifetime of the project.
   4.	 Calculate the indirect emission reductions. These are reductions that occur from replication and
       market expansion outside of the logframe or in the post-project period which have a “causal” link to
       the GEF intervention. If it is appropriate for the situation, use both the Bottom-up and the Top-down
       methodologies to create a range of potential impacts. In some cases, only the Bottom-up method
       will make sense. For certain types of transportation interventions, accepted (default) replication rates
       based on observed impacts can be used.
   Each of these steps will be discussed in more detail in the following sub-headings. Figure 1 (next page)
   contains a flowchart illustrating this process.

Some reality checks can be used to test the final results.    Bottom-up Approach
For example, the Bottom-up indirect calculation

   It is essential that the proponent read Section I (Introduction, Concepts and Introductions) and Section II
   (Overview for Applying GEF Tools and Methodologies) before moving forward. The core critical concepts,
   terminologies and foundations are detailed in those sections and are not repeated here. Unless the
   proponent is already quite familiar with GEF methodologies through prior experience, it is doubtful this
   current Section can be successfully navigated without first reading Sections I and II.


                   In this Section you will be working with the following TEEMP model:
