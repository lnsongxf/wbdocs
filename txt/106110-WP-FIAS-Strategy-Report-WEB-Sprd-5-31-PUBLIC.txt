    First drafts of these check-lists have been completed and those on construction and investment incentives have been piloted
    in Morocco to test their relevance.

Knowledge Management recommendations: The independent consultant recommends that knowledge management be aligned with
strategic objective of Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice. … In summary, what is missing currently from the KM is, first, a sense
of ownership in which an individual or small unit takes the time to re-synthesize those lessons learned into specific problem solutions
that address problems being faced in the field.

Efficiency and Effectiveness: Management appreciates the independent consultant’s overall ratings on efficiency and effectiveness.                                                GRAND TOTAL                    46     75     76     68             -         265

Political Economy: Management agrees that more can be done on political economy analysis (PEA) and in a more consistent manner.                                                   Timor-Leste                     0       1     0      0             -           1
Political economy analysis (PEA) is an integral part of project design. It is important to understand the relationship between the                                                Vietnam                         0      0       1     0             -           1

Management agrees that measurement beyond reforms is critical and has made and continues to make significant progress over the
last two years in moving toward measurement of impacts. On this FIAS has excelled, surpassing investment-generated targets before                                                 Bosnia and Herzegovina          0      0      0      3             -           3

Cross-Cutting: Management agrees that the approach to gender can be improved under FIAS. Prior to the FIAS midterm evaluation,
an effort was launched to develop a gender strategy for investment climate. It was approved by the management team in FY2014.                                                     Kosovo                          2      3      0       1            -          6
The action plan on gender is based on the FIAS FY12–16 strategy that focused on engaging on gender when client demand and                                                         Kyrgyz Republic                 0      0      0      2             -           2

very beneficial to understanding how and where PPD works best—in addition to developing better measures of its impact.                                                            Tajikistan                       1     0       1      1            -           3
