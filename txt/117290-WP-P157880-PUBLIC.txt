The analysis so far offers two takeaway messages for countries      cially how integrated the partners are into regional and global

chains. The first is that imports can be an important driver of     activity (including markets). The composition of firms within an

beverages destined mainly for industry, other industrial supplies, fuels and lubricants other than processed motor spirits, and parts and accessories for capital
goods and transport equipment. The composition of macro-geographic (continental) regions follows the UN methodology (http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/

Note: Numbers in parentheses are robust standard errors. Regressions are at the sectoral level using a fixed-effects specification that restricts the variance to the
country-sector dimension and thus captures the impact of changes in the independent variables on the dependent variable. This setup controls for time-invariant
country-sector omitted variables. See table A3.1.2 for a description of the variables and table A3.1.3 for descriptive statistics.

   In discussing the middle-income trap, it probably helps to         (increased connectivity and GVCs) and creating an environment
move away from the deterministic framing that the concept             conducive to diversification, innovation, and productivity. Second,
can assume, particularly in the eyes of policymakers. The evi-        attention to the macroeconomic, social, and environmental sus-
dence is fairly robust that there is nothing overly probable, let     tainability of a GVC-led development model is also in order.

Policy implications

The quality of institutions affects comparative advantage and
thus participation in GVCs. The stages of the production process
differ in the extent to which they use simple labor, skilled labor,
and capital (factor intensity). Activities also differ in their contract
intensity. Producing a complete, homogeneous product with no
imported content has simple or no contract intensity; growing
and exporting bananas is an example. At the other extreme is
producing a specialized part for a sophisticated electronics
product. If done at arm’s length, the purchasing firm has to have
considerable confidence in the contract.
    Developing countries in general have a lot of simple labor
relative to skilled labor and capital. Given those factor endow-                 Below the mean                                     Above the mean
