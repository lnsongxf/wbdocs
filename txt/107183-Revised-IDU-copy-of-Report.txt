Investing early in children is the key to enhancing the India’s competitiveness at the global level.
India’s right to free and compulsory elementary education (RTE) to all children of the age group
of 6-14 years of age rightly focuses on the early years and has demonstrated impressive gains.
Almost 98% of habitations having access to an elementary school; pupil-teacher ratios have
improved significantly and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan ( SSA) as the vehicle for the RTE has taken
huge strides in developing infrastructure for elementary schools across the country. While these
are certainly reasons to celebrate, the concern at present is the persisting low levels of learning in
the early grades. The recently concluded nationally driven National Achievement Test (NAS),
2015 for Class V that provided an opportunity to compare achievement levels over a period of
time shows a decline in learning outcome levels. This holds true across States and across subjects.
It is time to take stock of the return on the investments in school education to test its efficiency
and effectiveness.
The World Bank’s study Value for money from Public Education Expenditure on Elementary
Education in India has been undertaken as part of its ongoing support to Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.
The study reflects findings that have profound implications for the school education sector; the
decrease in Class V learning outcome levels is expected to reduce students’ expected wage
earnings by up to 11.9 percent, significantly reducing India’s labour force productivity and
economic growth. This is a phenomenon that links integrally to the key issue: have young children
been provided the right start in life? Are they taught by teachers who are qualified, motivated and
accountable? While India pays its teachers three times more than China, it needs to enhance the
presence of these teachers in the classrooms and actually teaching. Recent studies show that greater
accountability from teachers and improved presence in classrooms would reduce teacher costs by
$1.5 billion per annum.
The Report has raised some major emerging issues in the education sector while evaluating the
value for money as a reflection of its being used efficiently to yield a high return in terms of
children’s access to quality education and learning outcomes. Key funding of the study and major
recommendations are included in the Report. An infographic based summary of the report is
present below for easy readability.

I hope this study will be useful for academics, policy makers, educational practitioners and people
interested in the education sector in India.

                               EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The World Bank has been supporting the Universalization of Elementary Education (UEE)
program for India through its support to the flagship program of the Government of India, the
Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA). The Bank’s ongoing support to SSA is a little over $ 1 billion.
With reducing national level budgetary allocation and scarcity of resources for publicly-funded
education, it is important to analyse the efficiency and effectiveness of the investments in the
sector. It is critical that financial investments made have been used efficiently and yield a high
return in terms of children’s access to education and learning outcomes.

With this objective, the World Bank as a part of its ongoing support to SSA, undertook a Value
for Money (VFM) analysis that could assess the returns from public education expenditure.
This paper attempts to calculate and benchmark the economic value of any increases in
children’s access to schooling and in students’ learning levels that may result from increases
in public education spending over time.

Some insights about key issues and recommendations are presented in Infographics for easy

   Elementary Education in India: Some Facts
          Dwindling Enrolment: Increase in Small Schools

           In the last 9 years, while number of Government schools increased by 1.4 lakh, their total
            Enrolment fell by 6.7 Million students. The number of private school rose by 1.7 lakh and
            their total enrolment rose by 35.5 million.

           The reduction in total enrolment has rendered many Government schools economically
            unviable. There are 96,965 ‘small’ schools in India (those with 20 or fewer students as a
            whole, for classes 1 to 5 or 1 to 8).



          Learning Outcome Levels and Associated Costs
           Half of students enrolled in Class V, cannot read a Class II level text; for children enrolled
            in government schools in Class V, reading levels between 2010 and 2012 are increasingly
            getting lower and stuck (ASER 2014)
           During the period 2011-12 to 2014-15, the aggregate learning outcome levels for Class V
            students declined by 6 to 33 points (National Achievement Survey- NCERT). During the
            same time period the annual per pupil expenditure increased by up to 253 percent
           Cost per unit of learning achievement is INR 338 in government schools and INR 63 in
            private schools.


          Labour Force Productivity


           Every ‘one standard deviation’ positive increase in cognitive skills can increase a students’
            expected wage earnings by 18 percent.

           The decrease in Class V learning outcome levels between 2011-12 and 2014-15 is expected
            to reduce students’ expected wage earnings by up to 11.9 percent.




          Teacher Salaries and Absenteeism

           Government school teachers in India are given a remuneration which is three times what
            China pays its public school teachers and 25 times what private schools in India
            remunerate their teachers.

           The fiscal cost of teacher absence in India is around US $ 1.5 billion (or INR 9800 crore) per
            annum.




          Early Childhood Education



           Adding 2 years of pre-school education to SSA (Right to Education) can generate a return
            as high as INR 25 for every INR 1 invested- with about 30 to 60 percent additional income

                          The Small Schools Phenomenon




Number of Small Schools (computed from UDISE raw data)       Mean Annual per Pupil Teacher-Salary-Cost in Small Schools



           The reduction in total enrolment may make many Government schools economically unviable.
           There are 96,965 ‘small’ schools in India (those with 20 or fewer students as a whole, for classes
           1 to 5 or 1 to 8).

           These nearly 1 lakh ‘small schools’ have a PTR of mere 6.7 students per teacher, a mean teacher
           salary cost per pupil of INR 85,872 p.a, and with the teacher salary bill going up to of INR 9,700
           crore pa.

           While recognizing that some of these ‘small’ Government schools are in remote or hilly areas,
           the PTR of 6.7 students per teacher suggests (given the number of teachers allocated) that over
           time, student numbers have dwindled, leading to low cost-effectiveness.

           The RTE Act’s requirement for establishing more Government schools increases wastage, given
           the trend of the emptying of Government schools.


           To improve cost-effectiveness, in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, about 23,700
           Government schools have been merged with other Government schools or been closed down in
           2014-15.

   In the last 9 years, while number of Government schools increased by 1.4 lakh, their total
   enrolment fell by 6.7 million students.
   The number of private school rose by 1.7 lakh and their total enrolment rose by 35.5 million.

    Average enrolment per Government school fell by 24 students from a low base of 131 students
    per Government school in 2005, implying a 20% reduction in mean school size in 9 years.



   Between 2007 and 2014, Government schools with 50 or fewer students as a proportion of all
   Government schools increased from 24.3% to 32.3% (from 2.3 lakh to 3.5 lakh small schools).



        Since RTE obligated state Governments to establish neighborhood schools, 65,065 new
    Government schools have been established, reducing the mean size per Government school
    from an already low base. Currently, mean size per school (class 1 to 8) is 106 students per
    Government school.

 • The average decrease in learning outcome scores for
   mathematics, comprehension and environmental                • While the decrease in expected income varies from
   sciences is 18, 18 and 13 points respectively.                State to State, it ranges from 2.0 percent to 11.9
                                                                 percent.

Causes for Low Learning Achievement Levels


  Large educational inputs related expenditure, i.e. on items that have little relationship with
  student learning levels; example: expenditure to reduce pupil teacher ratios by large scale
  hiring of teachers to meet 1:30 Pupil Teacher Ratio (PTR) to meet requirements of the Right to
  Education (RTE) Act.



  Stretched fiscal capacity of Government through increasing teacher salaries while these salaries
  are already high compared to other developing countries; up to 10 times the salaries of
  contract teachers and up to 25 times the salary in private schools.




   Inefficiency of maintaining small schools due to diminishing student population.




  Lack of access to quality pre-school education (as per RTE Act) leading to lack of preparedness
  of young children on cognitive, con-cognitive and socio-emotional skills constraining their
  ability for smooth transition to formal schooling in Class I.
         Private schools with pre-school have greater enrolment trends and retention levels



  Wastage may be due to considerable proportion of non-genuine enrolments and high levels of
  student absence – need to have third party assessment of enrolment data and attendance rates
  for Government schools.




   Low teacher attendance rates and need for enhanced accountability.




  Need for greater autonomy and efficiency in the social accountability mechanisms through the
  School Management Committees that have been put in place under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan
  (SSA).

     Introduce Two Years of Pre School Education in Government Schools




Adding 2 years of pre-primary education in the government schooling system in India can generate
a return as high as INR 25 for every INR 1 invested. Students who undergo pre-primary schooling
have improved educational outcomes with 30 percent more students completing high school,
along with lower repetition and wastage in school. This leads to a skilled workforce and increased
labour productivity with 30 percent to 60 percent additional income over an individual's lifetime.
Additionally, other benefits to society in the form of reduced crime and improved health outcomes
are seen. Finally, benefits of pre-primary education surpass costs required to set up the system
within less than 10 years and lead to an additional GDP of approximately 4.3 percent by 2050 and
7 percent by 2074.

  •    Greater convergence between SSA and RMSA to reduce transation cost at national and
       state levels
  •    Closing private schools in the name of non-compliance may be revisited and they may be
       assisted for reform




Pre-School education in govt. schools


   •   Two years of pre-school education may be brought under the ambit of SSA urgently as
       inherent inefficiencies in provision of pre-school education is leading to low learning
       levels in primary school children and migration of students to private schools that provide
       pre-school education along with primary schools.




Learning Outcome Levels

  •    Provide performance based support to states under SSA through ranking of states based on
       learning outcomes
  •    India may participate in international assessments starting with PIRLS (Progress in
       International Reading Literacy Study) testing reading achievement of students in their
       fourth year of schooling and TIMMS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science
       Study) that tests 4th and 8th grade students to underatnd its position internationally




Teacher Salaries and Absenteeism


• Reduce teacher costs to the central government: with more efficient sharing of cost of
  teacher salaries between national and state governments
• Increases in teacher salary may be linked to teacher performance
• Link salary hikes to teachers accountability and performance with a mild form of performance
  related pay, as was done in Mexico as negotiated with teacher unions
• Strengthen local leaders and School Management Committees for assessment of teacher
  attendance and performance

                                     INTRODUCTION

Since resources for publicly-funded education are scarce, it is important that every Rupee is
used efficiently and yields a high return in terms of children’s access to education and learning
outcomes. Value for Money (VFM) analysis shows what return the taxpayer gets from public
education expenditure. This paper attempts to calculate and benchmark the economic value of
any increases in children’s access to schooling and in students’ learning levels that may result
from increases in public education spending over time.

Influential research shows that it is not (average) years of education of the population but rather
the (average) cognitive skill levels of the population that explains the economic growth rates
of countries (Hanushek and Woessman, 2008). For this reason, the paper focuses first on VFM
from government investment in terms of increasing children’s learning levels. Section 2
investigates how students’ literacy and numeracy skill levels change with changes in per pupil
education expenditure by government, and then measures the extent to which those resulting
changes in cognitive skill levels influence individuals’ productivity in the labour market. It also
measures the cost per achievement unit in the government and private school sectors, to
compare the VFM from education expenditure in these two schooling sectors. Section 3
examines the various underlying sources of VFM in school education and considers how VFM
could be improved. Section 4 considers the VFM from government education expenditure in
terms of increased access to schooling denoted by the drop in the number of out of school
children (OOSC) between 2009 and 2014. Section 5 concludes.

Key determinant of VFM: Changes in learning levels

VFM shows the amount of output produced for each rupee spent. A state is said to be achieving
high VFM for a given amount of educational expenditure, if it increases learning levels more
than other states/countries, or, conversely, if it produces a given amount of learning at a lower
cost than other states/countries.

The paper follow two different approaches to measuring VFM. Firstly, it examines the change
in productivity / earnings that a typical student would expect to get in the labour market, from
the change in learning level that he/she experienced between 2012 – 2015, as measured in the
National Council of Education, Research and Training’s (NCERT) National Achievement
Survey (NAS) of class 5 at these two points of time. Then, this is put together with the increase
in government education spending per pupil over the same period 2012-15, to yield VFM.

The second approach is to compare the learning output per rupee in the government schooling
sector with a suitable comparator. Evidence on two components is needed to calculate the
VFM in this approach – on government school pupils’ learning levels (output) and on
government schools’ per student cost (per pupil expenditure (PPE)). Putting these two together,
i.e., dividing the annual per-pupil-expenditure by the number of learning units, will yield the
rupee cost per learning unit in the government school sector. Ideally, one would like to compare
VFM from government education spending in India with the VFM from government education
spending in other countries; for that, on the output side, we would need data on students’
learning levels on the same test taken by students in India and in other countries. We do not
have such data for any recent year since India has not taken part lately in any international tests
and, even when it participated in the Programme for International Assessment (PISA) test, only
two educationally advanced states took part – Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.

                                                9
Thus, instead, to see whether VFM from government education spending is high or low, the
study compares it with the VFM from private school spending. To do this, the learning output
measure for government and private schools within India was required. Since the NCERT’s
NAS does not test private school students, the paper uses the learning achievement levels
measured in the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) survey. This exercise was
undertaken for 8 major states of India. PPE on government elementary schools is calculated
from the state governments’ published budgets 1, and private schools’ total fee level in
elementary (class 1 to 8) including the school’s tuition fee, examination fee, development fee
and other compulsory payments, is taken as their PPE. The median of private school fee in
each state is obtained from the National Sample Survey of 2014 (NSS, 2014).

Are we getting value for money? What is the expected change in productivity from a
change in learning levels?

The recently concluded NAS 2015 for Class V students provides the first opportunity to
compare achievement levels over a period of time, since the same class was also tested in 2011-
12. Class V is the first class for which learning outcome scores are available at two separate
points in time and that maintains a consistent Itemized Response Theory (IRT) based
assessment method. Table 1 contains the results. The mean achievement levels of class V
children in eight sample states in Reading, Maths and EVS in 2012 and 2015 are set out in
Appendix 1. The comparison of learning levels over the two years in Table 1A shows a decline
in learning outcome levels and this downward trend is observed to hold true across States and
across subjects.

The literature suggests a positive link between cognitive skill levels and the labour market
earnings a student can expect to derive after completing schooling. A drop in learning outcome
levels means a drop in the level of cognitive skills and in turn a drop in the individual’s (future)
productivity in the labour market. This drop in productivity would reduce the remuneration that
profit-maximising employers are ready to pay.

In order to facilitate comparison over time and across States, the NAS assumes a normal
distribution for learning outcome scores and, by construction, keeps the expected mean score
at 250 achievement points with a standard deviation (SD) of 50 achievement points around that
mean. Aslam et al (2010) show that a 1 SD increase in cognitive skills increases wages by 18%
in India; this is roughly in the range of size of effects from cognitive skills onto wages reported
in Table 1 of Hanushek and Woessmann (2008) for Ghana, Kenya and Pakistan. Thus, it is
assumed that for every one standard deviation reduction in the learning outcome score, a
student’s expected earnings upon joining the workforce dip by a factor of 0.18. We multiplied
the reduction in the mean test score in terms of standard deviations in the penultimate column
of Table 1a by the factor of 0.18, and this gives the percentage change in earnings as a result
of the reduction in cognitive skills that a student can expect to derive upon joining the
workforce.

The analysis uses change in the aggregate learning outcome achievement levels, i.e. average
test scores for ‘Comprehension’, ‘Mathematics’ and ‘Environmental Sciences’ seen in column

 Government expenditure on SSA and Mid Day Meals is removed, in order to exclude expenditure on free
uniforms, books, scholarships for SC/ST children and on mid day meals. This is to keep Government PPE
comparable to the private schools’ PPE, since private schools do not spend on these items.

                                                   10
5 of Table 1a. The state wise calculations given in last column clearly highlight how the drop
in learning levels is expected to impact the future earnings of students. The drop is expected
to be in the range of 2.04 percent in Gujarat to as high as 11.9 percent in Uttar Pradesh.

Table 1b shows that in absolute terms a child completing Class V in 2014-15 should expect to
draw earnings which are INR 312 (in Bihar) to INR 1,827 (in Tamil Nadu) less than what a
child completing Class V in 2011-12 expected to earn. The estimates for average annual
income of a Class V student have been determined using NSSO 67th round data 2.

While the drop in learning levels and therefore the expected drop in economic productivity/
earnings is a worrying sign, the gravity of the VFM problem is further exacerbated by the fact
that during the same time period (2011-12 to 2014-15), state governments have increased their
expenditure on elementary education. Estimates of PPE of Government elementary schools are
set out in Appendix Table 1k, whose note explains the method of estimating the PPE. The
change in annual PPE between 2011-12 and 2014-15 are given in Table 1c. During this time
period, the annual PPE has increased by upto 150% (in Madhya Pradesh), and by an average
of about 81%, if we average across the 8 major states (last row of Table 1c). Only Gujarat has
decreased annual PPE, by 15 percent.

To summarise, there has unfortunately been negative VFM from increases in government
expenditure on education over the period 2011 to 2014 since over this period, student learning
levels fell instead of rising and, when this reduction in cognitive skills is monetised, it shows a
negative impact on expected earnings/productivity.

Calculation of VFM – How are private schools doing?

Tables 2a and 2b show the VFM from education expenditure on government and private
schools for 8 different states of India, for literacy and numeracy areas respectively. VFM is
essentially a measure of the efficiency or cost-effectiveness of expenditure. Table 4a shows
that there are large variations in the cost-effectiveness of government spending across the
different states, with Uttar Pradesh being an outlier.

Consider the case of Madhya Pradesh (MP) in Table 2a, for illustration. PPE in MP government
school system is Rs 9384 per annum and in private schools Rs 3700 per annum. Thus,
government schools’ PPE is 2.5 times private schools’ PPE. However, the learning units are
higher in private schools: 58% of private school students and 28% of government students of
class 5 could read a class 2 level text in 2014-15. Thus government schools’ learning output is
just about half that in private schools. Putting the output and expenditure items together, we
find that the cost per unit of achievement is Rs 338 in government schools and Rs 63 in private
schools, implying that private schools are 5.3 times as cost effective as public schools, or that
government schools are one fifth as efficient in producing output as private schools.

However, studies show that a large part of the observed learning advantage of private school
students is explained by their more educated and better-off home backgrounds. When home

  A national estimate has been adjusted to a State level by using State wise per capita income estimates (2004-05
constant prices) as an adjustment factor. In order to do this, the per capita earnings estimates for the State have
been divided by the per capita earnings estimates for India as a whole. The resulting factor has been used to adjust
the National level estimate for expected income for a Class V pass out (INR 19,226). The figures for 2014-15
have not been adjusted for inflation so as to maintain comparison with the 2011-12 figures (as adjustment using
Consumer Price Index may have nominally negated the negative impact of fall in learning outcome levels).

background is strictly controlled for 3, the raw public-private learning gap greatly falls but is
usually not eliminated. In Desai et al (2008) and French and Kingdon (2010) both using
national data on India, about 20 to 30% of the private school achievement advantage remained
even after controlling strictly for home background. The last row of Table 1a shows that if only
25% of the raw public-private achievement gap of MP is attributed to superior private school
quality (e.g., lower teacher absence rates), then private schools are 3.25 more efficient than
government schools, rather than 5.3 times.

If all the raw public-private learning difference is due to the superior home backgrounds of
private school students, and private school quality is no better that government school quality
– then the public-private gap in VFM collapses to the public-private gap in PPE only, i.e.
private schools are only 2.5 times as cost-effective as government schools, or to put it another
way, VFM from government education expenditure is only 40% as much as the VFM from
private schools’ education expenditure, as seen in row G in Table 2a.

In summary, there is very low VFM from government expenditure on education, in terms of
producing the valued outcome of ‘learning’ among students. The private schooling sector gets
significantly higher VFM in this respect. Together with the earlier finding in section 2.1 where
VFM was in fact negative due to reductions in learning levels over time, this paints a fairly
grim picture of overall VFM being achieved from public education spending, and it calls for a
deep and honest probe into the factors behind these low returns. Section 3 below scrutinizes
the most major ingredients behind the low-VFM crisis.

Low VFM from public education spending: Source identification:

There are several identifiable factors behind the observed low VFM that need attention in order
to improve the efficiency of government spending on education. The first of these is low
learning outcomes from education.

Low learning levels

With the appearance of the NCERT’s NAS 2015 of class V, there is clear evidence of poor and
falling learning levels in government funded elementary education. The NAS, carried out only
in government schools, shows low and falling cognitive skill (literacy and numeracy) levels.
To take one example, in the 2010 NAS, only 45% of class 5 students could identify the correct
answer to the Multiple Choice Question “How much greater is 555 than 198?” a subtraction
word problem around the class 2 level of difficulty. By 2015, 40% of class 5 students who
could answer this same question. Table 3 shows a consistent across-the-board decline in
learning achievement level (of the order of 5 percentage points) in all subject areas.

Secondly, the national ASER 2014 also indicates a similar story of low and falling learning
levels. It shows that among class 5, only 42% of government and 62% of private school students
could read a class 2 level text, and only 21% of government and 39% of private school students

  Through a regression technique called ‘household fixed effects’ which compares only the achievement levels of
children within the same household who go to private and Government schools. Since the home background
(parental education; household wealth, etc.) is the same for different children of the same family, this is a more
powerful way of eliminating the influence of family background, and yields a much purer private school effect
than the simple cross-section Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis. Desai et al (2008) use India Human
Development Survey of 2005-06; French and Kingdon (2010) use three years’ of ASER survey. The latter also
do village level panel data analysis.

could do simple division, a class 2 or 3 level competency. Even among class 8 students in
government schools, only 46% could do the division sum. Some ASER evidence is presented
in Table 4.

Thirdly, in the international PISA test of 15 year old children’s performance, India stood 73rd
out of 74 participating countries, when it had put forward two of its educationally advanced
states (Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu).

If VFM is to increase, the single most important reform is to increase children’s learning levels.
The RTE Act’s best ideas for how to improve quality is to insist on lower pupil teacher ratios
(30:1 in primary, and lower than that in upper primary), to ensure that teachers have
certification of training qualifications, and to ensure the availability of basic infrastructure, but
this inputs based approach to quality is not evidence-based (see section 3c below). The RTE
Act does not prescribe any measures to strengthen teacher accountability and effort.

On the contrary, the recognition requirement of the RTE Act is compelling the (5 times higher
value yielding) private schools to close down due to non-compliance with the physical inputs
requirements of the RTE Act or with other recognition conditions. . According to the National
Independent Schools Association (NISA), 15,083 private unaided schools have closed down
so far due to RTE non-compliance. Closure of private unaided schools often negatively
impacts children’s right to education (RTE) (in a context where the child population is
increasing and state governments are closing down unviably small government schools), while
also reducing the overall efficiency of the system by reducing the number of high-value-
yielding private schools and continuing to operate the lower-value-yielding government
schools which, in some cases themselves do not fulfil the RTE infrastructure norms, since there
is no provision in the RTE Act for the closure of government schools that do not comply with
RTE norms.

High public expenditure on education

There are various ways of benchmarking the size of public expenditure on education in India.
One way is to compare it with that in other countries, e.g. comparing India’s “PPE on education
as a proportion of the country’s per capita GDP” with the same quantity in other countries.
Another way is to compare government schools’ PPE with private schools’ within India.

China and India comparison of public education expenditure
Because of data availability, we compare not total education expenditure but rather its largest
component, namely teacher salary expenditure, and it shows that education is produced three
times as expensively in India as in China. Table 5.4 in Drėze and Sen (2013) is reproduced
here as Table 5; it presents ‘teacher salary as a multiple of the country’s per capita income’ for
India and several other countries. The authors find that the ratio of teacher salary to per capita
GDP is 0.5 in Indonesia and 0.9 in China but 3.0 in India, i.e. average teacher salary expenditure
is three times the average national per-capita-income in India, but that in China average teacher
salary expenditure is less than the average national per-capita-income. In other words, China
spends only one-third as much on teacher salary as India, when expressed as a multiple of
national per capita income. This was before the wage inflation generated by the Sixth Pay
Commission, whereby teacher salaries approximately doubled in one go (Kingdon, 2010).




                                                 13
Public and private school comparison of per-pupil-expenditure
Another way of benchmarking the size of public expenditure on education is to compare PPE
in government schools with that in private schools. Tables 2a and 2b already showed PPE in
public and private schools for 8 major states of India. Table 2a showed that among these eight
states, PPE in government schools is anything from 1 to 13 times as much as in private schools.

Non-productive expenditures in education

VFM can also be low due to educational expenditures on unproductive inputs, i.e. on items that
have no relationship with student learning levels. One example is expenditure to reduce pupil
teacher ratios. The RTE Act 2009 obliges schools to maintain a maximum pupil teacher ratio
of 30 in primary classes, and lower than that in upper primary classes (due to specialist subject
teachers). But evidence internationally shows that pupil teacher ratio is not consistently related
with student learning (Hanushek, 2003; Altinok and Kingdon, 2014). Reducing pupil teacher
ratio is a very expensive reform without demonstrated return in terms of increased student
learning, especially in the context of high student absence rates and the alleged fake/over-stated
enrolment figures in government schools 4.

Another example of increasing spending on non-productive inputs is the increase in
government teacher salaries via Pay Commission recommendations. Much of the fiscal
capacity of government to increase education expenditure is tapped for increasing teacher
salaries when these salaries are already high compared to other developing countries, and are
also upto 10 times the salaries of contract teachers and upto 25 times the teacher salary in
private schools, which is the market-clearing wage 5. While it is proper/just that equity concerns
(equality of salary between contract and regular teachers within government schools) have led
to the ‘regularisation’ of contract teachers in many Indian states, three separate studies with
data from 5 states showed that learning levels among children taught by contract teachers were
no less than among children taught by regular teachers 6 even though their salary was upto one-
tenth of regular teachers’ salary, indicating that higher salaries are not a learning-enhancing
input. The fact that learning levels of children attending private schools are not lower (and
could be modestly higher) than of children attending government schools, despite teacher
salaries being upto 1/25th of government teacher salaries again goes to show that increases in
teacher salary are not a learning-related expenditure. Some expenditures that are arguably more
quality-related have not been made mandatory 7. The inefficiency of using bureaucratically set
high minimum wages rather than market clearing wages, can be addressed by following the
suggestion of a professional development ladder for all teachers, suggested by Pritchett and

4
  Though there are no hard figures, the SchoolTELLS survey of UP and Bihar found that 15% and 35% of
enrolments were fake, i.e. included names of children who were never found in the school in 4 unannounced
survey visits to the sample schools. The over-reporting of enrolment could be due to the economic incentives to
obtain extra food-grains from the Mid-day meal scheme, or extra cloth from the free uniform scheme, or to siphon
off funds intended for SC/ST children’s scholarship of Rs 350 per year.
5
  That is, the wage at which the supply of educated persons equals the demand for educated persons in a local
labour market. In rural Uttar Pradesh currently, mean teacher pay is around Rs 1500 per month in 2014-15
(inflating SchoolTELLS data using the inflation index), and the average salary of a primary (class 1 to 5) teacher
in Government school is Rs 39,683 pm (Ramachandran, 2015). Thus, Government teacher salary in rural UP is
more than 25 times private school teachers’ salary. Average teacher salary (of primary teachers) after 15 years’
experience is estimated at Rs 43,080 per month, in 2015-16 (based on Appendix Table 4).

  For example, investments in school leadership training; increasing teacher competence; monitoring and
inspection expenditure; learning surveys; increased parental information about school quality; research and
innovation; teaching-learning materials; computers; student exchanges; etc.

Murgai (2008). Another idea is to link salary hikes to increased accountability, or a mild form
of performance related pay.

Inefficiency due to non-genuine enrolment

Another problem of wastage is that there is a considerable proportion of non-genuine
enrolments and high levels of student absence. Some questions have been raised – from time
to time – about the veracity and trustworthiness of enrolment data from the self-reported
District Information System on Education (DISE). Newspapers regularly report scams related
to fake enrolment numbers. To take two recent examples from Uttar Pradesh, in November
2015, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) and the Mid-Day Meal Authority (MDMA)
carried out a joint survey of enrolment figures in UP government schools and found that
students’ names were entered in the enrolment registers of more than one government school,
and that in almost every elementary school, total enrolment was inflated by at least 10% 8.
Secondly, in September 2015, the DISE enrolment data for the Lucknow district were reviewed
by the District Magistrate who ordered for a survey to be carried out by the district Basic
Education Officer. The survey showed that 18% of students in Lucknow were “absent for long
period” and the District Magistrate ordered the cancellation of the admission of many of the
elementary school children whose names were in the enrolment registers 9. This is fairly
consistent with the findings of the SchoolTELLS survey of 80 rural primary schools in 5
districts of Uttar Pradesh 10 where each school was visited 4 times in the year 2007-08, and it
was found that 15% of students in the enrolment registers were never present in the school in
any of the four survey visits, i.e. 15% of the total primary school enrolment was apparently
fake. And this is disregarding the absenteeism among children who are not fake enrolments 11.
It has been widely suggested that there are economic incentives for government schools to
over-report enrolments since grains for mid-day meals, cloth for school uniforms, scholarship
money for SC/ST students, and the number of teachers appointed, all these increase with the
reported number of enrolled children in a school, and there are no penalties for over-reporting
enrolments. A de facto pupil teacher ratio of 30:1, based on attendance rate, would be a
desirable policy correction.

    Surveys by the MHRD and the ASER suggest that just over half the children who enrol have a tenuous
connection with the school in UP. The ASER survey for 2015 shows student attendance rates in UP government
schools as 55.1% in primary and 54.7% in upper-primary schools. Thus, when UP elementary schools show a
pupil teacher ratio of 33 according to their enrolment data, this amounts to about 17 pupils per teacher actually
present in school any day.

                                                       15
Low teacher attendance rates

Low teacher attendance is another large source of wastage in the publicly funded part of the
schooling system. Muralidharan et al. (2015) find that the fiscal cost of teacher absence in India
is around US $ 1.5 billion (or Rs. 9800 crore) per annum. They advocate improving governance
by hiring staff to increase the frequency of monitoring would be over ten times more cost
effective in increasing teacher-student contact time than hiring more teachers.

VFM from changes in access to schooling

One important source of VFM comes from children’s increased access to schooling, since
schooling has economic and non-economic benefits. A cost-benefit analysis of the return on
the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) expenditure – over the period 2003 to 2009 – by Kingdon
and Atherton (2010) showed a significant positive economic return from the public expenditure
on the SSA program as this period saw an increase in school access.

An important (inverse) measure of schooling participation is the number of OOSC. Estimates
of OOSC in India are available from the IMRB surveys commissioned by the MHRD via EdCil
in 2005, 2009 and 2014, and the annual ASER surveys. Their findings are summarised in Table
1. They show that between 2005 and 2009, the proportion of OOSC aged 6-14 fell from 6.9%
to 4.3%, close to the corresponding numbers of 6.6% and 4.0% respectively in ASER. In
absolute terms the number of OOSC fell from 13.5 million to 8.2 million over this period.
However, the pace of enrolling OOSC slowed down after 2009. Between 2009 and 2014, the
OOSC fell from 4.3% to 3% as per IMRB and from 4.0% to 3.3% as per ASER. In absolute
terms, the number of OOSC fell during these 5 years from 8.2 million to 6.1 million, a decrease
of about 20 lakh children who are out of school.

While the number of OOSC fell by about 21 lakh, unfortunately 18.5% of the OOSC who
enrolled never actually attended school, and another 37% dropped out of school, mostly by the
end of grade 2, thus 55.5% of OOSC did not remain in school (IMRB, 2014). This reduces the
number of OOSC who had meaningful schooling participation to 44.5% or 9.4 lakh children.

To measure the economic return to staying on in school for these 9.4 lakh youngsters, one
would consider the boost in earnings from extra years of schooling. If these students are
retained in school until class 10 or beyond, they will enjoy higher earnings and higher
productivity and will contribute to economic growth. While there appears to be little economic
return to increments in education in the Indian labour market until lower secondary class 10
level of education (Colclough et. al., 2010), perhaps because education below class 10th does
not lead to secure literacy and numeracy skills and employers are unwilling to pay higher wages
for mere completion 5 or 8 years of schooling without learning cognitive skills 12, a major
advantage of elementary education is that it permits access to high school and beyond, where
there are significant economic returns. Then there are also the non-economic benefits of basic
education. While the literature suggests that even the non-economic returns to education, such
as higher civic sense, lower fertility rates, lower infant mortality, better child health and
education, etc. are greater from secondary education than from elementary education, again
elementary education permits access to the (high return) secondary and further levels of
education. Moreover, government must be credited for establishing schools in remote rural

12
   But this phenomenon is not confined to India alone. Colclough et. al. show that the economic return to primary
schooling has collapsed over time in most developing countries.

areas where private schools are unlikely to operate, even though there is no established
methodology for monetising the non-economic benefits of education or for monetising the
benefits to remote communities of having school access.

Changes in enrolment patterns across government and private schools can lead one to question
the extent to which the OOSC have been absorbed by government schools, since as Table 2
shows government school enrolments have been falling sharply and private schools enrolments
rising strongly 13. However, it is still likely that the OOSC who joined school mostly joined
government school. Despite the difficulty of measuring the benefits from reduction in OOSC,
and despite the size of benefits being compromised due to the low quality of schooling, there
are nevertheless likely to be positive economic and non-economic returns to schooling
participation that is facilitated by government education spending.

The Small Schools syndrome: Is maintaining small, inefficient schools leading to
inequity?

Table 6 shows that government schools have been emptying over time: between 2005 and 2014,
in the 20 major states of India, while the number of government schools increased by 1,38,422,
their total enrolment fell by just under 6.7 million students, so that ‘average enrolment per
government school’ fell by 24 students [from a base of 131 in 2005] 14, i.e. mean school size
fell by nearly 20%. To understand Table 6, it is useful to see the underlying data in the
Appendix Table 2. To take the example of MP, the number of government elementary schools
in MP rose from 104,671 in 2005 to 114,360 in 2014-15, i.e. 9,689 new government schools
were established in MP in this 9 year period, an increase of 9%. However, the number of
students studying in government schools fell by 21,71,597, i.e. government school enrolment
fell by 20%. Thus, average government school size fell from 104 students per school in 2005
to 76 students per school, a reduction of 28 students per school, or 27%. Table 6 shows just the
changes over time for each of the 20 major Indian states.

The emptying of government schools has reduced school size so much that many government
schools are rendered economically unviable, with fewer than 20 students in the entire school
as a whole. Table 7 shows, for each state, the number of ‘small’ government schools that have
a total enrolment of 20 or fewer students. The last two rows of Table 7 show that in the listed
20 major states of India, there are 96,965 small schools and that these have 187,396 teachers
and 1,254,608 students. Thus, the pupil teacher ratio in these schools is a mere 6.7 students per
teacher, and the mean teacher-salary cost per pupil is Rs. 7156 per month. The teacher salary
bill of these schools is nearly a staggering Rs. 9,700 crore per annum. The underlying data for
each state, from which Table 7 is constructed, is given in Appendix Table 3.

If these were all schools in remote areas, it would be equity-related expenditure that is
facilitating access to schooling in remote areas. However, the reality of a pupil teacher ratio of
6.7 students per teacher suggests that at one time they had more students (hence the number of
teachers allocated) but that, over time, student numbers have dwindled, thereby lowering the
pupil teacher ratio. Thus, some part of this major phenomenon of small schools is due to



13
   The underlying DISE data on total Government and private school numbers and their total enrolments, from
which Table 2 has been made, are given in Appendix Table 2.
14
   Over the same period, the number of private (recognised) schools increased by 1,70,064 and their total
enrolment increased by nearly 35.5 million students.

                                                    17
reductions in student numbers and is indicative of a large problem of poor cost-effectiveness
of education expenditure.

That is presumably why some states have rationalised small schools to some extent during
2014-15, e.g. between Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, about 23,700 government
schools have been merged with other schools or been closed down (newspaper reports).

While the Government of India’s school location policies (reiterated in the RTE Act 2009)
have long aimed to ensure a school either within a habitation, or within easy walking distance,
little attention has been paid to the fact that school location policies affect not only schooling
access but also many important aspects of school quality such as school size, the number of
teachers, and the socio-economic composition of the student body. Anjini Kochar (2007) shows
that habitation size determines the availability of schools in scheduled caste and tribe (SC/ST)
habitations, and also determines the number of teachers, and that these in turn determine
schooling attainment of children. Where neighbourhoods are segregated by caste, the
availability of neighbourhood schools may lead to caste-based segregation in schools. Kochar
shows that this increases the schooling of upper castes but reduces that of SCs. Thus, school
location policies, through their effect on school quality, imply that the benefits of school access
differ across castes within any given region.

In this context of emptying of government schools, unviably small government schools, and
the negative effects of caste-segregated schools, there is an inherent inefficiency built into the
RTE Act’s prescription that governments must establish neighbourhood primary schools within
a 1 km radius, and upper primary schools within a 3 km radius, of every population cluster. In
a context where parents have been abandoning government schools, average government
school enrolments have fallen secularly, and thousands of government schools are being closed
down due to being economically unviable, creating yet more government schools would be
very wasteful. This dissonance requires correction with an amendment of the RTE Act.

Convergence for Greater Efficiencies: Downward Integration with Pre-School
Education and Upward Integration with Secondary Education:

Improving the Quality of Elementary Education through Introduction of Pre-School
Education: SSA, a centrally sponsored scheme, is currently the main vehicle for RTE- for
realizing the vision of providing quality education to all: which has demonstrated some success,
as evident from the fact that the net enrolment rate at the primary level has risen to about 90
percent in 2011-12 and the annual dropout rate has declined from 9.4 percent in 2007-8 to 5.3
percent in 2012-13. (MHRD, 2013). While these are certainly reasons to celebrate, the concern
is the persisting low levels of learning in the early grades, with a significant number of children
in grade 5 reported to not being able to read even grade 2 text ( ASER 2013), resulting in
children moving from one grade to another without learning even the basics of reading and
writing. Responding to this concern, the MHRD has launched a new scheme titled “Padho
Bharat Badho Bharat” with a focus on quality improvement in grades 1 and 2, for which
specific funding is provided under SSA.

While this focus on the early grades is well justified since a weak foundation can only lead to
cumulative deficits in learning in higher grades, the diagnosis of the problem needs further
examination.

Shifting Focus to the Child and School Readiness: Recent research in India in three states
on about 12 thousand six year olds has provided convincing evidence that a major factor for
low learning levels in early grades is inadequate school readiness with children coming into
school in Grade 1 with inadequate cognitive and language competencies which are
prerequisites for the primary school curriculum (Indian Early Childhood Education Impact
(IECEI, 2014). With the legislative and policy mandate for all children to come into school at
age 6, a significant number of children are now coming in from home environments which
primarily have an oral culture with very little exposure to literacy environments or even to print
material at home, with few role models which could inspire children in this context and with
limited opportunities to develop their vocabulary in the school language. As a result they lack
some basic cognitive and language competencies due to their limited experiences at home in
the early years, which influence their learning levels in school.

                                                              even one year of preschool

                                                              primary grades. (IECEI,

children in eight states provided evidence of impact of preschool participation on retention
rates in primary schools which improved by about 15-20 percent as compared to students who
had not participated.

An analysis of short and long-term returns to investment in pre-primary education, if integrated
into the government system in India, indicates significant potential benefits (The World Bank,
2015). The analysis examines Models 1, 2 and 3 for pre-primary education using a combination
of revitalizing programs, mobilizing existing resources and integrating current working
systems. Cost benefit analysis is undertaken in order to evaluate the cost to the system for pre-
primary education inputs against potential short-term and long-term savings for government
and society. The analysis of Model 1, 2 and 3 ( table presented below) represent a continuum
from most comprehensive intervention to a convergence model to a focused but succinct
package program to improve all early learners' school readiness.

Towards Composite Schools: Convergence between SSA and Rashtriya Madhyamik
Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) for increased efficiency: The Rajasthan experience:

The Government of Rajasthan (GOR) has taken a strategic decision to consolidate some of its
elementary schools and secondary/senior secondary schools into composite schools. The
consolidation is being worked out within the guidelines set under the RTE Act. This case has
been examined to study the merits of this move by comparing the effectiveness, efficiency and
impact of Elementary schools vis-à-vis composite schools.

Based on the realization that that a lot of elementary schools were actually created by separating
primary and/or upper primary classes from existing composite schools, the GOR initiated its
move on consolidation. While creating a public school network that was difficult to sustain and
was inefficient in operations. A number of schools were operating with poor enrolment, poor
monitoring and inadequate supervision mechanisms.



                                               20
Rapid expansion of the public schools network has led to a sizeable financial outlay towards
infrastructure expansion with major outlay towards development of school buildings,
classrooms, toilets and drinking water facilities. Resources for outcomes related indicators,
monitoring and quality improvement were getting constrained.

The GOR decided to place elementary grades in the same ecosystem that houses secondary and
senior secondary classes in order to –

    •   Place them under the regular care and supervision of the secondary/senior secondary
        school Principal for concurrent monitoring and reduced unaccounted teacher
        absenteeism.

    •   Provide elementary school teachers with access to subject teachers and focussed
        academic guidance (more qualified, trained and experienced) working with secondary
        and senior secondary teachers improve the Grade to Teacher Ratio (GTR) 15 thereby
        increasing the number of effective learning days.

    •   Provide students from elementary schools with access to facilities such as better
        equipped libraries, playgrounds, functional computers etc.

    •   Facilitate greater retention through improved quality of education and stronger parent-
        teacher association (a result of improved monitoring); and improved transition rates
        through unconstrained sharing of student data/information.

Effectiveness: Composite schools benefit from having a larger institutional setup in terms of
infrastructure, teacher availability and classroom availability. It is well documented that an
enabling teaching learning environment leads to better learning outcomes for children, and in
this sense certain parameters considered in this analysis have been charted out for both
composite and elementary setups.

Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) data from 2013-14, shows that
composite schools perform better than elementary school on various supporting
infrastructure/facilities related parameters such as availability of electricity connections,
libraries, playgrounds and computers. Data given in Table 1 shows that while 84.4 percent of
composite schools have access to electricity, the corresponding figure for elementary schools
stands at 52.4 percent.

Similarly, while 84 percent of composite schools have a library, the corresponding figure for
elementary schools is 80.4 percent. Most composite schools have a larger library setup and
many have a dedicated librarian. On the other hand, most elementary schools do not have a
library room but rather a small collection of books that are stored in a cupboard.

In order to improve the quality of education being imparted in public schools, the Government
has been making efforts to leverage information and communication technology enabled
teaching-learning transactions. However, implementing the same requires the schools to have
access to computers.

      Table 4: Schools with computer availability for teaching learning purposes

  Elementary           0.5

While composite schools house an average of three computers, the corresponding figure for
elementary schools is 0.5 with many elementary schools having no computers. This could also
be because a large percentage of elementary schools do not have electricity connections.

More importantly, composite schools seem to have more effective classroom transaction
processes. The percentage of teachers with a graduate degree is higher at composite schools.
The GTR estimates show that at a given point in time a teacher in an elementary school teaches
an average of almost two classes/grades. The corresponding figure for composite schools is
closer to a teacher a class/grade.

elementary schools is 99.

The benefits of concurrent monitoring through the Secondary/Senior Secondary school
Principals lead to composite schools reporting a lesser need for BRC (Block Resource

Increased efficiency: Having larger institutional setup in terms of infrastructure availability and
human resources, composite schools have the ability to cater to a larger number of students.
Working closer towards full capacity enables these schools to put their resources to more
efficient use. An analysis of SSA budget allocation on elementary education reveals that 50.1
percent of allocation is towards teacher salaries and trainings, 22.4 percent allocation is towards
infrastructure creation and maintenance and 27.5 percent allocation is towards other elements.

The Pupil-Teacher Ratio (PTR) in composite schools is higher than the PTR at elementary
schools. Similarly, the number of students per school at composite schools is higher than the
corresponding figure for elementary schools. Factors derived from these two data points when
used to adjust the allocation figures for teacher related and infrastructure related components,
provide for an estimate of the efficiency with which composite schools work.

Using the above given factors to adjust the budget allocation for infrastructure and teacher
related components reveals that composite schools provide for a 38 percent more efficient use
of funds invested in infrastructure and teacher related components. In terms of percentage
points, investing in composite schools leads to a 27.3 percentage point higher efficiency.

Another interpretation of the aforementioned statistic can be that all other outcomes being the
same, a composite school spends INR 0.73 per child where an elementary school spends INR
1.00. The only additional cost under the composite school model is the INR 20 per day the
Government provides to students in the form of transport assistance.

Conclusions and recommendations

This paper has attempted to measure the VFM achieved from publicly funded education, by
looking at both the school access and learning outcomes of children. While it was not possible
to monetize the benefits of schooling access, it is clear there will be positive returns from the
increase in schooling participation inherent in the observed modest reduction of OOSC.

Sadly, the economic returns from public education expenditure are negative in terms of falling
learning levels and their deleterious impact on labour market productivity. This problem is
compounded by the ‘double-whammy’ that learning levels fell during a period when
government expenditure on education nearly doubled, in per pupil terms. The increase in per
pupil government education expenditure over the 10-year period 2006-2015 is due partly to a
strong increase in total government education expenditure (1.4 lakh schools established) and
partly to a 24% reduction in government school enrolment and a 20% reduction in the average
enrolment per government school (Table 6).

VFM from the government school system is also low in comparison with that from the private
school system. The reasons are partly to do with lower learning levels in the government school
system but more majorly due to the huge cost dis-advantage of government schools which pay
bureaucratically set high minimum wages, compared to private schools which pay market-
clearing wages based on the supply of unemployed graduates who are willing to work for low
salaries. Private schools have flexibility in the mix of inputs they use and they also elicit greater
teacher effort and demand greater teacher accountability, as seen from the lower teacher
absence rates in private than in government schools (Muralidharan et. al., 2008).

Section 3 of the paper discusses the factors behind the low VFM. These include low learning
levels, high public expenditure on education, non-productive expenditures on education, the
inefficiency of maintaining small schools, inefficiency due to non-genuine enrolment numbers,
and the high teacher absence rates. The recommendations are based around these areas as well.

Recommendations:

Moving from block grants to per-student grants: One of the best ways to increase school and
teacher accountability and thus to raise VFM from government education expenditure would
be to shift from a "block grant" to a per-student grant to government and aided schools. Under
a per-student grant system, there will be strong monitoring of student enrolment numbers, and
schools would lose government grant money (and thus be forced to lose teachers) if their
student enrolment numbers fall. In most countries, government funding grant to schools is on
a per-student basis. Moreover, one can tease even greater VFM through adopting the practice
in many developed countries to have efficiency and equity incentives built into the grant
formula for schools. For example, in the UK, the per student grant for 2015-16 is fixed at £
2880 for primary, £3950 for class VIII and IX, and £4502 for class X students, but the school
gets, for each child of a designated group, additional per pupil grant for different categories of
disadvantage 16.

Rethinking school location policies: While India’s long-standing school location policies
(reiterated in the RTE Act 2009) have aimed to ensure a school either within a habitation, or
within easy walking distance, research suggests that this policy ends up segregating children
into different schools by caste, and raises the schooling attainment of the upper castes while
reducing that for the lower castes. In other words, school location policies, through their effect
on school size/quality, imply that the benefits of school access differ across castes within any
given region. Thus school location policies need to be rethought.

Amendment of the RTE Act: In the context of emptying of government schools, unviably small
government schools, and the negative effects of caste-segregated schools, there is an inherent
inefficiency as well as inequity built into the RTE Act’s prescription that governments must
establish neighbourhood primary schools within a 1 km radius, and upper primary schools
within a 3 km radius, of every population cluster. In a context where parents have been
abandoning government schools, average government school enrolments have been falling, and
thousands of government schools are being closed down due to being economically unviable,
creating yet more neighbourhood government schools would be very wasteful. This dissonance
requires thoughtful correction with an amendment of the RTE Act.

Moderation of teacher salary levels in the forthcoming Seventh Pay Commission: The fact that
learning levels of children attending private schools are not lower (and could be modestly
higher) than of children attending government schools, despite teacher salaries being upto
1/25th (or as little as 4%) of government teacher salaries, and given that PISA test learning
levels in China are significantly higher than in India even though teacher salary as a multiple
of per capita national income is only one-third as much in China as in India, indicates that
increases in teacher salary are not a learning-related expenditure. Thus, moderation of teacher
salary increases – especially in the forthcoming Seventh Pay Commission – will help to raise
VFM in the government schooling system. Teacher salary moderation can also help to
strengthen the School Development and Management Committees (SDMCs) since it will
reduce the current huge economic-distance between the well-paid teacher and the typically

16
  Additional per pupil grant for deprivation, between £882 and £1,870 per annum (full breakdown is given); for
looked-after children – £1,004; for low prior attainment – primary: £669; secondary: £940; • English as an
additional language – primary: £466; secondary: £1,130; a lump sum for every school – primary: £115,797;
secondary: £125,155; additional sparsity sum for small schools vital to serving rural communities – primary: up
to £44,635; secondary: up to £66,656.

lowly paid parent, since this economic gap hinders parents’ ability to hold teachers accountable,
as suggested in the literature (Kingdon and Rawal, 2010). Another idea is to link salary hikes
to teachers accepting increased accountability, e.g. accepting a mild form of performance
related pay, as was done in Mexico in return for a large increase in teacher pay, as negotiated
with teacher unions.

Protect the low fee private schools from closure: Since private schools are about 5 times as
cost-effective as government schools, and the vast bulk of private schools are the low fee
private schools that cannot afford the costs of compliance with all the RTE recognition norms,
it is important that government takes a facilitative rather than a punitive approach, protects
such schools from closure due to non-compliance with the infrastructure requirements of the
RTE Act or with the many other recognition conditions imposed by over-zealous state
governments. Governments can help private schools through subsidies to become RTE
compliant. Protecting them from closure will also protect children’s RTE in a context where
state governments are closing down small government schools, and it will maintain the overall
efficiency of the system compared with the counterfactual that the high-value-yielding private
schools are closed down, and lower-value-yielding government schools continue to operate
which, ironically, themselves do not fulfil the RTE infrastructure norms, since there is no
provision in the RTE Act for the closure of government schools that do not comply with RTE
norms.

Invest in quality-related expenditures: Government must invest more in quality related
expenditures which have been largely neglected hitherto, such as investments in school
leadership training; increasing the very low levels of teacher competence (as seen in the dismal
performance on Teacher Eligibility Tests, TETs), through relevant training; monitoring and
inspection expenditure, to reduce teacher absence rates and to ensure the accurate recording of
enrolment numbers; annual (non-high-stakes) measurement of child learning to enhance
teacher accountability; publication of transparent information for parents/the public about
learning levels in all schools, since such visible evidence on relative school quality of all the
schools within a district can set up healthy competition between schools); research and
innovation; teaching-learning materials; computers; student exchanges; etc.

Creating a professional development structure for teachers: The inefficiency inherent in
bureaucratically setting high minimum wages rather than paying market clearing wages to
teachers, can be addressed by establishing a professional development ladder for all teachers.
Pritchett and Murgai (2008) suggest that all teachers can start life on annually renewable
contracts and a modest salary for a specified period (3 or 5 years), after which their work is
assessed and, if found satisfactory, they are promoted to the position of a regular teacher with
a higher salary and a permanent post. They can be offered one or two more professional
development opportunities during their career, relating promotion and pay-rise to their
performance appraisal.

Strengthening elementary education through introduction of pre-school education:
In view of the significant and proven benefits of investment in preschool education especially
for 4 to 5 year olds (since 5 to 6 year olds are already in school in at least 23 states), and the
cumulative benefit of addressing the entire early learning continuum for children’s learning, it
is recommended that a preschool class may be added to existing primary schools across the
country and the curriculum for the pre-primary and first three years of primary be developed
in a bottom up manner to ensure continuity and developmental appropriateness. A two year
Diploma Course on Preschool Education has already been developed and notified by National

                                               26
Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) (2015) which could support teacher education for this
stage. This recommendation is in alignment with the RTE (2009) Section 12 which encourages
all state governments to endeavour to establish preschool classes for children from 3 to 6 years
so as to help them develop school readiness for primary grades. Possibilities may therefore be
considered of multiple models including relocating AWs to primary schools and ensuring
continuity of curriculum, to setting up a one year class in schools prior to grade 1.

Reducing transactions costs via consolidating the SSA and RMSA schemes: At present SSA
and RMSA operate as two separate programmes, with two different state implementation
agencies, leading to duplication of staff, buildings, vehicles, and efforts. Since many schools
are composite schools (containing primary, upper primary, and secondary sections), it makes
sense to consolidate the SSA and RMSA into a single centrally sponsored scheme. Savings can
be used more productively.

An honest, calm and evidence-driven rethink is needed about education policies. Bold and
imaginative reforms are required to deal with the parlous situation of very low VFM that has
long being achieved from government’s educational funding. One thing is certain: the payoffs
from wisely chosen and courageous reform that increases quality and learning levels in
government schools will be extremely high, both in terms of government popularity and, more
importantly, in terms of individual productivity and national economic growth.

Benefits of Investing in Pre-Primary Education

Government Focus on Primary Education

High-quality and well-timed preschool education has been shown, through sound scientific
evidence, to provide foundational learning during the vital early years influencing cognitive
functioning, socio-emotional development, self-regulation and overall health (Sylva et al.,
2010; Yoshikawa, 2013). Furthermore, research on investments in preschool suggests that early
childhood development directly influences economic, health and social outcomes for
individuals, society and the government (Heckman, 2011). The rationale for preschool
education currently is less an issue of "Why invest in early learning?" but rather a question of
"How to structure and implement an effective program?" alongside functioning primary school
systems.

In India, the Government is committed under the RTE Act, 2009, to provide free and
compulsory elementary education of satisfactory quality for all children between the ages of 6
to 14 years. SSA, a centrally sponsored scheme, is currently the main vehicle for realizing this
vision which has demonstrated some success, as evident from the net enrolment rate at the
primary level which has risen to 88% in 2013-14 and the annual drop-out rate which has
declined from 9.4% in 2007-8 to 4.7% in 2013-14 (DISE, 2013-14). While this increased
efficiency in the education system is certainly a reason to celebrate, the concern is the persisting
low levels of learning in the early grades with a significant number of children in grade 5 unable
to master the basics, leading to a cumulative learning deficit (NCERT, 2014; ASER 2013). In
response to this concern, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), the
department tasked with school education system, has launched a new scheme titled “Padho
Bharat Badho Bharat” with a focus on quality improvement in grades 1 and 2 for which
specific funding is provided under SSA.

This additional intervention in the early grades is well-justified as weak foundational skills
have been proven to lead to chronically low learning levels in higher grades (Karoly, L.M., et
al, 2005). While poor learning outcomes can be attributed to multiple variables in the school
system, there has traditionally been a focus on transforming the “teacher factor" – either teacher
absenteeism, poor quality of teaching or lack of skills among teachers which is understood to
be correctable through further training and monitoring. This paper argues for a shift in
perspective from the teacher to the student, the centerpiece of the learning process, advocating
for early exposure to preschool curriculum and instruction.

Shifting Focus to the Child and to School Readiness

Recent longitudinal research from three states in India, on approximately 12,000 children,
provides convincing evidence that a significant factor for low learning levels in early grades is
inadequate school readiness (ASER, 2013). Children are entering Grade 1 with inadequate
cognitive and language competencies, many of which are basic prerequisites for primary school
curriculum (IECEI, 2015). This data is critical in light of international research which suggests
that children beginning school with sufficient cognitive, behavioural and social-emotional
skills required are more likely to benefit from the learning experiences provided as well as
experience long-term success (Graue, 1992; Meisels, 1999).

The legislative and policy mandate in India is for all children to start school at the age of 6.
However, a significant number of students come from homes where oral culture dominates and

                                                31
there is minimal exposure to literacy-rich environments. These children often lack access to
print materials and parental role modelling of language which has the potential to build their
vocabulary. As a result, they lack basic cognitive and language competencies which adversely
influence their learning levels in school. Furthermore, the current provisions for pre-primary
learning occur at the level of the AWCs which have, in practice, focused on delivering health
and nutritional with minimal attention given to pre-primary education. Additional resources,
such as structured educational curriculum and pedagogical training for Anganwadi workers
(AWW), are required in order for AWCs to effectively facilitate early childhood education
delivery. Therefore, a critical need exists currently for children's school readiness to be
developed through proper preschool curriculum and instruction during the early years.

The Importance of the Early Years

It is imperative to understand why the early years are a critical time for investing in preschool
education in order to maximize school level outcomes. Recent multidisciplinary research from
the fields of neuroscience, behavioural sciences, economics, education and child development
suggests that 90% of brain growth occurs before a child is 6 years old and the quality of a
child's environment, during these early years, strongly influences this brain development (Reiss
et al., 1996). Research also indicates that the critical periods for development of language,
cognitive and socio-emotional competencies in the form of neural connections occur in the first
seven years of life (Doharty, 1997). Therefore it becomes important, during this period, that a
child is given exposure to a supportive environment and vibrant educational experiences for
the development of competencies, which despite neuroplasticity, become difficult and resource
intensive to address at the school level or in later years.

Furthermore, children from disadvantaged backgrounds who experience poverty during their
preschool years have lower rates of school completion than children and adolescents who
experience poverty only in later years (Brooks-Gunn, J & Duncan, G.J., 1997). For children
lacking a supportive home environment due to socio-economic disadvantages or lack of
knowledge among caregivers, the effects are visible in school in the form of low learning levels,
poor self-regulated behaviour, attention and working memory deficits as well as issues of social
maladjustment.

Pre-Primary Education and Learning Outcomes

Global evidence as well as India-specific research confirms that even one year of high-quality
pre-school education, when children are between ages 4 and 5, leads to a significant increase
in school readiness levels at the time of entry to grade 1, which in turn contributes to enhanced
levels of learning in primary grades (IECEI, 2015). A study by NCERT of
approximately38,000 children in eight states has provided compelling evidence on the impact
of preschool participation on retention rates in primary schools, which improved by 20.5% for
preschool participants in comparison to children who had not received preschool education
(Kaul et al, 1994).

Evidence also indicates that while participation in preschool has many benefits, these are
considerably enhanced if the program is high-quality and leads to sustained impact on learning
levels. A recent meta-analysis including evaluations of 84 preschool programs concluded that
on average, children gain about a third of a year of additional learning across language, reading
and math skills from high-quality preschool education. At-scale preschools in Tulsa and Boston
have produced even larger gains of between a half and a full year of additional learning in

                                               32
reading and math. Furthermore, gains are significantly higher for children from disadvantaged
backgrounds or with special needs (Yoshikawa et al, 2015). A review of specific evaluations
of programs designed to enhance cognitive ability in mathematics between ages 4 to 5 years
(Case, Griffin and Kelly, 1999; Kaul et al 1991) has concluded that strong preschool programs
are required to provide a sound foundation in the critical early years necessary to improve the
mathematics performance of students at the school level. (McCain, M.N. and J.F. Mustard,
2002).

Research further demonstrates that the sustainability of the benefit in terms of improved
learning levels is greater if there is continuity in curriculum and pedagogy from the first two
years of pre-primary to the first three primary grades, thus making these early years the
“foundation fives” (Crouch, in Press) which need to be given special attention and duly
strengthened and promoted. These five years are also referred to as the ‘early learning unit’ in
India’s XIIth FYP and emphasized as the early learning continuum which, if appropriately
scaffolder, can ensure a sound foundation for children, leading to better learning levels in
schools. The XIIth FYP recommended introducing a minimum of a year of preschool education
for 4 to 5 year olds in primary schools.

Additional Benefits of Pre-Primary Education

Research indicates that the benefits of quality pre-primary education clearly outweigh the costs
and include gains beyond improved learning outcomes and higher incomes. (Yoshikawa,
2015). These benefits may accrue from reduced spending on remedial education at school
level, less drop-outs, better social and academic competence and, in the long-term, from lower
incidence of deviant behaviour and juvenile delinquency and savings from counselling and the
criminal justice systems. Additionally, while long-term benefits can be expected from a better
skilled population, increased economic productivity, higher individual earnings; supplemental
benefits include improved health outcomes and lower crime rate, which would overall benefit
                                          the society and the government socially and economically.
  Gains from Preschool Education          Cost benefit analysis of investing in pre-primary education
                                          suggests significant benefits for government and society.

                                          programs such as the High/Scope Perry Preschool and the

                                          in cost) (Masse and Barnett, 2002). Estimates from the
  -7–12% increase in future income        Abecedarian Project, another influential preschool

                                          Brazil demonstrated the benefit to cost ratio for investing
                                          in preschool education to be 2:1. Furthermore, returns to
investment analysis indicated that program participants could expect a 7 to 12% increase in
future income (Young, 2002). According to Lancet (2011), a 50% increase in preschool
enrolment in low and middle income countries would generate an estimated $34 billion at 6. 4
- 17.6:1 rate of return. A review of research indicates that while there may be variation in exact
ratios of benefits to cost, the “best current evidence suggests that the impact of quality
preschool per dollar spent on cognitive and achievement outcomes is larger than the average
impact of well-known educational interventions per dollar spent, such as class-size reductions
in elementary schools” (Yoshikawa et al, 2015).

Cost-Benefit Analysis of Investing in Pre-Primary Education

An analysis of short and long-term returns to investment in pre-primary education, if integrated
into the government system in India, indicates significant potential benefits (The World Bank,
2015). The analysis examines Models 1, 2 and 3 for pre-primary education using a combination
of revitalizing programs, mobilizing existing resources and integrating current working
systems. Cost benefit analysis is undertaken in order to evaluate the cost to the system for pre-
primary education inputs against potential short-term and long-term savings for government
and society. International and India-specific evidence is synthesised in order to gather evidence
for how economic gains accrue from investing in pre-primary education during the early
childhood years. As data repeatedly advocates that preschool programs must focus on quality
and duration, Model 1, 2 and 3 represent a continuum from most comprehensive intervention
to a convergence model to a focused but succinct package program to improve all early learners'
school readiness.

Model 1: Two Years Pre-Primary Education

Description, Costs and Advantages
Model 1 for pre-primary education entails adding 2 years of pre-primary education in the
current government school system in India, including newly trained educators, pre-primary
curriculum and teaching methodology, to ensure high-quality, pre-primary learning for the
early childhood years. Students entering government schools are introduced to pre-literacy and
pre-math learning intended to develop cognitive, linguistic and socio-emotional school
readiness skills prior to entering primary instruction. Advantages for Model 1 include a
comprehensive and high-quality program; newly developed intervention built from the ground-
up; a program situated in the Government school system in order to ensure continuous
preschool to primary transition.

Global Evidence
Seminal studies such as High/Scope Perry Preschool, the Abecedarian and Chicago CPC
Studies illustrate that preschool interventions yield the greatest gains when there is a focus on

                                               34
high-quality, sustained curriculum and instruction that is delivered by trained educators in a
well-resourced and structured environment (Schweinhart, L.J. et al, 2005; Masse, L.N.,
Barnett, W.S., 2002; Reynolds, A.J., 2001). Evidence from these longitudinal studies indicates
significant benefits for those who attended preschool in comparison to those who did not.
Program participants had better education attainment (30% higher graduation rate; 40% lower
repetition rate), and higher income over a lifetime (14% higher income per person or an average
of $156, 490; 7 to 12% increase in future income for each year of preschool). Furthermore,
individual benefits such as higher income contributed to government savings from increased
tax revenues over a lifetime (28% increased tax revenues associated with higher expected
earnings), reduced government subsidies and spending on remedial or corrective education.
ROI ratios from cost-benefit analysis range from $7 to $16 per dollar invested illustrating the
high return from investing in pre-primary education. Finally, preschool education can be
expected to contribute to GDP increase in 2080 of 3.5% to 4% from a preschool program started
in 2005 (Dickens et al, 2006).

India-specific Data
Research in India also points towards higher returns from pre-primary education for
disadvantaged populations. Preschool exposure improved learning outcomes with students'
average test scores improving positively and significantly as pre-primary education quality
improved (Kaul et al, 2014). Students were also likely to have better educational attainment
with 20% higher retention for preschool students and 17% less likely to drop out by Class IV
(Kaul et al, 1993). Finally, systematic challenges like child labour, social exclusion and
economic backwardness can be overcome through Government sponsored preschool programs
for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Cost-benefit analysis for Model 1 suggests that adding these 2 years of pre-primary can
generate a Cost-Benefit Ratio of 25, or Rs.25 saved for every Rs. 1 invested.

Benefits from Cost-Benefit Analysis
Adding 2 years of pre-primary stage to government elementary schools would lead to benefits
for the individual, society as well as the Government and these benefits may potentially be
magnified as they are sure to include disadvantaged student populations. Model 1 shows a
requirement of an initial investment of Rs. 13,600 Crores and an annual spend of Rs. 12,650
Crores. This estimate is based on the understanding, as per DISE data, that there is a significant
number of small schools across states with declining enrolments which could accommodate
the additional pre-primary grades with minimal expense. The corresponding cost-benefit
analysis for Model 1 suggests that adding these 2 years of pre-primary can generate a Cost-
Benefit Ratio of 25, or Rs. 25 saved for every Rs. 1 invested.




                                               35
Benefits of Pre-Primary Education




Further benefits include a skilled workforce and increased labour productivity with 30% to
60% additional income over an individual's lifetime. Additionally, spill over benefits to society
can be seen in the form of 22 percent reduction in crime (basis international research) and
improved health outcomes finally, benefits of pre-primary education are expected to surpass
costs required to set up the system, with savings of Rs 171,000 Crores expected within the first
10 years. Pre-primary investments also contribute to a significant increase in GDP. As more
pre-primary educated cohorts enter the workforce with higher incomes, 4.3% additional GDP
can be expected by 2050 and 7% additional GDP can be expected by 2074. Figure 1 provides
a summary of the analysis for reference.

Ease of Implementation
Benefits for Model 1 highlight the great potential value of a comprehensive 2 year pre-primary
education model. Accordingly, Model 1 entails significant requirement of resources,
development and integration into the current Government school system in order for the
program to function effectively and successfully. Challenges entail the entire movement of
preschool delivery from one government department to another and the corresponding
logistical shift in responsibilities and obligations that would require. Furthermore, considerable
investment is required in terms of infrastructure, advisory, materials and training. However,
transferring preschool education to the school system ensures an optimal leveraging of school
related resources and transferrable expertise in curriculum and pedagogy as well as allows for
the most efficient and logical transition of the preschool learner into the primary grades.

Model 2: Convergence Model

Description, Costs and Advantages
Model 2 focuses on strengthening pre-primary education within existing government AWCs
with convergence and coordination between the Ministry of Women and Child Development
(MWCD), under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) program, and the MHRD.
This model requires construction of new AWCs so that they may function as classrooms,
adding a dedicated and trained pre-primary teacher in order to provide instruction at each AWC
beyond the AWWs. Costs also include teacher training for pre-primary teachers and
supervisors, teaching learning materials (TLM) and additional central costs. Advantages for
Model 2 include integrating resources, improving infrastructure, bringing in new resources and
improving efficiency of existing government programs.

Evidence
Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) for children below 6 years is currently under the
charter of MWCD as the ICDS program, which is mandated to offer preschool education for 3
to 6 year-olds as one of its six services (supplementary nutrition; provision of non-formal pre-
school education; nutrition and health education; immunizations; health check-ups; referral
services). ICDS has a reach of 13.4 AWCs with an enrolment of 3.7 Crore children and is the
sole provider of Government ECCE. However, research shows that less than half of AWCs
have teaching learning materials and several states report nil yearly expenditures of pre-school
kits allocated under the ICDS budget suggesting a lack of delivery of pre-school education.
A recent study which explored the pathways followed by children from 3 to 6 years revealed
that with the rising aspirations of parents for enrolling children early in organized education,
and rapid expansion of private provisions, the overall trend in parental choice is of 4 year-olds
being moved out of AWCs into either private preschools, if the parents can afford it, or to
government primary schools as underage children (IECEI, 2015). About 20% children in
government schools in Class 1 were found underage and were attending school without formal
enrolment. Despite 1.3 million AWCs in place currently, the IECEI study found low school
readiness levels among 5 year-olds at the time of entry to Grade 1. The AWCs, due to multiple
responsibilities as well as infrastructure and human resource constraints, are not able to provide
a systematically organized preschool education program which is required for children over 4
years. In addition, in at least 23 states of India the age for entry to Grade 1 is 5+ years, so that
5 to 6 year-olds are already not in AWCs but formally enrolled in the schools.

Benefits from Cost-Benefit Analysis
Model 2 calls for a revitalization of the current ICDS program utilizing resources available at
both MWCD as well as MHRD with shared cooperation and costs between both government
departments. The Convergence Model also utilizes continuing assumptions from Model 1 from
high-quality pre-primary programs, such as High/Scope Perry Preschool and Chicago CPC, but
it also integrates evidence from the U.S. Headstart program which, similar to ICDS, is a large-
scale long-running government program offering a combination of pre-primary education,
nutrition and health interventions. Data from the Headstart Impact Study (2010) indicates that
Headstart provides 80% of the effects of well-known early childhood programs such as Perry
Preschool and Abecedarian and Model 2 accordingly assumes 80% of benefits indicated in
Model 1. Additionally, students who had attended Headstart were 17% more likely to complete
high school than non-participants as opposed to 31% increase in high school completion in
Perry Pre-school program and Model 2 adjusts for these differences as well. Additional spill
over benefits also indicate that students who had attended Headstart were less likely to be
arrested at age 22 (5% vs. 15%) suggesting savings in crime related spending. Overall the

                                                37
Headstart program has significant benefits albeit lesser than standalone high-quality pre-school
programs.

The analysis for Model 2 indicates short-term savings from reduced government spending on
remedial education (Rs. 12,333 Crores) as well as household tuition spending (Rs. 5,800
Crores). Furthermore, it predicts long-term savings from reduction in government subsidies
(Rs. 1719 Crores in 2032; Rs. 23, 355 Crores in 2074); household savings from higher income
(Rs. 12, 300 Crores in 2032, Rs. 37.2 Lakh Crores in 2074); and subsequently government
savings from increased tax revenues (Rs. 145 Crores in 2032, Rs. 3.5 Lakh Crores in 2074).
Overall, Model 2 yields a cost-benefit ratio of 10, or a savings of Rs. 10 for every Rs. 1 invested
in pre-primary education.

Ease of Implementation
Model 2 or the Convergence Model leverages the capacity of multiple governmental
departments thus improving delivery of existing programs which in return saves on costs as
well as improves efficiency. Effective inter-sectoral coordination requires regulatory,
operational and financial convergence between multiple ministries and can be challenging.
However, despite the obstacles, the Convergence Model may have potential as MWCD
released a curriculum framework in 2012 for ECE outlining pedagogical approaches and
curriculum content along with the role of teachers and parents in early learning. In 2013, the
newly adopted National ECCE policy set a vision for ECCE and stipulated an institutional
arrangement focusing on convergence with the MHRD.

Model 3: School Readiness Package

Description, Costs and Advantages
School readiness research suggests that children lacking in basic cognitive and language
competencies perform adversely in early grades. Model 3, or the "School Readiness Package",
attempts to mitigate these gaps by introducing pre-primary education, consisting of pre-literacy
and pre-math learning, in first 30 to 90 days of Class 1. The package comprises an intense
program of instructing and reinforcing basic skills in order to gain a threshold level of
competency for young learners over a short, focused period of time. Model 3 requires minimal
one-time costs of content development, printing of activity books, TLM, teacher training and
additional central costs. Advantages for Model 3 include a focused, short-duration program
that seeks to deliver an intervention of basic early skills to prepare all students to learn.

Evidence
Research suggests low learning levels in early grades may be due to a lack of school readiness.
School readiness is a measure of how prepared a child is to do well in school from a cognitive,
social and emotional perspective. A recent study conducted across three states in India –
Assam, Telangana and Rajasthan – with 2500 six-year-olds suggests cognitive and language
competencies are lacking for in-coming students resulting in adverse conditions for learning in
primary grades (IECEI, 2015). Some of this may be attributed to first generation learners
entering school as a result of RTE 2009.

Model 3 offers young learners the opportunity to bridge the growing gap between pre-literacy
and pre-math skills and primary learning. The model is an equitable intervention as it is offered
to all students and reinforces skills, thus building on success, as well as teaches new basic
skills. The School Readiness Package also utilizes underlying assumptions from Model 1 and
particularly examines global and India-specific evidence in order to synthesize understandings

                                                38
of how short-term education interventions may lead to significant but small education gains for
students.

Model 3 examines the Pratham Balsakhi Intervention, a Learning Enhancement Program (LEP)
or remedial intervention, which resulted in an increase of 0.4 points out of 12.5 total points or
3.2% increase in reading and an increase of 0.3 points out of 6 total points or 5% increase in
writing1 (approximately 4% average academic gain). In comparison to Model 1 where high-
quality pre-school programs, such as the Perry Pre-school program, showed academic gains of
34% for participants, this indicates a small but significant gain. Hence, estimation of benefits
in Model 3 is expected to be scaled down by a ratio of (4% by 34%) or 11.7% of Model 1
benefits.

Benefits from Cost-Benefit Analysis
Analysis of benefits in Model 3 reveal short-term savings from reduced household spending
on tuition spending (Rs. 920 Crores). More significantly, it predicts long-term savings from
reduction in government subsidies (Rs. 594 Crores in 2032; Rs. 2,816 Crores in 2074);
household savings from higher income (Rs. 5,176 Crores in 2032, Rs. 8.3 Lakh Crores in
2074); and subsequently government savings from increased tax revenues (Rs. 101 Crores in
2032, Rs. 77,451 Crores in 2074). Overall, Model 3 yields a cost-benefit ratio of 75, or a
savings of Rs. 75 for every Rs. 1 invested in pre-primary education. However, due to the
minimal costs incurred in this specific model, benefits are not relevant in absolute terms.

Finally, a comparison between models is presented below which synthesizes cost-benefit
analysis across all 3 models in order to offer a comparison of savings for investments in pre-
primary education. Models 1, 2, and 3 can be evaluated on the basis of three key metrics: the
amount of investment required, years needed to recover costs and the cost-benefit ratio. Model
1 requires an investment of Rs. 14,021 Crores but recovers costs the quickest while Model 2
requires the steepest investment of Rs. 64, 102 Crores as well as the greatest duration of time
to recover costs with a reasonable cost-benefit ratio of 10. Finally, Model 3 requires minimal
costs of Rs. 1259 Crores and recovers cost by Year 12. However, cost-benefit ratio for Model
3 or the School Readiness Package is 75 and not relevant in absolute terms due to the minimal
costs required in the model. The comparison of all 3 models suggests that 2 years of
government pre-primary education would recover costs the most efficiently (by year 7) as well
as present a meaningful cost-benefit ratio of 25.

Annexure 1 provides further details and assumptions for cost-benefit analysis of investing in
pre-primary education as per Model 1, 2 and 3.

Recommendation

Based on the review and the analysis of Model 1, 2 and 3, presented above, this paper strongly
recommends that the MHRD initiate the process to include pre-primary education as part of
the RTE (2009) and support states in introducing a pre-primary section in all their government
primary schools for 4 to 6 year olds. It is also recommended that the curriculum for the pre-
primary and first three years of primary be conceptualized and developed in a ‘bottom up’
manner ( and not top down as is often the case) to ensure continuity in learning as well as a
sound early learning foundation for children. Again, this recommendation is in alignment with
the RTE (2009) Section 11 which encourages all state governments to endeavour to establish
preschool classes for children from 3 to 6 years in order to help them develop school readiness
for primary grades. Possibilities may be considered of setting up multiple models as per
feasibility, including relocating AWCs to primary schools and ensuring continuity of
curriculum, or setting up a one to two years pre-primary section in schools prior to grade 1.

 In 2015, the NCTE announced a revised teacher education curriculum which supported pre-
primary education and encouraged states to set up a cadre of teachers especially trained for pre-
primary and early grades. This investment in pre-primary education which ensures significant
returns, and which is specially intended to benefit children from marginalized communities,
will contribute in a significant way towards narrowing the social equity gap and ensuring
learning for all, one of the Sustainable Development Goals (2015) which India and the
international community has made a strong commitment towards.

             Construction of classrooms          Additional classrooms required in only those primary schools with >30
                                                 PCR i.e. ~30%; 1 classroom per school; Rs. 5 lakh / classroom;
                                                 Phased construction and intake over 5 years

             Cost of toilets                     Additional toilets not required




             Mid day meals                       MDM: Rs. 1,250/student; Other: Rs. 100/student
             Other: stationery, etc.             (assuming that no uniforms / books etc. provided to students)

             Teaching learning materials         Rs. 1,000 per classroom

             Teacher salaries and training       Schools with >20 PTR will require additional teacher for pre-primary i.e.
             costs                               ~70% of schools
                                                 1 teacher per school; Rs. 10,000/month salary
                                                 30 days induction training @ Rs. 200 per day; 20 days in-service

            Benefits                                                    Key assumptions

            Immediate Savings:
             • ICDS Savings            1/6th of ICDS budget assumed to be spent towards ECE for 3-6 year olds (given
                                       6 key tasks under ICDS charter) => cost savings of Rs 831 / student;
                                       Nutrition expense only towards 4, 5 year olds assumed saved = Rs 297/ student

             • Remedial Savings        Savings in LEP line item under SSA budget - starting at 10% in 2017 to 70%
                                       savings by 2021 (once ECE kids are in class 1-5); 70% benchmark from Chicago
                                       CPC Study); excludes Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat allocation which will be
                                       required for ensuring high learning levels in foundation years

             • Tuition Savings         45% primary school children take afterschool tuition (ASER); average tuition
                                       spend – Rs. 1,200 p.a.; savings of 70% for ECE participants (Chicago CPC
                                       Study)

            Long term Savings:         1.    Class 12 completion rates increase over time, maxing at 60% (Brazil is
             • Increased Income              around there. Australia is ~80%)
                                       2.    % of school / college grads entering workforce assumed at 60% (20% of
                                             women and 100% of men)
                                       3.    Starting salaries computed basis trades associated with the 3 segments –
                                             class 10 pass outs, class 12 pass outs, and college graduates
                                       4.    These segments would have otherwise earned as much as class 8 pass outs,
                                             class 10 pass outs and class 12 pass outs respectively.

   Long term Savings:
    • Increased Tax Revenue         1.   Class 12 completion rates increase over time, maxing at 60%
                                         (Brazil is around there. Australia is ~80%)
                                    2.   % of school / college grads entering workforce assumed at 60%
                                         (20% of women and 100% of men)
                                    3.   Starting salaries computed basis trades associated with the 3
                                         segments – class 10 pass outs, class 12 pass outs, and college
                                         graduates

                                         growth in tax slabs


    • Subsidy Savings               1.   Subsidies linked to BPL – food, kerosene, and MNREGA –
                                         assumed to remain the same in absolute terms going forward
                                         (historically as well, real growth has been ~1.5%)
                                    2.   % BPL population reduced basis 30-year historical CAGR of
                                         ~2.2%; have taken a floor of 10% BPL families
                                    3.   BPL families will come out BPL status as ECE kids join the
                                         workforce (assuming 2 kids per family) – this will result in subsidy
                                         reduction
                                    4.   Subsidy savings capped at 25%

FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPOSITE SCHOOL
              MODEL (CLASSES 1-10) IN RAJASTHAN

Financial and Economic Assessment of the Composite Schools Model in Rajasthan

The GOR has taken a strategic decision to consolidate some of its elementary schools and
secondary/senior secondary schools into composite schools. The consolidation is being worked
out within the guidelines set under the RTE Act. This paper explores the merits of this move
by comparing the effectiveness, efficiency and impact of Elementary schools vis-à-vis
composite schools.

The Background

The Government’s decision to work towards developing more composite schools was based on
the realization that a lot of elementary schools were actually created by separating primary
and/or upper primary classes from existing composite schools. This decision was the
Government’s initial response to the RTE. Subsequently, the Government also opened up a
number of schools to cater to students who did not come in the prescribed radius of an existing
facility.
While tracking the achievements of this move, the Government realized that the State had
ended up creating a public school network that was difficult to sustain and was inefficient in
its operations. A number of schools were operating with dipping enrolments. Further, a number
of schools were not being monitored and supervised at the desired level. As a result there were
schools where teachers were found to be absent or taking unaccounted affecting the quality of
classroom instruction. Further, leakages were discovered in the mid-day meal scheme.

The responsibility for monitoring the operations of the elementary schools has been placed on
the BRCs and CRCs. The number of schools and the geographic spread to be covered only
allow for bi-annual monitoring visits. Therefore monitoring and supervision is not concurrent.

The rapid expansion of the public schools network has led to a scenario where the Government
has had to cope with a sizeable financial outlay towards infrastructure expansion. Most of the
existing outlay has been towards the development of school buildings, classrooms, toilets and
drinking water facilities. However, a large number of schools are yet to gain access to inputs
that are required to support quality education. This includes but is not limited to inputs such as
libraries, play grounds, electricity connections and computers.

The Government’s decision to move towards consolidation via composite schools was founded
on the realization that this model could address a lot of the aforementioned challenges; in turn
leading to the provision of better quality education.

Placing the elementary grades in the same ecosystem that houses secondary and senior
secondary classes would:
● Place them under the regular care and supervision of the secondary/senior secondary school
   Principal. This would ensure concurrent monitoring and reduce unaccounted teacher
   absenteeism and leakages from the system.
● Provide elementary school teachers with access to subject teachers (more qualified, trained
   and experienced) who are working with secondary and senior secondary teachers; thereby
   providing them with access to ongoing academic support.
                    17
● Improve the GTR thereby increasing the number of effective learning days.

●   Provide students from elementary schools with access to facilities such as better equipped
    libraries, playgrounds, functional computers etc.
●   Facilitate greater retention through improved quality of education & stronger parent-teacher
    association (a result of improved monitoring); and improved transition rates through
    unconstrained sharing of student data/information.

Having identified the aforementioned benefits, the Government has moved towards ensuring
that every Gram Panchayat has at least one composite school. Placing this composite school
near the seat of the Panchayat also ensures better monitoring and supervision from the
community’s end. In order to ensure that students’ whose schools have been consolidated do
not suffer due to the distance between their place of residence and the composite school, the
Government provided them with a daily travel allowance (linked with their attendance).

Finally, the Government acknowledged that a few of the elementary school catering to remote
villages and those with high student strength (multiple classes for each grade) should be left
untouched under the consolidation plan. However, in order to further improve upon the
effectiveness, efficiency and impact of these schools the Government has linked them to the
composite school under a hub and spoke model. Under this setup, the Principal and subject
teachers of each composite school are expected to help with the monitoring and academic
supervision/training of teachers at these elementary schools. This model is yet to be fully
operationalized and the Government is in the process of finalizing the modalities for the same.

Effectiveness

Composite schools benefit from having a larger institutional setup in terms of infrastructure,
teacher availability and classroom availability. It is well documented that an enabling teaching
learning environment leads to better learning outcomes for children, and in this sense certain
parameters considered in this analysis have been charted out for both composite and elementary
setups.

Taking into consideration UDISE data from 2013-14, it has been observed that composite
schools perform better than elementary school on infrastructure/facilities related parameters
such as availability of electricity connections, libraries, playgrounds and computers.

Data given in Table 1 shows that while 84.4 percent of composite schools have access to
electricity, the corresponding figure for elementary schools stands at 52.4 percent.

                         Table 11: Schools with electricity connection

    connection

Similarly, while 84 percent of composite schools have a library, the corresponding figure for
elementary schools is 80.4 percent. Herein, it is also important to understand that most
composite schools have a larger library setup and many have a dedicated librarian. On the other
hand, most elementary schools do not have a library room but rather a small collection of books
that are stored in a cupboard.

In order to improve the quality of education being imparted in public schools, the Government
has been making efforts to leverage information and communication technology enabled
teaching-learning transactions. However, implementing the same requires the schools to have
access to computers.

It is observed that while composite schools house an average of three computers, the
corresponding figure for elementary schools is only 0.5. As a result it can be concluded that
many of the elementary schools do not have computers. This can also be because a large
percentage of elementary schools do not have electricity connections.

More importantly, composite are observed to be more effective in terms of the quality of
classroom transactions. The percentage of teachers with a graduate degree is higher at
composite schools. Further, while the schools support a higher PTR, they still work within the
limits prescribed under the RTE. The PTR at composite schools is 32 students to a teacher and
the corresponding figure for elementary schools is 20.

The GTR at composite schools is much lower than the figure observed for elementary schools.
The GTR figure has been derived by multiplying the number of schools under ‘primary’, ‘upper
primary’ and ‘primary + upper primary’, ‘primary + upper primary + secondary’, ‘primary’ +
upper primary + secondary + senior secondary’ + ‘upper primary + secondary’ and ‘upper
primary + secondary + upper secondary’ categories with ‘5’, ‘3’, ‘8’, ‘10’, ‘12’, ‘5’ and ‘7’
respectively. The latter set of figures is simply the number of grades in each type of school.


                                              53
The resultant figures have been divided by the number of teachers working at each type of
school.

The GTR estimates show that at a given point in time a teacher in an elementary school is
teaching an average of almost two classes/grades. The corresponding figure for composite
schools is closer to a teacher a class/grade. As a result, it can be assumed that almost half the
children in an elementary school are only passive ‘listeners’ and not ‘learners’.

  Elementary                81.4 percent            96.7 percent            20  1.83

The difference in GTR when factored in to adjust the average instructional days reveals that
the ‘effective instructional days’ in composite school is 159 and the corresponding figure for
elementary schools is 99.

The benefits of concurrent monitoring through the Secondary/Senior Secondary school
Principal are clarified by the fact that composite schools report a lesser number of BRC and
CRC visits; and this is despite these schools being relatively closer to the BRC and CRC
offices.

Efficiency

Having larger institutional setup in terms of infrastructure availability and human resources,
composite schools have the ability to cater to a larger number of students. Working closer
towards full capacity enables these schools to put their resources to more efficient use. An
analysis of SSA budget allocation on elementary education reveals that 50.1 percent of

                                               54
allocation is towards teacher salaries and trainings, 22.4 percent allocation is towards
infrastructure creation & maintenance and 27.5 percent allocation is towards other elements.

As mentioned earlier, the PTR at composite schools is higher than the PTR at elementary
schools. Similarly, the number of students per school at composite schools is higher than the
corresponding figure for elementary schools. Factors derived from these two data points when
used to adjust the allocation figures for teacher related and infrastructure related components,
provide for an estimate of the efficiency with which composite schools work.

                           Table 18: Adjustment factors
                                            2013-14

  Adjustment factors (composite/elementary) 1.6         1.6

Using the above given factors to adjust the budget allocation for infrastructure and teacher
related components reveals that composite schools provide for a 38 percent more efficient use
of funds invested in infrastructure and teacher related components. In terms of percentage
points, investing in composite schools leads to a 27.3 percentage point higher efficiency.

  Composite 27.5 percent         13.9 percent 31.3 percent 72.7 percent percent

Another interpretation of the aforementioned statistic can be that all other outcomes being the
same, a composite school spends INR 0.73 per child where an elementary school spends INR
1.00. The only additional cost under the composite school model is the INR 20 per day the
Government provides to students in the form of transport assistance.

Impact

At this point it is also important to appreciate that composite schools are imparting better
quality education and in this sense are delivering a higher impact at a relatively lower cost per
student. This is primarily because of their higher effectiveness in terms of higher number of
effective learning days, better supporting infrastructure and stronger monitoring arrangements.
At the very outset, it is observed that over the past five years the overall enrolment in
Government elementary schools in Rajasthan has decreased by 9.3 percent. However, in the
last year itself the composite schools in Rajasthan have reported a 17.6 percent increase in
enrolment (where the number of composite schools has largely remained unchanged). The
Government also believes that the composite schools have ensured an improvement in retention
and transition rates. Secondary school teachers have access to the elementary school records.
They are able to track and follow up with parents of students who do not show up for enrolment
in class 9. However, the Government MIS does not provide dropout figures and transition rates
disaggregated by elementary and composite schools.

As per a paper by Dr Geeta Gandhi Kingdon, every additional instruction day leads to a 0.01
time standard deviation change in students learning outcome scores. The corresponding
estimate for having a teacher who holds a graduate degree is 0.09. Assuming a 0.05 standard
deviation change for facilitating provisions/infrastructure and adjusting by differences between
elementary schools indicators and composite school indicators reveals that the average learning
outcome score for students from composite schools can be up to 34 points more than the
average learning outcome score for their peers from elementary schools. The learning outcome
test used as a basis of the calculation is the NAS which assumed that scores are normally
distributed with a standard deviation of 50 points.

Therefore the impact of better access to electricity in composite schools translates into a 0.81
point improvement in learning outcome scores. The estimate has been derived by multiplying
the difference in composite school and elementary school performance (32.2 Percent) with the
learning outcome change factor (0.05) and the standard deviation for NAS scores (50).

*Learning outcome impact factors and standard deviation have been taken from the paper
“Teacher characteristics and student performance in India: A pupil fixed effects
approach”

Further, as per another paper by Dr Kingdon, a standard deviation change in learning outcome
scores leads to 18 percent increase in the income that a student can expect to earn after
completing upper primary schooling. Given that composite school students are expected to
score 34.34 points better than peers studying in elementary schools and that NAS scores work
with a standard deviation of 50 points, the expected improvement in income for a student
completing upper primary education from a composite school is 12.4 percent. In an absolute
sense this work out to be INR 4,397 per year.

Sustainability

Basis the analysis presented through this paper it can be concluded that composite schools can
better sustain the directives of the RTE, SSA and RMSA. They make for more efficient use of
funds, are more effective n instruction and thus produce better academic results.

Given the increase in enrolment, transitions rates and learning outcomes; composite schools
are facilitating movement of students from elementary to secondary education. They are doing
this while imparting better quality education and this makes for a more sustainable case in
terms of benefits to students and society at large.

Note: The annual Government schools’ PPE has been calculated using State Government
revenue expenditure on education figures and UDISE Government school enrolment data. To
estimate the PPE on government elementary schools, we have taken the State government’s
revenue expenditure on elementary education and subtracted from it line items related to
government support ‘aided’ schools, and also subtracted Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and
Mid-Day Meal (MDM) expenditure. Since most of the secondary schools also provide upper
primary education, and thus have 7 classes – all the way from grade 6 to grade 12 – therefore
we attribute (3/7)th of the Government expenditure on government secondary schools (i.e.
excluding support to aided schools) to being expenditure on government-run elementary
education. The resulting estimate for State Government’s expenditure has been divided by
official enrolment figures for elementary education at Government schools in each state. Given
that enrolment figures are only available up till 2013-14, the figures for 2014-15 and 2015-16
have been estimated on the basis of the aggregate growth rate for the preceding years, as set
out in the Appendix Tables 1D to 1J. The last column in the table adds in per pupil SSA
expenditure (excluding SSA expenditure on civil works). Thus MDM expenditure is not
included either in the first or the last column. The PPE estimates also do not include
government expenditure on teachers’ pensions.

The PPE in elementary education in Government schools in Bihar is very low in comparison
with that in other states. This is explained by two things. Firstly, the fact that average pupil
teacher ratio was 54 in Bihar, 26 in India (DISE Flash Statistics, 2013-14, latest available in
Nov. 2015). Secondly, in Bihar a very high proportion (64%) of teachers were fixed-pay
(contract) teachers getting a salary of Rs. 8000 pm, so its salary expenditure is a fraction that
of other states 19, for example, in 2014-15, average salary of govt. primary school teachers in 9
states was Rs.39,683 per month (Ramachandran, 2015).

   As seen in Table 6, in 2014-15, average school size is 285 students per Government elementary school in Bihar,
and only 108 in India. Bihar had an average of 249 students per Government elementary school in 2005-06, and
this increased by 36 by 2014-15; The India average in the bottom row, is 131.7 students per Government
elementary school in 2005-06, and this fell by 23.7 by 2014-15; thus there are 108 students per Government school
in India by 2014-15. Moreover, Table 7 shows that there are far fewer ‘small’ schools in Bihar (169) than in other
states (average 4848 schools), i.e. with fewer than 20 enrolled students as a whole. While 2014-15 raw DISE data
is downloadable, the 2014-15 Flash Statistics are not yet available on the U-DISE website as in Nov 2015. Page
13 of DISE 2013-14 Flash Statistics shows 364,715 teachers in Government. schools. Out of these around
2,32,000 are ‘fixed-pay’ teachers (since their jobs are not annually renewable in Bihar, para teachers there are not
called ‘contractual’ teachers) whose pay was Rs. 8000 per month in Bihar in 2012-13 (from which the later figures
are extrapolated).

Note: The 2014-15 data on Andhra Pradesh’s number of schools seems problematic as the number of schools is dramatically smaller in 2014-15 compared to
2013-14. Thus, we have used only the figures upto 2013-14 for Andhra. The ‘India’ totals and averages in the last two rows refer to the 20 major states listed in

Note: * (e = c x Rs. 43,082 x 12); that is, total teacher salary expense in these small schools in
2014-15 is equal to the Number of teachers in these schools multiplied by the Average teacher
salary per month in elementary education in India, and this monthly figure is then multiplied by
12 to obtain the annual total salary expense.

Average salary of primary and secondary government school teachers in 9 Indian states in July
2014, is presented in Table 6.3 in a NUEPA study by Professor Vimala Ramachandran (2015).
This is reproduced here as Appendix 2. Ramachandran reports salaries of new appointees (0 years’
experience) and salary after 15 and after 25 years’ experience. We have taken the salary rate after
15 years’ experience as the average salary of teachers. While teachers of classes 1 to 5 get primary
teachers’ salary rate, teachers of classes 6-8 get paid the same salary rate as secondary school
teachers. Thus we have taken the simple average of primary and secondary teachers’ salaries after
15 years’ experience across the 9 states, as the measure of mean salary of teachers of elementary
classes (1 to 8). This was Rs. 43,082 per month in the school session 2014-15.

# Actual take home salary includes basic pay, grade pay, dearness allowances, HRA, city
compensatory allowances, any other benefits and deductions (if any). Also, actual take home
salaries for teachers might differ from district to district. The above is only a generalized
indicator for each state.

^ Salaries are given for Mohali district because the salaries of teachers vary across districts.
