Rural Income and Poverty 	49
  Box 4.1  Income Aggregate

  The income aggregate is constructed using the Rural Income Generating Activities approach. Household
  income has three components: agricultural income, nonagricultural income, and other income. Agricultural
  income consists of wages, crop income, and livestock income. Nonagricultural income comprises wages
  and income from nonfarm enterprises, and other income includes public transfers, remittances, and other
  income (rental, interest, dividends, and so on). Income is calculated using different modules of the ques-
  tionnaire. The employment module collects wage income. There are two modules on production activities,
  a module on agriculture and a module on nonfarm enterprises. Another module is dedicated to remit-
  tances and a last module collects other nonlabor income. The survey was implemented in four visits, and
  different modules were administered during different visits.
  Agricultural income. This income comprises agricultural wages and farm income. The EMC did not col-
  lect livestock data. Livestock is important in Burkina Faso, representing 10 percent of GDP. So not taking
  into account livestock underestimates both total income and agricultural income. Wages are taken from
  the employment module of the second visit. Agricultural wages are defined by the type of industry reported
  by the respondent. Only those industries related to agriculture are included. Wages comprise salary and
  different bonuses, in cash. Some workers have some benefits in-kind but those have been dropped—first
  because only a few people received them and second because there were too many outliers. Wages are
  computed for the primary and secondary employment at the individual level and then aggregated to the
  household level. The agriculture module was administered during the fourth visit, between November
  2014 and January 2015 when the harvest was almost completed. Farm income is computed by considering
  the whole production, crop by crop, valuing it using production prices and subtracting the costs of labor
  and input. In contrast to wages, farm income is directly computed at the household level.
  Nonagricultural income. This income is computed in the same way. Wages from nonagricultural work
  come from the employment module and are computed for the primary and secondary employment. The
  type of industry is used to classify nonagricultural wages. The module on nonfarm enterprises which was
  administered during the second visit is used to calculate income from enterprises. Information is collected
  on the revenues received and operating costs for the last month of operation. Using this information, the
  monthly value added is computed. This value added is annualized by multiplying the former by the num-
  ber of months the enterprise operated during the last 12 months. Then taxes, which are collected for the
  last 12 months, are subtracted to provide the net income.
  Other income. A module on remittances was administered during the second visit and is used for the
  calculation of this type of income. A module for all other income sources is also available. It is worth noting
  that remittances are underestimated. According to the 2014 EMC, the total amount of private transfers was
  CFAF 74.3 billion, with CFAF 48.5 billion being transferred from abroad. The total amount of remittances
  according to the 2014 balance of payment was CFAF 179 billion. It is true that the two concepts do not
  coincide exactly. For example, if someone who lives abroad has a bank account in his country and transfers
  money to this account, it is a remittance in the sense of the balance of payment, but not a transfer in the
  sense of household survey because there is no beneficiary. Still the difference is huge and it is not an exag-
  geration to think that the EMC has captured just one-third of the remittances.
