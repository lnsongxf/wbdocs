Preface
This report is the outcome of a combined financing and supervisory effort by the Zimbabwe
Multi-Donor Trust Fund (Zim-Fund) and the Multi-Donor Analytical Trust Fund (MDTF) under the
World Bank as well the operational contributions of the beneficiary local authorities. The Zim-
Fund financed the study that generated the Harare and Chitungwiza input data, while the MDTF
financed the additional investigations in Ruwa, Epworth and Norton and the development of the
integrated water and sanitation investment plan for Greater Harare.
The Consultant signed two separate contracts with the two financiers with different contractual
obligations regarding submission of reports. Under the Zim-Fund project, the Consultant is
obliged to issue individual reports for Harare, Chitungwiza, Kwekwe, Chegutu, Masvingo and
Mutare. Under the World Bank project (which includes Harare and Chitungwiza), the consultant
is required to issue a single report covering all the project towns.
Considering the inter-linkages and dependencies of the technical and institutional aspects of
water and sanitation service provision in the Harare area, the financiers resolved that it would
be in the best interest of the Clients to receive a single combined report for the Zim-Fund and
the World Bank projects instead of issuing two separate reports for Harare and Chitungwiza as
per the Zim-Fund contract. This arrangement will allow the Consultant to provide the necessary
information on the integrated Greater Harare water and sanitation systems in one consolidated
document.

ES1    INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

ES1.1 Zimbabwe Multi-donor Trust Fund (Zim-Fund)
       The economic and humanitarian crisis in 2008 that included widespread cholera outbreaks
       prompted the Zimbabwean Government and the donors to begin dialogue on the modalities
       of financing relief and remedial efforts. The African Development Bank was asked by a
       group of donors, with the consent of the Zimbabwean Government, to establish and
       administer a âbasketâ fund - the Zimbabwe Multi-Donor Trust Fund (the âZim-Fundâ). The
       main purpose for the Zim-Fund is to mobilise and administer donor resources needed for
       economic recovery and development efforts in Zimbabwe. Part of the resources mobilised
       by the Zim-Fund have been applied towards the Urgent Water Supply and Sanitation
       Rehabilitation Project (UWSSRP), the main scope of which is the urgent rehabilitation of
       water supply and sanitation systems in six urban centres, namely Harare, Chitungwiza,
       Mutare, Masvingo, Kwekwe and Chegutu.
       Under the UWSSRP, the Zim-Fund is also financing consultancy services for the
       development of Medium to Long Term Water Supply and Sewerage Investment Plans in
       the same towns and cities. The contract for these services was awarded to HP Gauff
       Ingenieure GmbH after an international competitive procurement process. The contract was
       signed on 22nd April 2013 and the project officially commenced on 20th May 2013.

ES1.2 Multi-Donor Analytical Trust Fund (MDTF)
       The City of Harare requested the World Bank to support the development of a water supply
       and sanitation strategic plan for Greater Harare - the metropolitan area that includes Harare
       and the satellite towns of Chitungwiza, Epworth, Ruwa and Norton. The purpose of the
       strategic plan is to assess the infrastructure requirements for the Greater Harare area as a
       single water and wastewater infrastructure system that can be managed as one entity. The
       long term vision is to have a well-structured and sustainable single utility able to raise its
       own capital on the financial markets.
       The World Bank engaged HP Gauff Ingenieure GmbH to develop the Greater Harare Water
       and Sanitation Investment Plan â a key input to the strategic plan - in parallel to the on-
       going study financed by the Zim-Fund.
       The Investment Plan outlines the medium (until 2020) to long term (until 2030) water supply
       and sanitation infrastructure requirements. It is intended to be a âblue-printâ that will guide
       future infrastructure and institutional development necessary for sustainable water and
       sanitation services for the Greater Harare area.

ES1.3 Synergies between the Zim-Fund and MDTF
       The Zim-Fund financed the study that generated the Harare and Chitungwiza input data,
       while the MDTF financed the additional investigations in Ruwa, Epworth and Norton and
       the development of the integrated water and sanitation investment plan for Greater Harare.
       The synergies between the two funds are illustrated in Figure ES â 1 below.

ES1.6 The Project Area
       The project covers Harare and the surrounding satellite towns of Chitungwiza, Epworth,
       Norton and Ruwa, collectively known as Greater Harare (Figure ES â 3). Greater Harare is
       situated on the Zimbabwean Highveld between latitudes 17Â° 40â S and 18Â° 06â S, and
       between longitudes 30Â° 37â E and 31Â° 16â E. It is an urban sprawl with a total current
       population of around 2.35 million according to the 2012 national census.
       The four centres of Harare, Chitungwiza, Epworth and Ruwa form a single contiguous
       urban area whilst Norton is located some 45 km to the west of Harare. Norton and Ruwa
       are both situated alongside primary access roads and railway lines, to the west and east
       respectively, and both were developed specifically to provide opportunity for industrial
       expansion outside of Harare. Chitungwiza has a limited industrial area and, together with
       Epworth, primarily serve as satellite residential areas for Harare.

ES2    DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE AND URBAN PLANNING

ES2.1 Overview
       Each of the five urban centres that constitute Greater Harare is managed by an
       independent urban local authority: the Harare City Council, the Chitungwiza Municipality,
       the Epworth Local Board, the Norton Town Council and the Ruwa Local Board. Each centre
       has its own unique history and pattern of development and, to date, there has been little in
       the way of coordinated planning between the individual towns. However, these centres
       function as part of single urban sprawl and economic system. In particular they are linked
       together on the basis of sharing a common water supply system and, also, all their
       wastewater treatment systems discharge upstream of the water supply dams on the
       Manyame River and consequently affect their common water supply.
       As the capital of Zimbabwe, Harare strongly dominates Greater Harare in terms of area,
       population and development of commerce and industry. Harare has a well-defined Central
       Business District (CBD) but this is lacking for the other centres of Chitungwiza, Epworth,
       Norton and Ruwa. In each case plans exist for development of a town centre but these
       have yet to be developed. As the capital city, Harare also supports the bulk of the
       institutional development, in particular hosting a large number of national organizations. For
       the other centres, institutional development is limited, the most numerous organizations
       being educational facilities, particularly schools, and churches.
       In order to estimate future water demand and wastewater flow projections it is necessary to
       project future populations, the spatial distribution of future populations and the breakdown
       of populations by different housing categories and associated service levels.

ES2.2 Population projections
       The results of the 2012 national census were used as the baseline for population
       projections. Future populations to 2030 were derived through consideration of historical
       rates of growth (derived from national census results from 1969, 1982, 1992, 2002 and
       2012) and through developing reasonable scenarios about future growth rates.
       Comparisons were made to regional data in the form of recent documented growth rates
       from 87 urban centres from seven comparable Southern and East African countries.
       Detailed discussions were also held with the individual urban authorities to identify specific
       factors likely to promote or constrain future growth within each of the five centres, and a
       number of workshops were carried out in order to present and discuss the scenarios and to
       develop and reach consensus among stakeholders on this key aspect.
       Over the last 20 years the rate of annual population growth in Greater Harare has declined
       markedly from a peak value of 6.05% for the 1982-1992 census interval, to 2.62% for 1992-
       2002 and to 1.84% for 2002-2012. This compares to a mean rate of annual growth of
       3.23% for the 87 regional centres, as recorded over their most recent census intervals.
       Likely causes of this muted growth for Greater Harare include high mortality rates due to
       the ongoing HIV pandemic and the massive economic decline from the late 1990s to the
       present, which has resulted in high levels of out-migration. Given the continuing economic
       problems these conditions seem unlikely to change markedly at least in the short term.
       Individual growth rates were established for each of the five constituent centres, in
       accordance with specific local factors (Tables ES â 1). Combining these results, the overall
       projection for Greater Harare is to continue with a relatively low rate of annual growth of 2%
       to 2020, but thereafter to escalate markedly to 3.59% to 2025 and 4.68% to 2030.

       The resulting population figures are shown in Table ES â 2. Harare strongly dominates the
       overall population of Greater Harare, in 2012 accounting for 72.5% of the overall population
       of 2,356,764 people. Corresponding figures for the other centres were 15.1% for
       Chitungwiza, 7.1% for Epworth, 2.9% for Norton and 2.4% for Ruwa.
       The overall population of Greater Harare is projected to grow from 2.35 million in 2012 to
       2.8 million in 2020 and to 4.1 million in 2030. Over this same period Harareâs population is
       estimated to increase from 1.7 million in 2012 to 2.0 million in 2020 and 3.0 million in 2030.
       By 2030 Chitungwiza is anticipated to increase to over half a million people, Epworth to
       reach nearly 250,000 people, and Norton and Ruwa to both expand to well over 100,000
       people each, to roughly the current size of Epworth.

ES2.3 Urban Planning
       Detailed discussions were held with town planning officials from each of the urban centres
       to determine the current distribution of population by housing categories, and to identify
       existing plans and potential for future growth in existing wards and neighbouring areas.
       Four levels of housing were considered: low density (LD) housing, medium density (MD),
       high density (HD) and informal settlements (without in-house water and sanitation
       services). The breakdown of the overall 2012 population for Greater Harare by service
       levels was 61% HD, 22% LD, 12% informal and 5% MD residents, although the proportions
       varied markedly between the different centres (Table ES â 3). During the course of the
       project the combined proportion of LD and MD is projected to gradually decline from the
       present value of 27 % to 23%; the level of HD is expected to remain relatively constant; and
       informal settlements are expected to increase from 12% to 17%.
       By comparison of expected growth by housing types against identified opportunities for
       growth, it was possible to estimate future annual ward populations by housing types. This
       data comprised a key input to subsequent calculations of future water demand and waste
       water flows.

ES3    WATER DEMAND AND WASTEWATER FLOW PROJECTIONS
       The level of investment required to provide water supply and sewerage services to an
       urban settlement is driven by the water demand and the resultant wastewater flows. Water
       demand comprises domestic, institutional, commercial and industrial water use
       (consumption), and the inevitable water losses resulting from physical leakages and

       inefficiencies in the commercial operations of the service provider (Non-Revenue Water or
       NRW). The water consumption varies over time, both seasonally and daily, so the water
       supply and sanitation infrastructure is sized and designed with capacity to provide services
       during the highest possible demand (peak period).

ES3.1 Key Planning and Design Criteria
       The high per capita water consumption figures prescribed in current water usage manuals
       in Zimbabwe are projected to gradually reduce due to improved public awareness on the
       need to conserve water, state driven policies that promote principles of financial
       sustainability in the provision of water and sanitation services, and implementation of a
       progressive block tariff system which penalises high water usage. Table ES â 4 below
       shows the consumption figures that were used. It is important to note that the figures are
       comparable with actual measured consumption figures from the region (Lusaka, Zambia).

       Water consumption for institutions such as schools, hotels, hospitals, prisons, service
       camps and administrative offices was calculated as a percentage of domestic consumption
       (15%).
       Industrial and commercial water demand was calculated on the basis of area. A unit
       consumption figure of 15 m3/ha/day was assumed for commercial properties while 22.5
       m3/ha/day was assumed for industries. The current industrial land area was calculated
       using a combination of information gathered during field investigations and recent satellite
       images.

ES3.2 Water Demand Projection Results and Key Issues
       The total peak season demand for Greater Harare is currently around 712,000 m3/d (Table
       ES â 6 and Figure ES â 4). It reduces to around 662,000 m3/d in the medium term and then
       grows to just over 820,000 m3/d in the long term. The reduction in the medium term is due
       to the assumed reduction in the physical losses over the next seven years and the gradual
       reduction in per capita water consumption over time. Table ES â 7 shows the breakdown of
       the aggregate water demand by the component towns.

       The Greater Harare area is currently utilizing water from the Upper Manyame catchment,
       except for Ruwa which uses sources in the Mazowe catchment. The 4% risk yield of the
       four dams (Seke, Harava, Chivero, Manyame) that provide storage for the water supply in
       Greater Harare is around 478,000 m3/d (allowing for upstream commitments only). Clearly,
       the current demand already exceeds the available water at 4% risk. The available water
       could increase if the risk factor was to be relaxed to 10% as is being advocated in some
       quarters. However, the evident climate change effects on the environment, particularly
       rainfall patterns, coupled with catchment degradation and the sensitive nature of the large
       urban concentration that Greater Harare is, counter the argument for relaxing the risk level.
       In terms of water production facilities (raw water abstraction and treatment), the installed
       capacity currently stands at a total of just over 704,000 m3/d, even though the actual
       production is around 540,000 m3/d. The plant rehabilitation efforts currently being
       implemented under various financing sources are expected to restore the water works to
       design capacity. Analyses indicate that the existing production facilities will be sufficient

       until around 2022. Hence short and medium term investments should be directed towards
       arresting the physical losses in the distribution network.
       Given the low yield and general environmental degradation of the Upper Manyame
       catchment, additional production facilities located in other catchments will be needed soon.
       The Kunzvi Dam and water treatment plant in the Mazowe catchment will have to be built
       as soon as possible.
       We propose that the Kunzvi scheme should be constructed first instead of the Muda Dam
       scheme because it can provide all the required capacity at one site. If Muda were to be
       developed first, Kunzvi would still have to be developed within a short period because
       Muda Dam WTW (with a capacity of 50,000 m3/day) would not provide enough water to
       satisfy the projected demand within the planning horizon. However, the Muda Dam and the
       Shabanove schemes should also be considered in the long term beyond the planning
       horizon of this study
       Kunzvi will be developed in two phases â Phase I with a capacity of 100,000 m3/day should
       be available by 2022. A second module with a capacity of 50,000 m3/day should be
       operational by 2029.

       The key issues regarding wastewater collection and treatment are as follows:
          â¢   Even though the existing aggregate design treatment capacity in Harare appears to
              be adequate, there is a deficit in some catchments, especially Crowborough which
              will be expanded;
          â¢   The rapid development of Harare South and the lack of treatment facilities in Ruwa
              and Epworth will necessitate construction of a southern trunk sewer and a new
              single treatment facility in Harare South â the Harare South Waste Water Treatment
              Works (Harare South WWTW);
          â¢   When both the modified conventional wastewater treatment plant and the BNR are
              rehabilitated, Chitungwiza will have sufficient wastewater treatment capacity.
              However, if the wastewater from the planned new Nyatsime development were to
              be treated at the existing Zengeza WWTW, pumping would be required. Hence it is
              proposed to connect Nyatsime and the St Maryâs area to the new Harare South
              WWTW in the long term;
          â¢   Parts of Epworth have a sewer reticulation network that was never commissioned
              because the treatment facility that was supposed to receive and treat the
              wastewater was never built. Once the Harare South trunk sewer and the associated
              treatment facility are built, those parts of Epworth will be reticulated and connected
              to the trunk sewer;
          â¢   The existing Adelaide ponds that Ruwa is currently using are insufficient. Moreover,
              they are located on land that belongs to the Epworth Local Board and has been
              allocated to a private developer. Hence Ruwa is in immediate need of an alternative
              wastewater treatment facility. For the short and medium term it is proposed that a

               new set of ponds and an irrigation system should be constructed just south of Ward
               7. In the long term Ruwa will be connected to the Harare South trunk sewer;
          â¢    For Norton the capacity of the existing wastewater treatment works and the new
               plant under construction, will barely meet the requirements for the medium term.
               Hence we propose construction of a new pond and irrigation system.

ES4    ASSESSMENT OF EXISTING WATER AND SEWERAGE INFRASTRUCTURE

ES4.1 Harare
       The Harare water supply scheme consists of two water treatment works (WTW) - Morton
       Jaffray WTW with a nominal design capacity of 614,000 m3/day and Prince Edward WTW
       with a nominal design capacity of 90,000 m3/day. Actual water production, however, is
       around 75% of nominal capacity. The water supply scheme also has 16 treated water
       pumping stations, 27 reservoir sites, 5,400 km of transmission and distribution pipelines
       and over 200,000 service connections. Water service coverage is around 82%, even
       though the supply hours are very low, or even absent, in many places.
       The City of Harare operates a number of wastewater treatment facilities with total installed
       capacity of around 220,000 m3/day. These include Firle WWTW, Crowborough WWTW,
       Donnybrook Stabilisation Ponds, Hatcliffe WWTW and Marlborough Stabilisation Ponds.
       The sewerage system has over 5,000 km of sewer collection and transmission pipes.
       Present sewerage service coverage is around 75%.

ES4.2 Chitungwiza

       The Municipality of Chitungwiza utilizes bulk water from the City of Harareâs water treatment
       facilities. The transmission system is designed in such a way that water can be drawn from
       both Prince Edward WTW and Morton Jaffray WTW. Overall, the city provides services to a
       population of 356,840 (2012 National Statistics). At present, the system has 55,669
       connections. Water service coverage is around 94% even though supply is very
       intermittent.

       The wastewater infrastructure in Chitungwiza consists of both on-site and off-site sanitation
       systems. Building and housing guidelines, by-laws and standards stipulate that Low Density
       properties depending on soil conditions, are not connected to the sewerage system. They
       are provided with on-site septic tanks and soak-away pits. High and Medium density
       properties, on the other hand, are all connected to the sewerage system. The sewerage
       system in Chitungwiza consists of laterals, collector mains, pump stations and trunk mains
       that collectively convey wastewater to the Zengeza WWTW.
       The key findings of the infrastructure assessment in Chitungwiza are presented in Table ES
       â 11 below.

ES4.3 Epworth
       Epworth relies on water from the City of Harare via the Ventersberg storage tanks. Supply
       is intermittent (very little is supplied infrequently). With the considerable water shortages
       that Epworth has been experiencing the Local Board has an ongoing programme to supply
       water through strategically located boreholes. Coverage is estimated to be around 38%.
       A small area of Epworth, within Wards 1, 2, 5 and 7 currently has a sewerage network.
       Ponds were constructed to collect and treat the sewage from the area but were quickly
       overbuilt and were never commissioned. Therefore the sewerage network was never
       commissioned either. Hence people use on-site sanction means such as pit latrines and
       septic tanks.

ES4.4 Norton
       Norton currently obtains all of its water from the Morton Jaffray WTW. A DN300 steel
       treated water supply line 3.8 km long feeds the townâs reservoirs on a hill to the east of the
       town. The water system currently supports around 12,500 service connections.
       Norton Town Council operates two sewage treatment plants at the same location known as
       the âOld Worksâ and the âNew Worksâ. The Old Works has a nominal capacity of 3,200
       m3/day, while the new works have a nominal capacity of 4,000 m3/day. There are also
       holding ponds with an allowable loading rate of around 300 kg BOD per day, equivalent to a
       flow of 2,400 m3/day from treated sewage from the works. Service coverage is around 41%
       mainly because people in low density areas are on septic tanks and the high density
       population in the northern wards do not receive water.
       The key findings of the infrastructure assessment in Norton are presented in Table ES â 12
       below.

          difficult.

ES4.5 Ruwa
       Ruwa currently utilises water from Nora Dam via a DN450 uPVC/ DN515 AC supply line
       which feeds into Green Sykes Dam and on to the Ruwa water treatment works. The bulk
       water supply has a capacity of 21,000 m3/day whilst the WTW has capacity 7,500 m3/day.
       Additional water is obtained from the City of Harare (treated water supply) via a DN525
       supply line from Donnybrook tanks to the ZIMRE Estate and onwards into the supply
       network for Ruwa, and a DN350/ DN200 supply line from the Ventersberg tanks which
       feeds the Mutare Road Ground Tanks via a booster station on the western outskirts of
       Ruwa. The system supports 12,500 service connections.
       Ruwa has a single sewage catchment served by three sewage pump stations and the
       Adelaide Ponds. The Adelaide stabilization ponds are in an area under the jurisdiction of
       Epworth Local Board, which has zoned the ponds area for development and has requested
       the Ruwa Town Council to make alternative arrangements to dispose of their sewage.
       Hence the sewage from Ruwa is currently discharged to the natural water courses
       untreated. The key findings of the infrastructure assessment in Ruwa are presented in
       Table ES â 13 below.

ES5    PROPOSED INVESTMENT MEASURES
       Assessment of the existing water supply and sewerage schemes in the project city/towns
       has confirmed that there is need for major rehabilitation investment to bring the existing
       facilities back to good working order. Further analysis of the water and sewerage service
       requirements indicates that, the water and sewerage schemes need to be extended in the
       medium and long term horizons.
       The proposed investment measures are grouped according to the following six categories:
       A - Water Demand Management/NRW Reduction Programme (Investment measures aimed
       at rehabilitating the distribution network and reducing NRW);
       B â Water Supply Service Improvements (Investment measures aimed at improving water
       production, transmission and distribution);
       C - Extension of Water Supply Services (Investment measures aimed at increasing water
       production and extending services to new areas resulting from population increase);
       D - Sewerage Service Improvements (Investment measures aimed at improving sewerage
       services by rehabilitating existing sewage collection and treatment infrastructure);
       E - Extension of Sewerage Services (Investment measures aimed at increasing capacity for
       wastewater treatment and service coverage to the new development areas);
       F â Accompanying Measures (Investment measures aimed at improving capacity to carry
       out technical and commercial operations. Professional services accompanying
       implementation of investments, uncertainties in estimating physical quantities).
       Table ES - 14 overleaf summarises the identified investment measures in each town.

ES6    INVESTMENT COST ESTIMATES

ES6.1 Prioritization Principles and Sequencing of Investments
       Given the current political and economic situation in Zimbabwe, there may not be enough
       funds to finance all the identified investment measures in one project. Hence prioritization
       and evaluation to identify measures with the highest economic and social returns is an
       important element of this investment plan. We have grouped the investment measures into
       three broad priority categories (Figure ES â 5).
       The highest priority will be given to investment measures aimed at ensuring that the utility
       meets its basic public health and service obligations by getting the most out of the existing
       facilities. The second priority will be given to measures that are essential for safeguarding
       the health of the population and the environment (wastewater treatment and disposal),
       while the last priority will include measures that will respond to the increasing demand for
       services due to population and economic growth.

       Figure ES - 5: Prioritization Principles

       Short and medium term investment measures will focus mainly on rehabilitation of existing
       infrastructure, while longer term investments will focus on expansion. The first wave of
       investments should aim at increasing the amount of water available to the customers,
       mainly by reducing physical losses in the network and increasing production at existing
       water treatment facilities. Financing from the Zim-Fund and EXIM bank of China has
       already been applied especially for rehabilitation of the water treatment plants. The second
       wave of investments should focus on managing the increased wastewater flow by
       rehabilitating existing wastewater treatment facilities and increasing treatment capacity.
       Once the services have been stabilised, additional investments can be made in increasing
       water production and extending services to new development areas, capturing more
       customers.

       rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, and US$1,095 million in longer term investments. Of
       the total investment 37% is for extension of water and sewerage reticulation into expansion
       areas, which could be financed by private developers.
       Table ES â 15 shows a summary of the investment costs in Harare by priority. The
       investment measures in each priority are presented in the accompanying graphic.
       Short term investment measures will include network restructuring and rehabilitation to
       reduce physical losses as well as other commercial operational investments to reduce
       overall NRW. They will also include further rehabilitation and optimisation of the two water
       treatment facilities to increase availability of water. Medium term measures will be
       dominated by the construction of the first phase of the Kunzvi scheme and the associated
       restructuring of the primary and secondary distribution network. Expansion and further
       rehabilitation of Crowborough WWTW and other wastewater infrastructure will also be done
       in the medium term. The long term measures will be dominated by the Harare South Trunk
       Sewer and associate wastewater treatment works.

ES6.6 Ruwa
       Table ES â 19 shows a summary of the investment costs in Ruwa by priority. The
       investment measures in each priority are presented in the accompanying graphic. The total
       required investment in Ruwa is US$ 141 million, of which 48% is required in the
       short/medium term and 52% in the long term. Ruwaâs investment costs are significantly
       higher in the short/medium term as compared to the other towns because of the immediate
       need for a wastewater treatment facility and the expansion of the water treatment works
       following the completion of the raw water transmission line from Nora Dam to Green Sykes
       Dam.
       Hence the short term investments are dominated by the pond system and the NRW
       reduction programme. The water treatment plant will be upgraded in the medium term
       along with the completion of the storage tank at the treatment plant. In the long term, the
       pond system may be decommissioned after connection to the Harare South Trunk Sewer.
       Long term investment measures will also include construction of more reservoirs in the
       system to increase storage capacity.

ES6.8 Financing Options
       This investment plan assumes that extension of the water and sewer reticulation network in
       new development areas will largely be financed by private developers. This accounts for
       38% of the total investment costs. A further assumption has been made that the service
       providers (councils and eventually the water utility) will meet the cost of periodic service
       meters replacements (8%) of the total. The remaining 54% of the total investments will be
       financed through grants and loans. Figure ES - 6 below illustrates this split in financing
       assumptions over the study horizon.

       Some financial resources have been made available in the short term. The Zim-Fund is
       financing the implementation of the Urgent Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation
       Project (UWSSRP) in two phases: US$ 14 Million under Phase I and US$ 19 million under
       Phase II (Table ES â 21). The City of Harare has secured a US$ 144 Million loan from the
       EXIM bank of China to be invested in rehabilitation works over the next three years. This
       leaves a financing gap of nearly US$ 1.2 billion. Efforts must start now to bridge this
       financing gap.

ES7    FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND SUSTAINABILITY

ES7.1 Objective
       The main objective of the financial analysis was to ascertain a utility based assessment of
       the financial viability over the project evaluation period (2013 to 2030) using income
       statements, cash flows and balance sheets to determine the individual level of sustainability
       of all entities; Harare, Chitungwiza, Epwoth, Norton, Ruwa and finally all these combined as
       a clustered entity.

ES7.2 Financial Model Configuration
       To achieve this objective a readily available spreadsheet application was used to develop a
       financial model capable of measuring the aforementioned financial statements. The general
       approach is outlined in the following schematic flowchart.

       financial statements availed by the councils and local boards. Discrepancies between ideal
       and advisable cost and efficiency levels were gradually adjusted. This includes the key
       parameters.

ES7.3 Key Parameters and Assumptions
       The key parameters and associated assumptions to the financial model are listed below:
          â¢   Proportion of bulk water demand supplied: With currently inadequate volumes of
              water available to fully satisfy the demand for water by Harare and satellite towns,
              only a proportion of the demand is realistically supplied. For the base year it is
              assumed that only 50 % of the demand for bulk water will be supplied by Harare.
              This gradually increases to 100 % as NRW reduces as well as the production
              capacities increase, which all contributes to more water available to satisfy demand.
          â¢   NRW is currently high, estimated at an average for all areas at 55 %. This is
              assumed to improve, reducing to 30 % by 2020 and further to 20 % by 2030
              (including commercial and technical losses);
          â¢   The bulk water tariff provides a financial interface between Harare (supplier) and the
              satellite areas. The current average bulk water tariff charged by Harare of USD 0.40
              was adopted and kept constant throughout the project horizon. This compares
              slightly higher than recalculated bulk water costs ranging between USD 0.25 and
              USD 0.31 over the evaluation period, Taking losses into consideration, the currently
              charged bulk tariff was considered to be realistic:
          â¢   The Retail tariff calculated by the model for water was well below the average tariff
              actually charged at present of 1.45/m3. This is a combined tariff including sewerage
              and other fixed charges. For purposes of financial modelling this combined charge
              was applied initially and gradually reduced to USD 0.90, also as a combined charge;
          â¢   Collection efficiencies vary amongst the various entities, the lowest for 2013 being
              Harare at around 40 %. While individual collection efficiencies obtained for each
              area were used as a starting point, they converged to the same miletone of 95 % by
              2020, which was assumed to be maintained at this level until the end of the
              evaluation period;
          â¢   Depreciation costs for existing assets were not included in the model as the
              financial position various entities would not allow for such a provision to be
              maintained; However, the depreciation of the planned capital investments were
              included in the cost calculations. Where applicable, depreciation is calculated on a
              linear basis;
          â¢   Maintenance costs calculated for both existing and investment assets were limited
              to 10 % thereof since the current financial performance of the entities is inadequate
              to afford higher levels. However with time, the proportion of ideal maintenance cost
              levels is increased to a maximum of 50 %.
          â¢   The financial model is carried out with real costs and therefore excludes inflationary
              cost escalations;
          â¢   Loan interest is calculated on a reducing balance, whereby two distinct loans have
              been identified; a) an existing loan from Exim Bank with a repayment period of 5
              years at an interest of 3.5 % and an anticipated loan for the implementation of the

              planned investment assets, set at a repayment period of 20 years at an interest of
              5 %, whereby 50 % of the funding would be a grant and hence the effective interest
              rate is 2.5 %.

Greater Harare Water and Sanitation Investment Plan                             Investment Plan Report
                                                                                   Executive Summary


       In general, the financial statements from the financial model indicate that Harare alone is
       financially viable to implement the measures detailed under the investment plan for
       scenario 1 (priority 1, 2 and 3). The results for the satellite towns is however not as
       favourable; none are deemed to be viable. The outcome of the financial model for a
       clustered situation -in which Harare and all satellite towns are combined into a single
       organisation-, is financially sustainable for all investment scenarios.

ES7.5 Conclusion
       Summarising the various findings presented above it can be stated that the base model for
       Harare using current and reducing tariff levels is positive with regard to the income
       statement, sustainable in terms of the cash flow and shown to have an affordable rate of
       investment according to the balance sheet.
       However, this cannot be stated for the satellite towns that return a substantially inferior
       financial position taking into consideration all three financial statements forecast for these
       areas. It can further be stated (in general terms) that the satellite areas neither have the
       liquidity at present nor are they likely to have this in future to cover costs and as such, not
       be able to honour the obligations of a loan required to implement the much needed
       investments.
       Clustering Harare Water together with the satellite areas does, however, present an
       opportunity of achieving a financially sustainable result and at the same time be in a
       position to refund the loan required to implement the much needed capital investments in
       all areas.
       While the existing loan from Exim Bank has provided for the funding of capital investments
       in Harare worth USD 130 million, the terms and conditions of a 5-year repayment period at
       an interest rate of 3.5 % p.a. poses a heavy burden on the entity. Nonetheless, the financial
       model shows that by and large it is possible to still afford an additional loan or loans
       required to implement the medium to long-term investment plan as proposed herein and
       service the existing loan obligations, however with the result that there are occasional
       periods during which the forecast financial performance may require assistance from the
       shareholders of the entity.
       The two alternative investment plan scenarios offered in this investment plan do provide
       scope for reducing the financial burden on the entity. However, these do not offer the same
       degree of satisfactory long-term technical solutions. Since the first option can be afforded, it
       would be advisable to consider re-negotiating the existing loan towards more favourable
       conditions in order to comfortably take on the full investments recommended and detailed
       under the investment scenario 1.
       As indicated above, the full investment for all areas, i.e. including all satellite towns, is best
       achieved under a single entity that clusters all areas into one more capable organisation.
       In view of the above, it is therefore recommended to cluster the areas and prioritise the
       investment plan as detailed under scenario 1.
