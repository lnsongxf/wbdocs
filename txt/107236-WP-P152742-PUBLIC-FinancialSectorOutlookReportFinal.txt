integration in the Orderly Blue scenario would
offer countries in the region many opportunities
for banking and capital markets integration.
Advantages from tailoring relevant EU directives
and regulations to country specific contexts versus
full transposition requirements at accession stage
will need to be balanced carefully. In this world
the Basel-driven regulatory environment brings
benefits in terms of a safer and sounder financial
system. At the same time its potential unintended
effects imply higher compliance costs and capital
requirements which could have a detrimental effect
on bank FDI and credit lines, on which the region
is quite dependent. Tightened global liquidity
conditions require further emphasis on domestic
resource mobilization. In this scenario, further steps
would be required by policymakers and regulators
to ensure that credit growth is supportive of private
sector activity—even in the context of restrained
foreign bank activity. Limited innovation in financial
services and payment systems in this scenario should
be considered an opportunity for small countries to
become pioneers, rather than seen as a constraint.

The scenarios are intended to facilitate a
conversation at the regional and national level on
possible policy responses to each of the scenarios.
While the regional level discussion provided a useful
validation of the scenarios and a starting point for
analyzing implications for actions, the greatest value
to be derived from the scenarios will be at a national
level aimed at informing financial sector strategies
and action plans. Each scenario spotlights different
challenges and opportunities that would be useful
for financial policymakers and regulators to consider.

meant as a starting point for exploration of scenario

  In this context, long-term deposits and loans are defined as deposits and loans with a maturity larger than one year.

  The decomposition approach draws on Randall, 1998 (IMF WP/98/59). The simplified approach applied for decomposing interest rate spreads is the
following: Il-id=il*RR + Prof/Dep + Overheads/Dep + Provisions/Dep - Non-Intr.Income/Dep , where: ‘Il’ is the derived lending rate; ‘id’ is the derived
deposit rate; ‘Prof’ is before tax profit; ‘Overheads’ are operational costs of the banks; ‘Provisions’ are loan loss provisions from the income statement;
‘Non-Intr.Income’ is non-interest income; ‘Dep’ are deposits averaged over two year period due to discrepancy between stock and flow approach with the
rest of the variables.

A key step in any process of thinking about the                          to represent the key areas of uncertainties affecting
future is to identify the most decisive elements                         the region’s financial systems. It was focused on the
of change and their degree of uncertainty over                           broad context (economic, political and market) and
the next ten years. This chapter briefly reviews the                     derived from extensive consultations with regional
continuum of uncertainty for each of the 14 different                    stakeholders, international organization partners and
elements of change that were identified as most                          experts—both inside and outside the World Bank
relevant to the scenario development exercise (see                       (see Figure 30).

                                                        The scenario analysis benefited from inputs and insights of a number

The elements of change are grouped into three
sets of global change and one set of uncertainties
more specifically related to the EU. Detailed
descriptions of each uncertainty and its impact
on the Western Balkans region were prepared to
serve as underlying building blocks for the scenario
development process. The following pages contain
an excerpt of the underlying analysis including a
series of facts, thoughts, and questions designed
not as a comprehensive review of the issues but
rather as a guide to exploring uncertainty around key
elements of change.

Following the identification of the 14 elements
of change, end-points for each uncertainty were
determined to define the different possible
extremes for each of the ranges in the 2025
scenarios. The identified continuums of uncertainty
then serve two related purposes: first they provide
a dashboard for thinking about change drivers
in the relevant context for the region’s financial
systems; second they become the building blocks to
construct a set of internally coherent and plausible
stories of the future. It is worth noting that the left or
right position of the end points does not have any
meaning of its own. This section presents them very
briefly and Annex 2 shows how they play out in each
of the scenarios.

barriers (the combination of these factors is usually
seen as an integral part of globalization). In the recent
crisis, the volume of global trade shrank by almost 20
percent and it remains to be seen how the trade/
GDP ratio evolves and if trade flows become more
regionally fragmented or globalization resumes.
While the volume and value of trade flows will also
depend on many other factors, it is greatly affected
by trade policy and tax decisions (by individual
countries and through bilateral and multilateral
agreements). How this uncertainty plays out in the
continuum from increased protectionism to further
liberalization is important because it will determine
market access and competitiveness of the Western
Balkans, and therefore their export opportunities.


Commodity Markets (Energy)15

Commodity markets have shown great volatility
in recent years. While the magnitude of the impact
of commodity price changes on these variables
differs across countries, the impact of price changes
is significant in virtually all countries. In addition,
the asymmetry of the effects of oil price swings and
the concentration of gains from high oil prices in a
few countries impact the distribution of savings and
reserves around the world. The uncertainty affects
both demand and supply. Countries in the Western
Balkan region rely heavily on imported hydrocarbons.
Therefore, trends and fluctuations in energy prices will
have direct impacts on the countries’ macroeconomic
stability and development prospects. Endpoints of
the uncertainty continuum range from low energy
prices due to significant improvements in energy
efficiency and increased supply from renewable
sources on the one hand to a rise in prices due to
strong growth and related energy demand in many
large emerging economies without improvements in
energy efficiency.

ranging perceptions of risk across countries and
room for regulatory arbitrage.


Global Banking Landscape

Global financial integration has increased
substantially over the last two decades—including
an increasing role of foreign banks across the
world. While foreign bank penetration may have
led to more efficient intermediation and risk sharing,
and the development of domestic financial sectors
through increased competition, it has also increased
exposure to external crises. Hence, the 2008 financial
crisis and its aftermath had significant effects on the
global banking landscape. Large reductions in cross-
border bank flows (mainly due to the retrenchment
of European banks) took place as banks sought to
restore balance sheets. Retrenchment to home
markets also reflected weakened demand, increased
sovereign/country risks, and an adjustment to
regulatory reforms. Countries in the Western Balkans
have significant reliance on foreign banks and their
capital inflows—both through FDI and credit lines.
The dynamics of banking FDI and cross-border credit
is an important uncertainty. The continuum ranges
from further retrenchment – in particular of Western
European parent banks - towards home markets to
expanded banking cross-border flows and FDI.


Capital Markets Development

Capital markets have expanded around the
world in recent decades and while the 2008 crisis
represented a set-back, there has been a strong
recovery since, particularly in stock markets.
Stricter regulations and market pressures caused

such as money transfers, savings, and lending have
surfaced as a result of increased digitization. Some
of these are new companies such as peer-to-peer
lending firms like Kickstarter or Lending Tree. Others
are nonfinancial institutions (or “nonbanks”) setting
up a finance arm, such as e-commerce sites like eBay
(owner of PayPal) or Alibaba, internet intermediaries
like Google, electronics and software developers
like Apple, and telecom operators like Safaricom.
How fast and widely the range of financial services
provided by banks and alternative providers will
expand is a key factor affecting the evolution of the
financial systems in the region. This uncertainty is
also important because it could radically challenge
regulatory mandates. The uncertainty continuum
ranges from inhibited to lively tech-based adoption
of innovations in financial services.


Payment Systems

The use of non-cash payments has grown rapidly
with the introduction of plastic cards. More recent
technological advances in the way information is
stored, the physical form of the payment mechanism,
and biometric account access and authentication are
creating efficiencies, reducing transaction costs and
times at the point of sale. Mobile money transfer
services have already transformed the landscape for
domestic remittances in several African countries.

potential implications. Discussions revolved around
topics including regional integration, management
capabilities and corporate governance, technology,
and the building of a robust economic and financial
sector structure. EU integration and harmonization
was recognized as an important anchor of reform in
the region. However, regardless of the fate of the EU
in different scenarios, cross-country harmonization
will keep playing an important role in attracting
and facilitating investments, as well as transferring
knowledge. Finally, as was the case with the survey,
there was surprisingly little emphasis placed by
participants on the role of technology and how
it might affect financial systems and regulatory
mandates. Keeping this initial discussion at a
regional level provided a valuable perspective that
enriches the thinking that could be done at the level
of individual countries. It also gave a strong sense
of the importance at both levels of action now to
ensure that all countries in the region arrive at 2025
with financial systems that are ready to make the
best possible contribution to economic growth and
prosperity. But the greatest value to be derived
from the scenarios is at a national level—where most
policies and regulations are set.

     The global economy is on a roll—and the center of gravity is no longer in the old
     advanced countries. 2015 did not mark the end of the “emerging golden age”
     but a pause in their growth march. By 2025 though, the term “emerging coun-
     tries” made no sense any longer as quite a lot of those formerly called emerging
     were now well-established upper-middle income countries. Trade is again a ma-
     jor driver of economic activity and supply chains keep getting more global.

as alternatives. It also quietly undermined the Basel
process by ignoring much of the guidance emerging
from there, pushing for more flexible global financial
regulation and the adoption of a more diverse set of
rules reflecting country—and regional—differences.
While it was not an intended consequence, regulatory
arbitrage has been rampant since the early 2020s.

Aggressive digital and online banking strategies
(including “hosting” of small “community payment
unions”) by a few banks proved successful and a
major strategic differentiator. Many banks hung
on to what proved a perishable notion of customers
wanting ‘brick and mortar’ bank branches and failed
to adapt quickly enough. The late 2010s saw the
emergence of many financial service innovators
responding to a willing-to-experiment attitude by
some regulators in major countries and regulatory
loopholes (often in-between regulatory silos) in
others. Many new options emerged reflecting local
circumstances—and paved the way for international
“umbrella” systems that use Blockchain-based
platforms and/or distributed ledger approaches.
Access to credit was changed forever by new players:
Lending Club had paved the way in the US when it
had $2billion turnover in 2016 with Alibaba rumored
to have done even more lending business, by 2020
a few sophisticated crowd funding/lending platforms
were quickly becoming major international players
and/or franchises.

Reality had swept away doubts on crowd-funding
by 2020 (just as a decade earlier Wikipedia had
done with knowledge). Non-bank mobile payment
mechanisms have spread widely. Credit cards are
going the way of the music CD—replaced by crypto
transfers and the financial version of the Internet of
Things. Social media platforms have added financial
options that have been eagerly embraced by young
users—a glimpse of that could be gained back in
2015 by looking at the wildfire-speed popularity
of Venmo (that taps into networks like Facebook)
among college students in the US.

Persistently low interest rates have put great
pressure on pension funds and insurance
companies—which have become a major new
area of consumer protection concern. In that
uncertain and volatile financial market environment,
relaxation of regulatory pressure on banks has
been required—Basel had to address the trade-off
between safeguarding risk and producing banking
paralysis and BIS prescriptions have proven very
divisive. Many countries (in part influenced by
the situation in Europe) have introduced capital
controls and measures to ring-fence their financial
systems. Together with the generalized market view
that sovereign debt (except for the few countries
considered ‘safe heaven’) is “junk”, this environment
makes it difficult and expensive for countries to
obtain external finance, unless their financial and
fiscal discipline earns them stand-out credibility.

Risk levels have been high throughout the decade
and many large banks continue retreating towards
their core markets—closing down or selling
subsidiaries. HSBC’s exit from Brazil in 2015 was
just the first step in a broader retrenchment and,
in Europe, by 2020 the previously adventurous
Austrian banks had already cut in half the number
of countries where they have a presence. With their
banking landscape looking bleaker, many countries
resorted to state-owned banking initiatives—which
only exceptionally appear to provide more than a
poor patch-up solution.

Impetus for innovation in financial services
and payment systems has been dampened by
economic weakness and by major waves of
cyber-crime and terrorist hacking. Only piecemeal
innovation is taking place on capital markets, financial
services and payment systems and it revolves around
low-end products of the m-Pesa type and reducing
transaction costs for remittances

 This is a world that favors incumbents—including both the old advanced countries
 and well-established international banks. The G7 remains predominant politically
 and economically—reflecting the strength of the US economy (not least through
 a new productivity impetus) and, finally, a graduation from recovery to steady
 growth in Europe. Growth has moderated overall for emerging and developing
 countries that in the early 2000s had been growing fast—with averages masking
 periods of significant set-backs for a number of major countries (including Brazil
 and Russia which took longer than was expected in 2015—the latter especially
 hampered by persistently low oil prices). Low oil prices have been a major help
 to India—which has been the decade’s world fastest growing country.

Three more countries were granted EU accession
before 2025 and several more are close to that
milestone. Renewed faith in the euro area has made
possible progress towards banking and capital
market unions in the EU, moving ahead of the 2015
road map pace. Addressing the need for critical
mass for capital market operations in smaller EU
members and members-to-be, the Vienna Financial
Center was fully operational by 2020 and has proven
a successful platform for corporate listings and
public and private debt issues—with security pricing
and CDS levels rewarding good governance and
transparency.

The resumption of economic growth in advanced
countries has dampened the anti-growth criticism
of strict banking regulations that was emerging
when major economies seemed to be gravitating
towards secular stagnation. The Basel approach
has taken strong roots and implementation has
proceeded apace. Together with renewed anti-
money laundering efforts combating the financing of
terrorism, regulatory dynamics have had the effect
of accelerating concentration and consolidation
of the banking industry in the EU and elsewhere—
as compliance costs become prohibitive for small
banks.

International banks are further curtailing activities
outside their home bases; but retrenching by major
Western banks from emerging markets stopped
well short of the worst 2015 fears in CESEE.
Alignment of views between major Western country
regulators and large banks has resulted in financial
service and payment innovations being rolled out
cautiously—and they are reaching the consumer
mainly through incumbent financial institutions.
Large banks that developed a sophisticated hybrid of
in-person and on-line banking are doing particularly
well. However, in countries adopting Basel-type
regulations often the unintended effect has been
a proliferation of regular financial services being
offered by non-banking institutions and “shadow
banking institutions”. Meanwhile, consumer interest
in more novel approaches to payments and crowd-
lending was dampened by a series of high-visibility
Ponzi schemes and other cyber-fraud.
