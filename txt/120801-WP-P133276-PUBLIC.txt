Foreword
When we launched the World Bank’s open data initiative, we were convinced
it was the right thing to do, but unsure what the results would be.


We soon saw that removing the technical and legal barriers to accessing
our data triggered a 15-fold increase in its use. From carrying out economic
analyses and highlighting gaps in our data, to creating news stories, data
visualizations and games - more users, in more places were doing more
things with our data than we’d ever seen before.


We have not been alone in this realization. Governments and organizations
around the world recognize that opening up their data maximizes the return
on the investments they have made in producing and managing it.


In the last five years, the World Bank has assisted over 50 low- and middle-
income countries with advice and financing to run their own open data
programs. We have worked to strengthen the open data community in every
region of the world, and to make sure that poorer countries do not miss out
on the benefits of new ways of managing digital public goods.


I’m pleased to introduce this synopsis of our work supporting the global
open data agenda since 2012. It represents the Bank’s work at its best -
using a mix of financing, knowledge and partnerships to make long-term
improvements that ultimately improve people’s lives.


I look forward to seeing this work to continue, and would highlight this
document’s lessons learned section as essential reading for anybody
working on open data inside or outside the World Bank.

       Abstract
       This report summarizes the World Bank’s activities to support the Open
       Data efforts of developing countries during the period 2012 - 2017. It is
       largely descriptive, but Chapter 4 includes key analysis and lessons learned.
       The main objectives of this report are to share information within the
       World Bank and with its partners and client countries, and to preserve the
       institutional memory and highlight the lessons learned as a way to improve
       the development effectiveness of Open Data.

      1 Introduction
         1.1 Background

         Open Data is data freely available online, in
         machine-readable format and covered by a legal
         license that allows anyone to use and re-use it for                                     Open
         any purpose, including for commercial purposes1.
         Open Government Data (OGD) is the data that
         governments collect and choose to release in open                              Open      Open

3	The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is a global development cooperative owned by 189
   member countries. As the largest development bank in the world, the World Bank Group provides loans, guarantees, risk
   management products and advisory services to middle-income and low-income countries, and contributes to international
   efforts to address regional and global development challenges.
4	The International Development Association (IDA) is the world’s largest multilateral source of concessional financing for the
   poorest countries. It provides concessional development credits, grants and guarantees in support of these countries’ efforts
   to increase economic growth, reduce poverty and improve the living conditions of the poor. In fiscal 2016, 77 countries were
   eligible for IDA assistance.
5	 World Bank’s Administrative Budget (Bank Budget, or BB) is used along with other resources to support overall client services
   and the operational expenses of project preparation, supervision and analytical and advisory activities (AAA), including
   technical assistance (TA) and economic and sector work (ESW).
6	 Trust funds (TFs) administered by the World Bank complement the IBRD and IDA funded operations. They allow scaling up of
   activities, notably in fragile and crisis-affected situations; enable the Bank to provide assistance when its own ability to lend
   is limited; provide immediate assistance in response to natural disasters and other emergencies; and pilot innovations that
   are later mainstreamed into the Bank’s operations.
7	 In response to specific requests, the World Bank provides a variety of RASs to clients beyond the analytic and advisory
   services that it can fund through its administrative budget or relevant TFs. Under a RAS agreement the client reimburses the
   bank the costs of the analytical and advisory services. Typically, RAS engagements are provided in addition to other WBG
   activities; for non-borrowing member clients, however, RAS may be the single instrument through which the WBG provides
   services.
8	 The DGF was the World Bank’s mechanism for providing grant financing for innovative partnerships that are of high value to
   World Bank clients, but cannot be adequately supported through the Bank’s country operations, or through economic and
   sector work alone. The DGF has been discontinued.

   for the index includes a ranking for openness and a ranking for metadata quality, which combined give the total ranking.
   If the intention is to examine only the NSO openness, only the ranking corresponding to this part of the index should be

*** Amounts are provided for all the projects where the cost of the OD component and the sources of funding are known. For
    many projects the cost of the OD component is not known, either because OD is not a separate component or because the
    project is policy lending. For some projects the cost of the OD component is known, but the sources of funding are not clear.
    In the last two cases, we have not included the amounts.


   For many TFSCB- and KGGTF- funded projects, while the exact amounts were difficult to establish, the TFs that funded them
   were earmarked only for OD activities; in these cases, the full grant amounts are listed in the table under “World”.
