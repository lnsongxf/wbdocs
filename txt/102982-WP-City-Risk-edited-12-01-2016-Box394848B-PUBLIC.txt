Foreword


In 2012, the World Bank initiated the Building Urban Resilience in East Asia program, aimed
at increasing the resilience of cities to disasters and the impact of climate change by using a
risk-based approach to making public investment decisions. The objective is to demonstrate
a scalable methodology and practical tools for risk assessment that can be used for city-level
investment decisions. As part of this program, a book entitled “Building Urban Resilience:
Principles, Tools and Practice” was published in 2013, providing a framework to implement
urban resilience activities. With the support from East Asia Infrastructure for Growth (EAIG),
a regional trust fund supported by the Australian Government, an activity was conducted to
experiment with the implementation of this framework in Indonesia.

This activity started with engaging selected cities that have reasonable complexity and are
experiencing significant growth. The next step involved conversations about disaster and
climate risks confronting the cities and the options that they could consider in building
resilience. The result of this experiment is presented in this book. It is hoped that this will be
the first in a series of publications on the development and adaptation of principles, tools and
practices for urban resilience in the Indonesian context.

The book begins with two chapters on the disaster and climate vulnerabilities in the context
of Indonesian cities, and the basic framework developed by the World Bank Building Urban
Resilience in East Asia program. The subsequent two chapters describe the Rapid Risk
Diagnostic as the first step in the urban resilience engagement, and the summary of the
diagnostic findings in selected Indonesian cities. The final chapter provides a glimpse of how
options to invest in resilience can be materialized in practice as part of a city’s development.
Presented with many visuals, maps and illustrations, we hope the book will be enjoyable and
informative for urban development practitioners.

    1.   URBANIZATION AND DISASTER
         AND CLIMATE VULNERABILITIES
         IN INDONESIA

         With an average annual urbanization rate estimated at 4.1% between
         2000 and 2010, Indonesia is one of the most urbanized countries in Asia.
         Its urban population, 54% in 2010, is projected to reach 68% by 2025.
         Rapid urbanization leads to dense settlements and a concentration of
         critical infrastructure. It is estimated that at least 110 million people in
         60 Indonesian cities are regularly exposed to natural hazards, including
         tsunamis, earthquakes, floods, as well as disasters related to climate
         change.

         Urbanization offers opportunities for Indonesia, potentially boosting
         regional economic growth and creating vibrant cities and metropolitan
         areas. Urbanization and the agglomeration economies that it generates
         are an important element in Indonesia‘s development as a middle-
         income country. If managed properly, urbanization can generate positive
         returns that create opportunities for economic growth, poverty reduction
         and shared prosperity.

         City management may lack core competencies to manage sustainable
         urbanization, as indicated by the many Indonesian cities developing
         without a disaster risk perspective. This can lead to increasing
         occurences of annual disasters and a higher than average death toll of
         urban residents.

         In addition, Indonesia’s cities’ resilience to natural disasters has been
         weakened by the rapid construction of physical assets in urban areas
         amid weak enforcement of building codes and zoning regulations.
         Indonesia’s fast-paced, and not always well-planned, construction of
         physical assets has seen demand for urban housing and commercial
         facilities multiply over the past decade. Since weak enforcement of
         spatial planning regulations are common, real estate and construction
         activities are prone to deliver structures of substandard quality.

                                                                          for Provinces (2011)
    of the number of disaster-impacted buildings and houses over the
    past two decades. Disaster impact on housing is a useful proxy for    Total Budget
    the degree of vulnerability of urbanized areas. In the past decade    IDR 3.9 Trillions
    alone, between 20 and 50 percent of post disaster reconstruction
    budgets have been spent on housing. Statistics also show that the
    proportion of post disaster budget in 2011 was concentrated in
    urban provinces. This suggests that many assets have not been built
    to appropriate standards in the first place.

    2.   FRAMEWORK fOR
         BUILDING URBAN RESILIENCE
         The rapid expansion of built-up urban areas provides an opportunity to
         develop and manage new settlements in a way that incorporate resilience
         into urban planning. The aftermath of a natural disaster can prompt
         decision-makers to push through with corrective and preventive action.
         Resilience goes beyond risk mitigation measures. It increases preparedness
         and the capacity to respond to disaster and swiftly recover from its
         impact. However, this approach is not yet seen as a part of everyday
         urban development, medium- and long-term investment planning, urban
         governance, and risk management.

         The World Bank in East Asia and the Pacific has compiled a set of tools
         to help cities and rapidly growing urban areas to embark on urban
         resilience investment. The tools comprise of three major building blocks:
         1) Assessment and Diagnostic; 2) Resilience Measures; and 3) Enabling
         Framework. Each building block consists of distinct components as
         visualized in Figure 3, below.

    3.   RAPID RISK Diagnostic AS A STEP
         TOWARD BUILDING URBAN RESILIENCE

         To initiate urban resilience building efforts, risk assessment needs to be
         carried out. However, since most urban areas develop naturally, high
         resolution data -- instrumental for conducting risk assessment --are not
         usually readily available. At the same time, cities continue to grow, adding
         new areas or modifying existing ones. This potentially introduces new risks
         and vulnerabilities.
         In practice, most city governments and their residents are quite familiar with the
         occurrences of low impact and high frequency events, like floods, landslides, or
         even small earthquakes. These events are considered ‘normal’, yet their causes
         and impact are not often observed properly. As the city grows, these events
         become exacerbated over time and their impact become more complex to
         analyze.
         Rapid risk diagnostic can be used to initiate a conversation between city
         officials and stakeholders on disaster and climate risks, their general
         spatial distribution, and how they influence the city’s growth pattern and
         trends. Using available low resolution data such as atlases, records of events
         as remembered by residents or information reports, and news on investment
         developments, specific geographic areas around natural hazards and
         investment locations can be easily pinpointed. Such rudimentary but targeted
         diagnosis, just like a general physician diagnosing illness symptoms, may
         lead to city managers having a clearer picture of issues and locations to focus
         on. More detailed and thorough risk assessments can then be conducted in
         smaller geographic areas where generating new and higher resolution data
         will be more manageable and less costly. Figure 4 illustrates the concept of risk
         diagnostic as a conversation starter for more detailed risk assessment.

The diagnostic applies a simple process of compiling existing data on: (i) the cities’ overall spatial structure,
and their growth trends and directions; (ii) the pattern of disaster occurrence and the main affected areas;
and (iii) an understanding of major urban investments being undertaken.

Development creates a dynamic and changing spatial structure, and influences the pattern and direction
of growth. Development also increases vulnerability to the environment and society. Disaster occurs
in vulnerable locations. With the knowledge of a city’s risk profile and resilience options, vulnerable
investments, are addressed to reduce disaster risk, decrease vulnerability, and improve spatial structure.




The rapid risk diagnostic preparess a city’s risk profile, by providing a storyline of each city in terms of location,
concentration of risks and urban investment activities, and options for integrating resilience into those on-
going urban investments. As the concept of urban resilience is relatively new, it is important that the risk
profile provide visual illustration of how a resilient city could physically look like. More importantly the city risk
profile also provide a list of measures that can be undertaken to boost resilience along the two previously-
described pillars of urban upgrading and ecosystem management/restoration.

          DIAGNOSTICS of
          6 cities
          Rapid risk diagnostics have been carried out in Indonesia
          in six medium and large cities as a pilot project. The six
          cities are: Balikpapan, Makassar, Palembang, Denpasar,
          Semarang, and Yogyakarta.

                        Figure 6. Index map of pilot cities


          The aim of this disaster and climate profiling is three-
          fold. First, to identify the key locations and urban
          infrastructure to be prioritized in order to create
          urban resilience. Second, to assess the prospects of
          incorporating risk reduction in urban development
          planning. Third, to provide strategy options for building
          urban resilience. The strategy options focus on three
          instruments:
          (i) risk-based land use and infrastructure investment
          planning; (ii) urban ecosystem management; and (iii)
          urban infrastructure upgrading for resilience.
          The six cities selected to pilot the diagnostic are
          combination of metropolitan and large cities in
          Indonesia. This type of city is most at risk from disaster
          and climate change due to their complex system and
          density. They face growing issues which drive risks.
          These cities experience hazard events that adversely
          affect populations.

             For flood control and anticipating the rise in sea levels, Balikpapan can refer to the
             lagoon concept in Foster City, California, for the area’s coastal road development plan.
             Balikpapan would also benefit from the lessons learned by Brisbane in Australia, which
             used backflow prevention infrastructure as part of the integrated drainage system.
Resilience
Options

             Risk-based infrastructure investment planning options include continuing investments on
             flood control infrastructure and implementing evacuation plans in the event of flooding
             or rising sea levels (integration between the new development areas at the coast with
             the mainland). Disaster and climate risk information also needs to be strengthened to
             support risk-sensitive land use and infrastructure planning.



             The involvement of the community and the private sector in urban ecosystem
             management is needed for improving greenery in water catchment areas in conserving
             mangrove forests. In addition, zoning control and strict permit issuance for landslide and
             flood prone areas need to be exercised.




             Urban infrastructure upgrading is focused on slum areas. The most essential infrastructure
             are: (i) seawalls for protecting coastal areas including vulnerable slums; and (ii) fire
             response paths which are developed by clearing and strengthening pathways,
             particularly on the west coast of Balikpapan Bay and in the slum areas of Klandasan Ulu.

     drainage system development and
     maintenance as well as bendali construction.
     Currently, the city is constructing its fourth

     However, instead of declining, flooding has
     increased. The provision of such infrastructure
     should therefore be accelerated to cope

             Most of the coastal development area in Makassar is the result of land reclamation, land
             readjustment and port facility improvement. Its development had included disaster-
             proof infrastructure such as utility tunnels and an earthquake-resistant berth. In addition,
             various cutting-edge shared utility systems help this 21st century city, such as district
             heating and cooling systems, as well as emergency underground water tanks.
Resilience
Options


             The options for risk-based infrastructure investment planning include effective flood
             control, by managing development upstream, as well as holistic improvement of
             the drainage networks. The area is equipped with secondary and local drainage
             systems, a solid waste management system, and water infiltration mechanisms such as
             biopore, catchment wells, and rainwater harvesting. All these should be the minimum
             requirement to which developers must comply. The municipality can ask the private
             sector to build a mini polder in order to improve the quantity of water catchment areas.



             Urban ecosystem management measure are needed, such as revitalization of mangrove
             forests in coastal areas as well as conserving forests and water catchment areas
             upstream in order to reduce sedimentation in the estuaries, particularly Tallo estuary,
             which has increased due to high land conversion. Building a number of water retention
             ponds in upstream areas of the Tallo catchment should be considered.




             Urban infrastructure upgrading is focused on slum areas above water elevated housing
             compound in riverbank and tidal prone areas. Slum infrastructure upgrading can be
             implemented by adopting the Urban Poor Consortium (UPC) model. The model has
             been tried out in several small-scale pilots in other region.




             Urban infrastructure upgrading is focused on slum areas. The most essential infrastructure
             is the seawall to protect coastal activities, including slums vulnerable to sea level rise.
             Fire response paths need to be built by clearing and strengthening pathways in densely
             populated slums.

   Disaster   hazards are relatively evenly distributed across the city since Palembang was originally
Occurrences   composed from wetlands. The areas that are highly prone to flood are those located
              along Musi Riverbank. In the case of fire, the most vulnerable part is the central area. In
              addition to those hazards, localized typhoons have also hit Palembang several times,
              since deforestation had created more barren land which had caused micro climate to
              change triggering unstable local weather pattern.

              About 7,125 hectares of Palembang are susceptible to flooding; some
              83 hectares are periodically flooded and over 7,000 hectares lowland              7,125 Ha
              and watershed areas are frequently flooded during the rainy season. The           Area
              duration of the floods is also increasing. In 2007, floods lasted only a few      regularly
              hours, but in 2013, the inundation lasted a few days. In February 2013,           flooded
              massive flooding occurred, impacting 54 villages in 9 subdistricts: Gandus,
              Ilir Barat I, Ilir Barat II, Ilir Timur I, Kemuning, Kertapati, Plaju, Seberang
              Ulu I, and Seberang Ulu II. Several public facilities and roads were affected
              as well, including Karyajaya Terminal, R. Soekamto Street, Mayor Ruslan
              Street, and May Salim Batubara Street. This indicates higher vulnerability
              and diminishing risk management capacity.




              On average, fire events occurred 6 times a month and distributed evenly across
              Palembang. Out of 107 villages, 43 villages are prone to fire hazards. The vulnerability
              to fire is generated by the many buildings built of easily flammable material. Fire prone
              locations are across several high density commercial areas, such as Seberang Ulu I
              Village, Kelurahan 1 Ilir Village, 2 Ilir Village, 1 Ulu Village, 7 Ulu Village, 3 Ulu Village,

              surrounding districts. Palembang is vulnerable due to population density and building
              conditions (particularly in slum areas), type of land use (along riverbank and wetland), as
              well as the absence of community level countermeasures in dealing with natural hazards.

             Palembang has already enacted Local Regulation Number 11 Year 2012, regarding
             Supervision of Wetland Utilization and Control, in order to ensure proper implementation.
             Hence the experience of Manchester City in the UK and New Jersey in the USA could
             be adopted. Manchester City revitalized the riverside through zoning control, while New
             Jersey provided incentives for voluntary conservation of wetlands. Both approaches seek

             wetlands as a water attraction and a a historical district for preservation.

             Risk-based land use and infrastructure investment planning:
             The key issue for resilience of Palembang is how to capitalize flood risk zoning into multi
             spatial sub-urban retrofitting (particularly in the densely populated downtown/old city). Land
             consolidation and water management should also be integrated, in order to produce a
             canal-rich waterfront downtown with waterways as alternatives for public transportation. Also
             required is urban settlement design and housing architecture that are flood-resilient.
             Development on reclaimed wetlands should entail strict requirements on the provision of
             disaster mitigation infrastructure and of water catchment preservation, through retention
             pools, biophores, rainwater harvesting, etc. Neighborhood Development Plans (RTBL)
             are needed in areas with specific urban functions and key investments. For example, the
             Jakabaring area.
             The city needs at least an additional 30 pools through which runoff can be channeled and
             retained during peak flow periods.
             The city has also established detailed procedures for evacuation along the main corridors,
             including the development of evacuation routes and training programs, as well as facilities in
             the event of an emergency.

             Urban infrastructure upgrading for resilience:
             Make mandatory building code requirements that minimize fire risk.
             The Municipality of Palembang has carried out various actions to control flooding, including

Today, housing complexes dominated land use of Denpasar. The expansion of settlements is clear. Of the
total land availability of 12,778 hectares, more than 61 % is used for housing, while rice fields occupy some
21 % of land, state-owned forest land take up 4.21% of land. The rest of the land is divided up as follows:
grassland has 3.10%, community forests have 0.59%, non-rice farming takes up 0.27%, fishponds comprise
0.08% of land, while the rest of the land -- 9.20% -- comprise of sands, swamps and wetlands.                                  37
 Pattern of   Settlement-dense Denpasar is prone to several types of hazards, including floods,
   Disaster   fire, tsunami, earthquakes, strong wind and landslides. Given the population density,
Occurrences   Denpasar is also prone to other types of disaster, such as flood-related disease outbreaks
              and poor sanitation. Denpasar is particularly vulnerable due to population density and
              land use activity near hazard prone areas. The existence of slum settlements in the city
              also contributes to vulnerability, particularly related to fire hazards.


              There are 18 locations in Denpasar that are prone to
              flooding: they are across 11 villages and cover an area of       18 location
              495 hectares. Flooding occurs due to poor drainage and            Area that always
              high rainfall intensity.                                          flooded

              Fire is the disaster that occurs most frequently, especially in highly dense settlements
              and in some commercial areas from east to south.


              As it lies on the active Australian and Indonesian plates, Denpasar has the potential of
              experiencing an earthquake and a tsunami. According to Indonesia’s earthquake index,
              Denpasar is categorized as “high-risk”. The possibility of tsunami in Bali is high since it is
              situated in between two earthquake generators. The epicenters are likely located at the
              ocean south of Bali Island.




              Landslides in Denpasar commonly occur in relatively limited areas that have steep
              slopes, such as riverbanks. However, as riverbanks are considered attractive and are
              rapidly converted into built-up spaces, they become risk areas and require serious
              attention.
              Whirlwind have also struck Denpasar several times, at speeds between 5 and 20 knots
              or about 30 kilometers per hour.

             In the medium and long term, Denpasar should focus on three measures:
             (i) flood mitigation; (ii) tsunami preparedness in tourist areas, fish processing areas,
             and high-density settlements; (iii) fire mitigation.
             Flood mitigation should be integrated with infrastructure development, with
Resilience   the river basins managed and flood-prone areas clearly designated. Coastal
Options      management, economic and social development should apply risk-based land use
             and infrastructure investment planning, by synchronizing zoning regulations.
             Balance between upstream and downstream development is also important,
             particularly as Badung District is under the framework of the Sarbagita secretariat,
             that is Denpasar, Badung, Gianyar, and Tabanan. This joint secretariat allows for
             horizontal coordination and decision-making in other jurisdictions.
             Denpasar should also adopt a community-based fire management system, by
             providing guidelines, standard operating procedures and training for community
             volunteers and hotel association.

             Risk-based land use and infrastructure investment planning, includes accelerating the
             implementation of comprehensive flood mitigation, ensuring controlled development
             in flood-prone areas, tsunami risk-based land use and infrastructure investment
             planning in coastal areas, as well as strengthening emergency and rescue capability
             for a “Tourist-safe Denpasar”.

             Urban infrastructure upgrading for resilience means fire mitigation planning should
             be undertaken, specifically infrastructure improvement in order to improve service
             coverage and response times during fire emergencies. Evacuation planning in every
             community should be developed through a participatory approach.

             Urban ecosystem management options: The RTRW of Denpasar specified Ngurah Rai
             Forest Park in South Denpasar as the protected coastal area with mangrove forests.
             Restoration of mangrove ecosystems along the coasts is urgently needed in order
             to simultaneously reduce the impact of abration, sea level rise, and tsunami, as well
             as offer a new tourist attraction. Denpasar could apply stricter spatial development
             controls upstream, particularly settlement development in flood and landslide prone
             zones in North and West Denpasar. One option to address this issue is to establish
             inter-region cooperation, particularly with Badung District.
             The prospects of incorporating resilience in on-going investments in Denpasar is
             promising, because the RTRW has already incorporated some resilience measures,
             particularly in response to the continuous development of the coastal areas. However,
             there is a need to integrate it with existing investments, towards comprehensive,
             water-sensitive, and tsunami-safe spatial development.

     Honolulu, Hawaii, adhered to the Primary Urban Center Development for coastal area
     concept – and Honolulu’s experience provides an example of balancing economic growth
     with the needs of the residents. This concept could be considered by Denpasar, in order
     to control rapid development that jeopardizes the natural ecosystem. The coastal area of
     Honolulu is also equipped with tsunami mitigation measures, including updated community-
     based evacuation plans. Denpasar could enhance its near coast ocean-floor data to
     develop more accurate evacuation plans and utilize the Banjar (traditional village) as well
     as the Pecalang (traditional safeguard) in designing evacuation plans and other mitigation
     measures

                                                    To achieve a regionally integrated risk sensitive
                                                    development, it is important to recognize the
                                                    challenges in inter-municipal collaboration
                                                    and development coordination. The Sarbagita
                                                    Metropolitan Area cooperation scheme needs to be
                                                    tapped, since some triggers for potential disaster
                                                    are caused by development in upstream regions,
                                                    particularly in the northern part of Badung.

Similarly, disasters in Denpasar can impact other regions in the metropolitan area. The Sarbagita Joint
Secretariat can be empowered to foster effective multi-region cooperation in conducting seamless
risk analysis, and risk sensitive urban planning and investment. This entity can be utilized to implement
regionally comprehensive disaster-risk based land use planning and infrastructure development,
particularly to reduce the impact of land conversion in upstream regions.
The Secretariat could act as a facilitator to establish collective decision-making processes among
the local governments. Most importantly, the secretariat could initiate agreement that disaster and
climate risk reduction measures should be implemented in a synergy, through open and transparent
negotiation processes.

                    6th most populated city (World Bank, 2012). The average population density is 4,087
                    persons per square kilometer, and the most densely-populated area is South Semarang,

Pattern and          In the past, the old town area of Semarang in the city’s northeast was the epicenter of
Direction of         growth. Semarang’s urban development began in the 17th century, when the colonial
    Growth           administration (VOC) designated an area of 31 hectares, known as Kota Lama.
                     Today, Kota Lama Semarang is no longer a growth center. Gradually, social and
                     economic activity shifted to the city’s central business district (CBD). Since the
                     establishment of Tanjung Mas Seaport, activity is particularly concentrated along the
                     north coast.

     Old Town



The city has expanded in various directions. New settlements were established in the southern part of the
city, including Banyumanik and Tembalang.
To control development, Semarang ensured that measures to reduce risks and manage disasters are
included in the Spatial Planning (RTRW), specifically through zoning regulations. However, despite the
presence of disaster risks, the by-law Semarang Spatial Plan for 2011 – 2031 has not fully recognized
potential key hazards such as flooding and landslides.

              Flooding greatly impacts commercial activities.


              Flooding occurs more frequently in the northern part of Semarang and
              mostly caused by tidal floods and poor drainage systems. Some 91                    91
              villages are particularly prone to flooding (ACCCRN, 2010; BPBD, 2010;              villages in
              Fire Department, 2010). The drainage systems are ineffective and carry              Semarang
              increasing inflow streams during the rainy season. High sedimentation               are prone to

              greater vulnerability to floods.




              Fire hazards occur more frequently in the city center, where economic activity is
              concentrated.

              The rate of Sea Level Rise in Semarang is about 7.88 mm/year, and reaches 1.7 – 3.0
              km inland. This leads to inundation of some 7,500 to 8,500 hectares and economic
              losses due to disruption of commercial activities.

              Landslides occur in the south, specifically the eight villages in Gunung Pati subdistrict.

  PEOPLE                          areas are illustrated using darker colors. Hence, the darker colored areas represent
                                  those with higher vulnerability to disasters, particularly fire, sea level rise and land
               42                 subsidence. Those are areas of major economic activity and strategic infrastructure.

Risk-based infrastructure investment planning options. New developments along the
north coast require countermeasures to sea level rise, such as land elevation and floating
construction, particularly in new areas for industrial development near Achmad Yani
Airport and the expansion of Tanjung Mas Seaport.
Semarang should formulate and implement a risk-based Neighborhood Development
Planning (RTBL) for industrial and other strategic areas in the north coast and in Central
Semarang.
The city must also control groundwater use. Options include improving the supply of tap/
pipe water, as well as utilizing rainwater harvesting in all sub-districts, particularly in the
north coast areas.
Undertake a strategic natural environment review on the RTRW under climate change
criteria, in order to inform existing and future development investment in the high risk
areas.

Urban Infrastructure upgrading: As part of Semarang’s flood response program, since
2010 the West Flood Canal (WFC) has seen improvements through normalization; the
repairs completed in 2013, and have significantly reduced the impact of flooding in the
northern and western parts of Semarang.
The East Flood Canal (EFC), on the other hand, has not been improved, at the time of
study for this publication in 2013. Coordinating the upgrading and operation of the canal
system is critical, as they are managed by different river authorities. Development of
areas in the south -- prone to landslides -- has been rapid.The hills in these areas need to
be strengthened, by building anchored walls, particularly where the slopes are steep, the
soil is unstable, and where important infrastructure need safeguarding. The municipality
should also enforce zoning control and apply stricter rules about the issuance of
construction permits.
Urban ecosystem management: To protect activity in the north coast, Semarang must
revitalize the area’s mangrove forests. This can reduce the impact of sea level rise, land
subsidence, and coastal inundation. Similarly, development upstream must be managed,
particularly settlement development in Banyumanik, Tembalang, and West Semarang.
Greenery programs, water harvesting, and other efforts to maintain water catchment
coverage should be integrated with any development that takes place in those areas.

     Flood management remains a major task for Semarang. The existence
     of West and East Flood Canals is not adequate in tackling the floods,
     because of the compounding effect of land subsidence along the
     coast. Semarang needs an integrated drainage system as well as
     land acquisition schemes for flood-prone areas, so that they can be
     cleared from built-up activities and repurposed as urban catchment
     areas and coastal ecosystems.
     Brisbane is the sister city of Semarang. Flood hazards occur
     frequently in Brisbane, as the city was built on a river and close to
     Moreton Bay, with many creeks and tributaries running through the
     suburbs. During the summer months, severe storms with heavy rainfall
     are common. These storms can result in flooding from Brisbane
     River and connected creeks, storm surges along the coastal areas,
     and overland flow flooding. Brisbane responded by developing an
     integrated drainage system that covers the whole city. The system is
     complemented by a backflow prevention device. The device ensures
     that storm waters will flow only to one direction through a piped
     storm water system, as well as minimize the amount of water that flow
     back to the roads/surfaces.
     This approach can be replicated in Semarang, along the two canals.
     Development of the city’s coasts should recognize more water-
     sensitive land use.
     For the hilly parts of Semarang’s south, rain harvesting and controlled
     development are options for reducing flood risks, conserving water,
     and mitigating land subsidence. Here, the City of Sumida, Tokyo
     can serve as inspiration. Having high rainfall and situated around two
     large rivers -- Sumida and Arakawa rivers -- Sumida residents often
     suffer from flooding but also paradoxically have inadequate water
     supply. Semarang can adopt Sumida’s example, by regulating permit
     requirements for property or residential developers in the Building
     and Neighborhood Development Plan (RTBL).
     But the implementation of rainwater utilization also requires the
     support of municipal government officials, as well as cross-agency
     cooperation and coordination. Local residents and businesses should
     also be informed about the short- and long-term benefits of rainwater
     utilization.

                    educational institutions has also influenced the city. As a result, built-

Pattern and          Yogyakarta as a city dates back to 1755, from the Keraton, with the Royale Palace
Direction of         Square and fortress as the city’s main elements. Later, a settlement for abdi dalem
    Growth           or the royal servants were built in the areas surrounding the Keraton.Traditionally,
                     Yogyakartans believe in the influence of Mount Merapi in the north and the coastal
                     area in the south, and hence the development of settlements should follow the same
                     pattern, in a north-south direction.

Yogyakarta used to be a relatively small city. In the 1930s, the city had a population of only 60,000 people
(Baiquni, 2004 in Baier, 2012).. The city has evolved into a metropolitan city, encompassing surrounding
cities and suburbs. Since the 1970s, migration to the city has grown rapidly. The city’s population now
crosses its administrative boundaries, particularly towards Sleman and Bantul districts.
In recent decades, new centers of commerce, education and tourism have grown in parallel with
developments of settlements, both formal and informal. As Yogyakarta has limited available land, rapid
migration into the city has resulted in low-income communities settling in natural disaster hotspots such,
as vulnerable riverbank slums (Bawole, 2012).


                                                                                                               53
 Pattern of   Yogyakarta is prone to flooding, flash flooding of cold lava (lahar), landslides, strong
   Disaster   wind, earthquakes, and fire. Most flooding, lahar, and landslide events are concentrated
Occurrences   in settlements located along the riverbanks, whereas fire occurs in densely populated
              areas, particularly in the northern part of the city. Yogyakarta is also at risk from volcanic
              ash rain, due to its proximity to Mt. Merapi, one of the world’s most active volcanoes.

              Lying atop the active Opak fault between Yogyakarta and Bantul District, earthquakes pose
              a constant threat to Yogyakarta. Earthquakes frequently occur at shallow depths, making
              many structures very vulnerable. The first recorded earthquake in Yogyakarta Province
              took place in 1840. Three earthquakes were followed by tsunamis. In 2006, Yogyakarta was
              struck by a strong earthquake, causing more than 5,000 fatalities. The damage is estimated
              to exceed USD $ 3.1 billion. According to the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology,
              Climatology, and Geophysics (BMKG) and the Center of Volcanology and Geological
              Hazard Mitigation (PVMBG), the latest and most damaging earthquake occurred on May
              27, 2006; the quake had a magnitude of only 5.8 – 6.2 on the Richter scale (Bappeda,
              2008). This hightlights the increase exposure of built up assets in recent years.




              Most flooding, lahar, and landslide occurrences are concentrated in villages located along
              the riverbank areas, including Code, Gajahwong, and Winongo River. Due to the expansion
              of built-up areas and poor drainage systems, the capacity of water catchment areas has
              declined. Lahar flows primarily through the Code River, a tributary of Mount Merapi.
              Landslides, on the other hand, strike areas of high development density.

              Fires in Yogyakarta also occur in densely populated areas, with the frequency being 40 to
              50 times a year.

      Major                                        Increased construction has led to greater density along the Code, Winongo, and
      Urban                                        Gajahwong rivers. Development takes place despite the fact that the area is geologically
Investments                                        unstable and prone to landslides. The rivers are also heavily silted by volcanic sediment,
                                                   reducing their channel capacity and causing frequent overflow. Overcrowding also increases
                                                   the risk to fire.

             These three rivers are key urban ecosystems that need careful management to ensure
             that rapid development will continue to balance between economic growth and
             ecological wellbeing. Upstream development must be controlled. On-going investments
             in waste management systems are required in order to control river pollution from
             commercial and settlement activities along the riverbanks. The Kartamantul inter-
Resilience
             administration Joint Secretariat can be beneficial and the city should take advantage
Options
             of their presence in order to address more complex disaster regimes beyond their
             administrative boundaries.

             Risk-based infrastructure investment planning options include accelerating the
             implementation of effective flooding, lahar, and landslides mitigation along the
             riverbanks; and restricting the development of hotels, restaurants, and housing along
             these areas.

             Urban infrastructure upgrading should first formulate a fire mitigation plan, specifically
             by providing fire hydrants in the most strategic and/or dense areas and improving
             accessibility for emergency response.




             Urban ecosystem management focuses on managing Yogyakarta’s watershed, by
             controlling development from the upstream to the downstream region. Comprehensive
             waste management is also required to control pollution. The city needs more green and
             open spaces to preserve the urban microclimate.




                                                                                                          57
     Yogyakarta is a major tourist attraction with a rich
     cultural heritage, as well as a center for education.
     There is opportunity here to turn the city’s three
     rivers into historic districts with environmental
     attractions. The City of Kyoto, Japan -- sister city
     to Yogyakarta -- can be the inspiration. Both cities
     are rich in cultural heritage, and both are prone
     to multiple disasters. Kyoto has several rivers
     and canals, such as the Katsura and Kamogawa
     (Kamo) rivers; the latter flows through the city and
     has been designated as cultural heritage. The
     watershed boundary area is preserved and used
     by the government as green open space and
     cyclist lane. It has become one of the city’s main
     tourist attractions.
     The Kampung development along the Code
     river serves as a starting point for Yogyakarta,
     and the community living along the rivers may
     become the center point of any redevelopment
     effort. Other rivers such as the Winongo and
     Gadjahwong rivers can follow suit. One option
     is to adopt a combination of riverbank natural
     protection on the upstream segment of the rivers,
     neighborhood upgrading on the middle segment,
     and commercial development for tourism small
     business on the lower segment. The three river
     corridors can be turned into river walks with nature
     attractions on the north, traditional kampung walks
     in the middle, and souvenir arcades in the south
     near the Palace areas.
     Riverfront redevelopment can offer both resilience
     and economic benefit more broadly for the
     community and the city.

          Making concrete resilient investment:
          Winongo Resilient River Redevelopment
          Case Study – Yogyakarta




          The aim of the Disaster and Climate Risk (DCR) Rapid
          Diagnostic is to promote evidence-based planning and
          budgeting practice, by combining technical expertise with
          community knowledge. Such a diagnostic allows decision
          makers to identify high risk areas against existing and potential
          natural hazards; this identification can help local governments
          initiate disaster preparedness and prevention mechanisms.
          The risk profile derived from the rapid diagnostic allows
          municipalities to focus on development corridors that have
          vulnerable population and assets and can improve the cities’
          overall resilience.
          This section outlines how the DCR Rapid Diagnostics
          encourages local government and stakeholders to undertake
          disaster and climate risk reduction efforts, by integrating
          resilience into on-going or planned urban investment
          in Indonesia. A case study was carried out in the City of
          Yogyakarta, where the Risk Profile produced through the DCR
          Rapid Diagnostic formed the basis for a pre-feasibility study on
          redevelopment planning along the Winongo River, identified
          by the diagnostic as a potential risk. The river redevelopment
          plan provides a clearer picture on the spatial re-arrangement
          required along the corridor. The process as presented in the
          diagram below reflects continued conversation amongst
          residents about disaster and climate risks and how to build
          resilience through investments.

     The Pre-Feasibility Study outlined, among others, the issues related to different segments of
     the river, potential themes for redevelopment, and specific potentially transformative priority
     projects. Along the Winongo River corridor, eight communities have already organized
     themselves to manage the area. Each community is part of the conceptual development and
     planning process.

As illustration, the central segments of the river have been designated as commercial areas for
community-based tourism, featuring traditional neighborhoods or “kampung” walks. Under such
plans, basic infrastructure for accessibility must be provided, and attractions as well as landscaping
further upgraded. Also required in the plan: improvements to existing embankments, construction
of pedestrian areas with proper drainage and sanitation, and development of commercial strips to
accommodate community businesses.
The Winongo Riverwalk Pre-Feasibility Study, carried out by AECOM (2014) and supported by the
World Bank, estimated between USD 94 to USD 157 million for the costs for resilient redevelopment.
This investment was estimated to bring economic benefits of between USD 30-70 million annually, or
USD 200-450 million total, capitalized at 15% over the life of the project. The calculations were based
primarily on commercial spending from tourists, and do not take into account additional benefits such
as improved health, economic productivity, flood prevention, increased property value, and improved
transit and mobility.

                                                                         Tourist Streets & Kampung Walks
                                           Certain streets should be given signage and landscape treatment to allow for these
                                           connections between the different attractions, the commercial areas and the hotels.

     According to Indonesia’s spatial planning regulations, each city is required to develop a detailed spatial
     plan at the scale of 1:5,000, including in areas with high population density such as the Winongo river
     zone. The detailed spatial plans typically outline designations of land use or zoning regulations, which
     broadly include settlement (low and high density), green open space, and river buffer zone, commercial
     areas, etc. Under the existing planning hierarchy, exceptions to the general zoning (e.g., using part green
     open space to accommodate settlements) can only be done through the development of Building and
     Neighborhood Development Plans, also known as the RTBL (Rencana Tata Bangunan dan Lingkungan).
     The RTBL provides an opportunity to codify existing spatial solutions needed for redevelopment into the
     formal spatial plan. It requires high resolution maps at scales of up to 1:2,000.
     Once a target area is identified and options for resilience selected, collaborative geospatial investigation
     is carried out by local technical agencies and community, in order to identify areas where adjustment
     and/or exception to the existing spatial plan is required to reduce the vulnerability. This exercise is called
     Collaborative Hazard Microzoning delineation.

The hazard microzoning and the Pre-Feasibility Study identified several structural measures
and environment revitalization that will help increase resiliency. This multi-discipline
analysis, involving a diverse group of experts from economists, environmentalists,
hydrologists, community development specialists, legal advocates as well as community
representatives. With the help of experts and planners, the community and the government
can manifest their vision of riverwalk redevelopment.

     Previous urban upgrading investments made along the Winongo river have provided concrete examples
     of how redevelopment on riverbank areas can increase resilience to flood and landslide risks. Figure 12
     A and B provide illustrative examples of the upgrading projects.

   The Winongo River case study in Yogyakarta demonstrates the
   case for investing in resilience, and that it can be initiated within
   the city’s existing development programs, as well as other relevant
   government investments in municipalities. The Disaster and
   Climate Risk Rapid Diagnostic has helped cities identify risks
   and select development corridors where resilient investments
   can be implemented, without necessarily creating Disaster Risk
   Management specific projects such as flood protection programs.
   Many resilience-building investments can be integrated within
   urban redevelopment spaces, such as along densely populated
   river corridors. For example, segment number 1 out of the 8
   segments within the Winongo River has been selected as a pilot
   site for the Ministry of Public Works and Housing’s National
   Slum Upgrading Program. The community-based Winongo
   Redevelopment Plan enables the city to implement investment
   plans for the designated segment. For fiscal year 2015, an
   estimated of IDR 10 billion has been allocated for Slum Upgrading
   Investment, which will improve access to basic service delivery,
   promote positive externalities of lower-income households,
   generate local income and reduce the area’s vulnerability to
   disasters risk and climate change. The Rapid Risk Diagnostic has
   provided the impetus for the city government and stakeholders
   to embark on conversation on disaster risks – and this has led to
   concrete investments towards urban resilience.

The Book was developed based on the experiences of conducting disaster
and climate risk rapid diagnostic in the cities of Balikpapan, Denpasar,
Makassar, Palembang, Semarang and Yogyakarta in Indonesia around
2013. The rapid diagnostic produced city risk profiles which were used
as dialogue and conversation tool by the city government and their
stakeholders on addressing their most significant risk through resilient
urban investment.

The Book summarizes the risk profile and resilience options in each city as
well as provide illustrative example of concrete resilient urban investment,
primarily through risk sensitive land use zoning, urban upgrading, and
ecosystem management/rehabilitation using Yogyakarta as case example.
It also serves as practical implementation in Indonesia of the World Bank’s
Building Urban Resilience in East Asia framework, 2013.
