                     UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights
                              and IFC Sustainability Framework

The objective of this analysis is to identify the convergences in IFC’s approach to human rights using the
IFC Sustainability Framework and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights:
Implementing the United Nations “Protect, Respect and Remedy” Framework (GPs).

For the purpose of this review, only the sections of the GPs specific to the private sector have been
considered, i.e., those relating to the corporate responsibility to respect (GPs 11 to 24), and those
regarding non-State-based and non-judicial grievance mechanisms that are directed at business
enterprises (GPs 29 to 31).

The analysis is carried out at two levels: at IFC’s level (IFC’s commitments are captured in the
Sustainability Policy and Access to Information Policy), and at IFC’s client’s level (client requirements are
found in the Performance Standards). The analysis confirms that IFC’s approach of assessing and
managing the environmental and social risks and impacts of its investment operations, including IFC
procedural and substantive requirement placed on its clients through the Performance Standards, is
broadly convergent with the GPs, and their emphasis on due diligence. Additional procedural guidance
and explanation on the substantive requirements can be found in the Guidance Notes accompanying the
Performance Standards.

Separately, IFC has analyzed how the updated Sustainability Framework relates to the International Bill
of Human Rights. [See “International Bill of Human Rights and IFC Sustainability Framework.”]

 A. Foundational Principles

 GP11: Business enterprises            SP ¶ 12 expresses IFC’s explicit recognition of “the responsibility of business to respect
 should respect human rights. This     human rights…[which] means to avoid infringing on the human rights of others and to

 infringing on the human rights of     this responsibility also means creating access to an effective grievance mechanism that

 with which they are involved.
                                       SP ¶ 12 also points to the human rights coverage of IFC’s Performance Standards,
                                       which support the private sector’s responsibility to respect human rights, as “[e]ach of
                                       the Performance Standards has elements related to human rights dimensions that
                                       businesses may face in the course of their operations.” [See “International Bill of
                                       Human Rights and IFC Sustainability Framework.”]

                                       PS 1 ¶ 3 recognizes for IFC clients and business enterprises generally that “[b]usiness
                                       should respect human rights, which means to avoid infringing on the human rights of
                                       others and address adverse human rights impacts business may cause or contribute
                                       to.”

                                       PS 1 ¶ 3 also states that “[e]ach of the Performance Standards has elements related to
                                       human rights dimensions that a project may face in the course of its operations. Due
                                       diligence against these Performance Standards will enable the client to address many
                                       relevant human rights issues in its project.”

                                       (For further information on avoiding and address adverse human rights impacts, see
                                       comments on GP 13.)


 GP12: The responsibility of           SP ¶ 12 footnote 4 specifies that, “[f]or purposes of this policy, IFC will be guided by the
 business enterprises to respect       International Bill of Rights and the eight core conventions of the International Labour
 human rights refers to                Organization.”

                                      PS 1 ¶ 2 acknowledges that, “[a]t times, the assessment and management of certain
                                      environmental and social risks and impacts may be the responsibility of the government
                                      or other third parties over which the client does not have control or influence” and
                                      explains that an “effective ESMS should identify the different entities involved and the
                                      roles they play, the corresponding risks they present to the client, and opportunities to
                                      collaborate with these third parties in order to help achieve environmental and social
                                      outcomes that are consistent with the Performance Standards.”

                                      PS 1 ¶ 9 further specifies that, “[i]n the event of risks and impacts in the project’s area
                                      of influence resulting from a third party’s actions, the client will address those risks and
                                      impacts in a manner commensurate with the client’s control and influence over the third
                                      parties, and with due regard to conflict of interest.”

                                      PS 1 ¶ 10 requires that, “[w]here the client can reasonably exercise control, the risks
                                      and impacts identification process will also consider those risks and impacts associated
                                      with primary supply chains.”

                                      PS 1 ¶ 22 states that, “[w]here the government or other third party has responsibility for
                                      managing specific risks and impacts and associated mitigation measures, the client will
                                      collaborate in establishing and monitoring such mitigation measures.”

                                      PS 2 elaborates provisions required for workers engaged by third parties (¶ 24-26) and
                                      extends some labor provisions (child labor, forced labor, and safety issues) to the
                                      supply chain (¶ 27-29).

                                      PS 6 ¶ 30 describes requirements for primary suppliers contributing to significant
                                      conversion of natural and/or critical habitats.


GP14: The responsibility of           SP ¶ 12 on the responsibility of business to respect human rights specifies that,
business enterprises to respect       “[c]onsistent with this responsibility, IFC undertakes due diligence of the level and

                                      PS 1 ¶ 5 requires the client to “conduct a process of environmental and social
                                      assessment, and establish and maintain an [environmental and social management
                                      system] appropriate to the nature and scale of the project and commensurate with the
                                      level of its environmental and social risks and impacts.”

                                      Similarly, PS 1 ¶ 7 requires the client to establish and maintain a process for identifying
                                      the environmental and social risks and impacts of the project. “The type, scale, and
                                      location of the project guide the scope and level of effort devoted to the risks and

                                       PS 1 ¶ 7 states that the “type, scale, and location of the project guide the scope and
                                       level of effort devoted to the risks and impacts identification process. The scope of the
                                       risks and impacts identification process will be consistent with good international
                                       industry practice, and will determine the appropriate and relevant methods and
                                       assessment tools.”

                                       PS 1 ¶ 7 additionally specifies that the “risks and impacts identification process will be
                                       based on recent environmental and social baseline data at an appropriate level of
                                       detail. The process will consider all relevant environmental and social risks and impacts
                                       of the project, including the issues identified in Performance Standards 2 through 8,
                                       and those who are likely to be affected by such risks and impacts.”

                                       PS 1 ¶ 7 footnote explicitly states that, “[i]n limited high risk circumstances, it may be
                                       appropriate for the client to complement its environmental and social risks and impacts

and the nature and context of the
operation.                            PS 1 ¶ 19 further mandates that the “process of identification of risks and impacts will
                                      consist of an adequate, accurate, and objective evaluation and presentation, prepared
                                      by competent professionals. For projects posing potentially significant adverse impacts
                                      or where technically complex issues are involved, clients may be required to involve
                                      external experts to assist in the risks and impacts identification process.”

                                      PS 1 ¶ 22 also states that, “[f]or projects with significant impacts, the client will retain
                                      external experts to verify its monitoring information.”

                                      stakeholders is addressed in many areas of the SP and PSs.

                                      SP ¶ 30 explains that, “[i]n cases where the business activity to be financed is likely to
                                      generate potential significant adverse impacts on communities (i.e., Affected
                                      Communities) or is likely to generate potential adverse impacts on Indigenous Peoples,
                                      IFC expects clients to engage in a process of Informed Consultation and Participation
                                      (ICP). In such cases, through its own investigation, IFC will determine whether the
                                      client’s community engagement is one that involves ICP and enables the participation
                                      of the Affected Communities, leading to Broad Community Support for the business
                                      activity by Affected Communities. Broad Community Support is a collection of
                                      expressions by Affected Communities, through individuals or their recognized
                                      representatives, in support of the proposed business activity… After the Board approval
                                      of the business activity, IFC continues to monitor the client’s community engagement
                                      process as part of its portfolio supervision.”

                                      SP ¶ 31 offers specific provisions when Indigenous Peoples are involved, stating that,
                                      “where a proposed business activity triggers the Performance Standard 7 requirement
                                      of Free, Prior, and Informed Consent of Indigenous Peoples, IFC will undertake an in-
                                      depth review of the process conducted by the client as part of its environmental and
                                      social due diligence.”

                                      PS 1 ¶ 22 says that, “[w]here appropriate, clients will consider involving representatives
                                      from Affected Communities to participate in monitoring activities.”

                                      PS 1 ¶ 25 describes the basic principles of Stakeholder Engagement, including a
                                      recognition that the “nature, frequency, and level of effort of stakeholder engagement
                                      may vary considerably and will be commensurate with the project’s risks and adverse
                                      impacts, and the project’s phase of development.”

                                      PS 1 ¶ 26-33 deal specifically with Stakeholder Analysis and Engagement Planning,
                                      including paragraphs specifically on Consultation (¶ 30) and Participation (¶ 31).

                                      PS 5 contains provisions for community engagement with affected communities,

                                     PS 1 ¶ 22-24 concentrate specifically on monitoring and review, detailing measures
                                     imposed on clients. Among the many provisions relevant to this GP are the following:
                                         •   “Where appropriate, clients will consider involving representatives from
                                             Affected Communities to participate in monitoring activities.” (¶ 22)
                                         •   “In addition to recording information to track performance and establishing
                                             relevant operational controls, the client should use dynamic mechanisms, such
                                             as internal inspections and audits, where relevant, to verify compliance and
                                             progress toward the desired outcomes.” (¶ 23)
                                         •   “Monitoring will normally include recording information to track performance
                                             and comparing this against the previously established benchmarks or
                                             requirements in the management program. Monitoring should be adjusted

                                         •   “The client, in collaboration with appropriate and relevant third parties, will
                                             implement these corrective and preventive actions, and follow up on these
                                             actions in upcoming monitoring cycles to ensure their effectiveness.” (¶ 23)
                                         •   “Based on results within these performance reviews, senior management will
                                             take the necessary and appropriate steps to ensure the intent of the client’s

                                      detail, including Information Routinely Made Available by IFC (¶ 16-48), Implementation
                                      Aspects of the Policy (¶ 49-69), and Monitoring and Reporting (¶ 70).

                                      PS 1 ¶ 25 states that stakeholder engagement may involve, inter alia, ongoing reporting
                                      to Affected Communities.

                                      PS 1 ¶ 34 confirms that “clients are encouraged to make publicly available periodic
                                      reports on their environmental and social sustainability.”

                                      PS 1 ¶ 36 concentrates on ongoing reporting to affected communities, specifying that
                                      the “client will provide periodic reports to the Affected Communities that describe
                                      progress with implementation of the project Action Plans on issues that involve ongoing
                                      risk to or impacts on Affected Communities and on issues that the consultation process
                                      or grievance mechanism have identified as a concern to those Communities.” Any
                                      changes to the mitigation measures or actions of the Action Plan should also be
                                      communicated.

                                      PS 1 ¶ 36 further clarifies that “[t]he frequency of these reports will be proportionate to
                                      the concerns of Affected Communities but not less than annually.”

                                      With respect to Occupational Health and Safety, PS 2 ¶ 23 requires the client to
                                      address areas that include the “documentation and reporting of occupational accidents,
                                      diseases, and incidents.”

                                      Regarding security personnel, PS 4 ¶ 14 requires the client to “report unlawful and
                                      abusive acts [of security personnel] to public authorities.”


Remediation

GP22: Where business                  SP ¶ 12 recognizes the importance of grievance mechanisms in meeting the business
enterprises identify that they have   responsibility to respect human rights: “Meeting this responsibility also means creating

impacts, they should provide for or   prompt remediation of various project-related grievances.”
cooperate in their remediation
through legitimate processes.         SP ¶ 54-57 describe the presence and function of the Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman
                                      as an independent body to accept and address complaints directed to IFC by Affected
                                      Communities. “IFC supports its clients in addressing environmental and social issues
                                      arising from their business activities by requiring them to set up and administer
                                      appropriate mechanisms and/or procedures to address related grievances and
                                      complaints from Affected Communities.” (¶ 54) “Recognizing the importance of
                                      accountability and that the concerns and complaints of Affected Communities should be
                                      addressed in a manner that is fair, objective, and constructive, a mechanism has been
                                      established through the Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman (CAO) to enable individuals
                                      and communities affected by IFC-supported business activities to raise their concerns
                                      to an independent oversight authority.” (¶ 55)

                                      PS 1 also underscores the importance of grievance mechanisms, as well as
                                      consultation and participation in remediation, in areas of stakeholder engagement (¶

                                   external communications (¶ 34), and ongoing reporting to Affected Communities (¶ 36).

                                   PS 1 ¶ 35 explicitly addresses grievance mechanisms for Affected Communities.
                                   “Where there are Affected Communities, the client will establish a grievance
                                   mechanism to receive and facilitate resolution of Affected Communities’ concerns and
                                   grievances about the client’s environmental and social performance. The grievance
                                   mechanism should be scaled to the risks and adverse impacts of the project and have
                                   Affected Communities as its primary user. It should seek to resolve concerns promptly,
                                   using an understandable and transparent consultative process that is culturally
                                   appropriate and readily accessible, and at no cost and without retribution to the party
                                   that originated the issue or concern. The mechanism should not impede access to
                                   judicial or administrative remedies. The client will inform the Affected Communities
                                   about the mechanism in the course of the stakeholder engagement process.”

                                   PS 2 ¶ 13-14 offer provisions related to workers’ organizations. PS 2 ¶ 13 supports
                                   “workers’ rights to form and to join workers’ organizations of their choosing without
                                   interference and to bargain collectively” where allowed by national law. PS 2 ¶ 14
                                   recognizes that, “[w]here national law substantially restricts workers’ organizations, the
                                   client will not restrict workers from developing alternative mechanisms to express their
                                   grievances and protect their rights regarding working conditions and terms of
                                   employment.”

                                   Additionally, PS 2 ¶ 20 explicitly addresses grievance mechanisms: “The client will
                                   provide a grievance mechanism for workers (and their organizations, where they exist)
                                   to raise workplace concerns. The client will inform the workers of the grievance
                                   mechanism at the time of recruitment and make it easily accessible to them. The
                                   mechanism should involve an appropriate level of management and address concerns
                                   promptly, using an understandable and transparent process that provides timely
                                   feedback to those concerned, without any retribution. The mechanism should also allow
                                   for anonymous complaints to be raised and addressed. The mechanism should not
                                   impede access to other judicial or administrative remedies that might be available under
                                   the law or through existing arbitration procedures, or substitute for grievance
                                   mechanisms provided through collective agreements.”

                                   With respect to security personnel, PS 4 ¶ 12 requires the client to “provide a grievance
                                   mechanism for Affected Communities to express concerns about the security
                                   arrangements and acts of security personnel.”

                                   PS5 ¶ 11 also specifically requires the client to establish a grievance mechanism
                                   consistent with PS 1 regarding land acquisition and involuntary resettlement.

                                   PS 7 ¶10 requires the client to “undertake an engagement process with the Affected
                                   Communities of Indigenous Peoples as required in Performance Standard 1. This
                                   engagement process includes stakeholder analysis and engagement planning,
                                   disclosure of information, consultation, and participation, in a culturally appropriate
                                   manner. In addition, this process will:
                                        •   Involve Indigenous Peoples’ representative bodies and organizations (e.g.,
                                            councils of elders or village councils), as well as members of the Affected
                                            Communities of Indigenous Peoples; and
                                        •   Provide sufficient time for Indigenous Peoples’ decision-making processes.”

                                     sound environmental and social performance. The policy provides a framework for the
                                     environmental and social assessment and management process, and specifies that the
                                     project (or business activities, as appropriate) will comply with the applicable laws and
                                     regulations of the jurisdictions in which it is being undertaken, including those laws
                                     implementing host country obligations under international law. The policy should be
                                     consistent with the principles of the Performance Standards. Under some
                                     circumstances, clients may also subscribe to other internationally recognized
                                     standards, certification schemes, or codes of practice and these too should be included
                                     in the policy.”

                                     PS 1 ¶ 15 specifies that, “[w]here the identified risks and impacts cannot be avoided,
                                     the client will identify mitigation and performance measures and establish
                                     corresponding actions to ensure the project will operate in compliance with applicable
                                     laws and regulations.”

                                     PS 2 Objectives include to “promote compliance with national employment and labor
                                     laws.”

                                     PS 2 ¶ 8 requires that human resources policies and procedures are “appropriate to its
                                     size and workforce” and “consistent with the requirements of this Performance
                                     Standard and national law.”

                                     PS 2 ¶ 9 states that “the client will provide workers with documented information that is
                                     clear and understandable, regarding their rights under national labor and employment
                                     law and any applicable collective agreements.”

                                     PS 2 ¶ 10 provides for reasonable working conditions and terms of employment.
                                     Footnote 6 suggests that “[r]easonable working conditions and terms of employment
                                     could be assessed by reference to [inter alia,]… conditions established by national law.”

                                     PS 2 ¶ 13 confirms that, “[i]n countries where national law recognizes workers’ rights to
                                     form and to join workers’ organizations of their choosing without interference and to
                                     bargain collectively, the client will comply with national law. Where national law
                                     substantially restricts workers’ organizations, the client will not restrict workers from
                                     developing alternative mechanisms to express their grievances and protect their rights
                                     regarding working conditions and terms of employment.”

                                     PS 2 ¶ 16 similarly requires that, “[i]n countries where national law provides for non-
                                     discrimination in employment, the client will comply with national law. When national
                                     laws are silent on non-discrimination in employment, the client will meet this
                                     Performance Standard. In circumstances where national law is inconsistent with this
                                     Performance Standard, the client is encouraged to carry out its operations consistent
                                     with the intent of paragraph 15 above without contravening applicable laws.”

                                     PS 2 ¶ 17 further clarifies that “[s]pecial measures of protection or assistance to remedy
                                     past discrimination or selection for a particular job based on the inherent requirements
                                     of the job will not be deemed as discrimination, provided they are consistent with
                                     national law.”

                                     PS 2 ¶ 19 specifies that the client “should ensure that all workers receive notice of
                                     dismissal and severance payments mandated by law and collective agreements in a
                                     timely manner.”

                                     PS 2 ¶ 20 outlines that the “[grievance] mechanism should not impede access to other
                                     judicial or administrative remedies that might be available under the law or through

minors, the client will follow those laws applicable to the client.”

PS 3 ¶ 10 refers to “national law, or where this is silent, with GIIP” regarding pollution
prevention. PS 3 ¶ 12 footnote 15 further specifies that “[t]ransboundary movement of
hazardous materials should be consistent with national, regional and international law,
including the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of
Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal and the London Convention on the Prevention
of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter.”

PS 4 ¶ 12 on security personnel says that “the client will be guided by the principles of
proportionality and good international practice in relation to hiring, rules of conduct,
training, equipping, and monitoring of such workers, and by applicable law.”
Additionally, PS 4 ¶ 12 footnote 3 explicitly specifies that practice should be “consistent
with the United Nation’s (UN) Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, and UN
Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials.”

PS 5 ¶ 5 footnote 6 clarifies that land rights or land use rights “also applies to
customary or traditional rights recognized or recognizable under the laws of the host
country. The negotiations may be carried out by the government or by the company (in
some circumstances, as an agent of the government).”

PS 5 ¶ 12 footnote 17 provides that, “[w]here national law and tenure systems do not
recognize the rights of women to hold or contract in property, measures should be
considered to provide women as much protection as possible with the objective to
achieve equity with men.”

PS 5 ¶ 17 defines displaced persons as persons, inter alia, “who do not have formal
legal rights to land or assets, but have a claim to land that is recognized or recognizable
under national law.”

PS 5 ¶ 24 requires that “[f]orced evictions will not be carried out except in accordance
with law and the requirements of this Performance Standard.” PS 5 ¶ 24 footnote 23
defines “forced evictions” as the “permanent or temporary removal against the will of
individuals, families, and/or communities from the homes and/or lands which they
occupy without the provision of, and access to, appropriate forms of legal and other
protection.”

PS 5 ¶ 31 specifies that the client will need to include in its Supplemental Resettlement
Plan, inter alia, “a description of regulated activities, including the entitlements of
displaced persons provided under applicable national laws and regulations.”

PS 7 ¶ 2 footnote 1 states that, “[i]n addition to meeting the requirements under this
Performance Standard, clients must comply with applicable national law, including
those laws implementing host country obligations under international law.”

PS 7 ¶ 13 clarifies that, “[w]hile Indigenous Peoples may not possess legal title to these
lands as defined by national law, their use of these lands, including seasonal or cyclical
use, for their livelihoods, or cultural, ceremonial, and spiritual purposes that define their
identity and community, can often be substantiated and documented.”

PS 7 ¶ 14 requires the client to “[e]nsure that Affected Communities of Indigenous
Peoples are informed of their land rights under national law, including any national law
recognizing customary use rights.”

PS 7 ¶ 15 footnote 12 acknowledges that, regarding communally held lands, that
“[t]ypically, Indigenous Peoples claim rights and access to, and use of land and
resources through traditional or customary systems, many of which entail communal
property rights. These traditional claims to land and resources may not be recognized
under national laws.”

PS 7 ¶ 17 states that, “[w]here a project proposes to use the cultural heritage including
knowledge, innovations, or practices of Indigenous Peoples for commercial purposes,
the client will inform the Affected Communities of Indigenous Peoples of (i) their rights
under national law.”


                                                                                 12
                                       PS 7 ¶ 19 requires that the “determination, delivery, and distribution of compensation
                                       and other benefit sharing measures to the Affected Communities of Indigenous Peoples
                                       will take account of the laws, institutions, and customs of these communities as well as
                                       their level of interaction with mainstream society.”

                                       PS 8 ¶ 6 specifies that, “[i]n addition to complying with applicable law on the protection
                                       of cultural heritage, including national law implementing the host country’s obligations
                                       under the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural
                                       Heritage, the client will identify and protect cultural heritage by ensuring that
                                       internationally recognized practices for the protection, field-based study, and
                                       documentation of cultural heritage are implemented.”

                                       PS 8 ¶ 15 confirms that “[l]egally protected cultural heritage areas are important for the
                                       protection and conservation of cultural heritage, and additional measures are needed
                                       for any projects that would be permitted under the applicable national law in these
                                       areas.”

                                       PS 8 ¶ 16 requires that, “[w]here a project proposes to use the cultural heritage,
                                       including knowledge, innovations, or practices of local communities for commercial
                                       purposes, the client will inform these communities of [inter alia] … their rights under
                                       national law.”


GP24: Where it is necessary to         SP ¶ 3 footnote 1 and PS 1 ¶ 1 footnote 2 take account of the severity of impacts as
prioritize actions to address actual   part of the definition of environmental and social risks.
and potential adverse human
rights impacts, business               SP ¶ 6 underscores that the specific requirements in the PSs are designed to help
enterprises should first seek to       clients improve their E&S performance through a risk and outcomes based approach,
prevent and mitigate those that        and that, “[c]entral to these requirements is the application of a mitigation hierarchy to

response would make them               or where avoidance is not possible, to minimize, and where residual impacts remain,
irremediable.                          compensate/offset for the risks and impacts, as appropriate.”

                                       PS 1 ¶ 13-16 outline the management programs required of the client, including a
                                       mitigation hierarchy to address identified risks and impacts, which “will favor the
                                       avoidance of impacts over minimization, and, where residual impacts remain,
                                       compensate[e]/offset, wherever technically and financially feasible.”

                                       PS 1 ¶ 22 states that, “[w]here the government or other third party has responsibility for
                                       managing specific risks and impacts and associated mitigation measures, the client will
                                       collaborate in establishing and monitoring such mitigation measures.”

                                       In PS 1, mitigation measures are also discussed generally, with respect to emergency
                                       preparedness and response (PS 1 ¶ 20), monitoring and review (PS 1 ¶ 22), disclosure
                                       of information (PS 1 ¶ 29), consultation (PS 1 ¶ 30), participation (PS 1 ¶ 31), ongoing
                                       reporting (PS 1 ¶ 36), and supply chain (PS 1 ¶ 38).

                                       PS 4 ¶ 5 requires that the client “identify risks and impacts and propose mitigation
                                       measures that are commensurate with their nature and magnitude. These measures
                                       will favor the avoidance of risks and impacts over minimization.”

                                       PS 5 ¶ 2 maintains that “involuntary resettlement should be avoided. However, where
                                       involuntary resettlement is unavoidable, it should be minimized and appropriate
                                       measures to mitigate adverse impacts on displaced persons and host communities
                                       should be carefully planned and implemented.”

                                       PS 7 ¶ 18-20 outline requirements for mitigation and development with respect to
                                       Indigenous Peoples.

 grievance mechanisms, both
 State-based and non-State-           See also the Guidelines of the IFC/MIGA Compliance Advisor Ombudsman, which is
 based, should be:                    IFC’s independent accountability mechanism.
   (a) Legitimate: enabling trust
 from the stakeholder groups for
 whose use they are intended,
 and being accountable for the
 fair conduct of grievance
 processes;
   (b) Accessible: being known to
 all stakeholder groups for whose
 use they are intended, and
 providing adequate assistance
 for those who may face particular
 barriers to access;
   (c) Predictable: providing a
 clear and known procedure with
 an indicative timeframe for each
 stage, and clarity on the types of
 process and outcome available
 and means of monitoring
 implementation;
   (d) Equitable: seeking to
 ensure that aggrieved parties
 have reasonable access to
 sources of information, advice
 and expertise necessary to
 engage in a grievance process
 on fair, informed and respectful
 terms;


                                                                                                                14
  (e) Transparent: keeping
parties to a grievance informed
about its progress, and providing
sufficient information about the
mechanism’s performance to
build confidence in its
effectiveness and meet any
public interest at stake;
  (f) Rights-compatible: ensuring
that outcomes and remedies
accord with internationally
recognized human rights;
  (g) A source of continuous
learning: drawing on relevant
measures to identify lessons for
improving the mechanism and
preventing future grievances and
harms;

Operational-level mechanisms
should also be:
  (h) Based on engagement and
dialogue: consulting the
stakeholder groups for whose
use they are intended on their
design and performance, and
focusing on dialogue as the
means to address and resolve
grievances.
