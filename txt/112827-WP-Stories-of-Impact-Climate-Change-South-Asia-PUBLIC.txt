In the last three years, IFC South Asia
has committed around $800 million
in climate-related investments. This
represents close to 21 percent of its
total commitments.

During the same period, IFC has spent
around $14 million (nearly 18 percent
of our total program spending) in
advisory services-related engagements
promoting climate-smart initiatives.
This strategy has already led to the
achievement of significant impacts.

IFC worked on defining an innovative
structure that would address the
challenges of developing the solar
rooftop market.

IFC, large third-party developers
own the solar generation systems
installed on the rooftops of public

advantage of this model is that
the third party developer is a
specialized solar industry player with
a better understanding of the solar
photo-voltaic systems, thus ensuring             IFC is helping Gujarat in implementing a pilot solar rooftop project on public
