In order to meet the growing Indonesian demand for electricity, while also constraining
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, future coal power plants may have to include CO2 capture
equipment with storage of that CO2. This study set out to define and evaluate the conditions
under which fossil fuel power plants could be deemed as carbon capture and storage (CCS)
ready (CCS-R). It considers the technical, economic and institutional implications of CO2
capture and storage for candidate power plants in South Sumatra and West Java. The
potential to sell captured CO2 for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) in South Sumatra is
reviewed.
Key findings are:
   A technically feasible process for CO2 capture (post-combustion) has been identified
     for use in existing plants (through retrofitting);
   To be capture-ready, a power plant’s design would need to recognize future
     implementation of CO2 capture and reserve space for additional equipment;
   CO2 capture would involve a large loss of electricity output from the power plant;
   There is sufficient storage capacity for CO2 in depleted gas wells for the cases studied;
   In the long term CCS would become constrained by available CO2 storage capacity;
   The cost of electricity would about double with the addition of full CCS, which would
     cost about US$100 per tonne of CO2 emission avoided;
   Assessment of partial CO2 capture indicated that the cost per tonne of CO2 captured
     would increase, due to sub-optimal use of equipment;
   Coal-fired power with full CCS is comparable in cost to geothermal power generation
     in Indonesia;
   The South Sumatra power plant is well placed to take advantage of EOR opportunities,
     but the West Java power plant is not;
   A co-benefit of the installation of CO2 capture is a reduction in emission of local
     pollutants; and
   Policy recognition and institutional support is a key barrier to CCS implementation in
     Indonesia.
Recommendations are:
   CCS enabling policy incentives and a supportive regulatory environment should be
     created;
   Measures to bridge the financial viability gap and improve confidence in the
     technology should be pursued; and
   Capacity building and CCS awareness initiatives should be undertaken.

The purpose of this study is to support institutional capacity building for PT Perusahaan Listrik
Negara (PLN), the national electric utility in Indonesia, and the Government of Indonesia (GoI)
by developing awareness and expertise in the area of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the
power sector. CCS on fossil fuel power plants provides an opportunity to help the government
to meet both its long term energy needs and commitments beyond its non-binding target1 to
reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 26 percent by 2020.
Indonesia’s growing economy is demanding increased electricity generation capacity, which is
predominantly based on coal as the least cost fuel for base load electricity generation.
Indonesia’s electricity outlook is that demand will increase by 8 percent per year over the
decade from 2015 to 2024, with ongoing future growth. Thus, CO2 emissions from the power
sector are projected to increase substantially. This study identifies a way to reduce CO2
emissions from the power sector in the long run, thus making a significant contribution to the
sustainability of the power sector’s development path.
In order to meet the GoI’s goal of improved energy supply and security, while also constraining
CO2 emissions, future coal plants may have to include CO2 capture equipment with CO2 storage.
This study set out to define and evaluate the conditions under which fossil fuel power plants
could be deemed as CCS-Ready (CCS-R). This study also presents PLN and related
stakeholders with the technical, economic and institutional implications of CCS
implementation in the power sector, based on post-combustion capture, which is the only
practical technology for retrofitting to the candidate power plants. In addition, this study
assesses Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) 2 as a potential cost-offsetting mechanism for CCS
projects in the power sector.

This study of CCS in Indonesia’s power sector is based on analysis of two candidate power
plant designs: a 2x1000 MW lignite-fired power plant in West Java, using coal from or
Kalimantan or Sumatra and a 1x600 MW power plant in South Sumatra located near a coal
mine. These two power plants are assumed to be commissioned in 2020 and 2022, respectively.

A CCS reference case is evaluated for each power plant based on separation of 90 percent of
the CO2 from the power plant flue gas with a commercially proven amine scrubbing process,
supported by flue gas cleaning processes, and liquefaction of the captured CO2 for
transportation to geological storage locations. As a step-off from the reference case, partial
capture of CO2 is evaluated. For example, 90 percent capture of CO2 from half of the flue gas
would result in 45 percent capture.

The reference cases are based on implementation of CCS in 2025 in West Java and 2027 in
South Sumatra, respectively (i.e., five years after the commissioning of the power plants). The

 EOR is an established technique for enhancing the production of oil from an aging oil well by injecting dense
phase CO2 to improve the mobility of oil deposits in porous rock and to displace oil towards a production well.

CCS operation would then run for 20 years, being the remainder of the power plant design life
of 25 years. The economic assessment reference case is based on CCS being built with no
delay, for comparability with other technologies. Longer CCS implementation delays are also
assessed.

                            KEY FINDINGS OF THE STUDY


1.     A technically feasible process for CO2 capture has been identified.

The retrofitted capture of CO2 from power plant flue gas requires as little impact as possible
on the existing power plant. However, retrofitting limits the choice of CO2 capture process to
chemical absorption from the flue gas at atmospheric pressure. The use of monoethanolamine
(MEA) as the chemical absorption reagent is a commercially proven process that is usually
considered for bulk CO2 removal in CCS applications.

The MEA process requires a large amount of low-grade heat. This is the primary energy penalty
associated with CO2 capture. That heat is supplied as low pressure steam extracted from the
power plant steam cycle, which reduces the amount of electricity generated by the host power
plant.

Another requirement for the MEA process is for the feed gas to be clean to avoid degrading
the MEA solvent. Additional acid gas removal equipment must therefore accompany the MEA
stripping process. Hence, a side effect of CO2 capture would be a major reduction in the
environmental emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulates
from coal use.

2.     Both plants can be considered as capture-ready as long as enough space is reserved
       and the plant design recognizes future CO2 capture.

The additional requirements to make the coal power plants CCS-Ready would have a
significant impact on the power plant site layout, which will require the power plant to have
sufficient extra land allocated for future installation of CO2 capture equipment; however, there
would be very little impact on the capital cost of the host power plant prior to implementation
of CO2 capture. No major changes to the host power plant would be required for post-
combustion capture. However, recognition at the detailed equipment design stage of the
likelihood for future retrofitting of CO2 capture may give rise to exercising options and
developing innovations to ease the later retrofitting of CO2 capture. Other than potential
additional land acquisition, the up-front cost of making a power plant CCS-ready would be
minor and within the power plant budgeting contingency. Substantial costs would not be
incurred until CCS is implemented.

3.       CO2 capture processes would incur a considerable energy penalty resulting in a
         lower net capacity of the plant.

The reduction in power output is estimated at 27.5 percent and 30.8 percent for the large West
Java plant and the smaller South Sumatra plant, respectively; at 90 percent capture. This energy
penalty is especially challenging in the current power sector environment where generation
expansion is a priority.

4.       CCS will require sizeable investments, especially on the capture side, raising the
         base plant investment cost by more than 50 percent.
Implementation of 90 percent CO2 capture in the West Java power plant would have an
estimated incremental capital investment of about US$1.68 billion and annual operating cost
of about US$182 million. For the South Sumatra power plant, the incremental capital cost
would be US$743 million with an annual operating cost of US$65 million.

5.       Sufficient storage capacity in depleted gas fields has been identified in West Java
         for CO2 from the West Java plant and in South Sumatra for CO2 from the local
         plant.

After a gas well has ceased production it may become available for the storage of CO2. A
survey of the potential storage capacity of large depleted and depleting gas fields in South
Sumatra and West Java is reported in Table ES 1.

                                                                  Millions of tonnes of CO2

The CO2 captured from the 600MW South Sumatra power plant at 90 percent capture over 20
years would be a total of 74 million tonnes. That would occupy 14 percent of the gas field
storage capacity in South Sumatra. The remaining gas field storage capacity in South Sumatra
would only be sufficient to accommodate CO2 from a further 3,750 MW of similar nominal
power generation capacity.
The CO2 captured from the 2000 MW West Java power plant at 90 percent capture over 20
years would be a total of 218 million tonnes of CO2. There is just sufficient off-shore gas field
storage in West Java to accommodate all of that CO2.

 Tonne (t), also known as metric ton, is a unit of mass equal to 1000 kilograms (equivalent to approximately
2,204.6 pounds, 1.10 tons (US), or 0.984 tons (imperial).

                                                       3
6.       Storage capacity for CO2 in deep aquifers is large but uncertain.

Liquid CO2 can, in principle, be stored in any deep porous rock that is overlain by impervious
rock. At underground conditions it would become a supercritical fluid.4 Deep aquifer storage
potential is assessed at 10 times gas field storage in South Sumatra and West Java. However,
permanent storage of CO2 would be less certain and more costly.

7.       Eventually CCS would become constrained by available CO2 storage capacity.
In the long term, mandatory application of CCS to all projected new coal-fired power plants in
South Sumatra would result in on-shore geological storage of CO2 in gas fields becoming full
by about 2050 and extension of storage into deep aquifers becoming capacity-constrained by
2100.

8.       Pipeline networks have been devised to transport CO2 from the power plants to
         storage sites.
Figure ES 1 shows a scheme for delivering CO2 from the West Java power plant to depleted
off-shore gas fields north of West Java, which are nearer and have more capacity than on-shore
fields.

The South Sumatra power plant is located within the oil and gas producing region of South
Sumatra, so pipelines would be much shorter and would be on-shore.

  CO2 above 73.9 bar pressure and above 31.1oC is a supercritical fluid with properties similar to a liquid but
without surface tension effects, so that it behaves like a gas. Supercritical CO2 is a benign solvent.

9.       At 90 percent capture, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is estimated at 15.4
         and 15.5 US cents per kilowatt hour (kWh), translating to a net incremental cost
         of CCS at 7.9 and 9.1 US cents per kWh for the West Java and South Sumatra
         power plants, respectively (Figure ES 2).

11.     On an LCOE basis, coal-fired plants with CCS are comparable with plants of
        similar scale and level of CO2 emissions.

At 90 percent capture, the LCOE of the South Sumatra power plant, at 15.5 US cents per kWh,
is comparable to the newly-set ceiling price for large-scale geothermal in 2022 at 14.6 US cents
per kWh. At 45 percent capture, the LCOE of the South Sumatra power plant, at 11.2 US cents
per kWh, is competitive with a base-load combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant with
liquefied natural gas (LNG) at an estimated 12 US cents per kWh.5

12.     The cost of CCS is equivalent to about US$100/tonne of CO2 emission avoided
        (Figure ES 4).

The cost of net CO2 emission avoided is calculated on the basis of the same quantity of net
electricity delivered to the transmission grid with and without CCS.

13.     Lower capture percentage and/or delayed implementation will reduce the
        incremental cost of CCS, albeit at the expense of higher CO2 emissions.

Reducing the capture percentage from 90 to 45 percent, or delaying CCS implementation by
five years from plant commissioning, would halve the net incremental cost of CCS.

14.     Enhanced Oil Recovery is an attractive cost-offsetting mechanism (Figure ES 5).

A small amount of EOR revenue (an equivalent of under US$10 per tCO2 at the gate of the
plant) would be required to bring: (a) the LCOE of the South Sumatra plant with 90 percent

        accommodate CO2 from West Java (Table ES 2).

There would be sufficient EOR demand in South Sumatra, which is all on-shore, to
accommodate the CO2 captured from the South Sumatra power plant, as well as low cost CO2
sources, but not enough to accommodate CO2 from West Java.

16.       The South Sumatra power plant is well placed to take advantage of EOR
          opportunities is South Sumatra, whereas the West Java power plant is not.

EOR provides revenues, transfers the costs and liabilities associated with CO2 storage, and
demonstrates CO2 injection technology. However, the ability for the host plants to take
advantage of EOR opportunities is uncertain due to:
         Limited demand and competing supplies of CO2 for EOR;
         Peak demand for CO2 for EOR at an oil field is for a short period;
         Uncertain willingness-to-pay from EOR operators due to oil price fluctuations; and
         The cost of CO2 delivery from sources that are a long distances from the EOR site.

17.       Policy recognition and institutional support is a key barrier for CCS
          implementation in Indonesia.

Institutional readiness for CCS in the power sector requires national climate policy support and
concerted efforts across CO2 capture, transportation and storage (Figure ES 6). Each process
requires the facilitation of appropriate institutional, legal and regulatory frameworks to govern
the structure, operations, ownership, management and monitoring of the process.

18.       All of the above institutional support mechanisms need to be established.

For CCS to contribute to Indonesia’s CO2 reduction targets in 10 years’ time, planned power
plants need to include CCS-readiness provisions. To define those CCS-ready provisions, the
regulatory environment needs to be in place. To build the regulatory environment, the policy
framework needs to be established. Hence, there is urgency for institutional support
mechanisms to be established.

Creating an enabling policy and regulatory environment
•   National climate policy to recognize CCS in the power sector as a means of CO2
    emission reduction;
•   Endorsement of the CCS Road Map, which included the power sector at the national
    level; and
•   Concerted efforts along the CCS value chain: CO2 capture, transportation and storage.

Bridging the technical and financial viability gap
•   Consider adding CCS-Readiness Provisions (such as space provisions and design
    modifications) in the Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) of future Independent Power
    Producer power plants;
•   Provide policy incentives for future CCS implementation;
•   GoI to initiate CCS pilot and demonstration activities for the power sector; and
•   Power sector inclusion in the CCS Road Map.

Awareness and capacity building

Develop an Indonesian Canter of Excellence in CCS technology that is purpose tasked to:

       Build technical and economic assessment capability;
       Develop technologies to suit Indonesian conditions;
       Run workshops to encourage wide understanding of potential and limitations of
        CCS; and
       Encourage public acceptance of CCS technologies.

1.       INTRODUCTION

1.1 Study objectives

This Analytical and Advisory Assistance (AAA) project is supporting institutional capacity
building for PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (Persero), (PLN), which is the sole national electric
utility in Indonesia, and the Government of Indonesia in developing Carbon Capture and
Storage awareness and expertise. In the longer term, this assistance will support Indonesia in
reducing carbon dioxide emissions from its fossil fuel power generation sector and will
contribute significantly to putting the country’s energy sector on a sustainable development
path while improving energy security. The focus is to assess the implications of deployment of
CCS to increase confidence that introducing CCS-readiness to future fossil power plants will
ensure that subsequent CCS retrofit is practicable.
Another objective is to examine whether the supply of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery is a
potential means of lowering CCS costs and potentially aiding project financial feasibility.
Specifically, this project has three major objectives:
        To assist PLN with economic, technical, operational and environmental analysis of the
         implications of CCS-readiness for two selected coal-power plants;
        To explore the enhanced oil recovery market and other geological CO2 storage capacity
         to assess their adequacy for accommodating captured CO2; and
        To strengthen the stakeholders’ CCS capacity by disseminating study findings through
         workshops and training.

1.2 Definition of CCS-Readiness
CCS-readiness is a planning tool used to provide a structured means of assessing a power plant
design in order to ensure that there are no insurmountable barriers to subsequent retrofitting of
the complete CCS train at some time in the future when CCS implementation may be required
due to changed economic or regulatory circumstances. CCS-R involves capture-readiness,
transport-readiness and storage-readiness to ensure that any potential barriers to successful
implementation of a complete CCS scheme are identified and resolved at an early stage.
For the power plant component, capture-readiness requires a technically and economically
feasible CO2 capture outline design to be established. The power plant layout should allocate
space and connection facilities for the possibility of future addition of CO2 capture equipment.
For transport-readiness, a technically and economically feasible transport method needs to be
established. A practical transport route with accessible rights-of-way between the power plant
location and the storage location should be identified.
For storage-readiness one or more storage sites need to be identified that are technically capable
of, and commercially accessible for, timely geological storage of the large volumes of captured
CO2 for the projected lifetime of the CCS scheme. Adequate capacity, injectivity (i.e., adequate
porosity to permit a high rate of injection of CO2 without fracturing the formation), and CO2
storage integrity should be shown to exist at the storage site. Any potentially conflicting land
use issues should be identified.

                                               10
For all CCS stages, the requirements for environmental, safety and other approvals need to be
identified. Public awareness and engagement activities need to be considered. The CCS-
readiness status should be regularly reviewed, improved and documented over time. The
United Kingdom (UK) has developed a set of CCS-R guidelines that are included, for reference,
in Annex 1.

1.3 Structure of the study
In the Background chapter, the energy scene in Indonesia is described, identifying the need for
rapid expansion of electricity generation infrastructure and the energy resources available to
meet that need. Indonesia’s commitment to addressing CO2 emissions are described, which
highlight a role for CCS. The issue of the potential impact of exploitation of the Natuna gas
field on Indonesia’s CO2 emissions inventory is also introduced.
In the Study Basis chapter, the selection of candidate lignite-fired coal power plants in West
Java and South Sumatra for CCS-R assessment is explained and the key features of those
nominal host power plants are listed. Scenarios that would give rise to the need to implement
CCS are discussed and the rationale for the assessment scenarios is set out. A comparison with
the alternative use of geothermal or natural gas-fired power generation as a means of reducing
CO2 emissions is quantified.
In the Capture Study chapter, the technology for post-combustion capture of CO2 with
conventional MEA is described and assessed. Processes for preconditioning of flue gas are
discussed and evaluated. Processes for conditioning and compression of the captured CO2 are
also discussed. Alternative CO2 capture processes are investigated. Operating cost parameters
and capital cost data for elements of the CO2 capture process are listed.
The Transportation Study chapter comprises two parts: transmission and distribution.
Transmission relates to bulk pipelining of CO2 from the power plants to distribution hubs local
to the CO2 storage locations. Distribution relates to the delivery of CO2 from the distribution
hubs to the CO2 injection points. CO2 transportation cost data are determined.
In the Storage Study chapter a review of opportunities for geological storage of CO2 is carried
out. The potential storage of CO2 in depleted gas fields in West Java and South Sumatra is
assessed. An outline discussion of the scope for CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers is presented.
Estimates of CO2 injection costs are also presented.
In the EOR Market Review chapter, the potential demand for CO2 for EOR is assessed and
compared with the scope for that market to be satisfied with low-cost by-product CO2 from
sources other than CCS.
The Incremental Cost Analysis chapter includes an assessment of the cost of the coal power
plants with complete CCS trains in terms of levelized cost of electricity and US$/tonne of CO2
captured and emission avoided, based on data for elements of the CCS process train determined
in this study. The impacts of timing of CCS implementation and partial reduction of CO2
capture fraction are also considered.
In the Institutional Readiness chapter, the need for policy mechanisms and supportive
regulatory frameworks for the CCS value chain are identified and discussed. Issues of CCS-

                                               11
readiness with respect to Power Purchase Agreements with Independent Power Producers (IPPs)
to build coal-fired power plants in Indonesia are also discussed. Recommendations for PLN
and the GoI are made.

1.4 Worldwide CCS projects

Sixteen of the 22 large-scale CCS projects worldwide that are in operation, or under
construction in 2014 use, or will use, the captured CO2 primarily for EOR. However, only three
of those are coal-fired power generation projects; the others are natural gas processing plants
and industrial processes. EOR with CO2 can make CCS demonstration projects economically
viable. This approach, known as Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS), is most
evident in regions of mature oil extraction such as North America, the Middle East and China,
where market opportunities to utilize CO2 as a commodity with value are strongest (GCCSI,
2014).
The other six active CCS projects involve dedicated geological storage of CO2 without EOR
revenue. All of these projects source CO2 from natural gas processing operations or industrial
operations where the production of a pure CO2 stream is a necessary part of that industrial
process, so the marginal cost and energy penalty of CO2 capture are not great.
A further 33 large-scale CCS projects are at an advanced stage of concept planning or at an
earlier stage of evaluation. Of these 33 potential CCS projects, only four (in China, South Korea,
Scotland and the Netherlands) involve demonstration of post-combustion capture of CO2 from
a power generation unsupported by EOR. All of those four projects anticipate operation at a
demonstration scale of about one million tonnes of CO2 per year by 2020 (GCCSI 2014).

2.1 Domestic energy growth

Indonesia’s growing economy is pushing up domestic energy consumption. Indonesia has
sustained an economic growth of about 6 percent per annum over the past five to eight years
(IMF, 2014), and this has been increasing the total primary energy consumption by an average
of about 5 percent per annum over the same period (BP, 2014). Primary energy consumption
in 2013 was 43 percent higher than a decade earlier. The national energy mix of consumption
in 2013 was dominated by oil at 43 percent, coal at 33 percent and natural gas at 19 percent,
with non-fossil fuels at only 4 percent (excluding biomass and biofuel). Figure 2-1 shows the
progression of primary energy consumption in Indonesia up to 2013 (MEMR, 2014).

Over the decade from 2003 to 2013, coal has gained more importance in Indonesia’s mix of
primary energy resources for domestic consumption. Coal use has increased by 150 percent
from about 165 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE)6 (~39 million tonnes per year) to
about 411 MMBOE (~98 million tonnes per year). In comparison, oil and gas consumption as
primary energy resources have both increased by about 20 percent: oil from about 456
MMBOE to about 546 MMBOE, and domestic natural gas consumption from about 204
MMBOE (1.31 trillion standard cubic feet [Tcf]) to about 243 MMBOE (1.56 Tcf), after a peak
in 2010 (Figure 2-2).

In terms of primary energy production, the tonnage of coal mined has nearly quadrupled
between 2003 and 2013 from 104 million tonnes to 407 million tonnes. More than three
quarters of coal produced was exported to the international market in 2013. Over the same
period, annual production of natural gas ranged between 2.8 Tcf and 3.4 Tcf, and has decreased
within this range in the last three years. Nearly half of the gas production is exported as LNG
to international buyers. Oil production has declined over the same period, from 1148 thousand
barrels per day in 2003 to 824 thousand barrels per day in 2013. About 40 percent of oil used
in Indonesia was net imported in 2013.

2.2 Domestic power generation mix

The domestic power generation mix is dominated by fossil fuels. As shown in Figure 2-2, the
contribution from the non-fossil sources of hydro and geothermal is small. PLN’s electricity
production in 2013 was 164 terawatt hours (TWh) -- comprising 147 TWh produced from
fossils, 13 TWh from hydro power and 4 TWh from geothermal -- while the contribution from
other renewables, such as wind power, was a very small 0.005 TWh. Thus, non-fossil electricity
only contributed 10.7 percent of the total production.

During 2013, PLN also purchased an additional 52 TWh of electricity from IPPs; 69 percent
from large coal-fired power plants, 13 percent from smaller gas-fired plants, 10 percent from
geothermal plants and 8 percent from hydropower and other renewables plants. With IPPs in
the total power generation mix, the contribution of renewables was about 12 percent in 2013.



                                                                                       14
2.3 Indonesia’s electricity outlook

The electricity demand in Indonesia is primarily driven by the economy and population growth,
at an average of 6 percent and 1.2 percent per year, respectively, and also increasing
urbanization. In anticipation of the rising demand, and also as mandated by the prevailing law
and regulations, PLN, Indonesia’s only state-owned utility responsible for most of the national
power generation capacity, prepares a 10-year power capacity development plan referred to as
the Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL, 2015). According to the RUPTL 2015-2024,
electricity consumption of PLN’s consumers throughout the country will increase by 8.42
percent per year, going from 219 TWh in 2015 to 464 TWh in 2024. To meet this growing
demand, in RUPTL PLN lists all power projects as well as transmission and substation projects
over a period of 10 years.
Presidential Decree No. 71/2006 launched the First Phase of the Fast Track Program (FTP I)
with the goal of building 10 GW of additional capacity. The decree specifically required PLN
to build coal-fired plants for two major reasons: firstly, oil fuel costs more than coal fuel (nine
times more at the peak in 2008); and secondly, there is an abundance of coal reserves in
Indonesia. Identified coal reserves in 2013 totaled 28 billion tonnes of sub-bituminous coal and
lignite (BP, 2014). Potential coal resource totaled about 120 billion tonnes in 2013, with 24
measured, 36 inferred and 33 hypothetical (WEC, 2013). The majority of power projects under
the 10 GW of coal power projects selected in 2006 for a fast track capacity development
program have been completed.
In 2010, Presidential Decree No. 04/2010 launched the Second Phase of the Fast Track
Program (FTP II) with the goal of procuring an additional 9.5 GW of renewable energy, gas
and coal-fired plant capacity. The 9.5 GW of power projects in FTP II were selected from the
list of potential projects originally identified by PLN in RUPTL-2010. By putting the projects
into FTP II, they are now recognized as the projects that will get government support in their
implementation.
In FTP I, the project list was fixed by Presidential Decree. In FTP II, the project list was decided
by a ministerial regulation of the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR). In the
original FTP II of 2010, coal was expected to account only for 33 percent of the total additional
capacity, natural gas for 15 percent, and the rest being renewable energy, which is geothermal
and hydro power. In contrast to FTP I, FTP II emphasizes renewable energy and seeks to
contribute towards addressing global warming challenges.
However, the project list of FTP II was amended by MEMR in August 2013 by the addition of
a further 9.2 GW of coal-fired power projects to the list (MEMR, 2013). The additional 9.2
GW coal power projects were selected from the list of potential projects in RUPTL in order to
provide sufficient capacity to meet the future projected demand in 2022. Again, the purpose of
adding the 9.2 GW coal power projects is to recognize them as the projects that will be granted
government support. This amendment indicates that the GoI would provide political support as
well as commercial comfort to the implementation of large-scale coal power plants to secure
future electricity supply. Altogether, 22.4 GW of new coal-fired capacity is planned to be built
by 2022.


                                                15
This extensive power plant building program is required to meet the expected demand growth,
while maintaining an adequate reserve margin. An important finding of this study is that the
installation of CCS would significantly reduce the net output from a power plant relative to its
nameplate capacity. However, assessment of the expansion of the power plant building
program that would be required to accommodate the mandatory implementation of CCS on all
new power plants is beyond the scope of this study.

2.4 Projected CO2 emissions

The increased coal-based generation contributes to increased CO2 emissions. While Indonesia
has considerable greenhouse gas emissions from forestry and land use change, CO2 emissions
from fossil fuel use are rising. In 2013, 523 million tonnes of CO2 were emitted from the
consumption of fossil fuels, ranking Indonesia as the ninth largest CO2 emitting country in the
world -- though this is still much less than China, USA, Japan and India (BP, 2014). The power
sector alone would emit 201 million tonnes of CO2 in 2015, and is projected to emit 383 million
tonnes by 2024 in line with the projected power generation mix in Indonesia’s power sector to
2024 (RUPTL, 2015). By the year 2024, coal will account for 87 percent of the power sector
emissions (RUPTL, 2015). CO2 emissions from the entire country are expected to reach 1,150
million tonnes of CO2 per year by 2025 unless the government takes action to reduce emissions.

2.5 CO2 emission reduction obligations

CCS provides an opportunity for the government to meet both its energy needs and its non-
binding target to reduce CO2 emissions by 26 percent by 2020. Indonesia signed the Kyoto
Protocol in 1998 and ratified it in 2004 through Law No. 17/2004. In 2011, the government
issued Presidential Decree No. 61 of 2011 regarding the National Action Plan on Greenhouse
Gas (GHG) Reduction (RAN-GRK) of which the objective is “to be used as guidance to various
institutions in carrying out a coordinated and integrated effort to tackle climate change”
(Survanti, 2009).
GHG emission reduction through CCS in the power sector is not part of the RAN-GRK. The
largest cut of emissions in RAN-GRK is from the forestry and land use sectors, with only a
very modest CO2 reduction target for the power sector through small hydropower and
geothermal power plant developments.
Presidential Decree No. 61 is supported by another Presidential Decree, No. 71 of 2011,
regarding the National GHG Inventory. The GoI was recognized as an important country for
global climate policy discussion as it hosted the thirteenth Conference of the Parties of the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meeting in Bali. In
2008, Indonesia unilaterally pledged by 2020 to cut energy sector emissions by 26 percent, and
by up to 41 percent if supported by the international community.
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), CCS is part of the global lowest-cost
greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation portfolio. Without CCS contributing a fifth of the necessary
emission reductions, the global cost of reducing GHG emissions would rise by 70 percent.



                                              16
Simulations by LEMIGAS7 and partners indicate that CCS could reduce CO2 emissions by
13.4 percent under different National Energy Policy Objective scenarios, as set by the
Presidential Decree No. 5 of 2006.
Further discussion of progress in Indonesia towards these targets is outside the scope of this
study.
2.6 Need for CCS

One way to meet the GoI’s goal of improved energy supply and security, while also reducing
CO2 emissions, is for future coal-fired power plants to include CCS. As a government-owned
utility contributing the most to national electricity capacity, PLN has an important role to play
in leading the way in Indonesia. Investigating the implications of having CCS-ready plants is
an important first step. CCS-ready plants could reduce the costs of retrofitting coal plants for
CO2 capture during the 25-year life span of a typical coal plant with likely extension for another
20 years. Investment decisions made in today’s uncertain environment need to consider the full
range of future conditions under which the plant may operate. Retrofitting CCS-ready coal
plants with CO2 capture equipment any time during their life could be significantly less
expensive than attempting to retrofit non-capture-ready coal plants. Thus, designing plants to
be CCS-ready could save PLN and IPPs significant costs if the regulatory and/or economic
environment changes.

2.7 CO2 from Natuna gas field

The production of natural gas from the East Natuna gas field could affect CO2 storage in South
Sumatra or West Java. The East Natuna gas field in the South China Sea has a CO2 content of
71 percent, which has to be separated and removed to produce a saleable natural gas product.
That gas processing operation would produce seven volumes of CO2 for each three volumes of
natural gas product. The planned peak rate of gas production from the Natuna field is about 4
billion standard cubic feet per day after processing, which is expected to commence in 2024
(Azwar, 2013), (OGI, 2014). That production rate would yield 190 million tonnes per year of
CO2, which is about the same as would be produced by CCS from 35 GW of coal-fired power
plant capacity with 90 percent CO2 capture. The Natuna gas field may be exploited at that rate
for 20 years from about 2025, producing 3,800 million tonnes of CO2 before gas production
subsequently declines.
If a driver for the implementation of CCS eventuates, that driver could apply equally to CO2
stripped from Natuna gas, which might need to use CO2 storage capacity in South Sumatra or
West Java for CO2 from Natuna, if storage elsewhere is inadequate. Since the cost of stripping
CO2 from Natuna gas will be borne by the gas producers, only the cost of CO2 transport from
Natuna would compete with the cost of capture and transport from coal-fired power plants.
Therefore, there is a risk that CO2 from Natuna could reduce CO2 storage capacity available
for CCS. However, the possibility of CO2 from Natuna being stored in South Sumatra or West
Java is not included in the analysis in this report.

3   STUDY BASIS

The scope of this study is to assess the feasibility of building new conventional coal-fired power
plants in the near future in such a way that they could be retrofitted with CO 2 capture some
years after their initial commissioning; i.e. to be built as “CO2 capture ready”. Accordingly,
retrofitting CO2 capture to existing plants or plants that are already designed is outside the
scope of this study. Likewise the selection of technology for future power plants that might be
required to integrate CO2 capture in their original design are also outside the scope of this study.

3.1 Plant selection criteria

A portfolio of existing and proposed power plants in the RUPTL (2013-22) was compared
against the following set of criteria:
       Plant efficiency and associated capture costs. To minimize the impact of CO2 capture
        on overall cycle efficiency, the power plants targeted for CCS should be large units
        (>600 MW). The most suitable candidates under this criterion are a few coal-fired
        supercritical or ultra-supercritical coal power plants to be constructed in the timeframe
        of 2018-22.8. The sizes and efficiencies of all existing thermal plants, as well as the
        proposed gas-fired units are sub-optimal according to this criterion.
       Adequacy of space. Space availability around existing coal- and gas-fired plants in
        urban demand centers is too limited to allow for subsequent CO2 capture and
        compression equipment installation.
       Construction timing. Previous studies have indicated that it is appropriate to allow for
        CCS-R modifications to be included at the initial design stage, which favors the choice
        of plants not expected to begin operations until 2018 or later.
       Demonstration potential. To ensure the future applicability of the study findings, the
        selected power plant(s) should be representative of Indonesia’s generation mix. A
        review of RUPTL suggested that with the uncertainties around natural gas supply, the
        use of gas in Indonesia’s generation mix will be declining in the period 2013-22. A few
        new gas-fired power plants will be coming online only when the GoI has allocated new
        gas supplies for electricity generation to those newly planned gas-fired power plants,
        while outputs from the existing plants are expected to decline due to the aging facilities.
       Availability of CO2 storage in the region. The detailed assessments of CO2 storage and
        the potential of EOR are carried out in this study. The availability of depleted oil fields
        in the region needs to be confirmed before the site is selected. This is especially relevant
        for sites located in Java, where availability of depleted oil fields is apparently minor.
In light of the above considerations, PLN and the World Bank team reviewed the existing and
planned thermal power plants under PLN’s official Power Development Plan (RUPTL, 2015),

 The engineering design of power plants with commissioning dates earlier than 2018 are likely to have already
been fixed.

came up with a shortlist of power plants, and then decided on two power plants to be built by
IPPs as the basis for the CCS-R study.
3.2 Selected plants

Two plants – one located in West Java and the other in South Sumatra -- were selected as a
nominal basis for the study. Although specific plants were selected and plant data was derived
from prefeasibility studies of those plants, in order to be as realistic as possible, the plants are
taken as generic examples. Some plant-specific data was modified in order to provide
consistency in the host plant specifications so that assessment of the impact of adding CO 2
capture was carried out on a consistent basis.
The larger plant, on the north coast of West Java, comprises 2 x 1000MWe (megawatts of
electricity) ultra-supercritical (USC) units.9 Under full operational conditions, with 90 percent
CO2 capture operational, the initially-estimated quantity of captured CO2 from both units
combined would be 10.92 million tonnes CO2/year. The smaller plant in South Sumatra would
be a 1 x 600MWe unit. For the purpose of this study, the more thermally efficient supercritical
plant design has been assumed. The total annual quantity of CO2 captured at a 90 percent CO2
capture rate would be 3.68 million tonnes of CO2 per year. Therefore, the maximum total
quantity of CO2 for which storage is required would be 14.6 million tonnes per year for 2600
MWe of nominal electricity generation capacity.
The coastal 2000MWe host power plant in West Java will use a high-sulphur lignite and will
include seawater scrubbing of the flue gas to reduce the SO2 content to meet the environmental
criterion of 750 milligrams (mg) SO2 per Nm3 10. The smaller 600MWe inland host power plant
in South Sumatra will use lower-sulphur lignite with high moisture content, but will not have
flue gas desulfurization. The reference host power plant design parameters are derived from
prefeasibility studies and discussion with PLN. The key parameters used for this study are
listed in Table 3-1.

  In this context the terms ultrasupercritical and supercritical refer to the steam conditions at the inlet to the very
high pressure (VHP) steam turbine, which is a key parameter affecting the thermodynamic efficiency of the
power generation cycle. The critical point of steam is at a pressure of 221.2 bar and a temperature of 374.15oC.
When the top pressure in the steam cycle is above 221.2 bar it is termed supercritical. Supercritical power
plants typically have VHP inlet conditions of about 250 bar and 550oC. Ultrasupercritical power plants, which
require more expensive materials of construction, typically have VHP inlet temperature in excess of 600 oC.

3.3 Capture Scenarios

To be most cost effective, the CO2 capture equipment would be designed to capture 90 percent
of the CO2 from a flue gas stream, as discussed in Annex 2. However, a lesser extent of CO2
capture might be required if, for example, the legislation enabling CCS sets a reduced
kgCO2/MWh (Megawatt hour) criterion. In that event, a portion of the total flue gas stream
might be processed through the 90 percent CO2 capture plant and a portion left untreated so
that, on average, the CO2 capture fraction from the power plant is less.
Three scenarios are considered that might provide the enabling change which results in CCS
retrofit being required:
      The international CO2 emissions market evolves so that participation is mandatory and
       also the supply of CO2 emission reduction credits falls short of the demand so that the
       internationally-traded price of “carbon” rises substantially to the point where
       implementation of CCS becomes economic compared with buying emission rights. In
       this scenario, pursuing as much CCS as practicable would be the rational economic
       choice. 90 percent CO2 capture reflects this scenario.


                                                     20
       The GoI, either unilaterally or in concert with other countries, decrees that all power
        plants shall be subject to a maximum emission factor in terms of kilograms (kg) of
        CO2 per MWh of electricity generated. 45 percent CO2 capture reflects this scenario.
       The GoI, or a financing institution, requires that CCS-readiness is taken to the next
        level by requiring implementation of a commercial-scale plant to prove the technology
        and provide a model for replication. 22.5 percent CO2 capture reflects this scenario.
These three scenarios correspond to the proposed CO2 capture scenarios of 90 percent capture,
45 percent capture and 22.5 percent capture, which would be achieved by 90 percent capture
being applied to all, one half or one quarter, respectively, of the flue gas from the host power
plant. Since CO2 capture equipment would comprise multiple gas processing trains, processing
a fraction of the flue gas is practical.

      3.3.1     Scenarios for the West Java power plant

The size of an individual MEA scrubbing process train is limited by the diameter of the
absorbers that could reasonably be manufactured and transported to the power plant site. An
initial outline process design indicated that an absorber diameter of up to 14 meters (m) should
be technically feasible, based on considerations of column flooding. An absorber height of 25m
would be required to achieve 90 percent CO2 capture. Eight MEA process trains at that size
would be required to process all the flue gas from both units at the West Java power plant (i.e.,
for 2000MW of host power plant capacity).
However, that size of absorber is bigger than has been proven commercially or has been
nominated in other CCS studies. Also, that size of prefabricated vessel might be difficult to
transport to the site. Therefore, a smaller absorber vessel (10-11 meters diameter) is assessed,
which would be sized to achieve 90 percent CO2 capture with 12 MEA absorber vessels for the
2000MW power plant. On this basis, the scenarios for assessment of CCS on the West Java
power plant are shown in Table 3-2.

          3.3.2 Scenarios for South Sumatra power plant

The proposed power plant in South Sumatra will have a power output of 600MW from the host
power plant, as 1 x 600MWe supercritical unit. As shown in Table 3-1, this host power plant
would be slightly less thermally efficient than the proposed West Java power plant. Hence, the
CO2 output from the South Sumatra power plant will be about one third of the CO2 output from
the West Java power plant. Accordingly, four of the MEA CO2 capture trains of the size
assessed for West Java would be needed for 90 percent CO2 capture. On this basis the scenarios
for assessment of CCS on the South Sumatra power plant are shown in Table 3-3.

           3.3.3    Comparison with natural gas power plant emission factors

As noted above, the 45 percent capture scenario (i.e., 90 percent CO2 capture from half of the
power plant flue gas) is founded on the scenario that coal-fired power plants would have a
limited CO2 emission factor (e.g., no greater than that of an equivalent gas-fired power plant).
Figure 3-1 shows a comparison of power plant CO2 emission factors based on the data in Table
3-2 and Table 3-3 and on the following assumptions for gas-fired power plants:
              CO2 emission factor for natural gas = 53 kgCO2/GJhhv11
               (Compared with 93 kg CO2/GJhhv for lignite)
              Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) power plant thermal efficiency = 50%hhv
              Open cycle (Gas turbine only) power plant efficiency = 30%hhv

Figure 3-1 shows that 45 percent CO2 capture from the South Sumatra power plant would
reduce the power plant CO2 emission factor to the same as an equivalent open-cycle gas turbine.
To match the emissions from a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plant, 66 percent
CO2 capture from the coal-fired power plants (CFPP) would be required. However, Figure 3-1
also shows that 45 percent CO2 capture from the West Java power plant would reduce the CO2
emission factor to the same as an equivalent NGCC power plant if that power plant is sourced
with fuel from a gas well containing 34 percent CO2 and that off-site CO2 emission is taken
into account.
Likewise, if the gas used in an NGCC has been supplied as liquefied natural gas, then there
would be substantial pre-combustion CO2 emissions associated with the liquefaction,
transportation and regasification of the LNG. In this case, taking those pre-combustion
emissions into account, the overall CO2 emission factor would likely be about equivalent to the
emission factor for a coal-fired power plant with 45 percent CO2 capture.
This latter comparison illustrates that the direct CO2 emissions from the power plant stack is
only part of the greenhouse gas emission consequences of fossil fuel power generation. For a
holistic comparison, the emission of CO2 and methane involved in the production of the power
plant fuel should be taken into account via a Full Fuel Cycle (FFC) GHG gas analysis. Such an
analysis typically reveals that the greenhouse gas emission from natural gas production,
processing and distribution are significantly larger per unit of consumer energy than the
emissions from the mining and transport of coal. In particular, if the raw natural gas has a high
CO2 that is stripped and vented as part of the gas processing operation, then the greenhouse
“backpack” of pre-combustion emissions carried by that gas when it is delivered to the power
plant can be significant.

3.4 Implementation timing
Three implementation delay scenarios of five, ten and fifteen years are used to assess the
economic impact of delaying the implementation of CCS. These delay scenarios are made to

                                                                                   23
reflect the fact that implementation of CCS in Indonesia will not occur until institutional
readiness is in place. It is expected that the West Java power plant will be commissioned in
2020, that the South Sumatra plant will be commissioned in 2022, and that both power plants
will have a 25-year design life ending in 2045 and 2047, respectively. On that basis, the total
amounts of CO2 storage required for CCS on the two power plants are shown in Table 3-4.
These are the quantities of CO2 for which storage locations need to be identified for CCS-ready
status.

4   CAPTURE STUDY

4.1 Introduction

This chapter presents a technical feasibility study for Capture-Ready status of two power plants
– one in West Java and one in South Sumatra. Both power plants will utilize lignite coal as
their main fuel. This chapter focuses on a preliminary engineering design of the CCS retrofit
facilities to capture CO2 from boiler stack gas, aiming to achieve the best CO2 capture scenario
in terms of technical performance and financial outcome. In addition, this chapter also covers
some recommendations regarding selection of equipment.
Even though CCS implementation is unlikely to eventuate before 2025, which would be some
years after the power plants are commissioned, CO2 capture design, site area requirements and
additional equipment locations would need to be defined in the original respective power plant
design and layout to prepare the power plants for later CCS implementation and thereby
achieve future-proofing of the power plant design.
          Figure 4-1      The capture-ready facilities retrofit in the power plant




Figure 4.1 shows a simplified schematic of the additional equipment that would be required to
add CO2 capture to a coal-fired power plant.

4.2 Power plant layout considerations for capture-readiness

CCS-R status requires the presentation of a scheme that uses commercially proven technology
that is suited to the specific circumstances of the power plant. MEA scrubbing is a proven
solvent for CO2 removal from products of combustion. Advanced amine systems, such as
methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), may be considered if there is sufficient confidence that such
solvent systems are commercially proven for this application.
The main impact on the power plant of the addition of CO2 capture is the requirement for an
energy source for the solvent reboiler. That energy is most efficiently provided in the form of
low-pressure steam extracted from the power plant steam cycle. About 70 percent of the steam

                                              25
that would normally be passed though the low -pressure (LP) steam turbo-generator would be
required for amine solvent regeneration in the CO2 capture plant, thus reducing the yield of
electricity. However, the electricity generated in the power plant’s high-pressure and medium-
pressure turbo-generators would be essentially unchanged. To be capture-ready, a plan for
extracting LP steam from the power plant has to be developed.
The MEA scrubbing process also requires a very low level of impurities, principally NOx and
SO2, in the flue gas from the power plant in order to avoid excessive degradation of the recycled
solvent.

           4.2.1   Oxides of nitrogen (NOx)
Environmental air quality legislation in Indonesia requires the discharge of NO x to be below
750 mg/Nm3 (365 ppm)12 in the discharged flue gas, which is usually achieved with low-NOx
burners in the combustor. However, the MEA process typically requires the NOx content of the
feed gas to contain no more than 20 ppm. Therefore, an additional process with about 95
percent NOx reduction would be required. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) could achieve
that level of NOx reduction by reacting NO2 with ammonia in a catalyst bed at elevated
temperature to yield nitrogen and water vapour. To be capture-ready, a power plant would
require space to be allocated for retrofitting SCR in the hot gas path.
In some countries, environmental criteria are stricter than in Indonesia, meaning that SCR has
to be included in standard power plant designs without CO2 capture. If there is the likelihood
that stricter environmental criteria might be applied in Indonesia, then provision of space for
later addition of SCR could be considered as prudent future-proofing of the power plant design
and might not be attributed to the consequences of making the power plant capture-ready.

           4.2.2   Sulphur dioxide (SO2)
Environmental air quality legislation in Indonesia requires the discharge of (SO 2) also to be
below 750 mg/Nm3 (263 ppm) in the discharged flue gas.
In the case of the West Java plant, the intention is to use lignite fuel with 1.8 percent (dry ash-
free) sulphur content, which would result in a flue gas with 4825 mg/Nm3 of SO2 if
uncontrolled. Scrubbing of flue gas with seawater is proposed at a coastal location, as the flue
gas desulphurisation (FGD) process in the host power plant, to reduce the SO2 content of the
flue gas by 85 percent to comply with the air quality criterion.
In the case of the inland South Sumatra plant, seawater scrubbing is not possible and no other
FGD is proposed. The design lignite has a sulphur content of 0.86 percent (dry ash-free), which
would result in a flue gas SO2 concentration of 2263 mg/Nm3. The lignite sulphur content
would need to be less than 0.28 percent to give a flue gas compliant with the 750 mg/Nm3 air
quality criterion.
The MEA process typically requires the feed gas to contain less than 10 ppm SO2. Therefore,
for a flue gas that is compliant with the 750 mg/Nm3 (263 ppm) air quality criterion, an
additional FGD process with 96 percent SO2 reduction capability would be required as part of

the CO2 capture retrofit. A wet scrubbing process, such as limestone/gypsum FGD, would need
to be located in the flue gas path after gas cooling and prior to the CO2 capture process.

4.3 Technical feasibility study of CCS-Ready facilities

       4.3.1   Framework model for power plant modification assessment
An Excel spreadsheet power plant model covering mass, energy and element balancing has
been developed for this study to enable rigorous assessment of the changes to the power plant
arising from the integration of CO2 capture. The model allows for six parallel cases to be
assessed and compared. The Framework model describes the power plant via 56 input
parameters defining the process configurations, the fuel properties and analyses, and the steam
cycle configuration and thermodynamics.
There are two computational sections: boiler and steam cycle. The boiler section is based on
mass, energy and element balancing calculations to assess the combustion process and flue gas
processing stages. In particular, this section determines the acid dew point of the flue gas, which
impacts on the flue gas temperature profiles. The boiler section relies on a database of physical
and chemical properties of fuels and gases. The steam cycle section embodies representations
of a supercritical steam cycle with high-pressure turbine, reheater, medium-pressure turbine,
low-pressure condensing turbine, condenser and eight-stage boiler feed water heating system.
The steam cycle calculations use the “X-steam” steam properties software with supercritical
capabilities. Heat exchanger pinch point methodology is used to optimize the steam cycle
thermal efficiency. Figure 4-2 presents the steam cycle representation for one unit of the West
Java plant ultra-supercritical steam cycle with low-pressure steam extraction for the amine
reboiler at 90 percent CO2 capture. In this example, the nominal net output to the grid of
1000MW is reduced to 725 MW net output due to the integration of LP steam extraction for
the amine reboiler.
The Framework model has been used to develop the outline power plant definitions presented
in pre-feasibility studies for the West Java and South Sumatra power plants to ensure that the
power plant assessment data with and without CO2 capture are determined on a consistent basis.

There are three possible schematic configurations to treat NO2 and SO2 from flue gas. These
three configurations are differentiated by the NOx removal sequence (Jeffers, 2008) as
illustrated in .
In the High Dust configuration, the SCR reactor is placed in the most thermally efficient
location between the economizer and the air preheater. In this configuration, the catalyst is
exposed to fly ash and chemical compounds present in the flue gas, which have the potential
to degrade the catalyst mechanically and chemically. However, as evidenced by the extensive
use of this configuration, proper design of a high-dust SCR system can mitigate the mechanical
and chemical impacts on the catalyst.
In the Low Dust configuration, the SCR reactor is located downstream of the electrostatic
precipitator (ESP). This configuration would reduce the degrading effect of fly ash on the
catalyst.
In the Tail End configuration, the SCR reactor is installed downstream of the flue gas
desulfurization unit. The tail end configuration is implicitly low-dust. However, this

configuration is typically less thermally efficient and more expensive than the high-temperature
configurations due to associated flue gas reheating requirements.
Of the three configurations illustrated in Figure 4-3, the High Dust configuration is selected for
the flue gas conditioning study, because a high operating temperature is required to maximize
NOx conversion and the High Dust configuration is the most thermally efficient. The fly ash
issues can be managed with modern designs. The optimum operating temperature for SCR is
about 400oC so the boiler exit temperature would need to be about that temperature. The
residual heat in the flue gas is recovered in an air preheater and recycled to the boiler. However,
the inclusion of SCR would result in an increase in the air preheater duty.

       4.3.3      NOx removal technology
NOx removal technology is required in addition to NO2 reduction that can be achieved with
Low-NOx burners in the combustion chamber. Generally, post-combustion technologies for the
reduction of NOX are: selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) and selective catalytic
reduction. Each of these technologies requires the introduction of a reagent, such as ammonia
or urea that will selectively react with NOx. This reaction occurs in the presence of oxygen.
The following simplified chemistry summarizes the reactions involved in the post-combustion
controls to convert NOx to elemental nitrogen (Bell & Buckingham, 2002).

SCR Reactions          :       2NO2 + 4NH3 + O2 3N2 + 6H2O            (catalytic reaction)
Table 4-2 provides a summary of the effectiveness and relative costs for these technologies.
This table lists the NOx reduction achieved by each technology as a percentage of the NOx prior
to the implementation of the combustion control.
                       Table 4-2       Design criteria for SCR facilities

Based on Table 4-2 (Buckingham, 2002), it can be concluded that SCR technology is the most
viable option to treat flue gas outlet from the electrostatic precipitator, when a high capture rate
is required. With this technology, 95percent of inlet NOx can be reacted catalytically to achieve
20 parts per million by volume (ppmv) in the SCR outlet. The two most used catalyst types in
the industry (Jeffers, 2008) are:
       Plate-type Catalyst
           Most suitable for high dust concentration;
           TiO2, V-oxide/W-oxide/Mo-oxide as the active catalytic material;
           Thermal and mechanical resistance; and
           Low SO2/SO3 conversion rate.
       Honeycomb Catalyst
           Most suitable for low dust situation;
           TiO2, V-oxide and W-oxide as the active catalytic material;
           Homogeneously extruded ceramic, and
           High active surface area per unit volume.
According to the International Energy Agency Greenhouse Gas Research and Development
Program (IEAGHG, 2006), 20 ppmv NOx is a reasonable limit to avoid excessive amine
absorbent solvent degradation in the CO2 capture system. Therefore, SCR is identified for both
the West Java and South Sumatra power plants as an additional process that would be required
for implementation of CCS.
The maximum size of proven SCR unit capacity for a single-train unit installed worldwide is
100-850 MWe (Srivastava, 1997). Table 4-3 shows the number of trains and other SCR design
information for the study. The ammonia demand is calculated on the basis of 10 percent more
than the stoichiometric requirement.

        4.3.4    SO2 removal technology
Sulphur dioxide in the flue gas is produced from the combustion of sulphur in the lignite.
Combustion in the boiler converts both organic and inorganic sulphur in the fuel to gaseous
SO2. Like NOx, SO2 concentration in the flue gas has to be severely limited to avoid excessive
amine degradation. SO2 in the flue gas should be below 10 ppmv before being introduced into
an amine CO2 capture system. SO2 reacts with amine solvent to form a sulphite that has to be
removed. In addition to requiring the removal of degradation products, there would be more
amine solvent makeup required to compensate for solvent loss (Nielsen, 1997). Hence, SO2
removal before CO2 capture would be required. Numerous systems for flue gas desulfurization
have been operated worldwide. The classification of many FGD schemes can be considered as
two types: wet and dry (DTI, 2000).
Wet FGD Process
        Wet FGD is based on using limestone as a reagent to scrub SO2 from the flue gas. In
        order to maintain homogeneous performance and good operability, limestone in the
        form of slurry is sprayed vertically inside a scrubbing tower. This technology is widely
        installed and most frequently selected for sulphur dioxide reduction from coal-fired
        boilers. Typically, SO2 removal efficiency for wet FGD ranges from 80-98 percent.
Dry FGD Process
        In Dry FGD, flue gas is contacted with alkaline (most often lime) sorbent. The sorbent
        can be delivered to flue gas in an aqueous slurry form (semi-dry) or a dry powder (dry).
        As a reaction result, dry waste is produced with handling properties similar to fly ash.
        Typically, SO2 removal efficiency for Dry FGD ranges from 50-80 percent.
If the sulphur content of the lignite coal used at the South Sumatra plant is 0.86 percent, then
to reach a satisfactory value of SO2 of 10 ppmv in the treated flue gas, the South Sumatra power
plant would require over 98.7 percent removal efficiency, which would be challenging.
However, the use of a single FGD process at the South Sumatra plant would be practical if a
lower sulphur content fuel (e.g., 0.28 percent sulphur) can be used that would achieve 750


                                               32
mg/Nm3 (<263 ppm dry) SO2 in the host power plant flue gas, thus requiring 96 percent SO2
removal with FGD.
At the West Java plant, the SO2 content of the flue gas would be reduced to below the air quality
criterion of 750 mg/Nm3 (<263 ppm dry) with seawater scrubbing. A further 96 percent
reduction in SO2 would be required to achieve 10ppm SO2 in the feed gas to make it feasible
to use amine scrubbing. A single step SO2 removal process is not sufficient for the West Java
power plant case.
Therefore a high-efficiency wet FGD process would be required for both applications as
illustrated in Figure 4-4.
Wet FGD can be operated reliably in a natural oxidation mode under favorable conditions.
However, for the majority of applications, it is necessary to control the extent of oxidation in
order to improve operational reliability of the system. Over the years, several process variations
have been designed to improve the operational reliability of wet FGD technology.

One way to prevent a scaling problem is to blow air into the absorbent slurry to encourage
controlled oxidation outside of the absorber. This type of FGD system, known as limestone
forced oxidation (LSFO), provides rapid calcium sulfate crystal growth on seed crystals. It
minimizes scaling in the scrubber and also results in slurry that can be more easily dewatered.
Consequently, the LSFO system has become the preferred technology worldwide (Srivastava,
2000).
Table 4-4 gives some design characteristics for wet FGD at both power plants. The limestone
demand is calculated on the basis of 10 percent more than the stoichiometric requirement.
Unlike SCR for NOx systems, which only need ammonia dosing as auxiliary equipment, wet
FGD systems require significant sub-systems. These sub-systems contribute to the cost of FGD
and to the site layout requirements.

It is well established that the best proven technology for the separation of CO2 from the
products of combustion is by the use of an amine solvent in a chemical scrubbing process
(Rubin, 2002) and (Folger, 2010). The amine scrubbing process, illustrated in
Figure 4-6, involves contacting an aqueous solution of amine with the flue gas at low
temperature in an absorber column where CO2 combines chemically with the amine. The
CO2-rich solution is then heated to cause the CO2 to chemically dissociate from the amine.
The CO2 is recovered from the hot amine solution in a regeneration column. The depleted
amine solvent is recycled to the absorber. The principal utility requirement for the amine
scrubbing process is low-grade steam for the solvent regeneration column

                                                                         34
          4.3.5        Amine-based post-combustion CO2 capture
The simplest amine is MEA (monoethanolamine) which is well proven commercially as a
reagent for CO2 capture in many commercial installations around the world (Bhown, 2011).
MEA has been used for assessment of the CO2 capture in this study.
The use of more complex amine compounds, such as MDEA (Methyldiethanolamine) and
mixtures of amine compounds have been successfully used in some applications. The use of
alternative amines or other CO2 capture technology is discussed in Annex 3.

      MEA absorber pressure                 : 1.1 bar
      CO2 stripper pressure                 : 1.8 bar
      Rotating equipment efficiency         : 75 percent
      Minimum temperature approach          : 10oC
With these calculation assumptions, the CO2 capture system can be realistically and accurately
evaluated with mass and energy balance calculations and the critical parameter of regenerator
energy requirement can be determined.
Several process refinements, and optimisations and alternative configurations have been
developed to minimize the energy penalty of CO2 capture. For example, the regeneration
temperature has to be optimized to compromise between energy demand and thermal
degradation of the solvent. Another key compromise is between the concentration of MEA in
the solvent and the corrosion of process equipment. Alternative process configurations include
a split flow configuration and also a vapour recompression configuration. Figure 4-8 illustrates
the split flow configuration.
A key outcome of the investigation carried out with amine process modelling is that the
optimized energy requirement for amine regeneration is 4.5 gigajoules (GJ) per tonne of CO2
captured.

The sizes of major equipment items are also determined by the Aspen model. The most critical
equipment dimension is the diameter of the absorber column. The absorber is a packed column
in which amine solution flows down over packing where it is contacted with flue gas flowing
up the column. The flows in the column have to be carefully designed to avoid the down
flowing liquid being held up by the up-flowing gas, which would cause the column to flood.
Commercial designs exist up to 14 meters diameter, but an absorber diameter of 11 meters is
well proven and a vessel of that size would be more easily transported. At that size, six MEA
absorber columns would be required to process all the flue gas from each of the 1000MW
power plant units. The corresponding numbers of process trains are summarized in Table 4-6.

       4.3.6        CO2 conditioning (dehydration and compression)
CO2 that has been stripped from the amine solvent in the regenerator tower will be prepared in
a CO2 conditioning system. In order to transport large amounts of CO2 efficiently, the CO2
must be liquefied and maintained in the liquid phase (i.e., above 74 bar pressure) in the pipeline
in order to avoid unnecessary problems of vaporization while delivering it. The critical
temperature of CO2 is 31oC, so when the CO2 is at a higher temperature it would be a

                                                          37
supercritical fluid rather than a liquid. To provide for the pipeline pressure, CO2 is compressed
at the power plant site with cooling and dehydration to 110 bar. The liquid CO2 quality
specifications for pipelining are listed in Table 4-7.
                                 Table 4-7          CO2 pipeline specifications

CO2 from the scrubber is saturated with water after being regenerated with steam in the stripper
column. Excessive amounts of water would cause corrosion problems in the delivery pipe.
Therefore, a water removal process must be included in the CO2 compression train. A CO2
conditioning configuration is illustrated in Figure 4-9.

The water concentration would be reduced to less than 50 ppm using molecular sieve
adsorption technology, which has been proven mature in chemical industries. In order to
separate CO2 and water, a molecular sieve with a 3Å (Angstrom units)13 pore size is the most
suitable pore size because H2O has 2.8Å diameter (UOP, 2001).
Additional to the basic assumptions of the CO2 capture system, a simulation was conducted for
CO2 conditioning systems assuming that:
          Pressure ratio of the compressor is < 3; and
          Compressor intercooler can reduce the temperature to 50oC.

4.4 Outputs from the Capture Study

       4.4.1   Reduction in net electricity output
Table 4.8 shows that installation of 90 percent CO2 capture on the West Java power plant would
reduce the net electricity output to the grid from 2000MW to 1450MW. That corresponds to a
27.5 percent reduction in net output for the same coal feed rate (i.e., the thermal efficiency of
the West Java power plant would be reduced from 42.5%lhv to 30.8%lhv) as shown in Figure
4.2. Likewise, for the South Sumatra power plant, the overall thermal efficiency would reduce
from 40.8%lhv to 28.2%lhv (i.e., a 30.8 percent reduction in net power out to the grid).
Table 4.8 shows that the main cause of electricity output reduction is the net loss due to LP
steam use for CO2 capture such that the electricity generation capacity of the LP steam turbine
is greatly reduced. That assessment is based on the MEA amine scrubbing plant having an
assumed energy demand of 4.5 GJ/tonne of CO2 captured, which reflects a well-proven
commercial process. There is substantial research and development (R&D) effort in exploring
more efficient CO2 capture processes, which are discussed in more detail in Annex 3.
Substantially lower reductions in net electricity delivered to the transmission grid (e.g., less
than 20 percent) are reported for some CCS schemes that are under development or are the
subject of desk studies. Such improved performance could be largely attributable to the host
power plant having a much higher thermal efficiency. If the host power plant is more efficient,
then the overhead losses of electricity -- due to LP steam offtake and own use for processes
and CO2 compression -- would be a smaller fraction of the output of the host power plant.
The relatively low thermal efficiencies of the host power plants in West Java and South
Sumatra are partly due to the use of low-quality lignite fuel, particularly in the case of the South
Sumatra plant. Also, the equatorial location of the power plants means that the bottom
temperature of the thermodynamic steam cycle is not as low as would be the case in higher
latitudes.

       4.4.2   Additional operating costs
The addition of flue gas processing, CO2 capture and CO2 compression have demands for
utilities and chemicals. The utilities and chemicals demands determined with the Framework

model and the Aspen modeling are listed in Table 4-8 for the 90 percent capture reference cases.
The main utilities requirement is LP steam for the MEA process regeneration. As described
above, that LP steam demand is integrated into the power plant steam cycle and so is manifest
as a net loss of electricity output from the power plant. Accordingly, that energy demand is
expressed in Table 4-8 as an electricity consumption, although it is actually a net loss of
electricity production.

The flue gases from lignite combustion have a high moisture content. When those flue gases
are cooled in a direct contact water wash cooler, after the air preheater and before the FGD
plant, there is a net make of water due to condensation from the feed gas. If that surplus wash
water were to be cleaned, it could be used as process water elsewhere in the process.
Accordingly, it is assumed that there would be no need to purchase clean water for the CO 2
capture process. However, if evaporative cooling towers are used to meet the cooling duty, then
both the host power plants, both with and without CCS, would be net consumers of water. The
proposed FGD process would produce by-product gypsum (calcium sulphate), which could be
a saleable product to offset some of the limestone cost.

       4.4.3   Incremental capital cost
The additional capital equipment required to implement CO2 capture on a power plant
comprises: SCR, FGD, MEA, CO2 compression, and also a low -pressure steam power
recovery turbine. Table 4-10 presents capital cost estimates for this process equipment based
on Aspen modeling, with reference to literature sources. These capital cost estimates are made
at the budget estimating level and are subject to a wide margin of uncertainty. The capital cost
estimates are made on the 90 percent capture cases and are scaled to give estimates at 45 percent
and 22.5 percent capture in accordance with the number of process trains required.

The process plant equipment listed in Table 4-10 would not need to be purchased until the
decision had been made to implement CCS. At the time of the design and construction of the
Capture-Ready host power plant, there would be minimal additional equipment cost, but the
plant layout and equipment design would need to take account of the potential future
implementation of CO2 capture. Also, land area would need to be allocated on the site for future
CO2 capture equipment. In the source case in West Java, adequate land has already been
purchased, which would be able to accommodate implementation of CO2 capture. However, in
the case of South Sumatra or other future power plants, land acquisition for CO2 capture might
need to be undertaken at the time of developing the host power plant, so that the power plant
can be deemed to be capture–ready.

       4.4.4   Additional site area requirements
In order to be ready to implement a CO2 capture system and its supplementary facilities, four
major process areas would need to be allocated space on the power plant site: SCR, FGD, MEA
and CO2 compression. These areas of land in a capture-ready power plant might be used for
some temporary purpose, such as a laydown area during power plant construction, a convenient

                                               41
stock yard, or car parking. However, the ability to re-purpose those areas for future process
plants would need to be retained.
Figure 4-11 presents an estimate of the total additional land areas that might be required for
CO2 capture equipment for a typical power plant configuration. If the extent of CO2 capture is
less than 90 percent, then the number of trains of process equipment would be less. As a
comparison, a UK study (Florin, 2009) reported that a 500MWe net electricity power plant
would require 3.75 hectares of empty land for CO2 capture and compression.

The West Java power plant with 2x1000 MWe output would require approximately six hectares
of additional land for CO2 capture facilities. A revised layout for a typical power plant, with
space for CCS-Readiness at 90 percent CO2 capture, is presented in Figure 4-12.

       4.4.5   CCS-Readiness costs
The principal up-front cost of making a power plant CCS-Ready would be the purchase of
additional land to accommodate the extra equipment in the future. However, in the case of the
subject West Java power plant, the site is large enough to accommodate future CO2 capture
equipment without the need for additional land acquisition. The cost of land is site-specific.
No significant additional equipment would be required for the power plant to be CO2 capture-
ready. However, planning and design effort would need to take account of the potential for
CCS to be retrofitted at a later stage. That design effort could incur project management costs
over and above the normal design and management requirements for replicating a standard
power plant design.
However, the direct CCS-readiness costs will be minor and, aside from land acquisition costs,
might be accommodated within the project contingency budgeting for a large power plant
investment.

   5. TRANSPORT STUDY

   5.1 Objectives of the transport study
   •   To identify possible pipeline routes and distribution networks from the power plants to
       the CO2 storage locations;
   •   To determine the lengths and diameters of CO2 delivery pipelines; and
   •   To determine costs of CO2 transport networks.

   5.2 CO2 transport – pipeline design principles

The transport of CO2 considered in this study involves the delivery of up to 10.92 million
tonnes per year from the West Java power plant, and up to 3.78 million tonnes per year of CO2
from South Sumatra power plant, to CO2 storage areas. CO2 can be transported at small scale
as a liquid in high-pressure containers at low temperature, by road, rail or ship, as in the Gundih
pilot project in Central Java. However, at the large scale of CCS operation, the use of pipelines
is the only viable technology.
For pipeline transport of CO2 it is important that the vapour phase should be avoided because
the much lower density of CO2 vapour would increase pressure drops; also, vapour lock
problems might be encountered in a pipeline network. The CO2 in a long distance pipeline will
be at ambient temperature, which is typically 25-30oC in Indonesia (i.e., near to the CO2
critical temperature of 31oC). Therefore, the pressure of CO2 in the pipeline should be
maintained above the CO2 critical pressure of 74 bar to ensure that formation of vapor phase
in the pipelines is avoided, so a minimum pressure of 80 bar is used as a pipeline design
criterion.
The CO2 would be compressed at the power plants site to 110 bar. The CO2 pipelines can
either be designed with a large diameter, low velocity and low pressure drop -- so that
recompression is not required -- or they can be designed with a smaller diameter, higher
velocity and higher pressure drop requiring recompression stations. The latter approach is
usually adopted for natural gas pipelines, which have a ready supply of energy for remote
recompression stations.
In this study, pipeline sizing has been based on the former approach so that CO2 is
delivered to the storage locations at above its critical pressure and without recompression.
In the context of CCS for CO2 emission control, avoidance of auxiliary energy
consumption is desirable. Also, from a practical perspective, the avoidance of arranging
an energy supply to a remote pipeline compressor station is also desirable.

       5.2.1   Underground pressure considerations
Since the liquid CO2 would be delivered to the injection site at a pressure in excess of 80 bar,
that delivered pressure would generally provide adequate driving force for CO2 injection, so
additional compression at the well site should not normally be required.


                                                45
The formation pressure at depth in the well might be greater than 80 bar due to the groundwater
hydrostatic pressure. However, the input pressure plus the vertical pressure head of CO2 in the
well would normally overcome that pressure unless the geothermal gradient is high. Figure 5-
1 shows a comparison of the hydrostatic pressure in a well with the increasing pressure of CO2
with depth, based on surface injection conditions of 80 bar and 100 bar at 30oC.

If the geothermal gradient is 25oC/km (degrees Celsius per kilometre depth) then injected
supercritical CO2 would have a relative density14 ranging from 0.56 to 0.6 below 600m deep,
which indicates that under these conditions booster pumps at the well head would not be
required until the depth exceeds about 2000 meters. However, if the geothermal gradient is
50oC/km, as is typical in South Sumatra and West Java, then the injected CO2 would have a
subsurface density of 0.25 to 0.35 gm/cm3. Under these warmer conditions, this indicates that
booster pumps at the well head would be required if the depth exceeds about 1400 meters.
Figure 5-1 also shows that, at the local geothermal gradient of 50oC/km, if the delivered CO2
pressure is 100 bar at the well head, then that would be sufficient to deliver CO2 to about 2000
meters depth. However, the actual pressure balance will depend on the actual down-hole
temperature and pressure conditions encountered.

           5.2.2            Design and costing for a single CO2 transmission pipeline
As determined in Section 6, a suitable CO2 storage location for 10.9 million tonnes per year of
CO2 from the West Java plant would be almost all in on-shore West Java gas fields to the east
of the power plant. Design parameters for a bulk CO2 transmission pipeline to that storage area
are shown in Table 5-1.
This sample calculation below is based on a 175-kilometer pipe with a low velocity, low
pressure drop and no recompression. It would require a 34-inch diameter pipe for the CO2 from

the reference case. A similar CO2 pipeline described (NETL, 2014) for a higher CO2 velocity
uses a smaller 24-inch diameter pipeline, with higher pressure drops and requiring two
recompression pumps for 300 kilometres of CO2 transmission.

 Pipeline cost factor (2014 basis)                            39,700          US$/km-inch

The pipeline design calculations shown in Table 5-1 indicate a nominal baseline total installed
cost of US$40,000 per km-inch (kilometres length multiplied by inches of inside diameter).
That factor is the same as the McCoy rule of thumb (NETL, 2014) for an 80 km pipeline in flat
dry terrain. CO2 transportation costs would be higher in mountainous, marshy or built up areas.
Also, the cost per kilometre would be higher for shorter pipelines. For this outline analysis of
pipeline costs, a terrain and length factor of 25 percent is added. Various literature sources
suggest that off-shore pipeline costs are typically about double the base cost of equivalent on-
shore pipelines, and literature (NETL, 2014) also suggests a much higher cost for deep sub-sea
pipelines. However, the sea north of Java is very shallow so pipe laying will be straightforward.
LEMIGAS proposes a cost of US$75,000 per km-inch for off-shore pipelines in the Java Sea.
For the purpose of this assessment, pipeline total investment costs are taken as US$50,000 per
km-inch for on-shore pipelines and US$75,000 per km-inch for off-shore CO2 transmission
and distribution pipelines in the shallow Java Sea.

       5.2.3   Using the pipeline for CO2 buffer storage
The CO2 transmission pipeline is effectively a large pressure vessel with some capacity to
accommodate fluctuations in the inputs and outputs of CO2. Natural gas transmission systems
use this feature, known as “linepack,” to help to match supply and demand. In the case of a
liquid CO2 transmission line, the ability to accommodate fluctuations in flow depends on the
compressibility of liquid CO2.
Considering the 175 km pipeline scenario presented in Table 5-1, the impact of an abrupt stop
of input of CO2 would be that the pressure at the pipe output end would gradually reduce.
Figure 5-2 shows how quickly the delivered pressure would reduce in the event of stopping
CO2 production.

Figure 5-2 relates to a pipeline that is 175 km long. This analysis indicates that if the supply of
CO2 at the West Java power plant stops, there would be about one hour for system operators to
take corresponding action at the delivery end of a 175 km pipeline. The length of time that
adequate delivery pressure would be sustained will be proportional to the pipeline length. In
the case of CO2 delivery to closer off-shore gas fields in West Java, the delay between stopping
of CO2 production and the stopping of CO2 injection would be less than one hour. In the case
of capture and storage via shorter pipelines in South Sumatra, the time delay would be even
shorter.
In the case of the concept of a 416 km pipeline delivering CO2 from West Java to South Sumatra
for EOR, the CO2 storage capacity in the pipeline would be able to accommodate a power plant
outage up to about two hours duration before the EOR operation was impacted. However, that
storage concept is dismissed in Chapter 7.
   5.3 CO2 transmission and distribution networks

       5.3.1   West Java CO2 Storage in on-shore gas fields in West Java
The implementation of 90 percent CO2 capture at the West Java power plant would require
capacity to store 10.92 million tonnes per year of CO2. If CCS were to be implemented five
years after commissioning the power plant, then it would operate for the next 20 years of the
initial 25 years of power plant design lifetime. Accordingly, identified storage for up to 218


                                                                 48
million tonnes of CO2 would be required to meet the CCS-ready storage criterion for the cases
evaluated.
Figure 5-3 shows the relative locations of the West Java power plant and onshore natural gas
fields in Northwest Java. Analysis presented in Chapter 6 identifies that the 17 on-shore gas
fields shown on Figure 5-3 only have enough capacity to store 164 million tonnes of CO2.
Therefore about half of the CO2 storage capacity of the largest off-shore gas field has been
included in the assessment of on-shore CO2 storage of the CO2 captured in West Java.
The locations of existing gas gathering pipelines are also shown on this diagram. For on-shore
CO2 pipelines, the routes are assumed to follow these existing pipeline corridors.

Figure 5-4 shows a pipeline network to deliver CO2 to these gas fields. The long CO2
transmission line from the power plant to the first off take point is a 34-inch diameter pipeline
that is 175 kilometers long, which is the subject of the sample calculation presented in Table
5-1.
The overall transmission pipeline would be 293 km long, initially at 34 inch diameter and
reducing progressively to 14-inch diameter, with smaller pipes branching to the gas fields.
In total, over 500km of pipeline would be required in the transmission and distribution
network for on-shore gas field storage in West Java, shown in Figure 5-4.

         5.3.2            CO2 Storage in off-shore gas fields in West Java
In the UK, the CCS storage-ready criterion includes the requirement that storage must be off-
shore. That requirement is partly due to plentiful off-shore CO2 storage capacity in the UK and
partly due to concern over the perceived risks and public acceptability of CO2 storage on-shore.
Accordingly, a second storage option for CO2 storage in West Java is assessed comprising CO2
storage only in off-shore gas fields.

The review of storage options detailed in Chapter 6 has identified sufficient storage in off-shore
gas fields to accommodate all of the 218 million tonnes of CO2 that would be produced from
the West Java power plant at 90 percent capture over 20 years.
Figure 5-5 shows the relative locations of the West Java power plant and offshore natural gas
fields north of Java. The existing gas gathering pipelines do not provide direct routes from the
power plant to off-shore fields, particularly the fields north of the power plant. Instead, for the
pipeline network, a direct line from the power plant to the nearest off-shore gas fields is
assumed, with the line to the other more eastern gas fields following the gas gathering pipeline
routes. The first off-shore CO2 transmission pipe would be 88 km long with 30-inch diameter.
The subsequent distribution pipes would have a total length of 303 km with an average diameter
of 19 inches. Figure 5-6 shows the pipeline distribution scheme to off-shore gas fields in West
Java.

An important consideration of CO2 storage in off-shore gas fields is that any leakage of CO2
would be into the sea and not into the atmosphere. The seawater overlying off-shore gas fields
of Northwest Java is typically less than 30 meters deep. Small quantities of CO2 seeping slowly
into the shallow seawater would dissolve and would not be released to the atmosphere, thus
achieving the CO2 retention objectives of CCS. Fossil fuel CO2 released to the atmosphere
slowly dissolves in the surface seawater at the rate of about 1 percent per year. Therefore, if
leakage from subsea gas field storage into the surface water is at a lower rate than 1 percent
per year, it would have a lesser seawater acidification effect than if the CO2 is released into the
atmosphere.
       5.3.3   West Java CO2 storage via EOR in South Sumatra
There are no significant EOR opportunities in West Java, so the possibility of piping CO2 from
West Java to be used for EOR in the oil fields in South Sumatra has been considered. Analysis
in Chapter 7 concludes that, due to the limited demand for CO2 for EOR and the uneven demand
profile for EOR over time, the accommodation of all the CO2 from West Java in the EOR
market in South Sumatra is not a viable option as a basis for CCS. Notwithstanding that


                                                51
conclusion, the feasibility and cost of the delivery of 218 million tonnes of CO2 over 20 years
from West Java to the oil fields of South Sumatra has been evaluated for completeness.
A 416 km long transmission pipeline would be required to the first distribution hub (H1) in
South Sumatra, which would include a 100 km long off-shore section. The CO2 transmission
pipeline would follow the existing route of a natural gas transmission pipeline. Figure 5-7
illustrates this concept (note: the distance of 356 km on this diagram is the distance to the
nearest oil field -- not to H1).
The 416 km CO2 transmission pipeline would have the same maximum duty as the 175 km
CO2 transmission pipeline assessed in Table 5-1. For the 90 percent CO2 capture case, it would
require a 36-inch diameter pipe, and the outlet pressure at Hub 1 would be 90 bar instead of
101 bar. Therefore, some recompression may be required to deliver the CO2 through the
subsequent CO2 distribution network.
The 36-inch transmission pipeline would comprise 100 km offshore and 316 km onshore
length. Therefore, the estimated transmission pipeline capital cost, using the factors developed
in Section 5.3, would be US$837 million to deliver 218 million tonnes of CO2 from 90 percent
capture in West Java to H1 in the South Sumatra oil field basin.

Figure 5-7 indicates that the delivery of CO2 at 90 bar from West Java to Hub 1, would be
about equivalent to the delivery of CO2 from the South Sumatra power plant at 110 bar directly
into the local CO2 distribution network. Therefore, if the cost of a booster pump to compress
the CO2 transmitted from West Java from 90 bar to 110 bar is added to the transmission line
                                              52
capital cost estimate it would provide a basis for assessing the marginal cost difference between
CO2 supplied for EOR from the two power plants in South Sumatra and West Java.
CO2 booster pumps are sized and costed according to the power that they consume. The energy
gain by the CO2 is proportional to the mass flow of CO2 and the pressure head increase. The
mass flow of CO2 would be 1558 tonnes per hour. The density of CO2 at 100 bar and 27oC is
0.8 kg/m3, so the pressure head increase from 90 bar to 110 bar would be 160 meters. If the
energy efficiency of the CO2 pump is 50 percent, then to pump the total liquid CO2 in West
Java from 90 bar to 110 bar would require 1.38 MW (i.e., an additional one percentage point
on the CCS energy penalty). The cost of a booster pump is estimated at US$2000 per
horsepower (HP, which equals 746 Watts) (i.e., US$2700/kW). Therefore, the capital cost of
pumps for this duty would be about US$3.7 million plus operating costs.
Table 5-2 shows an estimation of the capital cost of a conceptual 416 km pipeline from the
West Java Power Plant to the first CO2 distribution hub in South Sumatra.

These costs are based on the supply of CO2 at a steady rate for 20 years. EOR requires a large
amount of CO2 initially, declining in later years. If the demand for CO2 for EOR is not sustained,
then the economics of transmitting it from West Java would be worse.

       5.3.4    South Sumatra CO2 storage in gas fields
The implementation of 90 percent CO2 capture at the South Sumatra power plant would require
capacity to store 3.7 million tonnes per year of CO2. If CCS were to be implemented five years
after commissioning the power plant, then it would operate for the next 20 years of the initial
25 years of power plant design lifetime. Accordingly, identified storage for 74 million tonnes
of CO2 would be required to meet the CCS-ready storage criterion.
The review of storage options detailed in Chapter 6 has not found a single storage location with
adequate capacity for 74 million tonnes of CO2. However, sufficient storage has been identified
in six depleted gas onshore natural gas fields in South Sumatra, listed in Table 5-3.

The largest of these gas fields (GFSS3) would not be depleted and available for storage until
2032. Table 5-3 lists the natural gas production data and consequent CO2 storage capacity data
for these six gas wells. Figure 5-8 shows a scheme for the transport of CO2 by pipeline to these
eight storage locations. The total pipeline length is 92 km and the average diameter is 13.5

        5.3.5    South Sumatra CO2 storage in oil fields via EOR
An economically preferred storage location would be in depleted oil fields in the South Sumatra
basin, with the possibility of revenue from sales of CO2 for EOR, as discussed in Chapter 7. A
potential demand for 243 million tonnes of CO2 for EOR in 127 oil fields has been identified
in South Sumatra over the period to 2045. Figure 5.9 shows an overall plan for a CO2
distribution network for EOR in South Sumatra.

Analysis presented in Chapter 7 identifies that sources of by-product CO2 available in South
Sumatra would be able to meet all this demand over time, but that use of half to two thirds of
the CO2 from the South Sumatra power plant could enable the exploitation of some EOR to be
brought forward by about 15 years.
The actual contribution of CO2 from the power plant to specific EOR locations would depend
on timing and other factors. However, for the purpose of transport cost assessment, eight oil
fields in the southeast quadrant of the South Sumatra basin have been identified as having the
overall EOR demand to match more than half of the supply from the South Sumatra power
plant. Distribution pipes to those oil fields would have a combined length of less than about 50
km and an average diameter of 20 inches, as illustrated in Figure 5-10.

   5.4 Cost of CO2 transport options

Table 5-4 shows a summary of the capital cost calculations for transmission and distribution of
CO2 for the five cases assessed above. These calculations are based on 90 percent CO2 capture
for 20 years and use the pipeline costing factors of US$50,000 per km-inch for on-shore
pipelines and US$75,000 per km-inch for off-shore pipelines, developed in Section 5.3.
These capital cost calculations, which have not been discounted, show that:
       The on-shore and off-shore storage options in gas fields for the CO2 from West Java
        are similar in capital cost, because the higher cost of off-shore pipelines is offset by
        some off-shore gas fields being nearer to the power plant;
       The cost of delivering CO2 from the South Sumatra power plant to gas field storage in
        South Sumatra is lower per tonne of CO2 delivered than the cost of delivering CO2
        from West Java to gas field storage in West Java because:
         o No long-distance transmission pipeline is needed; and
         o The gas fields in South Sumatra are more closely spaced than in West Java; and
       Distribution of CO2 to oil fields for EOR would require 3-4 times more CO2 delivery
        locations than distribution to gas fields, and hence greater distribution pipeline costs.
                                                                           57
6   STORAGE STUDY

“Underground accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a widespread geological
phenomenon, with natural trapping of CO2 in underground reservoirs. Information and
experience gained from the injection and/or storage of CO2 from a large number of existing
Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) and acid gas projects, as well as from the Sleipner, Weyburn
and In Salah projects, indicate that it is feasible to store CO2 in geological formations as a
CO2 mitigation option. Industrial analogues, including underground natural gas storage
projects around the world and acid gas injection projects, provide additional indications
that CO2 can be safely injected and stored at well-characterized and properly managed
sites. While there are differences between natural accumulations and engineered storage,
injecting CO2 into deep geological formations at carefully selected sites can store it
underground for long periods of time: it is considered likely that 99 percent or more of the
injected CO2 will be retained for 1000 years. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs, possibly coal
formations and particularly saline formations (deep underground porous reservoir rocks
saturated with brackish water or brine), can be used for storage of CO2. At depths below
about 800–1000 m, supercritical CO2 has a liquid-like density that provides the potential
for efficient utilization of underground storage space in the pores of sedimentary rocks.
Carbon dioxide can remain trapped underground by virtue of a number of mechanisms,
such as: trapping below an impermeable, confining layer (cap-rock); retention as an
immobile phase trapped in the pore spaces of the storage formation; dissolution in the in
situ formation fluids; and/or adsorption onto organic matter in coal and shale.
Additionally, it may be trapped by reacting with the minerals in the storage formation and
cap-rock to produce carbonate minerals. Models are available to predict what happens
when CO2 is injected underground. Also, by avoiding deteriorated wells or open fractures
or faults, injected CO2 will be retained for very long periods of time. Moreover, CO2
becomes less mobile over time as a result of multiple trapping mechanisms, further
lowering the prospect of leakage.” (IPCC, 2005)
In this study the prospects of three categories of geological storage of CO2 storage are
considered:
     Supply of captured CO2 for EOR activities in South Sumatra;
     Injection of CO2 into the pore volume vacated by natural gas production; and
     Injection of CO2 into deep saline aquifers.
The potential for storage of CO2 in deep un-mineable coal seams with the displacement of
coal bed methane has not been assessed, because it is not expected that suitable deep coal
seams compatible with the permanent CO2 storage criterion are available in West Java or
South Sumatra and permanent retention of CO2 in coal formations is questionable.

   6.1 Objectives of the storage study

The objectives of the CO2 storage component of the study are:
   •   To assess the potential capacity for geological CO2 storage, including:
           o Potential demand for high-cost CO2 for EOR, taking account of the availability
             of low-cost CO2 from other sources;
           o Capacity for storage of CO2 in depleted gas fields in South Sumatra;
           o    Capacity for storage of CO2 in depleted gas fields in West Java; and
           o Capacity for storage of CO2 in deep aquifers.
   •   To determine economic implications of CO2 storage in terms of:
           o Cost of preparation of gas fields for CO2 injection; and
           o Cost of monitoring and verification of stored CO2.
Additional details of the assessment of oil and gas well storage capacity carried out by
LEMIGAS are presented in Annex 4.

   6.2 Demand for CO2 for EOR in South Sumatra

The potential market for CO2 captured from power generation for EOR is discussed in detail
in Chapter 7. In this section the background to EOR is discussed and the potential total CO2
demand in South Sumatra is assessed.
An oil field is a geological formation from which liquid hydrocarbons (oil) can be pumped.
There may also be a small amount of hydrocarbon gas produced with the oil. Water is also
usually produced from an oil well. Production of oil by pumping continues until the yield of
oil falls to the level where the pumping operation is no longer economic. At that point, a
significant proportion of the Original Oil in Place (OOIP) still remains underground and
various methods of enhancing the recovery of oil (EOR) are considered by the oil production
company.
Fluids that might be injected into an oil field to enhance the recovery of oil include water, steam
and CO2. CO2 is a particularly effective fluid for enhancing the recovery of oil from an oil field,
because it mixes with the oil to reduce its viscosity, whereas other injected fluids such as water
just displace the oil. The decision to carry out EOR and the timing of that decision is an
economic decision for the oil field operator, which takes into account the specific
circumstances of the field and the value of the additional oil that would be recovered. That
economic decision sets the price that the oil field operator can afford to pay for CO2. In the
USA, prices of US$20-40 per tonne have reportedly been paid in some areas for CO2 for EOR.
There are two mechanisms for CO2-EOR, which depend on the nature of the oil field:
immiscible EOR and miscible EOR. Immiscible EOR occurs where the injected CO2 does not
mix with the oil, but instead displaces the oil from the area where the CO 2 is injected and
increases the pressure of the oil at the production wells so that it can be pumped out. Miscible

                                                59
EOR occurs where the supercritical CO2 mixes with the residual oil to make it less viscous and
facilitating its flow to the production wells. In the case of miscible EOR, some of the CO2
injected into the well would be produced back out of the well with the oil. Separation and
reinjection of that CO2 would be more economic for the oil company than buying new CO2.
Every application of EOR will be case-specific. However, by using generic assumptions, the
total demand for CO2 for EOR can be estimated from oil well data. The generic assumptions
are shown in Table 6-1 (IEAGHG, 2009) and (Taber, 1977).
        Table 6-1       Assumptions of oil recovery factors and CO2 requirements
                                                       Immiscible                Miscible
 Additional oil recoverable
                                                           5%                      12%

 (tonnes per standard barrel of oil)

In West Java no significant oil fields have been identified with the potential for the use of CO2
for EOR. In South Sumatra there is no CO2-EOR practiced at present, but there is potential for
large volumes of CO2 to be used for EOR.
Screening was undertaken on all of the 127 oil fields in South Sumatra, of which 96 are
identified as miscible and 31 as immiscible. That analysis has determined a total potential
demand of 243 million tonnes of CO2 for EOR. Of these oil fields, only 20 have a CO2 demand
of more than one million tonnes, comprising a total demand of 63.3 million tonnes of CO2. The
part of the total demand that might be met by CO2 captured from power plants is determined
in Chapter 7.
CO2 storage in oil wells without EOR
When an oil well reaches the end of its productive life, after secondary and tertiary production,
a significant proportion of the OOIP place will still remain underground. If such depleted oil
wells were to be used for CO2 storage without EOR infrastructure then there would be
displacement of oily water in sub-economic quantities, which could be costly to deal with.
Furthermore, unrecovered oil in a depleted oil field may be considered as a potential asset for
future exploitation in the event of a change in oil production economics or technology. If such
depleted oil wells were to be used for CO2 storage, then that residual oil would become
inaccessible for future exploitation and it would become a stranded asset.
Accordingly, storage of CO2 in depleted oil wells without EOR would not be attractive to oil
well owners and is therefore not considered viable as a basis for CCS.
   6.3 Potential CO2 storage in depleted gas fields

When a natural gas well is exploited, the pressure in the well gradually declines until it reaches
a low pressure at which production and processing of gas is no longer economic. At that point,
the gas well is usually sealed and closed. The vacant gas storage volume is well defined by the
quantity of gas that has been produced and the geological seal of the formation is indicated by

                                               60
the former presence of natural gas. Therefore, depleted gas fields are considered to be prime
locations for the storage of captured CO2.
A work-over of an old gas well would be required to ensure its integrity, but the ability to use
existing wells means that drilling of new wells would probably be avoided. Long-term
monitoring of the stored CO2 would be required to ensure permanent retention of CO2.

       6.3.1   Relative CO2 and natural gas volumes
The relative densities of CO2 and natural gas depend on the pressures involved and on the
geothermal gradient. A depleted gas field could store 1.4 to 2.4 molecules of supercritical CO2
per molecule of natural gas previously in place, calculated as follows.
When the pressure of natural gas from a gas well drops to a low-value (in the region of 10 bar)
and the flowrate of gas declines, then the gas well is closed in and usually sealed with a cement
plug. When all the gas wells in a gas field have been exhausted and sealed, then that field
becomes a resource for CO2 storage.
CO2 can be injected into a depleted gas well until the pressure is restored to the pressure of the
original gas in place. Therefore the volume of CO2 injected should be the same as the total
volume of natural gas that has been produced over the life time of the field. Under storage
conditions in a gas field, the CO2 will be a supercritical fluid because the pressure will be above
the critical pressure of CO2 and, due to the geothermal gradient, the temperature of the CO2
will be above the critical temperature. The CO2 density and the density of the original gas will
depend on the depth of the gas field.

Figure 6.1 shows the mass of CO2 that can potentially be stored in a depleted gas field as a
function of the depth of the field. This chart is based on the following assumptions:
      The pressure in the field is equal to the hydrostatic head; and
      The geothermal gradient is 45oC per kilometer of depth, which is typical of conditions
       in South Sumatra.



                                                                    61
Over the typical range of gas field depths from 500 meters to 2500 meters the average storage
capacity factor is 0.0512 million tonnes of CO2 per billion standard cubic feet (BSCF) of natural
gas produced. This can be used as the default storage factor when the depth of a gas field is not
known.

                                6.3.2    CO2 storage capacity in gas fields in West Java and South Sumatra
LEMIGAS has carried out a survey of gas fields and has identified 51 gas fields in West Java
and 45 gas field in South Sumatra with their expected total gas yield and their expected year of
abandoning. From these data a cumulative gas field storage capacity curve has been compiled.
West Java
Figure 6-2 shows cumulative CO2 storage curves for gas fields in West Java, which amounts
to a total of 395 million tonnes of CO2 storage available up to 2050. That CO2 storage capacity
comprises 224 million tonnes in 29 off-shore fields (of which 219 million tonnes of storage
capacity is in 17 fields; each with more than 1 million tonnes of CO2 storage capacity) plus 171
million tonnes in 22 on-shore fields (of which 167 million tonnes of storage capacity is in 16
fields; each with more than 1 million tonnes of CO2 storage capacity)
Also shown on Figure 6-2 is the maximum production of CO2 from the West Java power plant
assuming that CCS is implemented on both units at 90 percent capture from 2025 to the end of
the design life of the power plant in 2045.

the West Java power plant under the conditions of the greatest CO2 production scenario.



                                                                      62
Therefore, this provides the storage element for definition of CCS-ready status for the West
Java power plant.
Figure 6-2 shows that the subject reference CCS scenario for West Java would use all the
storage capacity of off-shore gas fields. There would then be some further CO2 storage capacity
for CO2 on shore with capacity for CO2 from other power plants in West Java, or for a 16 year
life extension of the subject West Java power plant.
South Sumatra
Figure 6-3 shows the cumulative storage curve for gas fields in South Sumatra, which amounts
to 537 million tonnes of CO2 storage available in 45 fields up to 2050. Of that CO2 storage
capacity, 531 million tonnes is located in 32 larger fields, predominantly more distant fields to
the north. Also shown on Figure 6-3 is the maximum production of CO2 from the South
Sumatra power plant assuming that CCS is implemented at 90 percent capture from 2027 to
the end of the design life of the power plant in 2047.

Figure 6-3 shows that CO2 storage in gas fields in South Sumatra is easily adequate to meet the
needs of the subject South Sumatra power plant under the conditions of the greatest CO2
production scenario. Therefore, this provides the storage element for definition of CCS-ready
status for the South Sumatra power plant.
There would be sufficient additional CO2 storage capacity in South Sumatra gas fields for a 20
year life extension of the nominal 600 MW South Sumatra power plant at 90 percent capture
plus a further 2500 nominal MW of coal-fired power generation with 90 percent CO2 capture
for 25 years, which would actually yield a net 1750 MW with CCS implemented.
   6.4 Potential CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers

       6.4.1                              Principles of aquifer storage of CO2
Annex 5 presents a detailed review carried out by LEMIGAS of the geology of South Sumatra
and West Java. Prospects for locations suitable for CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers require

                                                                       63
a porous formation overlaid by an impervious cap-rock formation. Some potentially suitable
pairings of formations have been identified for further study, and likely volumetric capacities
have been estimated.
A recent international review of potential storage capacities in deep saline aquifers (IEAGHG,
2014) presents a comparison of volumetric and dynamic storage resource estimation methods
for deep saline formations. This report identifies that very long time frames (e.g., out to 500
years) might be required for the capacity determined by volumetric analysis to be filled with
CO2 when the dynamics of CO2 injection into deep aquifers is taken into account. This report
also suggests that potential storage capacity in deep saline aquifers could be a small fraction of
the theoretical volume based on the area and thickness of formations, when the dynamics of
CO2 injection is taken into account over the relatively short timeframe of the life of a power
plant.
Annex 6 presents a discussion of monitoring requirements for CO2 storage, which identifies
various potential CO2 leakage pathways that would need to be monitored. These include faults,
boreholes and spill points. Extensive site-by-site characterization would be required to build
confidence in each potential aquifer storage location. Then, comprehensive monitoring would
be required to ensure that the long-term storage objectives are met.
Since about 1996, the Norwegian Sleipner project has achieved satisfactory storage of about
one million tonnes per year of CO2 stripped from natural gas in a deep saline aquifer below the
sea floor. It is reported (MIT, 2014) that the CO2 injection at Sleipner costs US$17 per tonne
of CO2 in order to avoid Norwegian carbon taxes of about US$60 per tonne of CO2.
An important factor with regard to consideration of permanent storage of CO2 in geological
aquifers is the difference between the density and viscosity of CO2 and water. At suitable
geological formation depths for CO2 storage (i.e., greater than 800 meters and up to 2,000
meters) the down-hole pressure might be between 100 bar and 200 bar. The underground
temperature also increases with depth due to the geothermal gradient. Figure 6-4 shows the
formation pressures and temperatures for the 52 formations in South Sumatra assessed by
LEMIGAS.
Figure 6.4 shows the density of supercritical CO2 at each of the down-hole sets of conditions
surveyed. These density values range from 200 to 420 kg/m3 compared with the density of
water of 1000 kg/m3. Hence, CO2 will be very buoyant, relative to water, in porous formations.
Furthermore, the viscosity of supercritical CO2 at down-hole conditions is about ten times
lower than the viscosity of water. Also, supercritical CO2 would have no surface tension effects
to inhibit flow through fine cracks in the cap-rock. Therefore, without the evidence of a seal
provided by the presence of trapped hydrocarbons, the potential for leakage of CO2 from saline
aquifers would be high.

In view of these considerations, the prospect of identifying and characterizing sufficient deep
saline aquifer storage locations in South Sumatra and West Java to accommodate reliably 14.7
million tonnes per year of CO2 is not a sound basis for definition of capture-ready status.

       6.4.2     Methodology of aquifer storage assessment
An assessment of the potential CO2 storage capacity in deep aquifers can be made by
multiplying together:
      The areal extent of suitable porous formations;
      The average thickness of suitable porous formations;
      The porosity of suitable porous formations;
      The density of CO2 at the temperature and pressure conditions in the formation; and
      A storage efficiency factor.
The area, thickness and porosity of candidate formations can be estimated from seismic
analysis. Such analysis is carried out intensively in hydrocarbon producing areas, where it may
be supplemented by data from exploratory drilling for oil and gas. However, in other areas,
without limited seismic surveying, the scale of suitable candidate porous formations can only
be approximately inferred.
Where down-hole temperature and pressure conditions are not known, they can be inferred
from known conditions at shallower depths via the local hydrostatic gradient and the local
geothermal gradient, so that the density of supercritical CO2 at any particular depth can be
estimated reasonably well with empirical formulae, as used to compile Figure 6-4.
The storage efficiency factor for injected CO2 has been extensively studied based on empirical
evidence. Clastic rocks, such as sandstone, have different efficiency factors from deposited
rocks such as limestone. Furthermore, there are significant discrepancies between the potential
efficiency factor using different methodologies. Table 6-2 lists examples of efficiency factors




                                                       65
reported by USDOE in 2010 and lower efficiency factors reported in IJGGC (Goodman, 2011).
These factors are defined in terms of probabilities (P10, P50 and P90).15
The sets of formation data compiled by LEMIGAS for assessment of aquifer storage capacity
comprise porous formations that are separate from, and additional to, the known hydrocarbon-
bearing formations that comprise oil and gas fields. Therefore, the assessed aquifer storage
capacity is additional to the storage capacity previously assessed in oil fields and gas fields.

Based on the relative proportions of clastic and limestone rocks and the USDOE methodology
at P50, the efficiency factors used in the analysis in this report are 14.0 percent for South
Sumatra, based on 52 data points, and 14.8 percent for West Java, based on 22 data points.

Finally, the aquifer storage capacities determined from available geotechnical data (largely
from oil and gas basins) are extrapolated to cover the whole of the prospective areas of South
Sumatra and West Java by multiplying by area factors of 5 and 3, respectively. The variance
shown in Table 6-2 (3 percent to 24 percent) and the use of extrapolation indicates that there is
large uncertainty in the estimated CO2 storage capacity in aquifers.

The storage assessment methodology is based only the volume of porous rock. The
methodology does not include any assessment of the impermeability of overlying formations,
which would be required to act as cap-rock. In particular, porous rock formations that are not
overlain by hydrocarbon-bearing formations, have no inherent indication of the absence of
potential pathways for vertical migration of supercritical CO2 to the surface.

        6.4.3    Potential for aquifer storage of CO2 in South Sumatra
An analysis of 52 sets of South Sumatra data, compiled by LEMIGAS for deep aquifers in
hydrocarbon basins, identified 1776 square kilometers of candidate formations, at an average
depth of 1350 meters, an average thickness of 47 meters, and with an average porosity of 20
percent. The average density of CO2 under those conditions is 0.29 kg/liter. According to the
USDOE methodology, with an average storage efficiency factor of 14.0 percent, the total CO2
storage capacity in those 52 locations would be 696 million tonnes (or 683 million tonnes in
41 locations each with more than 2 million tonnes of capacity). Alternatively, according to the
methodology detailed in the International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, with a median

storage efficiency factor of 5.7 percent, the total CO2 storage capacity would be 285 million
tonnes (or 279 million tonnes in 41 locations each with more than 1 million tonnes of capacity).
To estimate the total potential CO2 storage in aquifers in South Sumatra, the assessed capacity
is escalated by a factor of 5 to give estimates of 3,480 or 1,425 million tonnes of CO2 storage
according to the two assessment methodologies.

       6.4.4   Potential for aquifer storage of CO2 in West Java
An analysis of 21 sets of West Java data, compiled by LEMIGAS for deep aquifers in
hydrocarbon basins, identified 542 square kilometers of candidate formations, at an average
depth of 1140 meters, an average thickness of 85 meters, and with an average porosity of 25
percent. The average density of CO2 under those conditions is 0.26 kg/liter. According to the
USDOE methodology, with an average storage efficiency factor of 14.3 percent, the total CO2
storage capacity in those 21 locations would be 380 million tonnes (or 377 million tonnes in
18 locations each with capacity more than 2 million tonnes). Alternatively, according to the
methodology detailed in IJGGC, with a median storage efficiency factor of 6.1 percent, the
total CO2 storage capacity in 21 locations would be 162 million tonnes (or 160 million tonnes
in 18 locations each with capacity more than 1 million tonnes.)
To estimate the total potential CO2 storage in aquifers in West Java, the assessed capacity is
escalated by a factor of 3 to give estimates of 485 or 1,140 million tonnes of CO2 storage
according to the two assessment methodologies.

   6.5 Monitoring of stored CO2

Figure 6-5 (not to scale and modified from (Goerne, 2010)) illustrates potential leakage
pathways for geologically stored CO2. In the context of CCS, the primary purpose of
monitoring is to ensure that leakage of CO2 in minimal and that any minor leakage is quantified
in order to certify the effectiveness of CO2 storage. If actual and potential leakage of CO2 is
confirmed as minimal, then any concerns over health and safety issues at the surface may be
dismissed. The wide range of monitoring methods that would be required are described in
Annex 6.

A case study on the cost of monitoring of CO2 storage in a deep aquifer has been carried out
for the Indonesian Gundih project. The costs are summarized in Table 6-3 and presented in
more detail in Annex 6.

Table 6.4 indicates that the total cost of short-term and long-term monitoring of a single CO2
storage location could be in the region of US$50 million. The CO2 storage assessments
presented above indicate that a large number of storage locations would be required for each
of the CO2 storage options assessed. The average quantities of CO2 that would be stored in
locations with more than one million tonnes of CO2 capacity are determined in Table 6-4.

   6.6 Other CCS storage studies in Indonesia

Two CO2 storage capacity assessments are currently under way:
Feasibility Study of Gundih Gas Field (central Java). This study is funded by the Asian
Development bank (ADB) as part of the joint effort between ADB and the Japan International
Cooperation Agency (JICA) on the Pilot Study for Carbon Sequestration and Monitoring in
Gundih Area. The site studied is located at Pertamina’s Gundih gas field in central Java. This
project aims to be the first in Southeast Asia to research and develop technology for CCS along
with management and leakage monitoring. Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) was chosen as
the research institute to carry out the assessment. ADB plans to bear the costs associated with
sequestration in the pilot project if the survey finds an appropriate site and the Indonesian
government makes a formal request.
CO2 Storage Screening Study on a Coal Gasification Project (South Sumatra). This study is
currently in planning by Reliance Power Ltd for a Coal to Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) project
located within the coal mine area of ID-1 in South Sumatra. The SNG plant has a planned
capacity of 4.2 MMscmd (146 MMscfd). Reliance has engaged an international engineering
and manufacturing firm, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), to carry out a Pre-Feasibility
study to examine cost of CO2 capture technology ‘inside project boundaries’. JCoal and
LEMIGAS are also involved in this project.

   6.7 Costs of CO2 storage

The capital costs of pipelines to deliver CO2 from a power plant to gas field storage locations
are assessed in Table 5-4. In West Java, the pipeline capital expenditures (capex) would be
about US$3 per tonne of CO2 delivered. In the case of South Sumatra, where the power plant
is closer to the candidate gas fields, the pipeline capex would be about US$1 per tonne of CO2
on average.
As determined in Section 6.5, the cost of monitoring is likely to be on average about US$3.5
per tonne of CO2 stored.
The other cost center for CO2 storage is well preparation. LEMIGAS advises that the capex
from drilling a monitoring well to 2000 m depth might be about US$1 million and the cost of
reworking an existing well as a monitoring well might be about US$0.7 million. Injection wells
would need to be a large diameter than monitoring wells and would require some surface
infrastructure. Other US references indicate well drilling costs in the region of US$3-4 million
per well. Access to all the CO2 storage capacity in a gas field may require a few wells to be
drilled or reworked.

   6.8 Long-term CO2 storage capacity in South Sumatra

The primary objective of this study is to assess the technical and economic impacts of the
application of CCS to two specific power plants over a specific time frame. However, the
implementation of CCS will only occur within the context of long-term policy objectives to
adopt CCS as a contributory strategy for meeting Indonesia’s CO2 emission reduction


                                              69
obligations. In that context, the long-term availability of storage capacity for CO2 from all
sources needs to be considered. The following analysis is carried out on the basis of the CO2
production and storage capacity in South Sumatra.
The following assumptions are made:

      CCS at 90 percent capture is applied to the subject South Sumatra power plant
       (600MWe reduced to 415 MWe net output) from 2027 onwards, requiring 3.68
       million tonnes per year of CO2 storage;
      Capacity factor equals 80 percent with CCS, so that total power generated is 2.9 TWh
       per year. Thus, the CO2 stored would be 1.265 tonnes per MWh;
      All new coal-fired power generation capacity after 2027 would have 90 percent CO2
       capture installed with the same performance parameter of 1.265 tonnes of CO2 per
       MWh;
      The life of the subject South Sumatra power plant with CCS would be extended
       indefinitely.
      South Sumatra electricity production in 2024 is projected to be 14.198 TWh per year
       (RUPTL 2015 Table A8.3);
      Electricity production in South Sumatra grows at 8 percent per year to 2027, reducing
       to 5 percent per year by 2037 and to 3 percent by 2050 and 3 percent thereafter;
      60 percent of electricity is generated from coal in 2027 increasing to 80 percent by
       2037 and thereafter;
      CCS is only applied to new coal fired power generation;
      From 2020, 2 million tonnes per year of CO2 from natural gas processing and other
       industrial sources would be used for EOR, and any surplus would be stored beyond
       2027;
      From 2020, 4.5 million tonnes per year of CO2 would be available from the proposed
       SNG plant to be used for EOR, and any surplus would be stored beyond 2027;
      No CO2 from outside of South Sumatra (e.g., Natuna CO2) would be stored in South
       Sumatra;
      CO2 demand for EOR is 243 million tonnes (See Chapter 7);
      CO2 storage capacity in depleted gas wells in South Sumatra is 537 million tonnes
       (See 6.3.2); and
      CO2 storage capacity in saline aquifers in South Sumatra is 1,425 to 3,480 million
       tonnes (See 6.4.3).
On the basis of the foregoing assumptions, Figure 6-6 shows the impact of CCS on the installed
power generation capacity and indicates the timeframes on which the assessed CO2 storage
capacities would become fully utilized.
The nominal generation capacity indicates the amount of power generation plant that would be
installed on a no-CCS basis. The actual generation capacity indicates the amount of electricity
that could be produced with CCS in place.

In view of the projected growth in coal fired generation, particularly in South Sumatra, if CCS
is adopted as a means of meeting Indonesia’s CO2 emission reduction objectives then CCS
would become constrained by the storage capacity of CO2. The surplus CO2 storage capacity
in South Sumatra’s gas fields would likely be all used by the middle of the century and the
potential storage capacity identified in deep aquifers would likely be used up by the end of the
century.

7.        EOR MARKET REVIEW

The use of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery presents a potential income stream for CO2 captured
from power plants as a cost-offsetting mechanism for CCS projects. It also provides a
demonstration of CO2 storage techniques. Furthermore, from the perspective of the CCS
operator, EOR transfers CO2 storage-related liabilities and costs to the oil field operators. Due
to its long history of oil and gas exploration, and the abundance of oil and gas fields, South
Sumatra has been identified as an attractive region for EOR.
This chapter comprises the following parts:
         an introduction on using CO2 for EOR;
         an EOR market assessment with projections of supply and demand for CO2 in South
          Sumatra; and
         a qualitative assessment of EOR as a cost-offsetting mechanism for CCS projects in
          Indonesia.

7.1       CO2 for EOR

The injection of CO2 into a depleted/depleting oil well is a well-established method of
enhancing the recovery of oil, while also providing a secure geological trap for storing some
CO2 within reservoirs that previously held oil in place for millions of years. The use of CO2 for
EOR has been proven effective in many parts of the world, particularly in the USA. The use of
CO2 for EOR is by far the largest potential market for CO2 as a commodity. EOR is not
practiced in Indonesia at present, but it is expected that EOR technology will start to be
exploited in South Sumatra from about 2020. The existing infrastructure and know-how in the
oil and gas industry will also help facilitate demonstration of CO2 transportation and storage
methods.
In order to recover additional oil from a depleting oil reservoir, the pressure within the reservoir
has to be raised to its initial level. That process is usually achieved through flooding the
reservoir with water or pressurized CO2. The latter is generally considered more effective,
albeit more costly. There are two types of CO2 flooding mechanisms:
         the miscible mechanism where CO2 dissolves in the oil, thus reducing its viscosity,
          density, and residual concentration, while increasing its mobility; and
         the immiscible mechanism where pressurized CO2 serves only to push oil from different
          parts of the reservoir towards the production wells.

7.2       Supply of CO2 in South Sumatra

The supply of pure CO2 in South Sumatra suitable for EOR could come from three principal
sources: CO2 stripped from natural gas, by-product CO2 from a proposed SNG plant, and CO2
captured from coal-fired power plant flue gas. There also may be other industrial sources of
by-product CO2. Emissions of CO2 in other flue gases are less amenable to CO2 capture than


                                                72
power plant flue gas, because the integration of the energy requirement into a power plant
steam cycle is an essential feature of an efficient CO2 capture scheme.

      7.2.1       Emissions from low cost by-product CO2 sources
In contrast to power plant flue gases that contain 10 -20 percent CO2 and require costly and
energy intensive separation, there are some sources of pure by-product CO2 in South Sumatra,
which would only require compression and transport to be ready to use in EOR applications.
The main sources of by-product CO2 are:
           CO2 removed from high CO2 natural gas resources to prepare it for delivery to
            customers. Such CO2 sources arise at gas gathering stations where the CO2 content of
            raw natural gas might need to be reduced from 10-30 percent CO2 down to 4 percent
            CO2 for delivery to customers; and
           CO2 stripped from shifted synthesis gas in the proposed Synthetic Natural Gas plant
            that will make SNG from coal. The developers of this process have already identified
            the EOR market as a commercial outlet for the by-product CO2 that the SNG process
            produces, which would reduce the embedded carbon content of the SNG product.
In total, by-product CO2 sources in Sumatra are likely to amount to over six million tonnes of
CO2 per year. The availability of these low-cost, ready-to-use sources of CO2 will impact on
the EOR demand for high-cost CO2 captured from coal-fired power plant flue gases.

          7.2.2    Projection of CO2 emissions from power plants in South Sumatra
Power sector CO2 emissions are expected to continue growing in the coming decade as
indicated in Chapter 2. The power sector has good data availability in the sector’s master plan
RUPTL. The current RUPTL (2015) indicates overall plans for new coal-fired power
generation capacity in South Sumatra are about ten times greater than the capacity of the South
Sumatra power plant considered in this study.

7.3         EOR market assessment in South Sumatra

          7.3.1    Scope of the assessment
The study assessed a total of 127 oil fields in South Sumatra as potential sites to use CO 2 for
EOR, as shown on Figure 7-1. Of all the oil fields investigated, only 52 have detailed
information based on which reliable estimates of the reservoir capacity can be made, whereas
the remaining fields only have information on depth, from which rough estimates of the
reservoir capacity can be extrapolated.

          7.3.2    Methodology
EOR reservoir screenings were performed on the 52 oil fields on which detailed information
was available using the screening criteria proposed by Taber et al. The criteria include a set of
parameters -- such as API gravity16, oil viscosity, current pressure, temperature, oil saturation,


16
  API Gravity is defined by the American Petroleum institute as = 141.5/RD – 131.5, where RD is the relative
density compared to water.

                                                     73
remaining oil, formation depth, thickness, porosity, permeability, and rock type -- which help
determine whether or not a reservoir is suitable for CO2 injection for EOR. For the remaining
75 fields on which incomplete information was available, reservoir capacity was estimated
using depth data assuming that oil fields deeper than 1 km were categorized as miscible while
those shallower than 1 km were categorized as immiscible. Moreover, the reservoir pressures
of the 75 fields where only depth was known were inferred from the pressure gradients of the
52 fields with more complete data.

                   Figure 7-1     Oil Field Locations in South Sumatra




     7.3.3     Estimated EOR capacity
Based on the above methodologies, 96 of 127 oil fields, including the five largest reservoirs,
were classified as miscible fields, and the remaining 31 immiscible. The 127 fields have a
combined estimated capacity for around 243 million tonnes of CO2 for EOR, as detailed in
Chapter 6, which could recover approximately 661 million standard barrels of oil. An estimated
162 million tonnes of the demand for CO2 will likely be absorbed by low-cost sources of CO2
supplies, such as by-products from natural gas processing and the proposed SNG plant. The
remaining demand of 81 million tonnes of CO2 is only sufficient to absorb the CO2 captured
from the South Sumatra plant, but not enough for the West Java plant, as shown in Table 7-1.

       7.3.4   EOR demand profile
Figure 7-2 shows the typical profile for CO2 demand for an oil well over 25 years of CO2
enhanced oil production. This profile shows a high demand in the early years for flooding,
peaking in Year 4, followed by a declining CO2 demand in later years. This CO2 demand profile
is based on overseas EOR experience, mostly in the USA, adapted by LEMIGAS for the mix
of miscible and immiscible EOR opportunities in South Sumatra.

       7.3.5   Supply and demand considerations
The implementation of a CO2-EOR operation on a depleted oil field will depend on the
availability of an adequate supply of CO2. The foregoing assessment and profile indicates that
on average about 2 million tonnes of CO2 would be required over 25 years for an EOR
campaign on each oil field. Before commencing an EOR campaign, an oil field operator would
need to be confident that adequate CO2 would be available over the life of the EOR campaign.
Therefore, the uptake of EOR would be constrained by the availability of CO2 and EOR would
probably not be commenced on an oil field until a dedicated supply of CO2 was known to be
available.
Three CO2 supply scenarios are considered:
       Scenario 1 – only by-product CO2 is available from existing natural gas processing
        plants combined with other industrial sources, which is assumed to be 2 million tonnes
        per year available indefinitely for EOR;
       Scenario 2 – in addition, by-product CO2 from the proposed Synthetic Natural Gas Plant
        would be available for EOR at a rate of 4.5 million tonnes per year indefinitely; and
       Scenario 3 – in addition, CO2 captured from the South Sumatra Power Plant under
        consideration would be available for EOR at a rate of 3.7 million tonnes per year from
        2027 to 2047.
Figure 7-3 shows projected supply and demand balances for each of the above scenarios based
on CO2 demand profile shown in Figure 7-2.

                                                 Scenario 2 - CO2 supply          Scenario 3 - CO2 supply

EOR Supply Scenario 1 assumes that the availability of pure pipelined commodity CO2 is
limited to that available from gas processing plants, with maybe other relatively small sources
from industrial plants; and that those sources combined could deliver 2 million tonnes of
commodity CO2 per year indefinitely. On that basis, it would take over 120 years to supply
sufficient CO2 to exploit all the EOR potential identified.
EOR Supply Scenario 2 assumes that the proposed coal to SNG plant is built in 2017 and can
supply 4.5 million tonnes per year of commodity CO2 to the EOR market. Figure 7-3 shows
that would enable a large number of oil field EOR operations to be commenced earlier. Under
Scenario 2 there would be sufficient CO2 available for EOR to have been commenced on all
127 candidate oil fields by about 2045. The demand profile shown in Figure 7-2 means that
there would be EOR operations continuing in South Sumatra through to beyond 2060.
EOR supply Scenario 3 assumes that there is also commodity CO2 available at 3.7 million
tonnes per year captured from the South Sumatra power plant from 2027 to 2047 as well as the
SNG CO2 and CO2 from other sources. Figure 7-3 shows that this larger supply of CO2 would
enable more EOR to be exploited earlier and that all EOR opportunities could be in operation
by about 2035. Under this scenario, all EOR activity would be completed by 2060 and the
amount of SNG CO2 used for EOR would be reduced by the amount supplied by CO2 captured
from the power plant, which would be about two thirds of all the power plant CO2 produced
between 2027 and 2047.
Although the availability of CO2 for EOR is constrained by supply under Scenario 3 from 2029
to 2038, the scope for accommodating more CO2 from other sources would be limited to about
2 million tonnes per year for a few years. That opportunity is insufficient to justify pipelining
captured CO2 from West Java to South Sumatra.



                                                                             76
Figure 7-3 shows that there is potential for more than half of the CO2 captured from the South
Sumatra power plant to be sold for EOR within the region, and thereby bring forward EOR
operations and reduce the cost of CO2 capture. However, that would displace later use of other
by-product CO2 and therefore, over time, would not affect the overall storage of CO2.
Figure 7.3 also shows that well before the end of the planned 25-year life of the South Sumatra
power plant there would be no more demand for CO2 from that source for EOR. So EOR does
not provide on-going storage for CO2 captured from power plants in South Sumatra.

7.4     Economic considerations concerning EOR for CO2 Storage in Indonesia

Several key findings have emerged from the EOR market assessment and the plant level studies
in this chapter. Although the demand for CO2 in EOR is sizable in South Sumatra, it is
insufficient to absorb all the CO2 captured from both reference power plants in the high capture
percentage scenarios even if there were no competing source of CO2 supply.

Given the supplies of CO2 for EOR from other sources are likely motivated by similar policy
drivers, the various CO2 supplies are likely to compete for EOR market share. Thus, CO2
captured from thermal power plants will likely be competing with CO2 available from other
sources for the limited EOR opportunities available. From the perspective of the cost of CO 2
capture and supply, at approximately US$70-80 per tonne of CO2 from coal-fired power plants,
the power sector would be at a commercial disadvantage compared with sources such as natural
gas processing, which only involves compression and transport at an estimated US$28 per ton
of CO2 (ADB, 2013).

Moreover, the upside offered by EOR to CCS projects is subjected to further uncertainties with
respect to the following factors:
The willingness-to-pay for CO2 for EOR
Oil field operators will only be willing to purchase CO2 when the prevailing oil market price
can justify the incremental cost of CO2 for the EOR operation. Thus, the volatility of the oil
price will be one of the key risk factors on the upside that EOR may provide. If 243 million
tonnes of CO2 can release 661 million tonnes of additional oil via EOR in South Sumatra, then
a purchase price of say US$40 per tonne of CO2 (as has reportedly been paid in some deals in
the USA), would add about US$15 to the production cost of a barrel of oil.
The cost of delivery of CO2 to the EOR sites
Pipeline cost is a function of the distance between the CO2 source and the EOR sites, and the
quantity of the CO2 transported through the pipeline. A long-distance CO2 delivery route from
West Java for part of the CO2 would render opportunities of EOR unattractive due to the
remaining need for alternative delivery routes for CO2 from that source to other CO2 storage
sites. Moreover, in a competitive market, with uncertainties of demand, the actual quantity of
CO2 transmitted through a pipeline for EOR may experience considerable fluctuation, running
the risk of the pipeline becoming a stranded asset.



                                               77
Continuity of supply for EOR
The nature of power plant operation is that it follows electricity demand. Even the base load
plants proposed would only have 80 percent capacity factor, with significant down time for
planned maintenance and unplanned outages. The very large volumes of high-pressure CO2
involved would make CO2 storage for significant periods impractical. It is noted in Chapter 5
that pipeline storage of CO2 would be no more than an hour or so. EOR operators may be
reluctant to enter into contracts for CO2 supplies on an interruptible basis.

Given all the above considerations, the South Sumatra power plant is well placed to take
advantage of EOR opportunities is South Sumatra, whereas the West Java power plant is not.
Moreover, EOR should only be viewed as a supplemental cost-offsetting mechanism in South
Sumatra, instead of the primary means of CO2 storage for either of the two reference power
plants specifically, or for the power sector in general.

8.          THE ECONOMICS OF CCS

This chapter assesses the incremental costs and benefits of CCS.
On the cost front, the assessments comprise:
           the levelized cost of electricity from the two reference power plants in West Java and
            South Sumatra without CCS;
           the incremental cost of CCS on the LCOE under different scenarios;
           a comparison of the reference coal-fired power plants with CCS to alternative
            technologies on a LCOE basis; and
           an economic assessment of EOR as a cost-offsetting mechanism for CCS.
On the benefit front, the assessments include:
           the global environmental benefit of reduced emissions of CO2; and
           the local environmental and health benefits of reduced emissions of local pollutants in
            the form of NOx, SO2 and particulates.

       8.1.2     Capture Scenarios
In order to provide a systematic and comprehensive approach for considering CCS retrofit to
the power plants, three cases of commercial-scale CCS were investigated: 22.5 percent, 45
percent and 90 percent of CO2 capture, respectively. The corresponding CO2 emissions used
for the economic analysis are shown in Figure 8-1, and are based on nominal gross power
outputs with 8 percent own-use as distinct from the nominal net power output basis used in the
technical analysis. These cases are developed to show the dependence of energy penalty, utility
requirements, and capital cost increment on the extent of CO2 capture recovery.

Based on the above assumptions, the LCOE was estimated at 7.5 cent/kWh and 6.4 cent/kWh
for the West Java and South Sumatra power plants, respectively. The lower LCOE from the
South Sumatra plant was primarily driven by the lower cost of coal at the mine mouth.

8.3         The incremental cost of CO2 capture

     8.3.1    Cost of CO2 Capture Investments
CO2 capture requires additional investments in the following equipment:
      a.    high efficiency Flue Gas Desulphurization units;
      b.    high efficiency Selective Catalytic Reduction units;
      c.    MEA CO2 capture process;
      d.    CO2 compression and dehydration plant, and
      e.    Pass out steam power recovery turbine.
Some of the above-mentioned equipment is installed in multiple units, as detailed in Table 4.6,
to accommodate the very large volumes of gas involved.

Of all the required CO2 capture equipment, the most expensive item is the MEA scrubber,
which is the main process for separating CO2 from the power plant flue gas. Under the 90
percent capture scenario, the MEA scrubber accounts for more than half of the incremental
investments. Table 8-2 provides a summary of the corresponding investment level in each
capture scenario.

           8.3.2     Energy Penalty
CO2 capture is an energy-consuming process. Energy for the thermal swing process, with which
MEA captures CO2, reduces electricity production and the subsequent process of CO2
dehydration and compression consumes electricity. The additional energy consumed for
capturing CO2 is a “penalty” to the net output of the power plant. The higher the capture
percentage, the more energy it will consume, thus the higher the energy penalty. Table 8-3
provides a summary of the energy penalties for the two reference power plants.

       8.3.3      O&M costs
Besides the energy penalty, CO2 capture will also incur additional operation and maintenance
(O&M) costs. Table 8-2 provides a summary of the estimated incremental annual O&M cost
associated with each CO2 capture scenario.

       8.3.4      Impact of CO2 capture on LCOE
Under the no implementation delay scenario, CO2 capture alone results in an estimated
additional cost of 2.1-6.8 US cents per kWh in West Java, and 2.6 – 8.4 US cents per kWh in
South Sumatra, on the LCOE, depending on capture fraction. Under the 90 percent capture
scenario, the energy penalty comprises more than half the CO2 capture-related incremental cost.
Table 8-4 provides a summary of the breakdown of incremental LCOE resulting from different
CO2 capture fractions at the power plant.

8.4      CO2 Transportation and Storage

       8.4.1      CO2 transportation
Incremental cost of CO2 transportation
CO2 is captured and compressed at the power plant. A pipeline will be constructed to transport
the captured CO2 to a distribution hub from which CO2 distribution pipelines will be
constructed to the storage and/or EOR locations. The incremental investment required for CO2
transmission and distribution is a function of the length of the pipeline and its diameter, the
latter of which is determined by the maximum quantity of CO2 to be transmitted through the
pipeline at any given time. The investment cost is assumed at US$50,000 per kilometre per
inch in diameter for on-shore pipelines, and at US$75,000 per km-inch for off-shore pipelines.
The annual O&M for CO2 transportation is assumed at 8 percent of the total investment costs
of CO2 transportation pipelines.


                                               82
The West Java power plant is considerably farther from the identified CO2 storage locations in
West Java than the South Sumatra power plant is from nearby CO2 storage locations in South
Sumatra. Moreover, at the same capture percentage, the West Java plant has approximately
three times more CO2 to be transported than the South Sumatra plant. As a result, the
incremental cost associated with CO2 transmission is considerably higher for West Java than
for South Sumatra. Table 8-5 provides a summary of the incremental investments for CO2
transportation under each scenario.

Impact of CO2 transportation on LCOE
Under the no-delay scenario, on an LCOE basis, the incremental cost of CO2 transportation is
relatively small -- at most 0.9 US cents per kWh and 0.4 US cents per kWh for West Java and
South Sumatra, respectively -- compared with an incremental cost of 6.8 US cents per kWh
and 8.4 US cents per kWh from CO2 capture for each case, respectively. Table 8-6 provides a
summary of the incremental cost of CO2 transportation.

     8.4.2     CO2 storage
Incremental cost of CO2 storage
In places where existing infrastructure, such as depleted oil and gas fields, are available and
can be used for storing CO2, the incremental costs associated with CO2 storage is relatively
small. To be conservative, this study assumes an incremental investment of US$3 million per
work-over of each depleted well, plus US$1 million per well in potential liabilities, and an
additional 8 percent in annual O&M. The corresponding investments are shown in Table 8-7.

Impact of CO2 storage on LCOE
Under the no delay scenario, the incremental cost of CO2 storage is as low as 0.2 and 0.3 US
cents per kWh for West Java and South Sumatra, respectively, accounting for less than 4
percent of the total incremental cost of CCS. Table 8-8 provides a summary of the incremental
cost of CO2 storage under different scenarios.

8.5    The incremental cost of CCS

      8.5.1   LCOE of coal-fired generation with CCS
Under the 90 percent capture with no implementation delay scenario, the CCS process will
more than double the cost of supply from both reference plants, raising the LCOE from 7.5
US cents/kWh to 16.1 US cents/kWh in West Java, and from 6.4 US cents/kWh to 15.2
US cents/kWh in South Sumatra. The energy penalty is the key contributor to the incremental
cost of CCS, accounting for nearly half of the total incremental cost under the 90 percent
scenario.
Table 8-9 and Table 8-10 provide a summary of the incremental cost breakdown under each
scenario.
Both implementation timing of CCS and capture percentage play important roles with respect
to the incremental cost of CCS. Postponing the implementation of CCS by 5 years could help
bring the LCOE down to a more affordable level by cutting the incremental cost of CCS by
half (from 8.6 to 4.3 US cents per kWh in West Java, and from 8.8 to 4.4 US cents per kWh in
South Sumatra). Moreover, postponing CCS implementation would also allow the reference
plants to learn from the CCS pilot projects in other places.

Similarly, reducing the CO2 capture percentage from 90 percent to 45 percent under the no
implementation delay scenario could reduce the total incremental of cost of CCS from 8.6 to
4.7 US cents per kWh in West Java, and from 8.8 to 4.7 US cents per kWh in South Sumatra.
However, both the implementation delay and the lower level of capture come at the expense of
higher CO2 emissions.

The “No delay” case (i.e., installing CCS in Indonesia in the same year of the plant's initial
operation -- the year 2020 for the West Java plant and 2022 for the Sumatra plant) is very
unlikely due to fact that CCS regulations and institutional arrangements will take a long time
to be implemented.
     8.5.2          LCOE comparison with other generation technologies
In this section, comparisons are carried out between coal-fired generation plus CCS with other
types of power generation in terms of their level of emissions and LCOE. Table 8-11 provides
a summary of PLN’s average cost of supply according to generation type in 2013.
In 2013, PLN’s weighted average cost of supply was at around 11.04 US cents per kWh. Of all
the generation technologies, hydro and steam (coal) presented the lowest cost of supply. The
average cost of coal-fired generation in the year was at 6.58 US cents per kWh compared with
the estimated 7.5 and 6.4 US cents per kWh from the West Java and South Sumatra plants,
respectively. Besides coal and hydro, the next tier of technologies in terms of cost of supply
was geothermal at 10.10 US cents per kWh and CCGT at 11.61 US cents per kWh. The third
tier of generation technology in terms of cost of supply was gas turbine, diesel and solar at
27.03, 30.07 and 32.70 US cents per kWh, respectively.

Coal-fired generation with CCS is competitive, in terms of LCOE at a comparable level of
emissions, with geothermal and CCGT.
In terms of CO2 emissions and availability of power generation, coal-fired generation with 90
percent capture is comparable to geothermal-based generation. According to MEMR’s
Regulation 17/2014, the ceiling price for geothermal in Java and Sumatra is set at 14.6 US cents
per kWh for geothermal plants commissioned in the year 2022, which is comparable to the
LCOE of the West Java and South Sumatra power plants with 90 percent capture without delay
in implementation of CCS. Geothermal ceiling tariffs are listed in Table 8-12.

In terms of CO2 emissions, coal-fired generation with 45 percent capture is comparable to
CCGT operating at base load (See discussion in Section 3.3.3). In terms of LCOE, coal-fired
generation with CCS at 45percent capture is comparable to the LCOE of CCGT in 2013, while
reducing the volatility of the cost of electricity supply due to fluctuation in the price of natural
gas used in CCGT.

8.6      Cost of CO2 abatement and offsetting mechanisms of EOR

Before estimating the cost of CO2 abatement associated with CCS, a distinction needs to be
drawn between two CO2 abatement measures, one focusing on the amount of CO2 actually
captured in the CCS process, and the other on the net amount of CO2 emission avoided on a
power output parity basis. On a power output parity basis, the production of pure CO2 is higher
because of the energy penalty of CCS. The amount of CO2 captured is thus greater than the
amount of CO2 emission avoided. Figure 8-5 provides an illustration of the difference between
the two CO2 abatement measures.
The choice of the measure will depend on the application. For example, when commodity CO2
is the focus of the analysis, such as in CO2 utilization schemes like EOR, the captured-basis is
a more appropriate measure by accounting for the actual amount of CO2 captured with the CCS
process. Yet, when comparing the costs of CO2 abatement across different technologies, the
avoided-basis is more appropriate because it is presented on an electricity output parity basis.

Table 8-13 and Table 8-14 provide a summary of the estimated CO2 abatement costs associated
with CCS for the reference power plants under different scenarios. The cost of CO2 abatement
is the lowest under the highest capture scenario due to economies of scale. These results are
presented in Figure 8-6 and Figure 8-7.

Moreover, the majority of the CO2 separation cost is incurred due to the energy penalty
associated with the CO2 capture process. Compared with other sources of commodity CO2, CO2
captured from coal-fired power plants would be more costly at US$63 to US$105 per tonne of
CO2 captured compared with an estimated levelized cost of US$11 per tonne of CO2 for natural
gas processing. The levelized cost for a natural gas-processing facility capturing CO2 was
estimated at US$28 per tonne of CO2 captured, including: costs for compressor plus dryer of
US$11/t,CO2 captured, pipeline costs of US$11/t CO2 captured, and costs for injection wells
of US$6/t CO2 captured (ADB, 2013).

8.7         Cost offsetting mechanisms of EOR

Revenues earned through EOR could offset some of the cost of CO2 abatement (on a captured
basis) associated with the CCS on a dollar to-dollar basis. A small amount of EOR revenue (an
equivalent of under US$10 per tCO2 at the gate of the plant) would bring the LCOE of the
South Sumatra plant with 90 percent CO2 capture down below the ceiling price for geothermal;
and LCOE with 45 percent CO2 capture down below PLN’s average cost of CCGT in 2012.
Figure 8-8 provides an illustration of EOR as a cost-offsetting mechanism for CCS.

However, several factors will affect the upside of EOR for a power sector CCS project:

The willingness-to-pay for CO2
This is a function of the market price of oil, the breakeven cost of oil production, and the output
ratio between CO2 input and oil output. Thus, the volatility of the oil price is one of the key
risk factors to the upside EOR. Figure 8-9 (Source: ADB 2009) illustrates the corresponding
willingness-to-pay for CO2 at a breakeven cost of oil supply at US$60/bbl.17

The cost of delivery of CO2 to the EOR sites
This delivery cost is a function of the distance between the CO2 source and the EOR sites, and
the utilization level of the pipeline. In some cases, such as West Java to South Sumatra, the
long distance of the CO2 delivery route would render EOR opportunities unattractive.
o    A long (416 km) transmission pipeline would be needed to transport the CO2 captured
     from West Java to a regional hub in South Sumatra. Additional long distribution pipelines
     are needed to deliver the CO2 from the regional hub to the EOR sites;
o    The scarcity of the CO2 demand and the skew of the CO2 demand curve alone would lead
     to considerable decrease in EOR pipeline utilization in the later years of the CCS
     operation. For example, even without the presence of any competition, the EOR pipeline
     from West Java in the 90 percent capture scenario would only be able to operate at a
     relatively high capacity for the initial few years before becoming redundant. Competitive
     pressure would further reduce the capacity utilization of the pipeline; and
o    Additional CO2 delivery routes to other CO2 storage sites are thus needed to transport the
     remaining CO2 to the storage sites. The fluctuation in the demand for CO2 for EOR will
     inevitably affect the quantity of CO2 transported in, and thus would also affect the
     capacity utilization of the alternative pipelines.

Competitive sources of CO2 and availability of lower cost CO2 by-products from other sectors

Lower-cost CO2 supplies from natural gas facilities will likely be the first mover in the EOR
market, and crowd out the CO2 captured from the power sector. The cost of capturing CO2 as
a by-product of natural gas processing is considerably lower (at around US$11 per tonne of
CO2) than CO2 captured from coal-fired power plants (at more than US$60 per tonne of CO2).
Therefore, the natural gas sector operations face a lower hurdle to respond to the same policy
incentives associated with CO2 abatement.

8.8    Benefits of CCS

A coal-fired plant generates both local pollutants (in the form of NOx, SO2 and particulates)
and a global pollutant (CO2). The CCS process would reduce the emissions of all these global
and local pollutants. Thus, the benefits of CCS can be viewed in terms of the avoided costs of
the global and local pollutants abated. Moreover, the implementation of CCS will also generate
added benefits in terms of local and global employment, an aspect that is not quantified in this
analysis.

      8.8.1    Positive global externality
Global environmental benefits represent the avoided cost of CO2 emissions. There is a general
lack of consensus view on the cost of CO2 emissions. Although costs of CO2 emissions under
the European Union (EU) Emissions Trading Scheme are currently around €7/tonne, and the
medium-term prices are expected to rise. In the Guidance Note on the “Social Value of Carbon,”
the United States Department of Energy (USDOE, 2013) and the World Bank have provided
the following projections of the economic damages associated with CO2 emissions: roughly at
US$30/tCO2 by 2015, US$35/tCO2 by 2020, US$42/tCO2 by 2025, and US$50/tCO2 by 2030.

      8.8.2    Positive local externality
Three studies were considered to estimate the cost of local negative externalities associated
with coal-fired power plants. A recent study for the Suralaya coal-fired power plant (Liun, 2013)
estimates a range for the monetary cost of the negative externality for NOx, SO 2 and TSP
between US$0.0020/kWh and US$0.00646/kWh in 2000 US dollars. Two other studies from
China and Australia were also considered. The China study is a joint study by the China State
Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) and the World Bank, and the Australia study is by
the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (ATSE). The negative
impacts of pollution on local inhabitants were measured by the benefit transfer method, using
studies from other countries and adjusting for the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita.

Table 8-15 shows the results of the three studies. The estimates of the Suralaya study are
between those provided in the China and Australia studies. The range is wide, with the adjusted
estimates based on the China study being lower and the adjusted estimates of the Australia
study being higher than those of the Suralaya study. An average of the low and high estimates
for Suralaya, (US$0.0042 per kWh) could be inflated to US$0.007 per kWh using IMF inflation
factors (IMF, 2014).

9.      INSTITUTIONAL READINESS

This chapter explores the institutional and regulatory aspects of CCS implementation from the
perspective the CCS “value chain” involving three distinct processes: capture, transportation
and storage.
Unlike other climate-smart technologies in the power sector, such as renewable-based power
generation, CCS is unique in that the CO2 abatement process cannot be accomplished in one
integrated step alongside power generation. It requires the successful implementation of three
sequential steps, starting from the capture of CO2 at the power plant level, to transportation,
and then to the deep underground storage of the CO2 captured. The CCS value chain involves
operators both within and outside the power sector, thus posing some unique institutional
challenges. Each step of the CCS operation requires the facilitation of appropriate institutional,
legal and regulatory frameworks, as illustrated in Figure 9.1, to govern the structure, operations,
ownership, management and monitoring of the process -- all of which still need to be
established.

Moreover, unlike most alternative technologies, CCS is still in its infancy. Before entering
commercial scale applications, CCS technology is yet to be tested out in small-scale pilot
projects in Indonesia. A CCS policy mechanism, along with a CCS Road Map tailored to the
stage of technology development, would help to develop a regulatory environment that fosters
CCS development in Indonesia. The power sector should play a strong role in the development
of this road map.
Meanwhile, in anticipation of potential future adoption of the technology at a commercial scale,
the power sector needs to reach a certain level of “readiness” on the strategic, technical,
institutional and financial fronts. However, the current absence of policy-level instructions on
the issue has led to many practical challenges in implementing CCS-R measures at the power
plant level today. Without clear regulatory mandate or policy-induced financial incentives, it
is difficult to incorporate CCS-R requirements, such as space provisions, layout and design
modifications, etc. into the IPP procurement process.


                                                94
Last but not least, none of the above mentioned adjustments would happen without a formal
adoption of CCS as one of the emission reduction measures in the national climate policy in
Indonesia. Once CCS is formally included in the list of climate-smart technologies, many
existing policy levers, such as feed-in-tariff, portfolio standards, etc., as proven effective in the
renewables arena, could be applied to CCS and CCS-R in the power sector. Under this policy
environment, CCS and CCS-R decisions can be made on the technical feasibility and economic
merits of the investment.

    9.1       Gaps in the National Climate Policy

As part its global commitment to combat climate change, the Government of Indonesia pledged
in 2009 to reduce GHG emissions by 26 percent from a business-as-usual level through
domestic efforts by 2020, and pursue a further 15 percent reduction with international support.
The only official document published by the GoI that governs the national policy on Climate
Change is the Presidential Regulation (PR) No. 61 of 2011 regarding the National Action Plans
on GHG reduction (RAN-GRK). RAN-GRK was developed to provide guidance for ministerial
agencies on the policy and strategy that are needed to reach the 26 percent and 41 percent
emission reduction targets by 2020. RAN-GRK laid out the largest contributors to GHG
emission reduction as forestry and peat land use, followed by transportation and energy sectors.
However, the emission reduction targets set forth by RAN-GRK for the power sector were
modest, and did not include limitation of GHG emission from fossil power plants.
The RAN-GRK listed directives to support the action plans in the transportation and energy
sectors, which pertain to: energy conservation, utilization of cleaner fuel (natural gas),
increased utilization of renewable energy (small hydro, biomass, solar, wind), utilization of
“clean technology for power generation”, and development of low-emitting mass
transportation systems. However, there is no further explanation of the “clean technology for
power generation” in RAN-GRK. Key technologies to reduce CO2 emission from fossil power
generation, such as USC coal power plants, IGCC or CCS, are not indicated in RAN-GRK.
As described in Chapter 2, Indonesia’s dependence on fossil fuels, particularly coal, will grow
rapidly instead of declining. CCS provides a potential way to address Indonesia’s Climate
Change targets in a way that power plant efficiency enhancements cannot.

    9.2       Gaps in the power sector

      9.2.1     Sector Regulation Overview
Public and private players in the power sector

The Indonesian power sector is regulated by the Electricity Law No.30 of 2009, which
stipulates that electricity provision to the public is governed by the State, and that the provision
of electricity is a responsibility of the GoI. In doing so, the GoI authorizes a state-owned
enterprise (SOE) and regional government-owned enterprises to undertake the electricity
supply business. In reality, there is only one SOE authorized by the GoI to conduct electricity
business throughout the country, which is PLN. There have been no regional government-


                                                 95
owned enterprises yet in the power business. Private enterprises, cooperatives and community
organizations can also participate in the electricity supply business, but only through PLN.

PLN is the only SOE in the electricity business in Indonesia with exclusive concession and
license granted by the government to carry out a vertically-integrated business spanning across
generation, transmission, distribution and sales of electricity. The concession is defined in the
Law by the activity of electricity distribution and/or sale to end customers. The concession area
granted by GoI to PLN is throughout the territory of the Republic of Indonesia, except in a few
smaller isolated areas or pockets where concessions are granted by GoI to some other entities.
As the owner of the exclusive concession areas, PLN has been acting as the “single buyer” of
all electricity produced by the Independent Power Producers through PPAs. The electricity
generated by IPPs and by PLN’s own generation would be transmitted and distributed to end
consumers through the high voltage (HV) transmission and medium voltage distribution grids
owned by PLN.
PPAs between IPPs and PLN have been the business model that makes private sector
participation quite successful in Indonesia. As of December 2012, about 27 percent of the total
generation capacity supplying the HV grid is owned by IPPs, with the remaining 73 percent
owned by PLN (DGE, 2013). It is expected that participation of IPPs will continue to increase
in the future, in line with PLN’s limited financing capacity for funding massive power
generation projects.

A PPA contains legal, commercial and operational aspects. Once a PPA is signed by an IPP
and PLN, all those aspects are fixed and binding over a 25-year term. Various risks associated
with IPP development and operation would be allocated either to the IPP developers or to PLN
on the principle that the party that has the most control over a risk shall take the risk. A typical
risk that is allocated to PLN is the government risk, which includes government force majeure
and change of laws and regulations.

According to the regulation, the purchase price from the IPP by PLN in the PPA has to be
approved by MEMR. A scheme of government guarantee can be provided by the GoI via the
Ministry of Finance to cover non-payment risk by PLN if the IPP project is a Public Private
Partnership (PPP), or if the IPP project is included in a government program, such as the “fast
track program”.
Tariff setting scheme
The Electricity Law No.30 of 2009 also stipulates that the electricity tariff is set by GoI with
approval from the Parliament. Due to considerations of public service obligations (PSO), the
tariff has been traditionally set at a lower level than the cost of supply, resulting in a
considerable PSO subsidy paid by the government to PLN, whose cost of production remains
a subject of hot debate by the Government and Parliament every year. The PSO subsidy is only
granted and allocated from the state budget each year after a thorough audit of PLN’s
performance.
Recent developments in the tariff policy of the new government have indicated that the GoI
would soon implement tariff rationalization in order to make the tariff more cost reflective for

                                                96
all consumer categories, except those under-privileged people who consume a small amount of
lifeline electricity. The tariff rationalization would bring the tariff to an economic level that
reflects the actual cost of supply, and would be automatically adjusted according to inflation,
changing oil price, and movements in exchange rates.
Role of CO2 emissions reduction in the power sector master plan
At present, there is no law or regulation limiting the amount of CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel
power plants in Indonesia.
RUPTL, which is a strategic power development planning document issued by PLN and
endorsed by the GoI annually, does not internalize the cost of CO2 emissions in the planning
process, resulting in power development plans dominated by coal as the lowest cost base-load
generation throughout the country. In the business model, the cost of emission has not been
reflected in the cost structure of the electricity supply.
Due to a lack of regulatory pressure, the issue of CO2 emissions has not entered the discussion
between IPPs and PLN during the PPA negotiations for coal-fired power plants. Without any
regulatory mandate or policy incentive, PLN cannot insert in a PPA contract clauses related to
CO2 emissions reduction, or specific requirements for the power plant to become CCS-R.

      9.2.2     Impact of CCS-Readiness on IPP Projects
The incorporation of CO2 capture into the coal-fired generation process will bring considerable
alterations to the commercial aspects of PPAs for the following reasons:
Reduction of Net Dependable Capacity (NDC)

NDC is the basis for calculating the capital cost recovery (CCR), or fixed capacity charge, or
capacity payment. This is the component in the PPA that generates real income for an IPP. If
the NDC were to be reduced by 25 -30 percent due to CO2 capture being implemented, PLN
would still have to pay the full capacity payment, as the IPP would not be willing to accept
lower capacity payments that cause lower revenues. In other words, PLN would have to take
the risk of implementing CCS in IPP projects. In the PPA, a new ruling that obliged IPPs to
install and operate CCS after the PPA has been signed would be categorized as a “change of
laws” risk. Such a risk would be borne by PLN.
A higher capacity payment by PLN to an IPP plant equipped with CCS would be reflected in
the overall cost of electricity production. This higher cost would either be passed through the
electricity tariff to end consumers (if the GoI has a policy to pass the higher cost to the people
through a higher tariff), or would necessitate government subsidizing the tariff (if the GoI does
not intend to pass the cost on to the people). Either way, the GoI would need a legal and
regulatory framework that allows the government to adopt such policies.
Additional investment incurred from installing CO2 capture equipment

All investments in IPP projects would eventually have to be repaid by the off taker, which is
PLN. The additional cost incurred in installing a CO2 capture system would be added to the
fixed capacity payment and hence the CCR. Before CO2 capture equipment is procured by an
IPP, say in year 5 of operation, PLN might have to agree on the additional cost component in

                                               97
the CCR. Negotiations between IPPs and PLN could take time, and according to the current
regulation on IPPs, the new purchase price by PLN would have to be approved by MEMR.
Deterioration of Plant Heat Rate

Heat rate is one performance indicator in the PPA that must be guaranteed by the IPP to PLN,
as it will greatly affect the quantity of coal consumed to produce each unit of electricity. Since
the cost of coal supply is passed through by the IPP to PLN, PLN must be prepared to accept
the deterioration of heat rate if CCS is implemented. Deterioration of heat rate could be
predicted on an engineering basis using heat and mass balance calculations, but the commercial
heat rate might have to be eventually negotiated between PLN and the IPP.
Additional land provision

The installation of CO2 capture equipment will require additional provision of land while land
is becoming ever scarcer, especially in populous demand centers, such as Java. Land for new
thermal power plants is subject to competition across all sectors. Land availability for CO 2
capture is not a particular issue for the West Java power plant considered in this study because
PLN had already acquired the land many years ago, and that land is sufficient to accommodate
the construction of two coal power generation units (2x1000 MW) along with a sizable coal
yard, fly ash pond, and any space needed for installing CO2 capture equipment in the future.
However, that case should be considered as an exception rather than the norm. For any new
power plant to be built, either the IPP developer or PLN will be responsible for acquiring the
land. Additional land requirement for CO2 capture may pose a considerable challenge in terms
of the land acquisition process, and at times may not even be feasible especially in land-scarce
demand centers. With no regulatory framework in place requiring new coal power plants to be
CCS-Ready, it would be difficult to convince an IPP developer to acquire additional land to
make provision for future retrofit of CO2 capture equipment.
Pre-emptive power plant design

For a power plant to be CCS-R, certain design considerations need to be incorporated in the
design phase. For example, the spacing between the economizer and the air preheater needs to
be carefully planned in anticipation of the future retrofit of NOx removal equipment (SCR) in
that space. Other examples include the provision of space for the future installation of high
performance FGD and CO2 capture equipment, as well as compressors for CO2 delivery. On a
more fundamental level, the layout of the steam turbine hall needs to accommodate future needs
for extracting steam for the CO2 capture process.
Impact of the lack of a policy framework
Many of the practical challenges that PLN is confronting today in incorporating CCS-R
requirements in the IPP procurement process, follow from the lack of a policy framework on
curbing CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel-based power plants. Not surprisingly, with looming
power shortages and delays in transmission projects, PLN sees no particular reason to further
complicate the IPP process by requiring the IPP developers to make additional provision of
land or any design modifications. Moreover, without a regulatory framework, it would also be


                                               98
   challenging, if not entirely impossible, to assign responsibilities and allocate risks amongst the
   players. At a practical level, it is also difficult to make provisions for tariff changes in a PPA.
   The CCS-R experience in the developed world can also shed light on the unique challenges the
   power sector faces in implementing CCS-R (Box 9-1).
                           Box 9-1          CCS-Ready experience in the UK
1.       Capture Readiness
Since about 2006 there has been an acknowledgement in the UK that new coal or gas power plants should be
constructed in a way that avoids barriers to the subsequent installation of CO 2 capture equipment. The intent
is to avoid locked-in CO2 emissions throughout the lifetime of the power plant. This concept has become
termed Capture-Ready. However, the formal definition of Capture-Ready has lagged behind the practical
consideration of the implications of pursuing the intent.
There have been nine new power plants built in the UK under this regime. All of them are natural gas
combined cycle gas turbine power plants. They have a combined generation capacity of 8,500 MW. There
has been no test case in the UK of a coal-fired power plant being built as Capture-Ready.
The regulatory mechanism for requiring Capture-Readiness is through the permitting and licensing process.
Rather than an obligation to meet specific quantified criteria, the power plant proponents are required to
present a reasonable CCS feasibility study plan, which is then judged in a subjective way by the licensing
authorities. This approach has resulted in inconsistent outcomes.
An example is the license conditions for 2006/7 West Burton CCGT station which state: “The layout of the
development shall be such as to permit the installation of such plant as may reasonably be required to achieve
the prevention of discharge of carbon and its compounds into the atmosphere.” Not only is this license
condition vague, but the use of the word “prevent” implies 100 percent CO2 capture, which is technically
impossible.
In 2009 the UK Government issued Guidance notes on CCS-Readiness (Carbon Capture Readiness – A
Guidance note for Section 35 Electricity Act 1989 consent applications UK Department of Energy and
Climate Change, Nov 2009). Applicants for power plant consents are required to prepare a feasibility study
which includes demonstrating:
      The technical feasibility of retrofitting their chosen carbon capture technology; and
      That sufficient space is available on or near the site to accommodate carbon capture equipment in the
          future.
2.       Transport and Storage Readiness
The feasibility study should also include an economic assessment and should demonstrate:
      That a suitable area of deep geological offshore storage exists for the storage of captured CO2 from
          the proposed power plant; and
      The technical feasibility of transporting the captured CO2 to the proposed storage area.
In 2006 the British Geological Survey published CR/06/185N “Industrial Carbon Dioxide Emissions and
Carbon Dioxide Storage Potential in the UK”. This is the standard reference for the identification of suitable
storage locations. This report quantifies storage capacity for 7,500 million tonnes of CO 2 in offshore
hydrocarbon fields and a further 15,000 million tonnes of quantified CO2 storage capacity in deep offshore
saline aquifers. Potential onshore CO2 storage capacity is much less, in smaller fields and subject to tighter
planning controls. It is also likely to be in demand for Natural Gas storage. So the UK CCS-Ready
requirements specify only offshore geological storage.
The nine CCS-Ready gas-fired power plants built to date in the UK have the combined potential to capture
about 23 million tonnes of CO2 per year. The quantified offshore CO2 storage capacity in hydrocarbon fields
is sufficient to accommodate CO2 at that rate for over 300 years.

    9.3     Gaps downstream in the CCS value chain for CO2 transportation and
            storage

LEMIGAS (LEMIGAS, 2010) identified existing legal and regulatory frameworks that could
be adapted for national regulatory development, with unique emphasis on the transportation
and storage end of the CCS value chain. A key finding of that study was the complexity of the
CCS value chain and the cross-cutting nature of the regulatory regimes that the value chain
occupies.
At present, there are no existing laws and regulations governing CO2 pipelines, neither are there
any with respect to the ownership, grant, or lease of subsurface pore space for CCS. For cost-
offsetting mechanisms, such as EOR, there is no clear approach as to how it could be integrated
into the production-sharing arrangements for oil/gas development programs.
CCS storage operations require long-term access to both surface and subsurface areas,
including access to pore space for storage. In Indonesia, the typical duration of existing land
ownership rights associated with production sharing, may be too short for CCS operations,
especially with respect to indefinite storage. This is further complicated by the restriction on
the mineral rights, which only GoI has the power to grant.
Some unique aspects of CCS include the need for long-term stewardship of the CO2 and
potential liabilities associated with the operation, including environment and health risks, and
potential leakage or contaminations. There remains a clear lack of regulatory frameworks in all
these areas.

    9.4     Policy review

Much of this section is a synthesis of the Regulatory Framework chapter of the Indonesia
Country Report Determining the Potential for Carbon Capture and Storage in Southeast
Asia, prepared by LEMIGAS for ADB.
CO2 classification

The definition of CO2, and the process by which it is stored, play a key role in determining
jurisdiction in Indonesia. Generally, there are two classifications of CO2 -- one as an industrial
product, also referred to as a resource; and the other as a waste product or pollutant. This
distinction is important for Indonesia in the future, because industrial resource recovery
projects are usually subject to regulation by existing oil and gas regulations, while waste or
pollutant disposal will fall under the jurisdiction of relevant environmental regulations. In the
USA, CO2 is sometimes classified as a commodity and in Canada, sometimes a resource.
However, CO2 is not yet clearly classified in Indonesia (OECD/IEA, 2014).




                                               100
CO2 transportation

Although there is no existing law directly addressing the piping of CO2 in Indonesia, some
parallels may be drawn from existing laws and licensing regulations on natural gas pipelines.
In Indonesia, BPMIGAS (the former Indonesian oil and gas industry regulator) was in charge
of awarding concessions for upstream natural gas pipeline construction and operation.
Generally, a concession is awarded on a competitive basis for up to 20 years, at the end of
which ownership will revert to the state. Under a concession awarded as a production sharing
contract (PSC), contractors would build and operate the pipeline but ownership of the pipeline
would belong to the State. Similar arrangements could apply to the construction and operation
of CO2 pipelines for CCS operations.
Surface rights and subsurface rights pertaining to CO2 storage

The transportation and storage of CO2 require access to both surface areas for the installation
of pipeline and storage facilities, and subsurface areas for the injection and storage of CO2.
Rights to subsurface and offshore areas are of particular importance to CCS storage operation.
In Indonesia, the state, acting as the custodian for the Indonesian people, owns the right to
mineral resources and subsurface areas. In turn, the State also grants usage rights for the
exploration and exploitation of mineral rights for limited periods under Hak Pakai or leasing
concepts. In the oil and gas sector, exploration and exploitation rights take the form of PSCs
between oil and gas operators and regulators. Rights to storage space would similarly require
a specific contract from the State or to be derived from an existing contract, such as a PSC or
other rights. The limited time duration of these contractual rights would pose issues for long-
term storage of CO2.
Long-Term Stewardship and Liability for Stored CO2

Although there is no existing law or regulation governing the long-term stewardship of CO2
and associated liabilities in Indonesia, existing regulations on upstream oil and gas reservoir
management and injection of wastewater in oil and gas operations may help guide the
development of similar regulations for CO2 storage and EOR operations. For example,
Regulation13, on the protection of underground water resources, specifies that field operators
may apply for five-year renewable permits from the Ministry of Environment for re-injecting
wastewater into a production field. The application must be accompanied by necessary
supporting documents which:
       Indicate the injection zone’s ability to absorb the matter injected;
       describe the selection criteria and the construction and operating procedures for the
        injection wells; and
       provide proof of structural integrity and absence of leakage of the pipeline and the
        associated reinjection field.
The wastewater regulation also requires the operators to properly seal the reinjection wells
based on a closure plan, with specifications on the plugs and cement used for well closure.



                                             101
Other oil and gas practices

Other oil and gas practices relevant to CCS include production sharing contracts that govern
all public and private activities taking place on the oil and gas fields, which would also apply
to CCS activities taking place in oil and gas fields. Related to PSCs, government Regulation
No. 35, 2004 on Upstream Oil and Gas Activities and Article 39 of the regulation provide more
specific guidance on the environmental aspects and liabilities associated with PSCs. Likewise,
existing oil gas regulations related to the transportation and injection of gas as part of the
hydrocarbon production/recovery process, as well as existing regulations on upstream oil and
gas activities and reservoir management, are all relevant to CCS operations.

    9.5     Recommendations

In light of the above discussions, the team recommends:

Creating an enabling policy environment
   Incorporating CO2 emissions reduction from fossil-fuel power plants as one of the measures
    in the national climate change policy;
   Including CO2 emission reduction from coal-fired power plants into the power sector
    master plan; and
   Making concerted efforts along the CCS value chain, via creating a corresponding
    regulatory framework, to enable not only CO2 capture in the power plants, but also facilitate
    the processes of CO2 transportation and storage.

Bridging the financial and technical viability gap
   Providing necessary policy incentives to help bridge the economic viability gap associated
    with CCS, while tailoring policy incentives to the stage of technology development (see
    Box 9-2 on the policy incentives at different stages of CCS technology development);
   Considering extension of the existing regulations (such as feed-in-tariff for renewable
    energy) which could be extended to include CCS and CCS-R to provide IPPs with the
    necessary price certainty and guaranteed off-take for their consideration of CCS and CCS-
    R options.
   Reducing the associated risks and costs of CCS through pilots and demonstrations where
    the power sector should aim to play an important part;
   Removing the lack of experience by showing technical feasibility through pilot and
    demonstration projects in Indonesia. Also, by replicating the CCS projects in many places
    in the world, reduction of cost and energy penalty can be expected by the development and
    improvement of capture technologies. (see Figure 9-2 for the Indonesia CCS Road Map);
   Integrating the power sector into the current CCS Road Map (developed by Government
    /LEMIGAS), and selecting or soliciting power plants. Presently, the CCS Road Map
    focuses on the oil/gas sector. The roadmap should show the timeline of pilot,
    demonstration and commercial deployment of CCS projects in the power sector. Indonesia
    can provide the opportunity of CCS at coal-fired power plants for donors to provide funds
    for pilot demonstrations because there are many coal plants planned in the development

                                              102
          plan of PLN. IPP developers can consider participating in such projects when adequate
          financial incentives are given; and
         Building awareness of and capacity in CCS and CCS-R implementation while managing
          public perception. Joint effort is needed among Government, Lenders, and Donors for
          dissemination and capacity building of CCS. The Inter-ministerial Working Group for CCS
          deployment is already formed focusing on the oil/gas sector. The Group should be extended
          to include the Power Sector CCS development and deployment.

          Box 9-2 Tailoring CCS policy mechanisms to the stage of technology development

A key challenge for policy makers is to enable support mechanisms to evolve to reflect developments in
technology, while ensuring the policy certainty and credibility required to drive investment. Today, CCS is
in the demonstration phase, and on the cusp of the early deployment phase. Thus, the most effective policy
mechanisms will be technology-specific, aimed at advancing technology learning, and promoting access to
private capital (as opposed to driving emissions reductions per se). These include mechanisms such as capital
grants, production subsidies, investment and production tax credits, credit guarantees, feed -in-tariffs and
portfolio standards. As CCS technology progresses, policy emphasis will shift to emissions reductions,
supporting wide-scale CCS deployment where it is cost effective among other abatement options. Policy
options include technology-neutral incentive mechanisms such as cap-and-trade schemes, carbon taxes,
baseline and credit schemes, fee/rebate systems and emissions performance standards (OECD/IEA, 2012).

The timing of the transition in policy is difficult to determine in advance, because it depends on how CCS
and alternative abatement technologies develop. To manage this uncertainty and provide some clarity to
investors, governments can establish “gateways” within a stable policy framework, that specifies:

              criteria that define when or if policy will move to the next stage, including potentially
               performance or cost thresholds;
              policies within each stage; and
              how government will react if gateways are missed. 

This figure provides an illustration of possible gateways within a CCS policy framework.

    9.6     Road Map for CCS Pilot Project Development

Figure 9-2 presents a comprehensive 15-year roadmap that has been proposed as a part of the
previous CCS study effort (ADB, 2013), aimed at facilitating and bringing pilot and
demonstration projects to larger scale commercial phase. The roadmap includes a timeline for
all related CCS activities, and detailed directions for their pilot phases.

To date, there is no project identified or planned to enter pilot or demonstration phase in the
power sector. This study is the first effort to facilitate the power sector taking a position on the
emerging CCS Road Map.

In Figure 9-2 the timing of each gate decision occurs at the end of the horizontal bar:
Gate 1: Identify CO2 source and storage site;
Gate 2: Secure funding and complete permitting;
Gate 3: Construction completed;
Gate 4: 50–100 tons/day CO2 injected successfully; and
Gate 5: Successful pilot assessment to confirm a swift transition to demonstration project (in
the same storage reservoir) (ADB, 2013).

    9.7     Recommendations

Creating an enabling policy and regulatory environment

National climate policy to recognize CCS as a means of CO2 emission reduction;
   •   Endorsement of the CCS Road Map at the national level; and
   •   Concerted efforts along the CCS value chain: CO2 capture, transportation and storage

Bridging technical and financial viability gap
   •   Consider adding CCS-Readiness Provisions in the PPA, such as space provisions and
       design modifications;
   •   Provide policy incentives for future CCS implementation;
   •   GoI to initiate CCS pilot and demonstration activities for the power sector; and
   •   Power sector participation in the CCS Road Map.

Awareness and capacity building

Develop an Indonesian Centre of Excellence in CCS technology and purpose tasked to:
   •   build technical and economic assessment capability;
   •   develop technologies to suit Indonesian conditions;
   •   run workshops to encourage wide understanding of potential and limitations of CCS;
       and
   •   encourage public acceptance of CCS technologies.
