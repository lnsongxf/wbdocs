This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

        below).]

        The KRK is a statement that contains planning information about
        the plot of land that BuildCo intends to build the warehouse on.

      The KRK also includes a city planning map scale (1:1000) signed
      by the Head of Jakarta City Planning Office. The city planning
      map covers information on:
      a. Building setback (GSB) - the borders within which BuildCo is
      allowed to construct the building
      b. Road border lines (GSJ) - the borders of the front yard or
      block borders or road control borders
      c. Land use plan - explanation about the benefits of the land
      d. Type of building
      e. Height of building in terms of floors/storey
      f. Floor area ratio (FAR/KLB) - the multiplication figure used to
      calculate the total area of building that is permitted
      g. Building coverage (KDB)
      h. Blocking - the arrangement of city spaces on certain lanes
      governing the length and width of the piece of land for which
      the city planning permit is being applied for

      BuildCo must also request approval of the architectural drawing
      Pengesahan Gambar Perencanaan Arsitektur (formerly known as
      building site plan - RTLB) from the City Planning Office. This plan
      outlines the exact position of the building on the city planning
      map and contains the following information (some of which is
      already contained on the city planning map previously):
      a. Building setback (GSB) - the borders within which BuildCo is
      allowed to construct the building
      b. Road border lines (GSJ) - the borders of the front yard or
      block borders or road control borders
      c. Building trace form and location
      d. Building usage
      e. Height of building, including KDB (building coverage) and KLB
      (floor area)
      f. Building cuts
      g. Parking lot
      h. Kelzar circulation/entry of vehicles

      Once the documents are submitted, BuildCo receives an invoice
      with the amount of fees that must be paid (SKRD). BuildCo must
      pay the fees at a local branch of Bank DKI and submit the receipt
      to the City Planning Office. The total cost to obtain these
      documents is IDR 1,482,000.00 according to Article 123 of the
      Regional Regulation No. 1 Year 2006.

      The following is the detailed calculation:
      • Land measurement (based on the land certificate, namely 500 -
      - 1,000 sq. m.) a retribution of IDR 750,000.00
      • Print out of the map (scale of 1:1000), a retribution of IDR
      1,000.00 per copy x 12 copies or a total of IDR 12,000.00
      • KRK for plans to use the land for warehouse construction
      (Karya pergudangan/Kpg) for a land area of up to 1,000 sq. m. is
      subject to a fee of IDR 40,000.00
      • Pengesahan Gambar Perencanaan Arsitektur (formerly known
      as building site plan - RTLB) for plans to build warehouse
      construction is subject to a fee of IDR 40,000.00/100 sq. m. of
      floor surface, so the total fee for the RTLB: IDR 40,000.00 x 13
      (based on a 1,300.6 sq. m. floor surface) = IDR 520,000.00

      The Building Supervision and Control Office has 4 different
      teams that review the architectural, structural, mechanical and
      electrical drawings. The application is first reviewed by TPAK (the
      team that reviews the architectural drawings). This can take 3-4
      weeks. The application is then forwarded to TPKB (team that
      reviews the structural drawings) and in parallel to TPIB (team that
      reviews the mechanical, electrical and plumbing drawings). This
      also takes about 3-4 weeks on average.

      According to Bylaw No. 3 on Building Tariff Rates of October
      2012, the permit fee is calculated as follows:

      RPP = L x It x HSbg = 1,300.6 x 2.1 x 25,000

      •          L = area of the building (1,300.6 sq. m)
      •          It = index that is calculated as follows:
      Ikg x If x Ik x Iw x Ipt where Ikg = 1 (for a new building); If = 3
      (for commercial buildings); Ik = 0.7; Iw = 1 (for permanent
      buildings); Ipt = 1 (if the building does not have a basement).
      Therefore, It = 1 x 3 x 0.7 x 1 x 1 = 2.1
      •          HSbg = IDR 25,000 / sq. m.

        Request city planning permit (SKRK) from Surabaya One-Stop
        Shop (Unit Pelayanan Terpadu Satu Atap - UPTSA)

        In order to obtain the city planning permit (SKRK), BuildCo must submit
        the following documents:

        a. Application form (available at Surabaya one-stop shop);
        b. Copy of identity card of the applicants;
        c. Copy of property tax invoice and receipt;
        d. Legalized copy of land ownership certificate.
        e. BuildCo’s deed of establishment
        f. License of supervising engineer

        BuildCo can see the map of Surabaya online and click on the location
        where they intend to build the project. Majority of applicants apply for
        the city planning permit in person, although it is possible to submit the
        documents online.

        Once it submits the documents, BuildCo is interviewed about the
        project details. After that, the Surabaya one-stop shop checks
        adherence of the location with master plan and calculates the
        retribution charges. BuildCo pays the fees at the Surabaya one-stop          1 day      IDR 2,822,000

        shop and the file is transferred to the City Planning Agency (Dinas Cipta
        Karya dan Tata Ruang). City Planning Agency representatives inspect
        the future building site, measure the location, prepare drawings, and
        position the future building's plot in technical master plan. They also
        prepare location drawings (with border, base coefficient, size
        coefficient, and technical requirements). When all is complete, the City
        Planning Agency evaluates, registers, and approves the application.
        Once the application has been approved, the City Planning Agency
        transfers the file back to the Surabaya one-stop shop which then
        notifies BuildCo that the statement is ready for pick up.

        Regulations establish a statutory time of 7 days for the city planning
        statement to be issued, but it usually takes longer.

        This procedure is governed by the following regulations:
        a. Local Regulation No. 7 of 2010 on Buildings
        b. Local Regulation No. 5 of 2012 On City Maps
        c. Major Regulation No. 39 of 2012 on Guidelines and Technical

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March (for 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city). As noted, the
warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff schedules may apply if a time-of-
use tariff is available.

       Land certificate examination at the Land Office

       A land certificate examination is carried out by a Land Deed Official. If
       the land book concerned is available at the Land Office, it usually takes a
       few hours to 1 day. However, sometimes the land book is unavailable,
       misplaced or being used by another division of the Land Office, so then
       the examination process will be pending and it usually takes a few days
       to obtain the information from the Land Office. The land title search
       would also involve a check at the local city planning office located at the
       local government office to determine the intended use of the said plot of      3 days            Rp. 50,000

       land, whether for residences, industry or green belt. No written
       statement is given, but a note made on the certificate saying 'Has been
       examined and in accordance with the register at the Land Office'. The
       cost for this procedure is IRD 50,000. The PPAT pays this fee at a bank
       and brings the payment receipt to the Land Office for the examination to
       start.

      Execution of sale and purchase of Land Deed by a PPAT official

      The execution of the sale and purchase of Land Deed is made before
      Land Officials (who are often public notaries as well) appointed by the
      Head of the National Land Office (PPAT) or a local Head of a District
      (Camat PPAT), after the taxes in Procedures 3 and 4 have been paid. For
      convenience, those payments are usually made by the notary three days
      before the execution of the sale-purchase deed. The PPAT obtains an
      appointment with the Land Office using the online platform
      (loket.bpn.go.id) to register the land deed.

      The documentation shall include:
      (i) Original land certificate                                                             1% of the property

      Every year, the local PBB Tax Office issues a tax assessment to land
      owners. By custom, the buyer usually wants to obtain the original of the
      payment of PBB for the past three years and utility bills for the last three
      months--though in practice the office will check the last 10 years. The
      Land Deed Officer drawing up the sale and purchase deed will only need
      to see the most recent PBB while the Land Office will need a copy of the
      most recent PBB for registering the land into the name of the new
      owner.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                                                 temporarily by the initiation of the bankruptcy proceedings, would
                                                 take approximate 2 years in total. BizBank would initiate foreclosure
                                                 after Mirage's default on payment. According to Part Six of Law
                                                 No.37 of 2004 regarding Bankruptcy and Suspension of Obligation
                                                 for Debt Payment, Mirage would petition to the Commercial Court
                                                 for a suspension of payments. The foreclosure procedure then gets

                                                 which can be granted as an extension of time is 270 days. During
                                                 this time, Mirage must propose a composition plan and creditors will
                                                 decide whether to accept the plan, reject it or proceed to a
                                                 permanent moratorium. BizBank is likely to vote against the
                                                 composition plan, which will lead to Mirage being declared
                                                 bankrupt. At that time, moratorium ends, and BizBank can proceed

market regulation are based on a detailed questionnaire
on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
     Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
       age 19, with one year of work experience.
     Is a full-time employee.
     Is not a member of the labor union, unless
       membership is mandatory.
The business:
     Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).

Job quality
Doing Business introduced new data on job quality in 2015. Doing Business 2017 covers eight questions on job
quality (i) whether the law mandates equal remuneration for work of equal value; (ii) whether the law mandates
nondiscrimination based on gender in hiring; (iii) whether the law mandates paid or unpaid maternity leave; (iv)
the minimum length of paid maternity leave (in calendar days); (v) whether employees on maternity leave receive
100% of wages; (vi) the availability of five fully paid days of sick leave a year; (vii) whether a worker is eligible for
an unemployment protection scheme after one year of service; and (viii) the minimum duration of the contribution
period (in months) required for unemployment.

the nonlinear transformation, an increase in the total tax
rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier
score for the total tax rate—and therefore on the
distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
