                         policy.
                             Tax incentives are, therefore, advised for the computer and communication equipment segments
                         given these segments’ priority and sensitivity to this type of support. Based on existing literature, glob-

                         Ethiopia Investment Proclamation. Moreover, it is critical that any incentives should carefiully consider
                         the potential trade off between financially incentivizing investments and its impact on public finances,

                         To signal government commitment to sector development it may be advised to introduce this lower
                         rate for both domestic and foreign manufacturing companies only—similar to the lowered tax rate for
