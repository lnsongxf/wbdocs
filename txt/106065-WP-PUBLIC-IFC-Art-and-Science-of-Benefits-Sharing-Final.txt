Each chapter opens with a list of questions that can be
used as a guide to assess the potential benefits and costs
of an investment. The questions are not exhaustive,
but are thought to be a useful starting point for review,
or for initiating dialogue about net impacts and risks
across constituencies.

     IFC Guiding Questions on Financial Benefit Sharing


     How do the project’s fiscal terms and conditions (royalty rates, profit tax holiday
     etc.) compare with those in other countries?



     How does the project’s benefit-sharing compare to common industry measures,
     such as the Effective Tax Rate (ETR) used in the mining sector?



     How is the project’s net present value (NPV) shared, using a base case set of
     assumptions of the factors that determine project results?



     How does the distribution of benefits change with variations in project costs, prices,
     and volumes?



     What is the investor’s expected real rate of return after tax?



     What are investors’ risks, and are returns commensurate? Did the project result
     from an exploration investment or is it a known resource? Are there other
     particularly challenging technical or political risks?



     Is the project consistent with the government’s policy objectives and overall
     legislative framework, and do these policies seem sustainable? What is the timing
     profile of anticipated revenue flows?



     How were rights to exploration, development and production awarded? How were
     the project’s terms set? Was there a transparent process, competitive auction, open
     access on standard conditions, or were they negotiated? Who are the investors?



     Are there benefits or costs not captured by the financial analysis that should also be
     taken into account?



     Are there any issues of special concern? Even if the fiscal sharing is reasonable, are
     there any terms that are questionable or possible outcomes that threaten the
     deal’s sustainability?

     BOX 2.1: Capturing all Financial Costs and Benefits

     All relevant costs and benefits should be captured in the financial model to present a complete
     picture of the project’s total financial profile for both governments and investors. Fully capturing
     applicable costs and benefits requires rigorous analysis and should include potentially key items,
     such as transfer pricing or thin capitalization.

     Investors incur costs through their investments and receive benefits through their share of net
     cash flows, usually distributed as dividends. In addition to normal sales revenue, investors can
     extract value through service charges from associated companies that more than recover the costs.
     Sometimes investors may benefit from transfer pricing. Even though many agreements and often
     general tax law prohibit inappropriate transfer pricing, a 2013 study identified transfer pricing as a
     potential major source of lost revenues for African governments (Africa Progress Panel 2013).5

     Investors commonly use a mix of equity and debt to finance projects to leverage their post-
     tax equity returns or to manage their exposure to project risks through non-recourse finance.a
     Financial structure may have some impact on overall benefit sharing through its impact on taxes
     payable. “Thin capitalization” rules will limit this as the rules control the amount of debt that a
     company can take on and the rates of interest it can pay. (See discussion of transfer pricing and
     thin capitalization in Appendix A.)

     Countries incur costs and receive benefits from projects through different forms of taxes
     (Appendix A) and from the country’s share of net profits, if any. Countries may also benefit
     financially if the country gains access to energy or other resources at below-market value, and
     if the country receives infrastructure or other services from the project at below-market values.
     Conversely, if a country supplies a project with a service such as electricity or other infrastructure
     at below its cost or market value, supplying this service will be a cost to the country.

     Note: a. Nonrecourse finance refers to funding from commercial and other lenders that will be repaid from the project only when the
     lenders have no or limited recourse to the investors if the project does not go well.

     BOX 2.2: Adjusting Cash Flows for the Cost of Time and Uncertainty

     The financial benefits and costs of a project consist of a series of cash flows, both positive and
     negative, that can extend over many years. Typically, there are large outflows over a relatively
     short period at the start as investments are made to build the project, followed by a longer
     stream of net positive flows once production begins. In assessing the profitability of projects
     and in making a reasonable assessment of their benefit sharing, analysis should move beyond a
     simple addition of flows to adjust for the following two factors:

     1.	 Inflation: Even modest levels of annual price inflation over long periods mean that the
         same amount of money in the future will be worth much less in real terms (what it can buy)
         than it is today. Proper analysis is needed to allow for these increases in inflation by using
         consistent assumptions about inflation throughout the project analysis (assumptions about
         costs, prices, financing costs, taxation treatment, and, ultimately, about converting net cash
         flows to real terms).

     2.	 Time value of money: Funds that are received years in the future are less valuable than
         funds available today that could, for example, be spent or used for other investment. NPV-
         based analysis adjusts for these timing differences in a project’s cash flows by discounting
         future flows. For example, if it is assumed that for every year a receipt is delayed, its value
         is reduced by 10 percent, then, in NPV terms, a payment of US$100 to be received in three
         years is worth only US$75.13 today.

     Investors typically use as their discount rate a “cost of capital” return that markets expect
     investments to earn. This expected rate of return can vary by subsector and time period. For
     industrial companies, 7 to 11 percent in real terms after tax is common. The appropriate
     discount rate for governments is generally argued to be as low as 2 to 3 percent in real terms.
     IFC applies a common discount rate of 10 percent real to project cash flows to investors and
     governments. This is because revenues from natural resource projects are highly uncertain and
     a discount rate of 2 to 3 percent for governments is too low for many developing countries.
     Developing country governments are frequently short of investment funds and have uses for
     these funds with prospective rates of return well in excess of 2 to 3 percent.

     There is always uncertainty around expected future cash flows from projects. Using a range of
     assumptions for key variables can test for alternative outcomes. How project returns and benefit
     sharing change with different assumptions and scenarios provides an important insight into the
     risks carried by the different stakeholders. See Appendix B for further discussion of these issues.

     IFC Guiding Questions on Financial Benefit Sharing among
     Different Levels of Government


     Do any affected subnational governments have the right to tax natural resource
     projects, and if so, how?



     Does the central government have a formula for sharing the revenues it collects
     with other levels of government, how is the sharing determined, and how does
     it take place?



     Are the revenues that are expected to flow to subnational governments significant
     (particularly to the directly- affected local governments), and how widely are the
     revenues shared with lower levels of government and regions adjacent to the
     producing areas?



     Are there constraints on what the revenues can be used for?



     What are expectations of affected local governments and communities concerning
     the scale, timing, and volatility of revenues?



     Are reasonable transparency and accountability mechanisms in place to help ensure
     that revenues received by local governments will be properly accounted for?



     Do subnational levels of government have the capacity to effectively manage and
     use revenues from the project?



     Are natural resource revenues integrated into local budgeting, with a plan to use
     revenues to help the impacted communities?



     Are the developers, local governments, and other stakeholders collaborating
     effectively to protect communities and is engagement with communities productive?



     Where revenues flow to communities from voluntary payments by developers, are
     there conflicts of interest, governance issues, or concerns about fair treatment of
     neighboring communities; and how is spending evaluated by governments
     and communities?

     THE PROS AND CONS OF CASH TRANSFER TO INDIVIDUALS


     Some economists feel direct distribution of revenues to citizens is an effective way to reach
     them and can improve their lives (Arezki and others 2012). However, direct distribution
     only happens in relatively few places, such as Alaska in the United States. Sometimes,
     members of a particular community or group may benefit financially directly from
     projects, such as landowners in Papua New Guinea and members of aboriginal groups
     in Australia whose traditional land title is recognized. In Canada, First Nations members
     enjoy rights that can lead to royalties and other benefits flowing to them. In South Africa,
     some communities may have rights to an equity share in mines nearby.


     Revenues that flow to groups can be substantial, and their distribution across current
     and future beneficiaries requires effective and transparent management. Traditional
     communities and individuals who have little experience with a cash economy may not
     successfully manage large amounts of funds and could easily end up worse off. There is
     the potential for vulnerable groups, such as women, to be further marginalized in cash
     transfer systems. Disparities among neighbors may raise issues, and cash distributions
     may generate dependency or credit problems rather than sustainable development. In
     general, cash flows will be a more effective form of benefit sharing if they are part of a
     broader package of development objectives and appropriate delivery mechanisms.

  BOX 3.1: Lessons Learned from IFC Revenue Management Programs3

  Building Local Government Capacity—What Works?

  •	   Start with the big picture. Government officers often act in silos. They need a basic
       understanding of the overall framework for public financial management and their role in
       the process.

  •	   Aspire to changing behavior. Focus should be on how to change day-to-day
       behavior in key areas through well-structured guidance, tools, and practical examples
       of good practice.

  •	   Concentrate capacity building efforts in a few key areas. Identify and concentrate
       on the key bottlenecks. Focus on how things can be done better by sharing proven good
       practices and support their adaptation through simple tools.

  •	   Develop trust. Provide practical advice and solutions.

  •	   Be mindful that absorptive capacity is weak. New practices and requirements
       need to be phased in and targeted so as not to overwhelm already under-capacitated
       local governments.

  •	   Capacity building has limits. There are limits to how much know-how small
       municipalities will be able to absorb and maintain in-house. Furthermore, some expertise
       might only be needed occasionally. The important point is not necessarily to have the
       expertise in-house, but to identify and have access to it when needed.

     IFC Guiding Questions on Project Impacts on the Local Economy


     What is the potential impact of the project on the local community and country in
     terms of linkages to local suppliers, to local off takers or purchasers of product, and
     local employment?


     What are the expected employment multiplier and local spend of the project?



     Has the investor compared project demand for skills, materials, and services with the
     available local human and business resources, including the capacity of local suppliers?


     What are national government requirements for local procurement and
     employment? Are they realistic? Do they offer reasonable returns for any resulting
     extra costs or tax reductions?


     Are there potential areas for competitive local supply and import substitution, and
     are programs in place to develop local suppliers, including financing sources? Are
     local businesses aware of opportunities?


     Are the investors’ recruitment, skills training, procurement, and supplier development
     plans aimed at enhancing local participation? Are they consistent with community
     expectations and aspirations for development? Are they integrated as appropriate
     with government programs? Does a review of skills and procurement demand across
     the industry exist? Does a sector wide approach to building local capacity exist?


     Have the investor’s regular international suppliers assessed the prospects for local
     supply and subcontracting, joint ventures, and skills upgrading?


     Is there the potential for all investors present in a particular location to work
     together and optimize the development of the local supplier industry?


     What is the potential for competitive local processing of production from the
     project? Can, for example, part of production, including oil and gas, be economically
     used locally and help develop downstream industries or provide more secure and
     competitive local energy access?


     Are there opportunities to meet the infrastructure needs of the project in a cost effective
     way and have local communities and the economy generally also benefit? Is there scope
     for increased coverage of infrastructure services at reduced costs? Is there potential for a
     collaborative approach to jointly serve community, national, and project needs?

     RESEARCH FINDINGS ON EMPLOYMENT AND MULTIPLIER IMPACTS


     A World Bank study on the linkages between mining and the economy found that in
     Chile, the sector accounts for over 700,000 direct and indirect jobs, or approximately 10
     percent of the workforce (McMahon and Moreira, 2014). In Peru, the estimated number
     of jobs created by its mining sector was similar. Another study found that the multiplier
     impact—the total number of jobs eventually created from one job in the mining sector—
     can be 10 or more (Apoyo 2009). An assessment of the Ahafo mine in Ghana found that
     the employment multiplier was 28 (Kapstein and Kim 2011). Allowing for the impact of
     government spending of mining tax revenue, the number of jobs created would be even
     higher. Another World Bank study found that, in Zambia, 2,448 direct jobs in mining led to
     26,850 jobs overall (World Bank, 2011).

     BOX 4.1: IFC Local Supplier Development Program—Rio Tinto Simandou
     Iron Ore Project in Guinea
     To optimize its economic impact on local communities, Rio Tinto is developing its local supply chain.
     However, local businesses lack technical and management skills, consistency in delivery, and an
     understanding of international firms’ requirements for health, safety, and environmental standards.
     As a response, Rio Tinto and IFC launched the Local Supplier Development Project in late 2012.


     The Objective of the Program
     The objective of the program is to support the Simandou project to: i) increase local supplier
     capacity to overcome weak organizational structures, lack of management and low levels
     of financial and technical skill, and poor access to markets and finance; ii) create market
     opportunities by adapting procedures and policies of the Simandou project for easier local
     sourcing from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); and iii) meet expectations for local
     content despite the limited capacity of the local private sector. Given the economic fragility in
     which the Simandou project is being developed, expectations are high from the government and
     the host population that the project will be a catalyst for local private-sector development.

     The program is designed to focus on both national suppliers in Conakry and local suppliers
     in the 10 prefectures impacted by the Simandou project. The program consists of various
     interventions that are targeted at Rio Tinto, local SMEs, and other actors involved in the
     cultivation of local entrepreneurship. IFC provides ongoing technical support to Rio Tinto’s
     different operational departments to identify local supply opportunities, particularly SMEs that
     are active in priority sectors, such as earthworks, agriculture, construction, and transport.


     Program Interventions
     The program is also training SMEs on financial and management skills using Business Edge, an
     IFC-backed business training program, as well as specific topics relevant to the mining sector,
     such as health, safety, environment, and others. Particular emphasis is put on identifying and
     developing women entrepreneurship opportunities. To leverage expertise widely, local training
     firms and independent trainers are certified in the use of IFC Business Edge methodology.


     Preliminary Results
     Thus far, local content principles have been developed and included in the investment framework
     and a number potential opportunities to contract local businesses have been identified in priority
     sectors, such as road maintenance, earthworks, catering and transportation. The program
     created a local training market through 17 local consulting firms who have become Business
     Edge franchises in Guinea. Over 200 SMEs have been trained and coached, and a database
     of over 400 SMEs is in place to facilitate interactions between the mining sector and local
     businesses. Moreover, the program set up an enterprise center in the city of Beyla to provide
     business services and facilitate communication between local suppliers and Rio Tinto. The
     current phase of the program has resulted in at least 61 SMEs reporting improved performance
     with US$286,000 in increased revenue and 131 jobs created or maintained.

Lessons learned
A close partnership is necessary to deal with changing circumstances.
Soon after the launch of the supplier development program, development of the Simandou
project slowed and construction temporarily stopped. Partners were able to make quick
amendments to the program, including a prioritization of women entrepreneurship, to ensure
continued implementation.

Dedicated personnel are required. Effective and strategic program coordination and
planning depend on dedicated personnel who are also incentivized for successful implementation
and delivery. Human and financial resources must be set aside.

Outreach must be targeted at women. Unless the program specifically targets women
in its advertising or holds events for women only, women are unlikely to be reached effectively.
Despite expectations, general marketing and advertisement to the general supplier population
has attracted few women. Even women-owned SMEs frequently send male participants
to trainings. Training curriculum must contain modules that specifically address women
entrepreneurship needs.

     IFC Key Guiding Questions on Project Environmental
     and Social Impacts


     Have project environmental and social risks and impacts been identified and evaluated?
     Has a mitigation hierarchy been adopted to anticipate and avoid risks and impacts to
     workers, affected communities and the environment? Where avoidance is not possible,
     does the mitigation hierarchy minimize and compensate/offset risks and negative
     impacts? Are appropriate strategies and processes identified to manage adverse impacts
     and enhance positive impacts?

     Are national requirements and IFC Performance Standards (IFC PS) on Environmental and
     Social Sustainability being observed?

     Are investor commitments to Good International Industry Practice (GIIP) and the IFC PS
     credible? Does the project have the appropriate policies, staff capacity, and systems in
     place to manage operations in accordance with these standards?

     Has a Stakeholder Analysis been conducted? Have all communities and other stakeholders
     likely to be impacted been identified? Have baseline surveys been conducted to
     gather information about concerns and expectation to guide environmental and
     social management plans, community development plans, and future monitoring and
     evaluation? Is it understood how different stakeholder groups within communities and
     the country will gain or lose from the project?

     Has a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) been devised and implemented? Is there an
     ongoing process that will run throughout the project life to ensure effective participation
     by all affected stakeholders, including local communities, civil society, local businesses,
     local and national government, and investors?

     Is there an appropriate system of community and public reporting on outcomes and are
     there appropriate independent oversight, monitoring, and evaluation mechanisms in
     place and sufficiently resourced? Is there an independent grievance mechanism?

     Are individual and community issues addressed and community consultations underway
     to inform, consult, and understand concerns? Are opportunities for community feedback
     and participation included?

     Is there an agreed community development plan, consistent with the project and local
     government plans in areas such as jobs, entrepreneurial opportunities, infrastructure and services?
     Are local government and others engaged to support sustainability and leverage impacts?

     Does the community broadly support the project? If there are groups that do not support
     the project or if there are concerns, are these understood and appropriately addressed? Is
     an easily accessible and effective grievance mechanism in place?

     Are there processes and resources available to address long-term issues, such as closure,
     and unforeseen, but costly risks, such as natural disasters? Are there cumulative impacts
     that need attention?

     BOX 5.1: Broad Community Support

     International practice varies regarding the rights of communities to share in the benefits of
     extractive projects and their rights to approve or veto projects. Some communities have strong
     legal rights to share in the fiscal flows of projects and may benefit substantially in financial
     terms. Others may receive nothing in financial terms and may benefit directly only in other ways,
     such as through jobs, community spending, or access to infrastructure services.

     In its Management Response to the Extractive Industries Review (EIR), the World Bank Group
     introduced the requirement that local communities should benefit from and broadly support oil,
     gas, and mining projects financed by IFC or another member of the World Bank Group.

     Where there is no absolute test of the reasonableness of the overall package of costs and benefits,
     the community’s support or lack thereof is an important potential measure of a project’s
     viability. As part of its appraisal process of proposed projects, IFC verifies whether there is Broad
     Community Support where applicable.

     A community’s support was adopted as a condition for natural resource projects after the
     conclusion of the EIR. In 2006, the IFCs Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability,
     which was further revised in January 2012, broadened the requirement for broad community
     support beyond the resource sector for projects with significant adverse impacts.

BOX 5.2: Gender Impacts of Projects

Without special efforts to take account of gender issues and risks, projects typically benefit
women (and children) less than men, and may expose women to new problems. Women tend
to be substantially underrepresented in the oil, gas, and mining workforce.a An undifferentiated
view of community benefits that does not account for gender differences risks providing a
misleading picture of the net benefits on the ground.

A review of the gender impacts of onshore oil projects in three countries found that women
typically bear more of the costs of development and receive fewer of the benefits than men.b
How impacts are experienced can relate to changes in economic position and in social status.c
This differential impact is accentuated when existing gender inequalities are pronounced,
putting at risk the developmental impact that could otherwise be achieved. Failing to properly
assess gender differences is a missed opportunity. More attention to gender issues during
project implementation and when engaging with communities could alleviate negative impacts
that resource developments can bring to communities. Similar experiences have been identified
in mining projects.d

Companies are increasingly aware of the win-win aspects of proactive policies regarding gender.
Community programs are more successful and company workforces more safety conscious,
for example, when women are incorporated. Women reportedly make up more than half of
the heavy equipment workforce at Newmont’s Ahafo mine in Ghana. Some industry analysts
report that companies can gain a competitive advantage if they are proactive in employing and
mobilizing women.e

The proportion of women in the workforce is generally low, especially at higher level jobs. The
industry group Women in Mining and Pricewaterhouse Coopers found that women fill fewer
than 10 percent of board positions in the top 500 mining companies.f This figure, similar to the
oil and gas sector, is the lowest of any industrial sector. They also found a positive correlation
between the number of women on a mining company’s board and its financial performance.
More resource companies and governments have initiated programs to promote women
in the workforce recognizing the myriad benefits this can bring to project and community
development.g But alongside hiring efforts, additional sensitization and practical changes often
need to be made at the operational level to retain female talent.

Appendixes




APPENDIX A: RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND TAXATION

There is a large pool of literature about the nature of nonrenewable resources and their ownership and
optimal taxation. Most reviews of resource taxation identify four key objectives that should drive design:

1.	 Governments should collect as much of the “rent” (returns generated from the project over
    and above what is needed to incentivize investors) as possible, and doing so usually requires
    progressive taxation (IMF 2012).

2.	 Taxation structures should be “neutral” and not lead investors to develop a resource in a
    suboptimal way.

3.	 Investors need adequate compensation to incentivize them to take risks and invest.

4.	 Taxation structures need to allow for government capacity to negotiate, design, administer, and
    carry the risk of different forms of taxation.


Uncertainties and Flexibility
If there were complete certainty about the nature of a resource and its future outcomes, estimating
its rent and designing an optimal tax structure or agreement would be relatively straightforward.
Once in place, taxation structure and agreements should ideally be responsive to changing market
dynamics, but getting this right is not always easy, given the complexity of designing and administering
appropriate tax systems and the demands these systems put on taxation authorities and investors.

In practice, there is considerable uncertainty about the values of the key parameters that determine
a project’s success. This uncertainty will decrease over the life of the project, but will not wholly
disappear. In the exploration phase, there may be considerable uncertainty about whether a viable
resource even exists. Even when a resource is identified, there will be uncertainty about the capital
costs preconstruction; about production levels, operating costs, and sales prices in the operating
phase; and about closure and decommissioning costs at the end of project life. There is debate about
what the appropriate return to investors should be, how much rent will be generated, and how this
rent should be shared.

Any form of contract intended to last over the long life of a resource (sometimes decades)runs the
risk of coming under pressure as circumstances change significantly from when the contract was
signed. In theory, contracts can be written to build in flexibility. In practice, contracts may not cope
well with major changes.

                                                                                                             65
     Over the last 10 years, for example, very high commodity prices have led to large increases in profits
     and company values across the resources sector. While volatile prices are a normal part of the
     commodities business, and a few years of high prices would not generally signal a major change from
     expectations, there has emerged a view that high commodity prices in the last decade present a ‘new
     normal’. There seems to be a strong perception in some countries that they have not participated
     enough in the windfall. Various oil, gas, and mining country governments have moved to renegotiate
     and change terms and conditions to capture more of the increased value, as a result.


     Common Considerations in the Mining, Oil & Gas Sectors
     Most resources are developed subject to specific resource taxes given the particularities of extractive
     projects, i.e. their potential to generate high levels and volatility of profits. There are, however, some
     commentators who believe there may be less rent from many resource developments than commonly
     assumed (Tilton 2010). And they even question whether the resources sector should have a special
     taxation regime. Nonetheless, resource taxation regimes do exist, and there are some common
     considerations in how they are constructed.

     Balancing sector prospects management capacities and revenues: Governments and
     investors need to take a long-term perspective of the prospects of projects and the sector that may
     receive investment and operate over decades. To create the perfect resource framework is very
     difficult, given the uncertainty of outcomes, the associated complexity of particular taxation systems,
     and frequent administrative capacity limitations. Governments will have to compromise between
     optimizing rent collection, neutrality, and administrative and political practicality. Governments may
     offer standard terms and conditions, rather than negotiating deal by deal. The resources taxation
     framework should be linked to the overall taxation framework and to other aspects of government
     policy, such as requiring good accounting standards, transparency, and access to information.

     Setting terms: Clarity and stability in terms and conditions are important factors for investors and for
     governments aiming to attract investment. When governments want to negotiate deal by deal, they need
     to develop the skills to set terms and conditions and to administer them effectively during the duration
     of the contract. Given the monetary values at stake, increased knowledge about the issues, and the
     availability of specialist expertise for hire internationally, acquiring these skills may not be as difficult as
     sometimes suggested.1 Increasingly, transparency about contracts and payments is an important factor in
     generating confidence about the reasonableness of deals and promoting their durability.

     Standard, non-negotiated terms are seen as offering the two benefits of simplicity and being less
     prone to corruption. Some commentators believe that governments will be comparatively weaker
     negotiators because they will usually have less understanding of a resource’s true prospects.
     However, there is a trade-off, and governments can supplement standard terms and conditions with
     some degree of negotiation.

     Competitive bidding through auctions and other processes to access known resources or prospective
     exploration acreage is one way to use the market to optimize tax receipts, enhance transparency,




     1	   For example, see the approach taken by Angola as described in McKenzie, Goldsworthy, and Sunley (2009).

66
and discourage corruption. While they can be complex, auctions can help bypass the complexities
and uncertainties that negotiated deals involve, not least because of their demands on government
capacity and oversight.

Whether terms are standard or negotiated, large changes in circumstances that are outside the
reasonable range of (expected) uncertainty will put agreements under pressure. Having in place or
establishing mechanisms to handle such changes constructively will be helpful.

Common taxation principles: Resource projects often generate rents, and taxation
arrangements should include some mechanism(s) to recover a share of these rents. Governments
have many possible taxation instruments and a wide range of approaches and combinations of these
have emerged and are used today. These instruments are based on country, sector, project specifics,
and on policy and precedent. Governments will vary in their capacity to carry the risks that some
forms of benefit sharing will impose on them (for example, full equity investment). Some approaches
are very sophisticated in how they tax projects, simultaneously aiming to capture a major share of
the resource rent for government and offering appropriate incentives for private investors. Some
common principles across the resource sector include:

•	    Progressive taxes, such as the corporate profits tax, which increase government tax take as
      profitability rises, are better than regressive taxes, which impose costs not related to profitability,
      but to output or price, such as royalties.

•	    For practical and political reasons, some form of regressive tax such as a royalty tax based on
      sales, is likely to be part of an overall package.2 The package would likely also include a corporate
      profits tax and sometimes a mechanism to recover a higher share of exceptional profits (rent).

•	    Tax holidays, in which governments agree not to levy profits taxes and possibly other taxes for a
      number of years regardless of profitability, are usually not needed and are not encouraged by the
      World Bank. Overgenerous depreciation allowances that allow the rapid tax write-off of long-
      life equipment may also pose problems for the timing of government profits from tax flows.

•	    Full or partial exemption from import taxes and value-added taxes for export-oriented resource
      projects is common.

•	    Some form of modest withholding tax on payments for foreign services may be helpful, although
      it will impact costs and taxation neutrality.


Differences between Sectors
While there are considerable variations in taxation within the mining and oil sectors, there are also
long-standing and fundamental differences between these sectors.




2	   Given the depletion of a particular resource, some economists see a royalty payment as an appropriate fee for the resource’s depletion, and
     therefore an essential component of resource taxation. These economists argue that the capacity of a project to pay the royalty should guide the
     decision of whether to develop the resource. Normally, governments need to commit to allow development at the exploration investment stage
     when there is no clarity whether the resource is economic to develop.

                                                                                                                                                        67
     Mining projects usually take place within standard sets of terms and conditions that are relatively
     simple in structure. However, very large projects can be an exception and may involve complex,
     negotiated contracts. Sometimes, even smaller deals have some component of negotiated terms.
     Typically, standard terms include a royalty of 2 to 5 percent on sales (a regressive tax), and a simple
     progressive tax, such as a corporate profits tax at a rate of 30 to 40 percent. Other terms could include
     a dividend withholding tax and exemption from import duties and the value-added tax. Depending on
     the actual rates, such packages can generate a reasonable share of the resource rent to governments and
     are relatively simple to understand and administer. What they do not do well is capture large increases
     in rent (windfall profits) generated by unexpected large and sustained increases in prices.

     For example, with a corporate tax rate of 30 percent, and a royalty rate of 2.5 percent, all other
     things being equal, only 31.75 percent of any increase in revenues from a price rise accrues to
     government.3 Very large mining projects are more likely to be based around individually negotiated
     deals, although some smaller deals may have some negotiated component. Even negotiated mining
     agreements often do not contain the sort of sophisticated progressive tax terms that many, if not
     most, oil projects have.

     Oil project taxation structures typically are more sophisticated and effective in capturing high
     levels of profits than typical mining tax structures. Some of the differences from mining are higher
     levels of profitability and greater rent in the oil and gas sector. While there are different approaches
     to oil taxation, many terms include provisions for an increasing share of a project’s net flows to go
     to government when prices or production increase. Some approaches will relate the share of benefits
     going to government to the cumulative rate of return earned by the private investor. In some cases,
     the marginal share of profits going to government may reach more than 80 percent (Lundgren,
     Thomas, and York 2013).

     Gas projects are often treated differently from oil investments. Due to their transportation and
     market issues, gas projects are more likely to sell their gas at prices that are below the international
     price of oil. Gas projects usually are likely to have less sophisticated profit-sharing arrangements
     than is often the case for oil projects.

     The degree of state ownership is another important difference between the oil, gas, and mining
     sectors. While state ownership varies across countries, the oil sector has a higher degree of
     government equity participation, varying from complete state monopoly to significant or majority
     private ownership with substantial state equity interest.


     Government Equity Participation
     A government equity stake in a resource project can be an alternative to taxes as a way of accessing
     a share of profits. Government equity participation may also be important politically. Some argue
     that government ownership may give it greater insight into operations and thereby improve policy
     or taxation effectiveness. A counterargument is that government ownership may create a strong




     3	   For example, an additional dollar of revenue from an increase in prices will generate an additional royalty of 2.5 cents for government and 97.5
          cents (100 minus 2.5) gross profit increase for the project. Leaving aside timing differences, this increased profit will generate extra taxes for
          government of 29.25 cents (97.5 x 0.3 cents), giving a total revenue of 31.75 cents.

68
government lobby in favor of the state resource development entity at the expense of broader policy
demands. In practice, the accumulation of profits in state companies is not necessarily the same as the
country’s treasury receiving the funds in the form of taxation. As part of their overall fiscal framework,
governments need to ensure that state corporations are appropriately taxed and managed.

Depending on the terms under which it is held, equity ownership will bring a different mixture of
risk and reward to governments and usually will increase government risk compared to the potential
tax alternative. As a normal equity investor in a project, a government will have to put up its share
of the equity capital needed to fund the investment before it generates revenues. As an owner, a
government will also be exposed to the risk that the venture will not to earn a satisfactory rate of
return or fail completely.

There are ways in which governments may be able to tailor their equity involvement to manage
their risk-return balance. For example, governments sometimes require private investors to initially
finance the government’s share of equity with repayment to the investor out of the government’s
share of future profit flows. Governments can also reduce their risk by holding an option (but not
the obligation) to invest in equity in the future at historic cost or some other value once it is clear
how the project will actually perform. Alternatively, they could simply negotiate the right to receive
a share of the equity profit flows, with no financing obligation. This third alternative is effectively
what happens in the oil sector with production-sharing contracts.

Equity participation and rights need to be seen as part of the overall fiscal and investment
conditions package. The rights and options that a government has will impact the distribution
of benefits (and risks) to private investors, and this distribution will have costs in terms of
other conditions and taxes that can be imposed. Moreover, some forms of equity rights held by
governments require investors to provide funding for government that may be repaid only out of
future profit flows. The charges that investors can make for such financing will also impact the net
benefit sharing of governments and investors.


Other Issues in Resource Taxation
Relevant for almost any resource tax structure, a number of practical issues recur and can impact
how much tax is actually collected compared to the tax indicated by the resource’s value and the
taxation system. What follows is a discussion of six related issues that have recently attracted
considerable attention.

Transfer pricing: Generally, taxation arrangements relating to resource agreements (and in
general purpose tax legislation) explicitly state that output and services will be sold and bought
at fair market prices. Resource production companies may be part of integrated companies that
produce, trade, and process materials and buy and sell from associated companies. Local companies
may receive expert technical services or supplies from international affiliates. In the absence of a
market-based, third-party relationship, companies need to establish appropriate transfer prices for
transactions between themselves.

By mispricing these transactions, there is considerable scope for investors to effectively transfer
profits from what is considered a relatively high-tax local regime to another low-tax regime, possibly
in an offshore financial center. As a result, governments will receive lower amounts of taxes than
they should receive under legal agreements or tax law. Some studies have claimed that the amounts
                                                                                                             69
     of taxes or profit sharing being evaded in this way are substantial in the African resources sector
     (Africa Progress Panel 2013).

     Using inappropriate transfer prices usually is contrary to general tax law and is considered
     tax evasion. Governments should ensure that requirements concerning pricing are known and
     effective and, where appropriate, part of the resource development agreements. For example, the
     International Bar Association’s Model Mine Development Agreement4 proposes that transactions
     with affiliated companies follow the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s
     (OECD) “Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administration,”5 based
     around arms-length market pricing as the appropriate basis for transfer prices.

     Governments also need to ensure sufficient capacity to identify risks and to audit properly. While it
     can be complicated to validate sales and cost values for some commodities, for many commodities
     quoted market prices exist, or reasonable unbiased relationships can be derived using the more
     widely quoted prices of related products. Furthermore, considerable expertise exists internationally,
     the cost of which is likely to be low compared to the value at stake. IFC is often an equity investor
     in projects and tries to assures itself that pricing between the company in which it invests, and the
     company’s associates is based as much as possible on verifiable market prices.

     “Thin capitalization” is a special case of transfer pricing. Investors usually have incentives to finance
     projects through a mixture of equity and debt financing. When the leverage ratio between equity and debt
     goes beyond typical industry standards, and interest charges go well above market rates, the financing
     structure can become a mechanism for tax reduction. Most governments have “thin capitalization rules” 6
     to limit financial structures to proportions that are close to what is market appropriate.

     In many cases, companies employ complex tax and financial structures to minimize taxes in ways that
     are legal in the investment country and in their home countries and that account for the relevant tax
     treaties between both. In some cases, structures are driven to minimize tax in their home countries as
     the result of deliberate government policy objectives. For example, current U.S. tax policy, which does
     not tax international profits that are not brought back into the United States, may encourage the use of
     offshore tax financial centers as a means for U.S. companies to invest across a number of countries.

     Governments and the public generally may be surprised at the complexity of arrangements and
     perceive that taxes are being avoided inappropriately. In some cases, this may put considerable pressure
     on governments to react and remedy what is seen as unfair. Recent examples of apparently legal,
     but very low, corporate tax payments by foreign companies in the IT and other sectors in the United
     Kingdom are an example of this tax avoidance from outside of the natural resources sector. Currently,
     there is an international reaction against the aggressive tax planning and transfer pricing of multilateral
     businesses. The G20,7 for example, issued a 15-point action plan that covers this kind of tax planning.

70
Offshore financial centers: Almost all foreign investors use offshore financial centers as a
mechanism to manage ownership of investments and to optimize tax payments. These centers are
not illegal and are not necessarily associated with tax evasion. Tax optimization for investors may
mean taking advantage of home country policies and tax legislation that discourages the direct
remittance of profits from foreign investments to home. These policies many have allowances that
delay any tax payable on profit until it is repatriated. A third-party low tax base enables investors to
flexibly redeploy pretax profits elsewhere. Investment host governments should not necessarily have
a problem with this. Host governments that can reasonably structure tax arrangements to enable
investors to take credit in their home country for local taxes paid probably can increase their own
tax revenues, as a result.

Offshore financial centers may also play a part in schemes intended to disguise true ownership of
assets and flows of illicit funds. Governments need to be alert to what may be money laundering and
respond appropriately in their approach to taxation audits, requirements for disclosure of contracts,
and beneficial ownership, among other factors. International initiatives are working to increase
the information flows and information about offshore centers and their clients. IFC will support
investments that involve the use of entities based in offshore financial centers that meet WBG policy
guidelines (World Bank Group 2011).8

Stabilization clauses and changes in terms and conditions: Investors about to commit
to investments that will pay back only over a long time, are often concerned that the tax terms
and conditions under which they will operate may change after the investment is committed, the
project is operational, and their relative negotiating power with a government is significantly
reduced (the “obsolescing bargain”). Such investor concerns may delay investments. To help
alleviate these concerns, governments sometimes agree to include stabilization clauses in
agreements that guarantee that key terms will not vary over the project life and provide specific
remedies if they do.

A United Nations-sponsored study supported by IFC concluded that, if reasonably drafted, such
clauses may serve a purpose by reducing perceived risks and encouraging investment, especially for
large, complex projects with long paybacks (Shemberg 2009). In general, countries can strengthen
their reputations as good investment locations by respecting agreements made. However, when
circumstances change considerably, these agreements may come under pressure because the
distribution of net benefits is no longer perceived to be fair. A number of governments have made
this case in recent years when large rises in commodity prices have boosted the profitability of
resource projects (Toledano et al. 2014).

Timing of resource taxation flows: Closely related to concerns about the overall sharing of
benefits from resource projects is the timing of government flows. Profits-based taxes usually will be
the most important source of revenues to government on the condition that the project is profitable.

However, it will usually be several years between the announcement that a project will begin
construction and the date it begins producing. Moreover, even if the project is profitable early on,




8	http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/corp_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/what+we+do/due+diligence

                                                                                                             71
     sometimes several more years pass before it pays taxes, because depreciation and other tax terms
     may delay the date that the profits tax is payable. These lengthy delays can frustrate both the
     government and the public, especially in countries in which resource development is starting, and
     particularly in the case of large projects for which expectations are great.

     In some ways, investors are best placed to understand when they are likely to be paying taxes, in
     what form, and the level of uncertainty about these payments. In contract discussions, investors
     should have a strong interest in ensuring that governments understand these issues of delay, and
     that in the investors’ communication and consultation processes, the wider public understands these
     issues as well. The risk of delayed or uncertain taxes on profits needs to be considered carefully when
     governments and investors structure agreements.

     This risk is one of the reasons that governments usually have a royalty component in the taxation
     package. Other approaches or forms of nonprofit-related taxes that may be adopted by governments,
     with different advantages and costs, include:

     •	   Up-front payments generated through auctions or negotiated fees and signature bonuses for
          access to known resources and prospective exploration areas.

     •	   Greater focus on other taxes such, as import taxes, that could be levied on imported equipment
          and materials even in the construction phase, and that can increase project costs up front.

     •	   Less government equity investment requiring up-front financial commitments.

     •	   Minimizing tax terms that delay payment of the profits tax, such as tax holidays or generous
          depreciation provisions.

     •	   Borrowing against (uncertain) future tax receipts, although doing so may pose risks in terms
          of fiscal management and public disappointment when tax revenues that finally come in are
          committed to repay borrowing.

     •	   If delays in tax receipts come as a surprise, governments may be prompted to change the
          previously agreed terms and conditions to generate revenues immediately.

     Capital gains on assets sales: In the last five years, foreign investors have sold or attempted to
     sell the rights to nonproducing resources in a number of countries for large profits. The governments
     of these countries felt that if the investor was realizing a substantial profit, the government should
     receive a share in the form of taxation. However, there was no agreed or unambiguous taxation
     mechanism to do this. For example, the change of ownership might be effected not through the
     direct sale of the asset, but through the sale of shares in an offshore company that directly or
     indirectly owned the asset. There was no consensus among the parties on whether such transactions
     realized a capital gain that was taxable under the existing tax frameworks and agreements.
     Governments have tended to feel that it was unreasonable that the original investor was realizing a
     large profit without any immediate tax due as a result. The high prices realized also suggested that
     the existing tax structure might have been too generous or that the resource was more valuable than
     governments had originally believed. In some cases, governments have attempted to claim a tax from
     the purchaser and not the seller.


72
This is likely to remain a complicated and evolving area of taxation in which governments need
to clarify intentions and legislation, and companies may need to be aware when they negotiate the
sale or purchase of assets.

Offshore accounts: Some local civil society groups have questioned the use by investors
of offshore accounts for receiving and holding the proceeds of production sales (Akabza and
Ayamdo 2009). It is suggested that using offshore accounts leads to loss of benefits to a country
from its resources sector, and that the proceeds of sales—which are usually denominated in
U.S. dollars—should be converted and held in local currency accounts. While offshore bank
accounts can be a means of facilitating corruption, investors view the use of such accounts as
essential to pay for foreign-currency-denominated costs, such as interest and debt repayment
costs, fuel, supplies, and equipment. Forced automatic conversion of U.S. dollar proceeds into
a local currency with the risks of depreciation and nonconvertibility would materially increase
risks to investors, discourage investment, and increase required rates of return. Banks and other
international lenders will be much less likely to lend to projects for which currency
convertibility is a risk.

In practice, once governments have agreed on an overall framework for the development of a
resource, their real interest is not in the gross sales proceeds of production, but in the taxes,
profits, and other payments due under the agreement. Forced repatriation of gross sales proceeds
seems unlikely to offer any sustained net benefit to governments or countries.


APPENDIX B: IFC MEASURES TO ASSESS NATURAL RESOURCE PROJECTS

IFC uses the following measures of project financial and economic performance (all adjusted for
inflation to real terms) to assess resource projects:

•	    Economic rate of return (ERR) estimates the overall economic rate of return that a
      project earns. The ERR is a broader measure of a project’s rate of return than the financial
      rate of return, FRR (see below), because it aims to include all of the economic costs and
      benefits. Thus, the ERR will be calculated before taking off taxes that are a financial but not
      an economic cost, and it will bring into its calculation benefits and costs such as, market
      externalities that are not be captured by the project’s accounting. For example, an adverse
      environmental impact that is not paid for by the project is an example of an economic cost
      that would be included as such in the ERR. For IFC, it is fundamental that the ERR is positive
      and high enough to show that the project is generating a reasonable economic return for the
      resources it employs. Without this, economic value is being destroyed, even though it may
      be attractive to investors because the FRR is high enough.9 The ERR says nothing about the
      sharing of benefits of a project, only that it is creating real economic value that is available
      among all stakeholders and society at large.




9	   A project could have a high FRR for investors, but a low or negative ERR for the world as a whole, if, for example, the project was supported
     financially through subsidies from the government or users (for example, through import restrictions or tariffs).

                                                                                                                                                     73

                    •	   Net present value (NPV) establishes the value that the project creates above all of its costs,
                         including an appropriate cost of capital for the funds invested. That is, projects with a positive
                         NPV will earn an ERR that is above the cost of capital of the project. How the NPV is shared is
                         core to understanding the overall benefit sharing of a project.

                    •	   Investor’s financial rate of return (FRR) shows the net financial rate of return (after tax
                         but before financing charges) that accrues to the private investment made in the project.

                    Other measures IFC may also use from time to time include:

                    •	   Return on investors’ equity: Investors usually finance with a mixture of equity and
                         debt. IFC will also estimate the private return that the private investment earns on its equity
                         investment (after tax and financing charges). This gives IFC insight into how attractive the
                         project may be to the investors it is supporting.

                    •	   Return to the domestic economy measures the return the country earns in all forms on
                         the resources it commits to the project. It provides a guide to the overall attractiveness of an
                         investment from the country’s perspective. This can be a useful test for governments that plan to
                         invest resources to support the project on the expectation of a broad range of national benefits,
                         especially when the investors are all foreign.


                    Selected Issues
                    Discount Rates to use: There is a rich and active business school and economic literature about
                    such estimates, and in particular about the appropriate cost of capital that should be used for
                    NPV analysis and to set benchmarks for ERRs. For simplicity, IFC uses a common 10 percent real
                    discount rate for its NPV calculations. This is close to many estimates of the appropriate cost of
                    capital for resource investment, which vary according to the historical time period used to estimate
                    them. IFC will also look at how benefit shares vary using different discount rates.

                    How important the choice of discount rate may be depends to a certain extent on the project.
                    However, a positive discount rate when calculating the public versus private take will invariably
                    reduce the share of total benefits going to the investors. This is because of the typical nature of
                    the project investment cycle where investors put up the capital expenditure for the project in the
                    beginning and it will be some time before they reap profits. Typically, the higher the discount rate the
                    lower the private investor’s share will be.
74
Higher profitability projects will be relatively less impacted than low-rate-of-return projects. For
example, an IMF study of a number of mining and petroleum-producing countries found that
projects with relatively high rates of return did not experience much change in the proportions of
NPV cash flows to the governments when different (lower) discount rates were chosen (IMF 2012).
However, for low-rate-of-return projects, changes in the discount rate used can have a marked
impact on shares. This can be illustrated by using a simple hypothetical model (Appendix C) of a
resource project and looking at how NPV shares differ between one based on a zero percent discount
rate and one based on a 10 percent real discount rate.

Using this simple model, in a lower-rate-of-return “base case,” the share due to government changes
from 38 percent to 97 percent, as the analysis changes from not discounting flows (a 0% discount
rate) at all to applying a 10 percent discount rate (table A.B.1). In the “higher profitability” scenario,
the government share changes less, from 35 percent measured on a zero percent discount rate basis
to 56 percent measured on an NPV (10 percent) basis.

Project scope: An important factor in IFC’s decision to invest in the development of a project
will be the expected net economic benefits that the development will bring going forward—treating
past spending on exploration as sunk costs. These net benefits are captured by the economic rate or
return. However, in its review of the overall benefit sharing of the project—the split of NPV—IFC
will include the preconstruction spending by the investors, including on exploration. In some cases,
allowing for such spending may be relatively straightforward. For example, an investor may have
taken out an exploration license, explored for a few years, found a resource, evaluated it, produced
a bankable feasibility study, and then approached IFC for financing as it moves into the development
phase. Adding back such predevelopment costs to get a sense of the overall sharing of costs and
benefits including these costs is relatively straightforward.

In other cases, the discovery may have followed a decade or more of unsuccessful exploration in the
same region or in different regions of the country or even in adjoining countries. It is a judgment
call as to which portion of these past costs should be included in an analysis of benefit sharing for a
particular project.

Sometimes, the investor developing the project may not have found the resource, but instead bought
the rights to it from another investor, possibly at a substantial premium. While the acquisition price
is a cost to the new owner and developer, part of the price may be profit to the seller, who may or
may not have paid taxes on such profit. The overall private sector balance of costs and benefits will
be different from that of the investor who is developing the project. This difference may lead to
differences in perspective between investor and government on how profitable a development is and
the reasonableness of the benefit sharing.

Depletion of resources and future generations: There is a rich literature about the
economics of natural resources and their depletion. When it comes to benefit sharing, it is important
to address the issue of benefit sharing across generations. For example, it is argued that a country
today and for some time will enjoy the taxes and other benefits that flow from a natural resources
development, but future generations will not benefit in the same way if the resource is depleted.
From this perspective, benefit sharing assessments should take into account the issue of whether
and how future generations should be compensated and what are the implications for resource
development. National wealth accounting is one possible framework to consider in the context of
evolving approaches to national accounting.
                                                                                                             75
     Arguments against the need for accounting for depletion focus on the ambiguity about whether
     resources will be actually depleted in practical terms, given the potential for new discoveries and
     technological advances that will expand the resource base. Depletion may be true for a specific
     resource, but not for resources generally. And, typically, societies do pass on greater wealth to future
     generations than was inherited, although its form may change without specifically accounting for the
     benefit derived from natural resources development.10


     APPENDIX C: INTRODUCTION TO SIMPLE MODEL AND SCENARIOS

     Financial models of oil, gas, and mining projects can be very complicated, in part because of the
     nature of projects themselves and the key factors that drive their success. Additional complexities
     are created by the multiple forms of taxes that interact with one another and with other assumptions
     such as financial structure, interest rates, exchange rates, and inflation. A simple model can help
     illustrate key characteristics of a project and tax system, provided limitations arising from these
     simplifications are kept in mind.

     The hypothetical model in tables C.1 and C.2 is intended to illustrate what might happen to a
     government’s share of the net financial benefits of a project measured in NPV terms. This model
     assumes that the government made no investment in the project and receives revenues only in the
     forms of profits taxes and a fixed percentage royalty on sales.

     To keep it simple, the project is not leveraged and is financed by the investor in the form of equity. In
     practice, this scenario would be unlikely, and introducing debt probably would increase the overall
     share going to the private sector, but not by much. No tax holiday for a profits tax is assumed
     here. And the project is assumed to pay tax once the accumulated net profits after accumulated
     depreciation are positive. It is assumed that the government does not collect any taxes based on
     capital and operating costs, such as import duties and nonrefundable value-added tax. In reality, this
     assumption is not unusual, but in some cases, these forms of tax can be important, especially in the
     early or preoperational phases of a project. Other forms of payments to the government that would
     likely exist, such as land rental and administrative fees, are not assumed here and are not likely to
     be important to the overall messages. Governments may also earn taxes on employees’ salaries and
     spending, but these taxes are not included here.

     The investor’s net returns are the sum of the investment costs and its share of profits after taxes.
     No account is taken of any additional taxes that the investor (if a foreign investor) or the investors’
     shareholders may pay in the investor’s home country. From a high-level economic perspective, a
     decision as to whether to support a project depends on costs and benefits going forward, so past
     exploration spending would not figure in. However, from the perspective of sharing the financial
     benefits of the project, past costs of the investor to find and appraise the resource are figured in
     here. NPV estimates are made on the basis of a 10 percent real discount rate. All dollar values are
     expressed in real terms. For simplicity, prices are assumed to be constant at scenario values through
     all the years of the scenario.




     10	 Some of the richest resource-producing countries do account for and plan to preserve the benefits of their resource development for future
         generations through sovereign wealth funds and other mechanisms intended to ensure that the financial flows from resource developments are
         used for longer term development or future generations.
