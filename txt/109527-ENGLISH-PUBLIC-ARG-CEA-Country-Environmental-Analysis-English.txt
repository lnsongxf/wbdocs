The report is based in the diverse challenges faced by the environment and natural resource sector in
Argentina, especially those relating to new challenges in the rural economy, but also by urbanization and
industrial development. Steady economic growth, increasing equality, and structural economic transfor-
mations fundamentally change the features of environmental challenges – but also how they can be man-
aged to help reverse environmental degradation, and to demonstrate that environmental sustainability,
economic growth, and shared prosperity can be mutually supportive goals.

The Argentina Country Environmental Analysis report was prepared by a team of World Bank Group staff
and consultants working on sustainable development, environment and natural resources. Staff from
other global practices and sectors, such as urban, DRM, energy, and agriculture, contributed importing
supporting material.

Public Expenditures for Environment

low but show an upward trend. National government
spending for Environmental Management accounts
for about 1.7% of the total public spending, and about
0.4% of GDP. By way of comparison a conservative                     More revealing is the trend in environmental spend-

 shows that, as expected, deforestation is signifi-
cantly and positively associated with an increase in
soy cultivation throughout all examined time lags,
yet, the most pronounced effects occur two years
after the deforestation. The effect for other crops
is fundamentally different: In some cases the effect
is negative and about twenty times larger (e.g. sun-
flower) or mixed and about the same size (e.g.
maize). Only for soy we can derive a clear and con-

soy and also that deforestation was foremost driven
by soybean cultivation and not by other crops.
