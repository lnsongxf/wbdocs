as well as through direct communication with the courts.

The analysis covers the aspect of uniformity of court web sites, as well as the technological-
administrative aspect, through the following categories:

   •   Presence on the internet
   •   Finance and development
   •   Availability on the internet
   •   Administrative-technical presentment
   •   Specific contents and online services
   •   User interface

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

PRESENCE ON THE INTERNET

1. Courts in the Republic of Serbia have been present on the internet since 2006.

2. A significant number of courts has a web page, while a certain number of court still does
   not have a web page. Regardless of the fact that a relatively small proportion of the courts
   does not have a web page, it is very important that all courts have their own web
   locations, so as to enable end users to access the court’s services on the internet.

                              Presence of the courts on the internet

                                                           No: 7 : 7%

                                                    2
FINANCE AND DEVELOPMENT

3. The development of the majority of court web pages is self-financed and /or self-
   supported.

                        Development of the web page is supported by
                                                                   NON-GOVERMENT
                                                                   INSTITUTIONS: 10 :

                                  SELF-SUPPORTED: 60 : 85%




4. A significant number of courts participated in designing and developing their web sites.
   Also, a certain number of courts relied on the services of specialized design and software
   development companies.

AVAILABILITY ON THE INTERNET

5. Even though a significant number of court web sites are up and running, a certain
   number of web sites are still inaccessible on the internet. It is necessary that all web sites
   are up and running, so that users can easily access court services on the internet.

                         Court Web Sites Availability on the Internet

                                                        OFFLINE: 4 : 5%




                             UP AND RUNNING:

                                                   4
ADMINISTRATIVE – TECHNICAL PRESENTMENT

6. Majority of court web pages are registered under the official domain (*.sud.rs). A few
   courts are registered different domains. It is recommended that all of the court web sites
   are registered under the same domain (*.sud.rs). It is recommended that all of the courts
   remain unified under a specific administrative-technical entity, so as to assure the users
   to the validity of content and service of the web site.

                                      Multi-domain: 6 : 7%

                         Yes : 77 : 87%




SPECIFIC CONTENT AND ONLINE SERVICES

7. It is evident that the structure, content and services of court web sites vary significantly.
   It is recommended that the structure of content and electronic services, be equalized
   through a centralized/decentralized system of court web sites.

                                          7
8. In most cases the web sites are updated periodically. It is recommended that the courts
   are encourage to post as much information as possible on a daily basis.

                    PERIODICALLY: 45 : 65%



USER INTERFACE

9. Unevenness of structure and various user interface components is evident through
   different usability, structure of components and performances of the user interface, as
   well as the W3C standard compatibility1. Equalization and centralized development of the
   user interface is recommended through ha centralized/decentralized system of court web
   sites.

COMPATIBILITY WITH MOBILE PLATFORMS

10. A significant number of web sites does not have mobile platform version. Due to the
    increasing number of smart mobile devices, it is necessary to update the user interface
    for mobile platforms as well. Central development of user interface (figure 9) would be
    the main solution.

DESIGN AND VISUAL IDENTITY OF COURT WEB SITES

11. An unevenness of visual identity of court web pages is evident. Although the design of
    most web sites is appropriate for the court website, the design structures are balanced
    out, and text structures are correct, the design of the web sites is out of date. The average
    lifespan of a last version of the web site is 3.46 years. As for the user interface (figure 9)
    equalization and central development through a centralized/decentralized system of
    court web sites is recommended.

STORAGE OF CONTENTS OF COURT WEB SITES – “WEB HOSTING”

12. The content of the majority of court web sites is located on a public web hosting. Due
    to the possibility of unauthorized access as well as the confidentiality of the users’
    information gathered through the electronic services, internal storage of contents is
    recommended.

                                     Location of court web sites content
                                                   INTERNAL HOSTING: 2 : 3%

CONTENT MANAGEMENT

13. Site content management is inconsistent. The majority of court web site content is
    organized through the CMS – Content Management System4. A significant amount of web
    sites does not have a content management system, and changes are made through
    directly editing the HTML code, instead. The web sites whose content is organized through
    the site management system, use at least 5 different CMS platforms. It is recommended
    that all web sites use a single platform for site management through a centralized /
    decentralized system of court web sites.

14. The majority of courts have a trained person within the court, responsible for the
    maintenance and updating of the court web site. Courts in Serbia have good support
    through qualified IT personnel. In that sense the courts should decrease their reliance on
    vendor / outsourced services, and should focus on strengthening their internal capabilities
    through adequate training of staff. The courts web development teams are not
    connected. Networking and cooperation of web development teams is recommended as
    it is necessary for a high quality technological-technical exchange. The most promising
    members of the team could be the backbone of development/maintenance of
    centralized/decentralized system of court web sites, through proper training.
