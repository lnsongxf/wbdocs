The Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Sustainable Logistics (MDTF-SL) commissioned a series of short
notes from recognized thought leaders to better understand burgeoning issues within the MDTF-SL’s
thematic pillars. This note explores issues within the Urban logistics & Port-Cities thematic pillar
and has been prepared by Dr Edgar E Blanco from MIT, USA.

The Urban Logistics / Port-Cities pillar is one of three focus areas, or thematic pillars, for the
MDTF-SL. The goal of this pillar is to finance activities that will assist developing countries in two
areas; addressing urban congestion resulting from retail distribution of goods, and improving the
sustainable design and operation of port–cities.

Activities under this pillar will concentrate on reducing congestion and pollution by focusing on the
efficient distribution of goods in urban environments. Additional emphasis will be placed on the
urban planning tools and investments required for port–cites to address sustainability issues endemic
to densely populated economies serving as either a local or regional transport hubs.

and an extreme example of the tensions between local
urban needs and freight. These trade hubs are often at
the heart of major urban centers, are important
contributors to local economies but also generate
significant externalities including urban freight.

As these trade hubs grow in importance, they achieve
efficiencies by a much larger consolidation process
(larger conveyances and facilities that can achieve
even larger economies of scale), but unlike private
urban logistics operations, they seldom decentralize:
their advantage is tied to their historical infrastructure
investments and geographical location. Instead, they
put further pressure to their urban context by
expanding their activities into extensive
inland/hinterland regions, which in turn increases the
flow of freight that flows through the city. Finally,
these trade hubs have even more jurisdictional and
regulatory complexity due to their scale and sheer
volume of activity.                                                            Fig. 1 A matrix of port-city relations.

2    STATE OF THE ART IN URBAN FREIGHT
There is an extensive body of literature related to
urban freight research in North America, Europe and
Japan including urban freight in port cities. An
extensive review, focusing in the US and the EU, can be
found in [3] and [14].

Besides infrastructure investments, Giuliano and
Dablanc summarized the most common urban freight
strategies, along with an assessment of their
effectiveness and applicability to both the EU and the
U.S. This comprehensive list, included in Table 2, is
organized in four major categories: flows in the urban
core (e.g. downtowns), metropolitan wide flows (e.g.
truck vehicle-miles-traveled), environmental impacts
(e.g. pollution) and freight hubs (e.g. ports).

They argued that the most effective strategies were
the following:

 Off-hours deliveries. This strategy seeks to shift
  truck activity out of the peak traffic periods and
  reduce congestion and emissions. However, few
  examples of large-scale successful implementation
  exist since it requires changing hours of operation
  and coordination of shippers, drivers and most
  importantly receivers. There are many point
  examples of successful projects (e.g. Barcelona),
  but there is only one large-scale policy project in
  New York City that is currently under development.

 Voluntary programs. These are private-public
  partnerships aiming at engaging the freight actors
  to agree on voluntary operating rules and targets to
  improve urban freight. Cities like London and Paris
  have decades of successful experience in managing
  programs. They are also very common in the U.S..
