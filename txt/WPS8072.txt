1. Introduction
One of the most salient features of the 21st century is the rising concern about economic
inequality, to the point that it is assessed as ‘the defining challenge of our time.’4 Inequality
has been observed with concern by multilateral organizations, politicians and religious
leaders.5 The concerns about inequality are not only based on efficiency arguments, but
especially on a moral ground. Anecdotal evidence suggests that concerns about inequality
extend to the general population. For instance, protests such as ‘Occupy Wall Street’ are
manifestations of the discontent with the wide income gaps. However, research on how the
general population thinks about inequality, and how factors like age, gender, or education
relate to our views on what is fair and unfair is still scarce.

    Central to this paper is the concept of social justice or fairness and the underlying desire
to live in a just world.6 Since the seminal paper of Rabin (1993), the concept of fairness has
been increasingly important in the field of economics. Fehr and Schmidt (2003) provide an
extensive review of the experimental evidence related to the desire for fairness. The authors
show how in dictator games, participants share part of their endowments even though they
could keep it all. Similarly, in ultimatum games, participants accept a monetary loss to
penalize behavior that is not considered fair, and in gift exchange games, participants are
averse to inequitable outcomes.
    The desire for fairness seems to transcend cultural differences. Throughout Jerusalem,
Ljubljana, Pittsburgh, Tokyo, the Machiguenga of the Peruvian Amazon, and 15 other
small-scale societies, ultimatum game offers are always positive, and payoffs that are not
considered fair are punished by rejecting positive offers at considerable rates.7 Evidence
from psychology suggests the desire for fairness is ingrained in human nature. Children as
young as three years old react negatively to unfair distributions (Loblue et al, 2011),8 and
children’s aversion to inequities also transcends borders (Blake et al., 2015). Insights from
biology suggest preferences for fairness might have evolutionary origins. In their famous
experiment, Brosnan and de Waal (2003) find that capuchin monkeys reject unequal payoffs,
a finding that has been replicated in other species, such as dogs (Range et al., 2009) and
birds (Wascher and Bugnayar, 2015). Bjornskov et al. (2013) show that people who perceive
their society as fairer exhibit higher levels of subjective well-being and, in the context of

  During a visit to Bolivia in 2015, Pope Francis stated that: “Working for a just distribution of the fruits of the
earth and human labor is not mere philanthropy. It is a moral obligation.”
6 Benabou and Tirole (2005) show that this desire is so strong that people distort their perceptions of reality

in order to interpret it as fair.

distributive justice, Corneo and Fong (2008) find that US households put a monetary value
on social justice of about a fifth of their disposable income.
    In this paper, we study the general population’s beliefs about distributive justice, i.e.,
the perception of whether income distribution is fairly distributed, in the context of a
pronounced decline in the income inequality in Latin America (LA), a highly unequal region.
Our approach is to combine income microdata originated from household surveys with
perceptions data from opinion polls surveys. We exploit the heterogeneity across years,
countries, and individuals within countries to analyze how our views of fairness relate to
the actual levels of income inequality.
    Evidence of the relationship between fairness perceptions and income inequality,
particularly in LA, is rather scarce. In Argentina, Rodriguez (2014) finds that people who
consider their income to be fair tend to perceive lower levels of inequality. The work closest
to this paper is CEPAL (2010), which shows that perceptions of distributive inequity in LA
remained persistently high during the 1997-2007 period, consistent with the high levels of
inequality of the region.
    In the first part of the paper we document a series of stylized facts. After a decade of
increasing disparities in LA, the 2000s saw a remarkable decrease in the levels of inequality.
Despite this, the region continues to be one of the least egalitarian in the world, with levels
of inequality comparable to those of Africa (Alvaredo and Gasparini, 2015). To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to show that unfairness perceptions fell during the 2000s in
line with the evolution of income inequality, although we find that unfairness perceptions
are not very responsive to changes in inequality. During the 2002-13 period, a 1 percentage
point decrease in the Gini coefficient was associated with a 1.4 percentage point decrease in
the share of the population perceiving the distribution as unfair or very unfair.
    The evolution of unfairness and inequality was consistent across countries: perceptions
moved in the same direction as the Gini coefficient for 17 of the 18 countries of the region
for which microdata are available. We also show that this change was widespread across
very heterogeneous groups of the population, and that the decline in unfairness perceptions
was driven mainly by a reduction in the intensity of such beliefs (i.e., compared to ten years
ago, fewer people perceive the distribution as very unfair).
    Next, we shed some light on the discussion of whether inequality should be measured
with relative vs. absolute indicators, by analyzing which indicators are more correlated with
unfairness perceptions. We show that relative indicators—and in particular, the Gini
coefficient—are the ones mostly correlated with people’s perception of fairness.
    In the second part of the paper we explore how individual factors and belief systems
affect how inequality is perceived. We find that older, unemployed and more educated
people are more likely to perceive income distribution as unfair. A decomposition exercise
provides evidence on the relative contribution of composition effects vis-à-vis changes in
aggregate inequality trends, to explain the decline in unfairness perceptions during the last

                                              3
decade. Regarding beliefs and unfairness, consistent with theories of fairness, we find that
people leaning to the right of the political spectrum, Catholics, and optimists are more likely
to believe income distribution is fair. Finally, we analyze the link between fairness
perceptions and propensity to protest, and show some suggestive evidence that people who
believe inequality is very unfair are more prone to mobilize.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we document some stylized
facts about distributive justice perceptions and the evolution of income inequality. In section
3, we shed some light on the discussion of whether income inequality should be measured
with absolute or relative measures by studying the relationship between perceptions data
with different indicators of income inequality. In section 4 we analyze whether individuals’
unique backgrounds shape their perception of fairness, by analyzing how individuals’
characteristics relate with perception of distributive justice; and compare the relative
importance of the demographic variables vis-à-vis aggregate trends of inequality to explain
the observed changes in fairness perceptions. In section 5 we analyze the relationship
between different beliefs systems and unfairness, while in section 6 we explore the link
between fairness perceptions and social cohesion. Section 7 concludes.

2. Income inequality and fairness: Some stylized facts
Latin America has long been characterized as a region with high levels of income inequality,
among the least egalitarian regions in the world. Among the ten most unequal countries of
the world for which household survey data are available, eight of them are in LA, and the
rest in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank, 2016), probably the most unequal region in the
world (Alvaredo and Gasparini, 2015). Although the disparities between the poor and rich
are still large, after a period of increasing inequality during the 1990s, the region
experienced a ‘turning point’ in the 2000s, when income inequality saw a widespread
decrease across the countries of the region.9 The social gains in terms of inequality contrast
with what happened in other developing regions in the world, where the declines in
inequality were much more modest (e.g., such as in the Middle East and North Africa), or
even increased (such as in East Asia and Pacific, cf. Alvaredo and Gasparini, 2015, p. 29),
and also contrasted with the increases in inequality experienced by developed countries (cf.,
Atkinson, Piketty and Saez, 2011).

    In this section, we replicate the widespread decrease in income inequality in LA, and
show how perceptions about fairness moved in the same direction. Our primary data set for
income inequality comes from a regional data harmonization effort known as SEDLAC
(CEDLAS and World Bank), which increases the cross-country comparability from official
household surveys.10

    Figure 1 shows a scatterplot of the Gini coefficient of the per capita household income
(in 2005 USD PPP) of 18 LA countries for which comparable data are available both at the
beginning of the 2000s and one decade later (we use years close to 2002 and 2013). The
figure includes a 45-degree line denoting all the points for which the Gini coefficient is the
same in both years, and points to the right of this line denote decreases in income inequality.
                             Figure 1. Gini coefficient circa 2002 and 2013




Note: This figure presents the Gini coefficient for 18 LA countries circa 2002 and 2013. Due to a break in data
comparability or household data unavailability, for some countries we use inequality data from adjacent years.
In 2002, we use: Argentina 2004, Chile 2003, Costa Rica 2010, Ecuador 2003, Guatemala 2006, Nicaragua
2001, Panama 2008, and Peru 2004. In 2013 we use: Guatemala 2014, Mexico 2014, Nicaragua 2014, and
Venezuela 2012. See Data Appendix for further details.

    As is immediately apparent from Figure 1, with the exception of Costa Rica, all countries
of the region experienced a decrease in income inequality. The regional trend is consistent
with the cross-country evidence: the average Gini coefficient has decreased every year since
the beginning of the decade, declining from 0.54 in 2000 to 0.47 in 2015. Moreover, as
Rodríguez-Castelán et al. (2016) note, the decline in income inequality of the region is
robust to the inequality indicator used and to the method of aggregation of the countries.
    We complement the ‘objective’ evolution of income inequality with data from public
opinion polls from Latinobarómetro, which has conducted surveys in 18 Latin American
countries since the 1990s, interviewing about 1,200 individuals per country about individual
socioeconomic background and preferences regarding political and social issues (including
inequality). The surveys are representative at the national level for the population over 18
years old.11 In every country, Latinobarómetro asks “How fair do you think income distribution

11Latinobarómetro has been extensively used for research on several economic issues. For instance, Torgler
(2003) uses this data set to analyze tax morale and tax evasion in Latin America; Graham and Felton (2005)

is in [country]? Very fair, fair, unfair or very unfair?” Using this question, we construct
dichotomic variables reflecting whether the individual believes income distribution is unfair
or very unfair.12 Our baseline definition of unfairness perceptions includes all the individuals
who perceived income distribution as unfair, i.e., we include those who answered both
‘unfair’ and ‘very unfair’, but also show the results are robust to a narrower definition of
unfairness (i.e., considering only those who answered ‘very unfair’). Figure 2 shows the
percentage of each country’s population that believes income distribution is either unfair or
very unfair in 2002 and 2013.
                         Figure 2. Perceptions of unfairness in 2002 and 2013




Note: This figure presents the percentage of the population that believes income distribution is either unfair
or very unfair in 2002 and 2013 for all LA countries for which data is available in. Due to data unavailability
in 2002, for the Dominican Republic we use 2007. See Data Appendix for further details.

    There are several things to note about Figure 2. First, the percentage of the population
that believes income distribution is unfair is strikingly high in both points in time. The
regional average was as high as 86.6% in 2002 (with Argentina peaking at 97.7% of the
population, in the midst of a severe crisis). Even in Venezuela, the country with the smallest
perception of unfairness in 2002, three out of four individuals (74.5%) perceived inequality
as unfair in 2002. Although lower, the share of the population unsatisfied with income
distribution was still astoundingly high in 2013, when about 72.8% of the population
thought inequality was unfair or very unfair.

satisfaction with the privatization of state-owned companies in Latin America.
12 Unfortunately, this question was not asked every year. We restrict our analysis to the years in which this

question was asked: 1997, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2015.

                                                      6
    Second, there was a widespread decrease in the share of the population that perceived
income distribution as unfair. Relative to the previous decade, in 2013 fewer people
perceived income distribution as unfair in 16 of the 18 countries analyzed. The change in
perceptions ranges from modest decreases, such as in Chile, where the decline was of less
than one percentage point, to remarkable reductions, such as in Ecuador, where perceptions
about unfairness declined from 87.5% to 38.6% in the 2002-13 period.
    Lastly, with the exception of Honduras—where, despite falling inequality, the
population perceived the distribution as more unjust—in the rest of the countries both
variables moved in the same direction. To see this more clearly, in Figure 3 we show jointly
the change in the perceptions of unfairness (as measured by the percentage point change in
the share of the population reporting income distribution is unfair or very unfair), and the
change in the Gini coefficient during the 2002-13 period. As can be easily seen from Figure
3, most LA countries lie in the third quadrant, where both inequality and unfairness
perceptions decreased.

Note: This figure presents the percentage point change in the share of the population that believes income
distribution is either unfair or very unfair between 2002 and 2013 (or close years), and the change in the Gini
coefficient between 2002 and 2013 (or close years) for all LA countries. See Data Appendix for more detail.

    The relation between unfairness perceptions and the Gini coefficient is strong both
across countries and time. In Figure 4 panel (a), we show the cross-country correlation
between unfairness perceptions and income inequality in all the years for which both

13 In 1997 Latinobarómetro had a low coverage in large countries with relatively high levels of inequality
(such as Brazil and Colombia), and did not survey other countries at all (such as Dominican Republic). The
increase in the coverage of the survey could drive part of the change in perceptions between 1997 and 2001.

                                                                        8
were calculated through linear interpolations. Panel (b) shows the unweighted average Gini coefficient of LA
and unfairness perceptions since 1997. To ensure the same set of countries is analyzed over time, a linear
extrapolation of inequality indicators was made in the years in which income microdata was not available.

    Figures 4a and 4b indicate that income inequality and unfairness perceptions are closely
related. The linear correlation between the Gini coefficient and the unfairness perceptions
across countries is 0.39, while the Spearman correlation between the ranking of countries
is 0.45 (in both cases, p<.01). The correlation over time is stronger than across countries.
The linear correlation of the series plotted in Figure 4.b is notably high (0.80), and the
correlation between the Gini coefficient and perceptions is very similar if we consider the
share of individuals who responded that income distribution is very unfair (0.79).
   Our results point to a low elasticity of unfairness perceptions to income inequality.14
Pooling the data from all the countries, we find that, during the 2002-13 period, a one
percentage point decrease in the Gini coefficient was associated with a 1.4 percentage point
decrease in the share of the population perceiving the distribution as unfair or very unfair.15
To put this number in context, this means that, at the pace of inequality reduction of the
2000s, it would roughly take LA more than another decade to reduce the population that
perceives income inequality as unfair to 50%.
    The decrease in unfairness perceptions—from almost 90% in 2001 to 72.8% in 2013—
does not seem to be driven by any particular group of the population, but is rather a
widespread phenomenon. To see this, in Figure 5 we present the perceptions of fairness by
dividing the population into several subgroups: according to their age, gender, educational
achievement and labor status.
    Figure 5 reveals some heterogeneity across groups. For instance, relatively younger
populations are less likely to perceive income distribution as unfair (panel a), while females
are more likely to do so, although not consistently across time (panel b). Similarly,
individuals with a higher educational achievement are more likely to believe income
distribution is unfair, while the results according to employment status are mixed.
Regardless of the different average beliefs, the perception of unfairness of all these groups
consistently fell during the 2000s.




14The elasticity of unfairness perceptions to the Gini coefficient is calculated as: = ∆%Unfairness/∆%Gini.
15 The estimated elasticity is the combined effect of a higher elasticity of ‘very unfair’ perceived inequality
(1.99) and a lower elasticity ‘just unfair’ perceived inequality (1.03).

   Not only injustice perceptions fell during the last decade, but the intensity of beliefs also
diminished over time. To see this, Figure 6 shows the evolution of the different possible
answers to the question of unfairness perceptions.

Note: This figure presents the average across 18 LA countries of the share of individuals that perceived income
distribution as very unfair, unfair, fair, and very fair over the 1997-2015 period.

     As can be seen from Figure 6, the decrease in unfairness perceptions was driven mainly
by strong beliefs about unfairness (i.e., people who perceived inequality as very unfair).
While in 2001, 37.4% of the population thought income distribution was very unfair, this
figure decreased to 25% in 2015. In contrast, weak beliefs about unfairness (i.e., the
population that responded income distribution was only ‘unfair’), have been more volatile,
remaining relatively constant during the 2000s (from 51.4% in 2001 to 49% in 2015). On
the other hand, the share of the population believing in a fair distribution increased from a
meager 9.5% in 2001 to a sizable 22.6% in 2015, while strong beliefs on fairness (i.e., ‘very
fair’), have remained under 5% throughout all the 2000s.

3. Is fairness absolute or relative?
In the previous sections, we showed that a large, albeit decreasing, share of the population
believes income distribution is unfair, and that such levels and evolution are consistent with
a high, but also declining Gini coefficient. Despite being the most widely used indicator to
measure income inequality, the general population’s views on income distribution might, in
fact, be better captured with other indices.
    The literature on inequality measurement makes a crucial distinction between two types
of indicators: the relative (such as the Gini coefficient) and absolute ones (such as the
variance). The main distinction between them is that relative indicators fulfill the scale-

                                                      11
invariant axiom, while the absolute indicators meet the translation-invariant axiom. In
practical terms, this means that if the income of the entire population increases by the same
percentage, relative indicators will remain unchanged, while absolute indicators might
increase significantly. The question on which indicator should be used in practice has led to
a heated debate in the literature. Milanovic (2016) provides several arguments to defend the
use of relative indicators in practice, but the fact that they are better from a technical point
of view does not say anything about how the general population perceives fairness.16
    Understanding whether people think about distributive fairness through the lens of
relative or absolute indicators is more than a technical measurement issue or an economist’s
whim. As Ravallion (2003) and Atkinson and Brandolini (2008) note, it has profound
consequences about how we think of important issues such as the distributive effects of
globalization or trade openness. As measured by absolute indicators, globalization has
deteriorated the income distribution since the absolute income differences between the rich
and the poor have increased, but under the lens of relative measurement, income inequality
has been reduced, since the poor have grown proportionally more than the rich in relative
terms.
    We take an agnostic approach and let the data show which inequality indicators are
more correlated with the perceptions of distributive justice. To do this, we calculate 13
different measures of income inequality for all the countries in our sample, and correlate all
the indicators with the share of the population that believes income distribution is unfair
over time.17 Table 1 shows the results for the three different ways of calculating the
correlation between the perceptions and inequality indicators at the regional level: (i)
pooling all the data (i.e. taking simultaneously the indicators of all the countries and
calculating the correlations with that pool of data, columns 1-3); (ii) calculating the average
of the indicators across all the countries in every year, and then calculating the correlation
between the average values of the indicators (columns 4-6); and (iii) calculating the
correlations between inequality indicators and perceptions at the country level and then
averaging the results (columns 7-9).
    Our results suggest perceptions of unfairness are more correlated with relative
indicators rather than absolute ones (Column 1 of Table 1). In fact, the Gini Coefficient—
probably the most used inequality indicator in the literature—is the one with the highest


16 Perhaps the most disturbing instance of a mismatch between ‘best practices’ in inequality measurement
theory and general perceptions is given by Amiel and Cowell (1992), who provide experimental evidence
showing that many respondents do not agree with the Dalton-Pigou axiom, the backbone of all inequality
indicators.
17 The indicators are the Gini coefficient, the ratio between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile, the ratio

between the 90th and 10th percentile, the Atkinson index with an inequality aversion parameter equal to 0.5
and 1, the mean log deviation, the Theil index, the Generalized entropy index, the coefficient of variation, the
absolute Gini, the Kolm index with an inequity aversion parameter equal to 1, and the variance of the per
capita household income (in 2005 PPP). These last three indices correspond to the absolute measures of
inequality, while the other ten are relative measures.

                                                        12
explanatory power.18 On average the Gini coefficient explains about 15 percent of the
variability of the perceptions about unfairness, as measured by the R-squared. On the other
hand, the absolute indicators of inequality correlate negatively with the unfairness
perceptions, and the explanatory power of such indicators is lower than of the relative
indicators. It is interesting to note that indicators often mentioned in the mass media, such
as the ratio between the richest 90% and the poorest 10%, exhibit low explanatory power,
although this may be due to mismeasurement of the top incomes. The results of the high
correlation between unfairness perceptions and income inequality seem to be driven by the
population that perceives inequality as very unfair (columns 2, 5, and 8), rather than just
unfair (columns 3, 6, and 9), as the correlations in the latter are close to zero for almost all
indicators.
    These results are consistent with experimental evidence from Amiel and Cowell (1992,
1999) who show that support for the scale-invariance axiom was greater than for translation
invariance, reflecting greater support for relative inequality indicators. Moreover, the
results are also consistent with graphical evidence that shows decreasing relative inequality,
but rising absolute inequality during the 2000s in LA (Figure 4 and Figure 7, respectively).
Since unfairness perceptions also declined over time, the relative indicators do a better job
of tracing such evolution.




18
   The results are very similar if we exclude the observations with income equal to zero. For example, pooling
all the data and excluding individuals with zero income changes the correlation of the Gini with the share of
the population that perceives income distribution as either unfair or very unfair from 0.39 to 0.40.

Note: Panel (a) of this figure presents the cross-county correlation between unfairness perceptions and the
absolute Gini coefficient for all LA countries for which data is available over the 1997-2015 period. The
absolute Gini was normalized so the average over the period is equal to 100 in every country. Figure does not
include data points that were calculated through linear interpolations. Panel (b) shows evolution of the
unweighted average absolute Gini and unfairness perceptions. To ensure the same set of countries is analyzed
over time, a linear extrapolation of inequality indicators was made in the years in which income microdata
was not available.

4. Fairness through the eyes of people
In this section, we explore how individuals' characteristics relate to their views on
inequality. As shown in the previous section, most of the change in perceptions over the last
decade was driven by the share of the population that perceived income distribution as being
very unfair, thus we focus on explaining the correlates of such measure, although we also
show the results for a broader definition of unfairness.

4.1 DATA
Our sample of individuals comes from pooling all LA countries from nine different waves
of Latinobarómetro over the 1997-2015 period. Appendix Tables A1-A3 show basic
descriptive statistics of the sample. Roughly half of respondents are women (50.9%), the
average age was 39.4 (most interviewees—38%—were aged 25-40). Over half of the sample
(57.3%) reported being married or in a civil union, and are adherents to Catholicism (70.7%).
    About 90 percent of the sample are literate, the majority of respondents (76%) completed
at least primary school, while a third of them (32.3%) had secondary education or more.
Almost two-thirds of the sample (64%) were part of the labor force, and 9.9% of them were
unemployed. Access to basic services among respondents is relatively high: 87.6% of
individuals had access to running water inside their dwelling and over two-thirds (69.7%)
reported that their dwellings had access to a flush toilet connected to a waste-removal
system (i.e., sewerage). Ownership of durable goods ranges from low levels regarding cars
and computers (27.3% and 29.6%, respectively) to high levels regarding fridges and mobile
phones (79.2% and 76.4%).
    To assess the differences between Latinobarómetro’s sample and the household surveys’
sample (SEDLAC), Appendix Table A4 compares a set of summary statistics in both data
sets in 2013. To ensure comparability of the samples, we restrict the calculations to
individuals aged over 18, and to countries with data available in both databases. In general,
the samples are similar in observable characteristics. For instance, the average age in
Latinobarómetro’s reduced sample is 40.6 years, while in SEDLAC it is 42.7 years.
Similarly, the percentage of males is 48.9% in Latinobarómetro and 47.6% in SEDLAC. The
main difference arises from educational attainment. On average, the SEDLAC subsample is
more educated (46.1% of the population has secondary education or more, while this figure
is 38.8% in Latinobarómetro).

4.2 ESTIMATION STRATEGY
To formally assess the relationship between individuals’ characteristics and fairness
perceptions, we run Logit regressions where the dependent variable takes the value 1 if the
individual believes income distribution is very unfair and 0 otherwise. In the baseline
specification, we assume that unfairness perceptions can be characterized according to the
following equation:



                                             16
                     	            =     +    	     +    	    +          +         +


where       	            is the variable of interest, namely, whether individual of country
during year believes income distribution is very unfair or not; is a vector of individual
characteristics that includes the age, sex, civil status, education, and type of job;    is the
country’s Gini coefficient; is a vector of country and subnational fixed effects ; is a
                                                                                      19

vector of year fixed effects and      is the error term.

    We are interested in the sign and magnitude of and . The first of these coefficients
captures the relationship between the individual’s characteristics and unfairness
perceptions. If unfairness is uncorrelated with observable characteristics, then this
coefficient should not be statistically different from zero. On the other hand, captures the
relationship between the Gini coefficient and the perceived fairness after controlling for an
individual’s covariables. If subjective measures of income inequality are significantly
correlated with their objective counterparts, we would expect this coefficient to be positive
and statistically different from zero.

4.3 RESULTS
Table 2 summarizes the main results of the Logit regressions under different specifications.
Column (1) presents the results controlling only for the Gini coefficient. Column (2)
includes basic demographic indicators: age, age squared and gender. Column (3)
incorporates dummies for civil status and educational variables, namely, literacy and
maximum educational attainment. Column (4) includes dummies for labor market variables:
labor force participation and unemployment. Column (5) incorporates access to basic
services—running water and sewerage—and asset ownership, namely ownership of a
computer, washing machine, telephone and car. Column (6) replicates the same specification
as column (5), but with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). All specifications include country,
subnational and year fixed effects.
    Our first result is that the Gini coefficient has a positive and statistically significant
relationship with unfairness perceptions, consistent with the evidence shown in the previous
section. For example, in a country with average characteristics, a decrease of one point of
the Gini coefficient (from 0.496 to 0.486) decreases by about half a percentage point the
share of the population that believes income distribution is very unfair. Such magnitude is
quite similar with the Logit (column 5) and OLS (column 6) estimates, and does not vary
much across different specifications (columns 1-5). It is important to stress that the
interpretation is not causal. The relationship between income inequality and unfairness
perceptions can go both ways. On one hand, higher inequality can increase the share of the
population that believes distribution is unfair. But as more people perceive income


19Latinobarómetro’s survey is representative in each country at the subnational level, so we include 380
subnational fixed effects to capture unobservable heterogeneities at this level.

       distribution as unfair, inequality can be affected through several channels (e.g., more
       demand for redistribution).

Note: This table presents estimates of the correlation between unfairness perceptions dummy variable that indicates if the
individual believes income distribution is very unfair and individuals’ characteristics. Columns 1 to 5 coefficients presents
the marginal effects at the mean values of the rest of the variables and were estimated through Logit regressions, weighting
by individuals probability of being interviewed, while column 6 coefficients were estimated through Ordinary Least Squares
regressions. All columns include country, subnational and year fixed effects. ***, ** and * denote significance at 10%, 5%

    The results of the regressions also suggest that, holding all other variables constant,
older people tend to respond more often that income distribution is very unfair, although
the relationship between age and unfairness perception is not linear. This result is similar
to that of Bellemare et al. (2008), who find that young individuals have lower aversion to
inequity than other groups in an experimental setting.
    On average, males are just as likely as females to perceive income distribution as very
unfair, while married individuals are less likely to do so. Education seems to be correlated
with perceptions of unfairness but only at the highest level of education—for those who
have completed primary and secondary school, the coefficients are not statistically different
from zero. Being part of the labor force does not seem to be correlated with perceptions of
unfairness, but being unemployed does. On average, the unemployed population is more
likely to perceive income distribution as unfair. The dummy variables for access to basic
services and asset ownership have negative signs. In household surveys, these variables
tend to be correlated with household income—although the correlations tend to be low—
so a possible interpretation is that relatively richer people (as measured by access to services
and assets), are less likely to perceive income distribution as very unfair.
    Next, we run a similar set of regressions but, instead of considering only the people who
responded that income distribution is ‘very unfair,’ we also consider the ones who answered
only ‘unfair.’ The output of those regressions is reported in Table 3.
    When we use the broader definition of unfairness, the effect of education on perceptions
of unfairness becomes stronger: in all the specifications, educational attainment is positively
correlated with a sense of distributive unfairness. Moreover, the magnitude of the coefficient
increases with the level of qualification: the coefficient of those with tertiary education
complete is three times larger than the coefficient of those with only primary education
complete. These results are similar to those of Rodriguez (2014), who finds that more years
of education are associated with higher perceptions of inequality. The other two main
differences with respect to the baseline set of regressions are that the civil status stops being
statistically significant, and the male dummy becomes negative and statistically significant
(in both cases consistently so across specifications).
    As a robustness check, we run the set of regressions reported in column (4), but using
an alternative set of inequality indicators instead of the Gini coefficient. Those results are
reported in Appendix Table A5. The results confirm the story of a positive and statistically
significant correlation between income inequality and unfairness perceptions across a very
different set of relative indicators (columns 1-4). Indeed, the Gini coefficient calculated
without households with zero income, the Atkinson index, the Theil index and the
Generalized Entropy indicator are consistently correlated with unfairness, even after
controlling for an individual’s characteristics, while the absolute Gini (our absolute measure
of inequality in the table) is negatively correlated with unfairness perceptions.

4.4 DECOMPOSING CHANGES IN UNFAIRNESS OVER TIME
One of the broad takeaways from the regression results is that both the aggregate inequality
trends and the individual’s characteristics are associated with unfairness perceptions. A
natural follow-up question is to ask what factors explain to a greater extent the reduction
in the unfairness beliefs over the last decade: the observable characteristics of the individuals
or the aggregate inequality trends. To analyze this point, we perform a basic Oaxaca-
Blinder decomposition, taking 2002 and 2013 as the two ‘groups’ to be compared (see
Appendix C for further detail on the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition). The covariables
included in the decomposition are analog to those of Column (4) in Table 2. The results are
summarized in Figure 8.

Note: This figure presents the estimates of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition. The dependent variable is a
dummy that indicates whether the individual believes income distribution if unfair or not, and the regressors
include the Gini coefficient, age, age squared, and dummy variables for: civil status, gender, literacy, maximum
educational attainment, labor force participation and unemployment status. Results were calculated pooling
data for 18 LA countries. The ‘explained’ part of the results refers to the endowment effects (changes in the
value of the covariables), while the ‘unexplained’ refers to changes in the coefficients and the interaction terms.

   During the 2002-13 period, the share of the population perceiving the distribution as
unfair decreased 13.9 percentage points, from 86.9% to 73.0%.20 The decomposition results
suggest that a third of such change (4.5 percentage points) cannot be explained by changes


20These figures are slightly different from those presented in the previous section due to some observations
having missing values in the covariables relevant for the decomposition.

                                                                      21
in the covariate’s values (i.e., changes in the ’s of the regression), but rather are a
consequence of changes in the elasticity of perceptions to each covariable (i.e., the ’s of the
regression), while the other two-thirds (9.3 percentage points) can be explained by changes
in the covariables’ values.
    Among the covariables included in the decomposition, the one that explains the decline
in the unfairness perceptions is the change in the value of the Gini coefficient, and not
changes in the composition of the groups. In fact, although marginal, the demographic
component actually contributed to an increase in the unfairness perceptions. This is mostly
due to changes in average age and educational attainment. Between 2002 and 2013 both the
average age and the maximum educational attainment saw a modest increase in our sample,
and since older and more educated individuals are more likely to perceive the distribution
as unfair, these changes counteracted part of the decrease in unfairness perceptions.

5. How beliefs shape fairness perceptions
Ingrained in any judgement of income distribution as unfair is an assessment of the sources
of the inequalities. Theories of fairness suggests that societies that perceive that inequality
arises from hard work and effort are less likely to perceive distribution as unfair, while
societies that believe luck, connections and corruption are the main determinants of income
are more prone to see inequality as unfair (see Alesina et al., 2001).21 Understanding why
some people perceive outcomes as a consequence of luck while others think it is due to effort
is challenging, although the literature has provided a few clues.
    First, political views matter. One of the clear dividing lines between the political ‘left’
and the ‘right’ is the views of to what extent luck determines incomes (which, in turn, affect
preferences about the extent to which the government should intervene to redistribute from
the rich to the poor, as shown by Alesina and Giuliano, 2009). A second view is that beliefs
are shaped by interest groups (e.g., Glaeser, 2005). In particular, religion has been identified
of a relevant group shaping beliefs (Bénabou and Tirole, 2005). In LA, we would expect
Catholicism—the predominant religion—to affect fairness perceptions. Finally, sociology
suggests that individuals with motivated beliefs are more likely to perceive hard work and
effort as the ultimate determinants of success (e.g. Hochschild, 1981). In line with this
research, we would expect people with a more optimistic life outlook to perceive income
distribution as less unfair. Summarizing, we identify political views, religion and life outlook
as some possible determinants of distributive justice perceptions. We test empirically
whether these variables correlate with unfairness perceptions.
     To measure political views, we rely on the question “In politics, people normally speak of
“left” and “right”. On a scale where 0 is left and 10 is right, where would you place yourself?” We


21This theory is supported by much experimental and empirical evidence. For a review of relevant literature,
see Fehr and Schmidt (2001).


                                                    22
interpret values closer to zero (ten) closer to a liberal (conservative) worldview. We create
a categorical variable for reported religion, coding the rest of the religions (and lack of
religion) as zero. Finally, we proxy life outlook with the question: “In the next 12 months do
you think that, in general, the economic situation of your country will be much better, a little better,
the same, a little worse or much worse than now?” When using these questions, we control for
the current assessment of the country’s situation to avoid any spurious correlation.22 We
interpret expectations that the country will be better (conditional on the present situation)
as a positive life outlook.
   Table 4 presents the main results. We control for individual characteristics in all the
specifications, and include country and year fixed effects we well.

Note: This table presents estimates of the correlation between perception of distribution as very unfair and
measures of individual values. Coefficients present the marginal effects at the mean values of the rest of the
variables and were estimated through Logit regressions, weighting by individuals’ probability of being
interviewed. All regressions control for age, squared age, gender, civil status, maximum educational
attainment, labor force participation, and unemployment status, access to basic services and asset holding, as
well as country, subnational and yearly fixed effects. ***, ** and * denote significance at 10%, 5% and 1%
levels, respectively. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors in parentheses.

    Our results suggest that, as expected, ideologically conservative people are, on average,
less likely to perceive income distribution as very unfair (column 1). Catholics are less likely

22 Such assessment comes from the question: “In general, how would you describe the country’s present economic
situation? Would you say it is…? (1) Good, (2) About average and (3) Bad.” We recode the variables so larger
values correspond to a more positive assessment.

                                                     23
to perceive income distribution as very unfair, even after controlling for other observable
individual characteristics (column 2). Finally, people with a more positive (and less
negative) future outlook (column 3), are less likely to perceive inequality as unfair, even
controlling for the country’s current situation (as perceived by the individual). These results
are robust to controlling for all the beliefs at the same time (column 4). The Gini coefficient
is positive and statistically different from zero in all specifications, although the magnitude
decreases notably when all the variables are included, suggesting part of the relationship
between the Gini and unfairness perceptions is mediated through other beliefs.
    As a robustness check, we run the same set of regressions, but using as the dependent
variable all unfairness perceptions. These results are shown in Appendix Table A6. We find
that the relationship between Catholicism and unfairness loses its significance, while the
self-reported ideology actually changes its sign, which suggests these two results—religion
and political ideology—are driven by the population with strong beliefs about unfairness.
The rest of the results remain unchanged. As noted previously, we are not inferring any
causal relationship out of these results, but rather establishing strong empirical associations
as stylized facts. For example, it could be the case that a negative life outlook increases the
unfairness perceptions, or that an unfair distribution of income makes people more negative
about life in general, or that both variables are caused by a third (omitted) variable.

6. The relationship between social unrest and fairness perceptions
There is a vast literature that relates economic inequality—and more recently, measures of
polarization—to social cohesion, conflict, and activism.23 More recently, some papers have
argued that models that include ‘objective’ measures of inequality to explain social
phenomena such as conflict could be misleading since people do not directly observe the
income distribution (or the Gini coefficient), but rather take decisions based on their
perceptions of it (e.g. Gimpelson and Treisman, 2015). Thus, this evidence suggests
perceived inequality, and not actual inequality, should be the relevant regressor in the models
that relate social unrest with inequality. To understand what this implies from an empirical
point of view, it is useful to take the measurement-error perspective. Let’s assume perceived
inequality is equal to real inequality plus an error term:
                            Perceived inequality = Inequality + Error
    If the population’s perception of inequality corresponds to the actual level of inequality,
then = 0, and the estimations we would obtain of the relationship between conflict and
inequality would be unbiased. However, research about how accurately people perceive
income inequality reveals systematic cognitive biases. The seminal paper of this strand of
the literature is Norton and Ariely (2011), who find individuals dramatically



23For instance, in LA, Gasparini et al. (2008) find a strong empirical correlation between inequality and
conflict, as well as polarization and conflict.

                                                   24
underestimated the current level of inequality.24 Gimpelson and Treisman (2015) show that
ordinary people have little idea about the levels of inequality, its evolution over time, and
their place in the income distribution. Individuals consistently arrive to misperceptions of
inequality, regardless of the data source, operationalization, and measurement method. In a
survey experiment, Cruces et al. (2013) find systematic biases in perceptions of own income
rank: a significant portion of relatively poor individuals place themselves in higher positions
than they actually occupy.	This evidence suggests that the mean of the error term will not
necessarily be zero. Thus, if we use the ‘objective inequality,’ instead of the perceived one
as explanatory variable in regressions, the measurement error becomes part of the error
term in the regression equation, creating an attenuation bias.
    In this section, we test whether unfairness perceptions are positively correlated with
social unrest, exploiting the fact that both perceptions and stated activism vary at the
individual level.25 We rely on the following question from Latinobarómetro: “On a scale from
1 to 10 where 1 means “not at all” and 10 “very”, how willing would you be to demonstrate and
protest about…? (a) Higher wages and better working conditions; (b) Improvement in health care
and education; (c) Exploitation of natural resources; and (d) To defend democratic rights.”
    Figure 9 shows the simple cross-country correlations between unfairness perceptions
at the country level and the average index of the different measures of stated activism in
2015. Visual evidence suggests that unfairness measures tend to be positively correlated
with the social unrest measures, although in some cases the correlation is small.

therefore have a notably smaller sample size.

    Table 5 suggests that the population that perceives distribution as very unfair is more
prone to actively demonstrate. Each of the four reasons to mobilize has positive and
statistically different from zero coefficients. The magnitudes of the coefficients suggest this
effect is larger in the case of protests for jobs, health and education, compared to exploitation
of natural resources or to defend democratic rights, where the size of the coefficients is half
as large. Table 5 also suggests that, on average, people are less prone to protest in countries
with relatively higher levels of inequality. As with previous results, the relationship can go
either way. For instance, relatively unequal countries might, in fact, have higher levels of
inequality due to a lower propensity of its citizens to manifest against such disparities.
    Although these results are encouraging, the analysis relies on ‘willingness’ to
demonstrate. However, people might state they are very eager to protest, while in practice
they might not do it. To partially overcome this issue, we analyze the relationship between
unfairness and actually having mobilized in the past. In particular, we consider six different
types of demonstrations: making a complaint to the media, making a complaint on social
networks, signing a petition, refusing to pay taxes and being part of an authorized or
unauthorized demonstration. We recode these variables so they take a value equal to 1 if
the individual stated she had a past of mobilization, and 0 otherwise. Cross-country visual
evidence is provided in Appendix Figure A9 while regression results are shown in Table 6.
    Overall, both visual and regression analysis suggests unfairness perceptions are
positively and significantly correlated with a past of activism. With the exception of illegal
activities (columns 1 and 4),26 and making a complaint to the media, all other coefficients
have the expected sign and are statistically significant. In Appendix Tables A7 and A8 we
replicate the regressions in Tables 5 and 6, but using as the regressor of interest the
population that perceived distribution as unfair or very unfair. We observe two main
differences. First, some of the coefficients stop being statistically different from zero (e.g.,
columns 3 and 4 from Table 5). Second, some of the coefficients actually turn negative and
statistically significant (e.g., column 2 from Table 5, and columns 1-3 from Table 6). These
two facts together suggest that activism is driven by the population with strong views about
inequality (i.e., very unfair), and not by those who perceive it as just unfair.
    Even though a strikingly high share of the population shares the view that income
distribution is unfair, the fight against inequality does not seem to be a top priority among
LA citizens. Every year, Latinobarómetro asks respondents what they think is their
country's most important problem. Although there is a lot of heterogeneity both across
countries and across time, insecurity and unemployment are consistently listed as the top
priorities. In these rankings, reducing the high disparities between the rich and the poor is
usually listed in the bottom half of the priorities, under other issues like 'education’ or
‘corruption.’


26 Perhaps, the lack of results with respect to illegal activities (columns 1 and 4) could be due to measurement

error, as there are no incentives to report accurately a past of doing illegal activities.

    A highly speculative reading of this section is that, the way in which this higher
propensity to mobilize could manifest is not with direct demonstrations against inequality
(like in the Occupy Wall Street movement), but rather in demonstrations against other
types of inequalities (such as inequality in access to education or health), or against the
underlying causes of it (such as low wages of some specific segments of the population).

7. Concluding remarks
There is a growing body of evidence showing that many of the decisions agents make are
not based on objective economic indicators, but rather on how these are perceived.
Understanding what people believe about the income distribution is crucial from a policy
perspective—not only from a traditional view, in which a just income distribution is seen
as a pure public good (Thurow, 1971) and is therefore underprovided by the unregulated
free-market economy, but also because interventions that make information less costly can
have welfare-improving effects (Roemer, 2003) if there are mismatches between perceptions
and reality.
    In this paper, we analyzed the perceptions of distributive justice in a context of falling
income inequality. If fairness perceptions are interpreted as preferences for some leveling
of income, our results suggest a striking majority is in favor of reducing the existing
disparities between the rich and the poor, while very few people believe the current
distribution is fair and all incomes should be the same.
    The positive news is that beliefs moved in line with the evolution of objective indicators:
both unfairness perceptions and income inequality declined both across countries and time.
The bad news is that three in four LA citizens believe income distribution is unfair, and
such perceptions have proved to be quite inelastic to changes in income distribution. What
happened during the 2000s in terms of inequality reduction was remarkable, but recent
evidence suggests the pace of inequality reduction is not going to be the same in the near
future. As inequality reduction in LA stagnates, one can wonder if an income distribution
that the majority of the population thinks is unfair can be a steady state in the long run.
     We believe that, compared to the vast literature on inequality measurement, as well as
its causes and consequences, relatively little emphasis has been given to how inequality is
perceived by the general population. This paper intends to bridge this gap in the research
agenda. We present the characterization of fairness perceptions in LA not as conclusions
but as a starting point for researchers who are interested in income inequality perceptions.
The results of this paper also raise a number of puzzling questions for future research:
Where do people think the unfairness of income distribution stems from? What has been
the role of mass media in shaping these beliefs? Does the general population think
separately about the ‘micro-justice’ (i.e., the income I receive is fair) and the ‘macro-justice’
of overall patterns of inequality? Would fairness perceptions change if individuals are
confronted with accurate information about income distribution? We hope future research
helps to clarify these questions.

 Note: This table presents estimates of the correlation between measures of past demonstrations and unfairness perceptions (unfair or very unfair). Coefficients
present the marginal effects at the mean values of the rest of the variables and were estimated through Logit regressions, weighting by individuals’ probability
of being interviewed. Column (1) presents the results for refusing to pay taxes. Column (2) for signing a petition. Column (3) for unauthorized demonstrations.
Column (4) for authorized demonstrations. Column (5) make a complaint to the media and Column (6) complain in social media. All regressions control for age,
squared age, gender, civil status, maximum educational attainment, labor force participation, and unemployment status, as well as country, and yearly fixed
effects. ***, ** and * denote significance at 10%, 5% and 1% levels, respectively. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors in parentheses.

Appendix B: About the Data
The numbers presented in this paper are based on two harmonization projects, known as
Latinobarómetro and SEDLAC (Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the
Caribbean). In this Appendix, we describe how we make both sources compatible.
    Our perceptions data come from Latinobarómetro, which has conducted opinion surveys
in 18 LA countries since the 1990s, interviewing about 1,200 individuals per country about
individual socioeconomic background, and preferences towards political and social issues.
Although the survey is conducted every year, not all years include the question regarding
fairness of income distribution. The survey was designed to be representative at the national
level of the voting-age population (in most LA countries, population aged over 18). In Table
B1 we show what percentage of the voting-age population is represented by the survey in
each country for all the years in which the fairness question is available.

Note: This table presents the percentage of the voting age population represented each year in
Latinobarómetro overtime. The regional average was calculated by weighting each country’s population. N/A
means the survey was not conducted in that particular country.

    Since our goal is to analyze how unfairness perceptions evolved vis-à-vis changes in
income inequality, we put a lot of effort in trying to get income inequality data for each data
point for which we have perceptions data available.



                                                   42
    Our source for income inequality data is SEDLAC, a joint effort of the World Bank and
CEDLAS at the National University of La Plata in Argentina. SEDLAC increases cross-
country comparability of selected findings from official household surveys. The welfare
indicator used is the total household per capita income in 2005 US$ (PPP) per day. The
inequality measures we use include households with zero incomes unless otherwise noted
(results are similar with the exclusion of these households). For Argentina and Uruguay,
the inequality data correspond to urban areas only.
    Whenever possible, we used comparable annual household surveys to estimate
inequality indicators. However, some countries did not conduct surveys every year, and
some of the household surveys available in certain countries are not comparable across time,
usually due to important methodological changes (for instance, due to changes in the
sampling scheme or in the set of variables available).
    To increase the number of observations available (without pushing the data too much),
we made to two partial fixes. First, we filled the data gaps using household surveys of ‘close’
years in which previously unused data were available. For instance, Chile conducts
household surveys on average every two years. We have perceptions data in 1997 but no
income inequality data for the same year. Therefore, we use the inequality data from the
adjacent year (1998) to compare the perceptions data from 1997. As noted previously, we
only do this process of using data from close years if the data from the adjacent year
correspond to a year in which the perceptions question was not asked (and therefore,
inequality data are not needed in that year).

    Finally, for some countries, a few years had perceptions data available but no comparable
household survey over time and no ‘close year’ available. In this case, and in order to analyze
the same set of countries every year, interpolation was applied to the inequality indicators.

    Overall, the years in which income inequality was calculated using linear interpolations
represent a relatively small share of the total data points (17% of total). The majority of our
inequality data points (69%) were calculated using a household survey from the same year
in which the perceptions polls were conducted (Table B1), while the remaining 14% of our
inequality indicators were calculated using household surveys from adjacent years (Table
B2). A summary of the data sources used in every year in which perceptions data are
available is provided in Figure B1.

Appendix C: The Oaxaca-Blinder Decomposition
The starting point to decompose changes in unfairness perceptions between 2002 and 2013
is the following equation:

                                =       	       + ε 				; 						t ∈ 2002, 2013                                      (C.1)

    Where t indicates the year in which perceptions are captured, and X denotes all the
explanatory variables defined in the regressions (mainly, demographics factors and the Gini
coefficient). Defining       as a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if the year is 2013,
then, the mean difference in unfairness perceptions between both years is given by:

           ∆ = (                    |            = 1) − (                                |             = 0)         (C.2)

   Since the regression line that comes from estimating the parameters in equation C.2
above meets the property of passing through the sampling means, we have:

                        =           	            					&					                         =            	        		       (C.3)

    Where is the vector of the average values of the explanatory variables in year t, and
  the vector of estimated coefficients. If the relationship between the explanatory variables
and the perceptions of fairness did not change during the 2002-13 period (i.e., the
remained constant), then the unfairness perceptions in 2013 could be expressed as:

                                                   =             	           					                                  (C.4)

    Where the superscript C indicates this value comes from a counterfactual exercise.
    Replacing the expected value of the covariables in equation (C.2) by the sample averages,
the difference in the perceptions between both years can be expressed as:

                                    ∆ =                           −

	
               ∆ =                      −                       		 + 	                       −	                 	


                            (               −          )	                (           −                )	
               ∆ =                                          +                                                       (C.5)
                                    ∆                                           ∆


     The first term of equation (C.5.), usually known as the “composition effect,” captures the
difference between the average perceptions in 2002 and the counterfactual perceptions 2013
if the ’s—i.e., the elasticity of perceptions to the different covariables—remained constant
during the 2002-13 period. In other words, this first term captures only differences in the
                                                            46
endowments of characteristics that determine unfairness perceptions (such as the
educational attainment, age or income inequality).
    In turn, the second term of equation (C.5)—what can be thought of as a “perceptions
structure effect”—reflects the difference between the average perceptions in 2013, and the
counterfactual perceptions in 2002 with the observable attributes of 2013. Therefore, this
component reflects changes in perceptions that are due to changes in the elasticity of the
different covariables between both years.
   In the main text of the paper we exploit the additive linearity assumption of the
decomposition, and report the sole effect of changes in the Gini coefficient.
