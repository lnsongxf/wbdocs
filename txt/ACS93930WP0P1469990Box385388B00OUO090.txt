Clearance mechanism Mechanism through which indirect taxes are collected by Israel on behalf of the
“Maqasa”            PA and normally refunded via clearance procedures which were agreed in the
                    1994 Oslo accords (Protocol of Economic Relations also called the ‘Paris
                    Protocol’2).
Net Lending                       For the purpose of this engagement Net Lending refers to the indirect payment
                                  made by the PA to IEC through deductions by the Israeli Ministry of Finance on
                                  clearance revenues collected on behalf of the PA. These deductions are made to
                                  cover portion of the unpaid electricity bills from Palestinian electricity
                                  Distributors.
Debt/outstanding debt Open payments for all connection points in the West Bank and Gaza to IEC for the
                      purchase of electricity which has not been paid by the connection point owner or
                      covered by the Net Lending
Non-Payment                       Non- payment by customers to DISCOs, municipalities and village councils for
                                  the cost of electricity consumed or
                                  Non-payment by DISCOs, municipalities and village councils for the cost of
                                  electricity purchased from the IEC which is equal to Net Lending + Debt
DISCO                             Electricity Distribution Companies that sell and deliver electricity to customers
GEDCO                             Gaza Electricity Distribution Company. It is important to note that:
                                   GEDCO is the sole electricity Distributor in the entire Gaza Strip.
                                   It purchases electricity from 3 different sources: IEC, the Gaza Power
                                     Generating Company (GPGC) and Egypt.
                                   Information and data included in this report regarding Net Lending only

Electricity Losses                Difference between electricity purchased from the IEC measured at IEC meters at
                                  each connection point and the electricity sold to Palestinian customers measured at
                                  the customer electricity meters. Electricity losses include technical losses due to
                                  inefficiencies in the distribution network, and non-technical losses due to

Non-Payment for Electricity Services in the Palestinian Territories
1.    The Palestinian Territories (West Bank and Gaza Strip) are highly dependent on energy imports
      from neighboring countries due to the lack of domestic energy resources. The Palestinian Territories
      consumed 5,430 GWh of electricity as of 2013 (1,581 GWh in the Gaza Strip and 3,849 GWh in the
      West Bank). The Israeli Electricity Corporation (IEC) is the largest supplier of electricity providing
      the Territories with around 88% of its total electricity consumption. In 2013, 4,778 GWh were
      imported from IEC amounting to 2.4 billion ILS (US$ 660 million).
2.    In this context, the Palestinian Authority (PA) -with support from the international community- has
      been actively engaged in a comprehensive reform of the electricity sector to increase its overall
      efficiency for the benefit of the Palestinian population. The commitment and involvement of all
      stakeholders in this extensive restructuring has resulted in the creation of a well-structured electricity
      market. Additionally, the international community has been facilitating the strengthening,
      rehabilitation and extension of the transmission and distribution systems in order for the PA to be
      able to meet the growing demand for electricity in the Palestinian Territories.
3.    Alongside the steady increase in electricity consumption, non-payment for electricity imported from
      the IEC has increased over the past few years, amounting to 58% of its total cost (equivalent to
      1,407 million ILS or US$ 381.3 million in 2013). Non-payment of IEC’s electricity bills by
      Palestinian electricity distributors, including municipalities, village councils and Distribution
      Companies (DISCOs) remains a key challenge to the electricity sector and to the overall fiscal
      position of the PA. Outstanding payments owed to the IEC are either (i) deducted from the PA’s
      clearance revenues by the Israeli Ministry of Finance and registered as “Net lending3” or (ii) are
      accumulated as debt owed to the IEC.
4.    Net lending reduced the PA’s available revenues by an estimated 1 billion ILS in 2012 (US$ 280
      million), representing 13.5% of the PA’s total revenues. The IEC only recovered part of the non-paid
      bills by Palestinian electricity distributors through Net lending, which led the outstanding debt to
      grow over the years reaching a total of 1.172 billion ILS (US$ 330 million) as of February 2014.
      Even if a settlement of this historic debt is agreed upon by Palestinian and Israel stakeholders,
      additional debt would continue to accumulate in the future unless decisive actions are taken to
      address the underlying issues of non-payment for electricity services in the Palestinian Territories.
5.    More recently, to complement the electricity sector reform, the Palestinian Energy and Natural
      Resources Authority (PENRA) initiated several measures specially targeted at reducing electricity
      non-payment. These measures include amendments to the Electricity Law covering punitive actions
      for electricity theft. While the initiatives introduced by PENRA may have a positive effect, a
      cohesive strategy is required to successfully deal with this problem.
6.    This assessment aims to more precisely understand the sources and reasons for non-payment of
      electricity in the Palestinian Territories and to develop an action plan based on current programs and
      activities led by PENRA and the donor community.

Finance on clearance revenues collected on behalf of the PA. These deductions are made to cover unpaid electricity bills from Palestinian electricity
Distributors

Results of the assessment
7.    To present a comprehensive overview, the report has assessed the impact of non-payment for
      electricity services throughout the complete financial payment cycle as follows:
        a. IEC’s invoice cycle:

        There are no procedures for the invoicing of electricity from the IEC to the Palestinian
        distributors. The current process is not harmonized for all electricity distributors and lacks
        transparency. Distributors in various areas of the West Bank and Gaza do not have access to
        meters located in area C in the West Bank, and meters near the borders between Gaza and Israel.
        Further, some electricity distributors claim that they do not receive IEC’s invoices on regular
        basis, which results in them not paying their bills.
        Any late payment leads to the addition of a late payment fee or an added interest. Interest rates for
        late payment are set unilaterally by the Israeli Public Utility Authority (PUA) and are high
        compared to commercial interest rates in both the Israeli and the Palestinian markets.
        While Israeli deductions from the clearance revenues collected on behalf of the PA are not
        implemented in a transparent manner, some progress has recently been recorded. IEC, for
        example, provided PENRA and the World Bank with critical data and information to complete
        this assessment. Since then, the Palestinian Electricity Transmission Company Ltd. (PETL) stated
        that IEC has been sending regularly their invoices. This process should lead to an
        institutionalized, regulated and transparent cooperation between the IEC, PUA and PETL.

        b. Non-payment by Palestinian electricity distributors to the IEC:

        In the period 2010 to 2013, Palestinian electricity distributors in the West Bank did not pay 37%
        of their bills to the IEC. During the same period, non-payment reached 100% in Gaza.
        The Top 10+1 group of non-payers, which included the largest ten non-payers in the West Bank
        and the Gaza Electricity Distribution Company (GEDCO), represented 92% of the total non-
        payment of Palestinian electricity distributors to IEC.
        GEDCO was the single largest non-payer, accounting for more than 1.7 billion (US$ 471 million)
        or 41.8% of the total non-payments to the IEC from 2009 to 2013. During the same period,
        JDECO was the second largest non-payer contributing to more than 1.1 billion ILS (US$ 297
        million) or 26.3% of the total IEC non-payments.

        c. Electricity Losses:

        Electricity losses were high and steady at 23-30% between 2010 and 2013. Distributors did not
        have proper tools to measure losses and could not differentiate between technical and non-
        technical losses. GEDCO, in particular, did not have the necessary tools to assess its losses and
        could not access the meters required for an appropriate measurement and categorization of losses.
        Losses in GEDCO and JDECO concession areas were reported to reach very high levels and
        should be dealt with as a priority.
        In 2013, electricity losses caused significant revenue loss to Palestinian distributors – estimated at
        726 million ILS (US$ 201 million). Due to high electricity losses, revenues from invoiced
        amounts to end customers in the West Bank were only able to cover the cost of electricity
        purchased from the IEC and did not cover the electricity distributor’s operating and investment
        costs. The amount invoiced to customers in Gaza only accounted for two thirds of the electricity
        purchases for the whole Gaza Strip while one third of the purchased quantity (247 million ILS)
        was lost either as a technical or a non-technical loss.

             d. Collection from customers:

             The overall bill collection rate from end customers in the West Bank and Gaza for the period
             2010-2013 was better than expected, but customer payment has consistently been decreasing in
             the West Bank and increasing in the Gaza Strip. The increase of payment in Gaza can perhaps be
             attributed to a program to roll-out pre-paid meters across Gaza and the successful implementation
             of an automatic electricity bill deduction from civil servant salaries.
             Overall, Special areas such as refugee camps, i.e. areas with low collection rates and high
             electricity losses, and institutions of the Palestinian Authority are the poorest payers. Their poor
             payment performance is also claimed to negatively impact the payment behavior of other
             customers.
             The main reasons attributed to the deterioration of the collection rate in the West Bank can be
             summarized as follows:
                  Israeli deductions from the clearance revenue, e.g. November 2012, give the impression that
                   customer bills are and will be paid for by the PA.
                  PA introduced incentives for customers committed to pay their bills and for the indebted
                   customers to reschedule their debts. As an example JDECO deducted 14 million ILS from
                   committed customers since starting this initiative and cancelled 8 million ILS of debt for
                   indebted customers. However, the Palestinian Government did not compensate JDECO for
                   these amounts. Also, the Israeli deductions from clearance revenue in November 2012 and
                   PA’s measures for indebted customers created a disincentive for committed customers, which
                   resulted in a significant decrease in JDECO’s collection rate from 96% in 2012 to 83% in
                   2013.
                  Unpaid bills from PA institutions, in particular for water pumping, resulted in most of the
                   electricity distributors unilaterally settling their debts4 to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) from
                   the unpaid consumption of the PA institutions. This unilateral settlement between the
                   DISCOs and MOF was not done consistently or systematically and was time consuming. If
                   PA institutions would pay for their electricity consumption, collection rates could increase by
                   3-5%.
                  Municipalities are not paying for their bills for services such as street lighting and water
                   pumping. If municipalities would pay for these services, collection rates could increase by
                   1.5-2.5%.
                  Subsidies made available by DISCOs for social cases but then not repaid by the government
                   also contribute to a lower collection rate.
                  Special areas, such as refugee camps and certain villages have low collection rates. If bill
                   collection rates from these Special areas could be increased to benchmark levels, collection
                   rates would increase by 4-6%.
                  The quality of the service provided by Palestinian electricity distributors to customers in the
                   West Bank and Gaza is deemed to also be one of the reasons for the deterioration of the
                   collection rate. Customers have voiced severe criticism on a declining service quality.

             e. Tariff analysis:

             The purchase tariff is set unilaterally by the Israeli Electricity Regulator (PUA) as a bulk tariff for
             medium or low voltage. This is contested by the Palestinian Authority (PA) as it does not
             consider the Palestinian electricity distributors as one unit. As the largest single customer to the

    Amounts owed by Palestinian Electricity distributors to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) related to Net Lending.




PwC                                                                                                                 Page 7
             Israeli Electricity Corporation (IEC), it is recommended that the tariff be set at an export
             wholesale price only including the cost components applicable to PA’s consumption and
             removing non-applicable components, such as the renewable energy component.
             The PA has been involved in talks with its Israeli counterpart for the past 10 years to negotiate a
             commercial agreement for the sale and purchase of electricity, i.e. Power Purchase Agreement.
             However, progress on reaching an agreement has been slow, and it is recommended that this
             process is brought to a conclusion as soon as possible.
             As for the sales tariff, the Palestinian Electricity Regulator (PERC) has been setting the sales
             tariff to the Palestinian customers since 2011 based on a cost plus approach to cover the cost of
             electricity purchased from IEC as well as the operational expenses and an acceptable profit
             margin for electricity distributors. According to the methodology, the tariff would be reviewed
             yearly and be amended to include benchmarks for certain key performance indicators (KPIs),
             including losses and operating costs in order to enhance the efficiency of DISCOs. PERC is
             currently in the process of reviewing the tariff for the first time, which will include reviewing the
             different tariff components, such as the impact of removing subsidies and the inclusion of certain
             financial and quality KPIs.
             The difference between the sales and the purchase tariff, also known as tariff margin, reached
             54% after the new tariff was implemented in 2011. When the tariff was first applied, this margin
             was considered to be sufficient to cover all the cost of electricity distributors and was estimated to
             even allow them to earn a small profit. Since then, the tariff margin has decreased in the West
             Bank between 2010 and 2013 from 54% to 40% largely due to (i) subsidies included in the tariff,
             which are mostly not repaid by the Government, and (ii) a significant increase in the amount of
             electricity purchased from the IEC.
             In order to avoid an increase in the sales tariff, the Palestinian Electricity Transmission Company
             Ltd. (PETL) should finalize the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the IEC at a lower
             wholesale tariff, while PERC should set benchmarks for electricity distributors to reduce their
             operational expenses. At the same time, electricity distributors should cooperate with relevant
             electricity authorities to improve their efficiency. This further requires that all revenues from
             electricity services are primarily used to cover its purchase and operating costs.
             As for Gaza, the average purchase tariff from all the sources5 is nearly equal to the average sales
             tariff. GEDCO should review at least its commercial tariff, which is currently 20% less than the
             commercial tariff in the West Bank.
             In order to reduce electricity generation cost from the Gaza Power Plant and to eventually use bill
             collections from customers to pay for IEC invoices, the PA has plans to supply the plant with
             natural gas instead of diesel. In addition to reducing the costs, this action by PA will also enable
             the plant to run at full capacity, which will then reduce the power shortages in Gaza.
             In the West Bank, the PA introduced subsidies amounting to 200 million ILS (US$ 55 million) as
             part of the tariff between 2011 and the end of 2013. These governmental subsidies were adopted
             for political reasons essentially to satisfy customers and to prevent public disturbance as a result
             of electricity price increase. Unfortunately, due to the weak financial situation of the PA, MOF
             only repaid 40 million ILS (US$ 10.8 million) out of the 200 million ILS owed to electricity
             distributors6. The non-payment of these subsidies created more deficits to electricity distributors,
             which often chose to compensate for this cost by reducing their payments to the IEC. The
             outstanding unpaid subsidies owed to electricity distributors were 10.5 million ILS (US$ 2.9
             million) representing about 4% of the estimated electricity purchase cost of distributors in the
             West Bank between 2011-2013.

             f. Efficiency and transparency of Palestinian electricity distributors:

             According to the Palestinian Electricity law nº13, only licensed electricity distributors can sell
             electricity to customers. The law was implemented in 2009 to integrate municipalities, which
             were providing electricity services, in four efficient Distribution Companies (DISCOs) in the
             Palestinian Territories, three in the West Bank and one in Gaza. While many municipalities never
             joined the DISCOs, the existing DISCOs -which built structures to serve complete regions-,
             remained highly inefficient due to the absence of economies of scale. In parallel, those
             municipalities that did not join the DISCOs, kept their inefficient structure.
             Distributors –and particularly municipalities and villages- have opaque financial systems with
             unclear payment mechanisms. MOLG reported that some municipalities have not yet proceeded
             with segregating their accounts. DISCOs also appear to be only moderately transparent showing
             an inability to report properly on their finances. Palestinian electricity distributors seem to be
             highly influenced by the internal political environment in which they operate.
             Distributors choose to cover operational costs, investment costs and payments to shareholders
             before paying invoices to the IEC, which is one of the reasons for non-payment in the West Bank.
             Distributors were reported to have financed their shareholders through dividends and loans
             totaling 242 million ILS (US$ 67 million) in 2013, in spite of not completing their invoice
             payments to the IEC. NEDCO, HEPCO and SELCO, in particular, indicated that they use part of
             the collection from customers to fund ad-hoc payments to their municipal shareholders.
             Municipalities, on the other hand, disburse funds collected from electricity sales to cover the
             payment of other services, such as education, health, project finance and rehabilitation projects.
             All these payments are vaguely categorized under “municipal finance”.

             g. Other reasons for Non-payment of electricity:

             The analysis of the special areas7 revealed that collection there is usually low, but significant
             differences in collection trends and behavior are nonetheless observed. In terms of absolute
             figures, the contribution of these areas to non-payment is quite low because they do not cover
             extensive areas or large numbers of customers, e.g. special areas in JDECO (refugee camps) only
             represent 5% of the total customers and 21% of JDECO non-payment to IEC in 2013.

             It is critical to note, however, that in refugee camps the consumption per capita reached
             unprecedented levels, and non-technical losses are also significantly higher than in the rest of the
             Palestinian Territories.
             Specific issues related to affordability and arrears in these areas were addressed by the PA
             through the introduction of incentives and subsidies for the benefit of social cases. Unfortunately,
             the subsidies for social cases were not paid by the government to the electricity distributors thus
             impacting the non-payment negatively. On the other hand, incentives to refugee camps were
             never implemented due to the refusal of customers in refugee camps to pay for their electricity
             consumption.
             The special arrears analyzed in this assessment, in particular the refugee camps and the old city of
             Hebron, are considered to be areas that require special political attention in order to constructively
             tackle non-payment. Law enforcement in these areas is challenging and indeed requires the
             endorsement of PA’s highest authority as well as the representatives of these areas.

            Distributors, in coordination with the PA, should nevertheless continue to address these issues. It
            is also crucial for DISCOs to improve public perception by launching media campaigns and
            developing customer service trainings for their employees.
            The graph below illustrates the financial impact of the payment shortages in the payment cycle as
            well as issues arising from the purchase and sales tariff levels.

8.       The study reviewed the action plans from Palestinian stakeholders and the sectorial activities
         supported by donors to assess the extent to which these plans are addressing or will address non-
         payment for electricity services. The action plan proposed in this assessment incorporates both
         insights drawn from the analytical results and from the strategies currently being implemented by

      PENRA and the PA –and supported by the international donor community. To be effective, the
      different actions suggested in the proposed action plan should be implemented as part of a cohesive
      broader plan monitored and regulated by a coordination entity comprising all sector stakeholders.

9.    The action plan recommends to further develop the Palestinian electricity sector by continuing its
      on-going institutional reform, improving its legal and regulatory environment and developing key
      infrastructure to consolidate and monitor electricity supply. The success of the proposed action plan
      is highly reliant on steady donor support, which will need to be coordinated with a Special
      Committee that bears overall responsibility for the action plan, including the collaboration of all
      stakeholders, and monitoring payment improvement and progress in related aspects.

10. The action plan puts forward a set of recommendations classified by priority level (see Section 5.3 of
    the assessment for the complete list). The high priority recommendations are the following:

           Expand the mandate of the existing “Net lending” governmental committee to be able to
            manage and monitor all actions proposed in the action plan to reduce non-payment. The
            performance of this specialized committee, which will ensure that all actions are coordinated
            and implemented correctly, is a precondition for the successful implementation of the action
            plan.
           Continue capacity-building activities for PERC and PETL to ensure that both institutions are
            ready to implement satisfactorily key actions proposed in the plan.
           Finalize a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between PETL and the IEC, which will (i) settle
            the issues related to the invoice cycle with the definition of clear invoice and payment
            procedures, (ii) set the purchase tariff at wholesale levels, and (iii) reduce non-payment to the
            IEC.
           Establish a web-based database between PETL and the IEC to ensure timely transfer of
            invoices and payments to the IEC and to establish a reliable system to monitor payment
            cycles for all electricity stakeholders.
           Install monitoring meters to measure and identify the location of non-technical losses in the
            Palestinian Territories and be able to take appropriate actions.
           Rehabilitate electricity networks to reduce technical losses.
           Install additional prepaid meters and smart metering systems to increase collections and
            timely payment from customers.
           Conduct regular awareness campaigns.
           Enable law enforcement and implementation of the legal actions arising under the amended
            electricity law.

11. The chart below illustrates the saving targets that could be reached with the cohesive implementation
    of all high priority actions proposed in the action plan. The saving targets set in the chart entails an
    increase in customer collection up to 93%, assumes a tariff margin set at around 0.52, with losses
    reduced to a mere 15.25% and revenue from electricity services used only to cover electricity
    expenses.

    1.           Introduction
In the past few years, the Palestinian Authority - with support from the international community - has
been actively engaged in a comprehensive reform of the electricity sector to increase its overall efficiency
for the benefit of the Palestinian population. The commitment and involvement of all stakeholders in this
extensive restructuring has transformed the sector and led to the creation of a well-structured electricity
market. The Palestinian electricity sector now displays proper legal and regulatory frameworks, a
suitable market model, well defined institutions and identifiable key market players.
In 2013, 88% of the total electricity purchased and provided to the Palestinian Territories (West Bank and
Gaza) was supplied by the Israeli Electricity Corporation (IEC). The Palestinian Authority has faced
many challenges over the years to both ensure the proper operation of the sector and secure the timely
payments of invoices by Distributors to the IEC.
The non-payments or partial payments of these bills create deficits for the IEC which then leads the
Israeli government to proceed with monthly deductions from the clearance revenue (tax and customs
transfer) owed to the PA. The deducted amounts are transferred by the Israeli Ministry of Finance to the
IEC, which then registers the remaining amount (if any) as debt. As a result, these non-payments are
either accounted for as deductions from the clearance revenue - mechanism also known as Net Lending -
or accumulated as debt9.
Sector stakeholders have attributed the reasons for the non-payment to a variety of factors which can be
summarized as follows:
    Electricity Losses whether technical or non-technical which result in shortfall between the
        quantity of electricity sold and invoiced by the IEC and the quantity of electricity which is sold to
        customers.
    Collection from Customers of electricity invoiced by Distributors which is believed to be low
        and continuously decreasing.
    Tariff at which electricity is sold to the customers is considered to be high and some Distributors
        indicated it did not even cover their costs. In addition, Distributors also indicated during the
        assessment workshop that the purchase tariff from IEC is deemed to be high and payment terms
        are unfair10.
    Efficiency and transparency of Distributors is being questioned. This includes allegations that
        Distributors use the collected cash for other purposes than the settlement of invoices and
        operational costs. Revenues collected by Distributors from electricity sales are customarily
        consumed to cover the cost of purchased electricity, the operational expenses, the capital
        expenses, dividends for shareholders and other costs. In the Palestinian territories. Many
        DISCOs11 do not properly settle their invoices and use part of the collection to make ad hoc
        payments to their shareholders 12 . Municipalities and village councils are also reported to use
        funds collected from electricity for other services such as payment of education health, municipal
        projects finance, etc. All these payments are categorized under “municipal finance”.
The objective of this report is to support the on-going efforts to improve the payment for electricity
services and reduce “Net Lending” in the West Bank and Gaza by: a) more precisely understanding the
sources and reasons for non-payment for electricity within the Palestinian Territories, b) assessing current
donor programs and PENRA actions aimed at addressing non-payment of electricity, and c) developing

an action plan that builds on the current donor programs to further improve payment for electricity in the
Palestinian Territories.
The purpose of the assessment is to understand the reason for the non-payment and determine whether it
is the result of the factors listed above. The detailed methodology followed to perform the assessment is
provided in Appendix A. The list of data received from the IEC in provided in Appendix B and the data
gathered by the Palestinian Distributors and Municipalities in Appendix C of the report.
The analysis of the reasons for non-payment in this report is based on an assessment of the consumption
and payment data collected from the IEC between 2010-2013 for 286 connection points between the
Palestinian Territories and Israel and data collected from Distributors covering the period between 2009-
2013. The report includes an assessment of non-payment by customers (from Palestinian residential and
commercial sectors, etc. to Palestinian Distributors), as well as non-payment by Palestinian Distributors
to the IEC. The report also includes the conclusions of a survey and focus groups. Based on this
assessment and taking into consideration existing strategies and proposed actions by the PA and the
donor community, the report finally provides a detailed action plan with suggestions on how to improve
non-payment and reduce Net Lending in the Palestinian Territories.

 2.                Overview of the Palestinian Electricity Sector
This chapter provides an overview of the electricity sector in the Palestinian Territories (West Bank and
Gaza). It explains the set-up of the sector and the existing framework within which the issues were
addressed and the recommendations developed. It examines the electricity supply chain in the West Bank
and Gaza as well as the institutional set up and the main sector actors. Finally, it outlines the political
context within which the sector is operating.

2.1.         Electricity Supply
The Palestinian Territories are highly dependent on electricity supplies from the Israeli Electricity
Corporation (Chart 1). Diagram 1 below illustrates the electricity supply mechanism where Palestinian
loads to the West Bank and Gaza are distributed through the IEC controlled lines, which extend from the
IEC substations. The Palestinian network only starts beyond the network connection points which are
also currently under the administration of the IEC.
In 2014, 286 Low Voltage (LV) and Medium Voltage (MV) connection points belonging to 173
connection point owners13 service the Palestinian Territories. Ten of these connection points supply the
Gaza Strip while the remaining 276 supply the Palestinian areas in the West Bank. The capacity of the
MV connection point is greater than that of the LV connection point which creates an opportunity to
extend the network by installing additional transformers and lines within the Palestinian Territories when
required. The Palestinian Authority (PA) with the support of the World Bank, the European Investment
Bank (EIB) and other donors initiated the “Electric Utility Management Project (EUMP)” which includes
the consolidation of a large number of the existing connection points in the West Bank into 4 high voltage
substations financed by the EIB. The project, initiated in 2008 is currently under implementation with the
first substation expected to be operational by the end of 2014. The operation of these PA owned
substations should increase Palestinian control over imported electricity from Israel and pave the way for
the PA to finalize negotiations on a commercial agreement with the IEC to supply the West Bank, and
potentially reduce the price of electricity to customers14.

In addition to the supply from the IEC, a medium voltage connection line from Jordan supplies the West
Bank city of Jericho with around 5% of the total West Bank electricity supply as of 2013. In Gaza, a fuel
operated power plant provides the Strip with around 29% of Gaza’s total supply, while as of 2013; an
additional 8% is supplied from Egypt to Rafah, in the southern area of Gaza.

2.2.      Institutional Setup
 In the last few years, the Palestinian Authority with the support of the donor community committed to
 initiate a comprehensive restructuring of the electricity sector. An extensive reform process began which
 led to the establishment of robust institutions and provided the Palestinian Territories with one of the best
 structured markets in the Middle East. In 2009, the Palestinian Authority issued the electricity law which
 formulates this institutional set up and started with its implementation defined in Diagram 2.

2.3.      Key Players15
     PENRA: The Palestinian Energy and Natural Resources Authority former Palestinian Energy
      Authority was established in 1995 as the electricity policy maker. It is responsible for ensuring the
      provision of reliable electricity at affordable prices to Palestinian citizens.
     PERC16: The Palestinian Electricity Regulation Commission was established in 2010 to monitor and
      ensure a well performing sector based on high quality services and fair tariffs.
     PETL17: The Palestinian Electricity Transmission Company was established in the last quarter of
      2013 to act as a single buyer in a regulated and organised environment.
     Distribution Companies

        Of the six DISCOs currently operating, only two (JDECO and NEDCO) received distribution
        licenses from PENRA upon recommendation of PERC in 2011, in line with the electricity law. All
        other DISCOs are still operating without a formal license.
        The electricity regulator PERC has not, until recently, been able to have any authority over GEDCO
        due to political differences between the West Bank and Gaza authorities. Although this situation is
        expected to improve shortly with reconciliation talks between the two parties under way, GEDCO is
        yet to apply the unified tariff prevalent in the West Bank under PERC’s recommendations.
        Comprehensive tables including all data related to DISCOs including collection, tariff, losses,
        customer profile, etc. is attached in Appendix C.
      Municipalities and village councils: It is important to note that around 150 municipalities and
       village councils in the northern and southern regions of West Bank have not transferred their
       electricity services to DISCOs. The consumption of these municipalities and village councils
       represents about 22% of the total electricity purchased from the IEC to West Bank, and about 17% of
       the total purchased electricity from the IEC by the Palestinian Territories in 2013. The major
       municipalities and village councils not included in West Bank DISCOs are shown below.

2.5.          The Sector in the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza
              Strip
In the 1993 interim agreement on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, it was agreed that the “powers and
responsibilities”20 of the Palestinian electricity sector would remain with the Israeli Civil Administration,
and would not be transferred to the Palestinian Authority. In Article 10 of this agreement, both sides
agreed to continue their negotiations on Electricity matters with the aim of reaching a final settlement 2. In
the interim, the status quo in the electricity sector in the West Bank and Gaza will persist. This includes
free, unrestricted and secure access for IEC personnel and equipment to the Palestinian electricity grid.
As of today, no agreement has been reached regarding the transfer of the power and responsibilities of the
electricity sector from the Israeli Civil Administration to the Palestinian Authority with the exception of
the Gaza Strip where the “power and responsibility” were transferred after the Israeli Disengagement
from Gaza Strip in 2005.
It is worth noting that currently, while the Israeli Civil Administration is responsible for the power and
responsibilities of the sector, it is not in a position to enforce some rules and regulations falling under this
mandate such as setting the tariff on the Palestinian Distributors. The approval of the Israeli Civil
Administration is still required for the installation of any new connection points as well as for the increase
in capacity of existing connection points in the West Bank and Gaza. Finally, its approval is required for
the installation of any new electricity lines in area C21.

     The Oslo II Accord divided the West Bank into three administrative divisions: Areas A, B and C :
     - Area A (full civil and security control by the Palestinian Authority): circa 3% of the West Bank, exclusive East Jerusalem (first phase, 1995). This
         area includes eight Palestinian cities and their surrounding areas (Nablus, Jenin, Tulkarem, Qalqiliya, Ramallah, Bethlehem, Jericho and 80 percent
         of Hebron), with no Israeli settlements. Entry into this area is forbidden to all Israeli citizens.
     - Area B (Palestinian civil control and joint Israeli-Palestinian security control): circa 23-25% (first phase, 1995). This area includes some 440
         Palestinian villages and their surrounding lands, and no Israeli settlements.
     - Area C (full Israeli civil and security control): circa 72-74% (first phase, 1995): “areas of the West Bank outside Areas A and B, which, except for
         the issues that will be negotiated in the permanent status negotiations, will be gradually transferred to Palestinian jurisdiction in accordance with
         this Agreement″.

 3.            Analysis and key findings
Analysis of the data collected from stakeholders during the review revealed the magnitude of the non-
payment issue as well as its distribution throughout the West Bank and Gaza. It exposes the main non-
payers in the Palestinian Territories as well as the causes of the non-payment. This chapter describes the
non-payment issue, in particular the extent and main contributors as a starting point to understand the
reasons identified for non-payment during the data analysis. Electricity losses, collection levels, level of
purchase and sales tariff, governmental subsidies, and efficiency and transparency of sector participants
(external and internal) were identified as the main factors contributing to the non-payment described
below.

3.1 IEC invoice reconciliation and cycle
The IEC issues monthly invoices to connection point owners. These need to be paid within 11 days of the
date of issue. Any delay in payment leads to a 10% annual late fee charge.
While the IEC bills are issued monthly, a number of Distributors 22 (mainly municipalities and village
councils) indicated that these bills were rarely received by connection point owners or that the receipt was
often delayed. The receipt of bills by connection point owner is the starting point to ensure proper and
timely payment of invoices. An efficient mechanism to guarantee invoice deliveries and monitoring of
payments should be designed and implemented to secure this operation. The invoice process needs to be
fully transparent as most of the connection points are located in area C21, where Palestinians have no
access to connection points and this prevents them from reading the meters and verifying the accuracy of
IEC’s invoices.

3.2 Non-payment of Distributors to the IEC
Although non-payment of electricity bills to the IEC started as early as 2002, the issue became a concern
and priority for the PA in 2007 when the levels of non-payment showed significant year on year increases,
resulting in 1407 million ILS (381 million US$) being due in 2013.
The non-payment and partial payment of electricity bills creates receivables for the IEC which then leads
the Israeli government to proceed with monthly deductions from the clearance revenue (tax and customs
transfer) owed to the PA. These amounts are transferred by the Israeli Ministry of Finance to the IEC,
who then registers the remaining amount (if any) as debt from each connection point. As a result, these
non-payments from the owners of connections points are either accounted for as deductions from the
clearance revenue mechanism also known as Net Lending- or accumulated as debt. The absence of
mechanism to monitor payments to the IEC makes it impossible to check if duplicate payments are made
to the IEC by the connection point owner or through deductions from the clearance revenue.
Discrepancies were actually detected between the monthly Net Lending amounts as registered at MOF
and the IEC financial data as shown in Appendix E.

  GEDCO stated it had not received any IEC invoices for the past 3 years. PENRA started receiving these invoices at the beginning of 2014 and has
been transmitting them to GEDCO shortly after.

3.1.1.       Non-payment figures
The analysis of the data23 shows that for the period 2010-2013, the total non-payment amounts for the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip reached 4.16 billion ILS (1,135 million US$ equivalent) 24. This amount
translates into non-payment of 37% of the total invoiced amount for the West Bank and 100% for Gaza.
During that period, the Israeli Ministry of Finance proceeded with arbitrary deductions –following IEC’s
request- from the clearance revenue to partially compensate the non-payments. The amounts deducted and
the frequency of deductions does not follow a set calendar or pattern and seem to occur following requests
from the IEC to the Israeli Ministry of Finance and negotiations between the Israeli Government and the
PA Ministry of Finance. These deductions are recorded as Net Lending on the PA’s balance sheet and are
shown as receivables against Distributors under the assets’ category. The amounts which are not
deducted are recorded as debts which are expected to either be paid by Distributors in future bills or will
be later deducted through the clearance mechanism as Net Lending. A detailed description of the
deductions from the clearance revenues is provided in Appendix F.
In 2012, the Israeli Ministry of Finance deducted a significant amount in comparison with the previous
years to compensate for Distributor’s accumulated debt. This led the Net Lending to increase to
unprecedented levels that year reaching 13.5% of the total PA revenues. The clearance revenue that year
amounted for 70.3% of the total PA revenues25 and Net Lending reached 19.2% of the total clearance
revenue amount. These percentages and amounts illustrate both the dependence of the PA on the
clearance revenue for its general budget and the burden represented by Net Lending on the PA general
budget. The following table compares the clearance revenue and the electricity Net Lending for the period
2010-2013.

During this period non-payment to the IEC from the West Bank amounted to 2.422 billion ILS (664.7
million US$ equivalent) from which the Israeli Ministry of Finance deducted 1.25 billion ILS (334.7
million US$ equivalent) registered as Net Lending for the PA and the remaining amount of 1,172 billion
ILS (330 million US$ equivalent) was registered as outstanding debt24 to IEC.
During the same period, non-payment to the IEC from Gaza amounted to 1.74 billion ILS (471 million
US$ equivalent) representing 100% of the total cost of IEC invoices for Gaza. 89% of this amount was
deducted by the Israeli Ministry of Finance while the remaining 11% was recorded as outstanding debt to
the IEC. The amounts of the overall non-payment are substantial and could be used by the PA for other
priority expenditures in the electricity or other sectors.


3.1.2. Geographical distribution of non-payment 2010-2013
The next step to understand the extent of non-payment in the Palestinian Territory is to analyze the
regional level of non-payment. The analysis clearly revealed that Gaza comprises the highest non-
payments in absolute amounts (GEDCO concession area) with a total amount of 1.739 billion ILS (471
million US$ equivalent). The West Bank central region (JDECO concession area) is next with a total
amount of 1.096 billion ILS (297 million US$ equivalent). This clearly indicates that solving the non-
payment issue in the Palestinian Territories will require focusing mainly on these two geographical areas
which together represent almost 70% of the non-payments during the reporting period.

3.1.3. Progression of non-payment over the period 2010-2013
It is essential to acknowledge that during this reporting period, the price of electricity purchased by
Palestinian Distributors from the IEC increased by 33%28 going from 0.33 ILS/kWh to 0.44 ILS/kWh,
since the increasing cost of electricity is one factor in terms of willingness to pay.
Non-payment during the period constantly and rapidly increased. In 201029 non-payment reached 37% of
the total electricity cost and it jumped to 58% of the total electricity cost in 2013.
This non-payment can be attributed to several factors including, the increase in the purchase price from
the IEC and a corresponding decline in willingness to pay, the decline in collection from customers and
the 2012 large deduction executed by the Israeli authority through the clearance mechanism which gave
Distributors and customers the impression that non-payment would automatically be compensated by the
PA.

To confirm whether non-payment was widespread in the Palestinian Territories or was only affecting
certain regions more significantly, the data was broken up into regions. In the West Bank, the overall
trend reveals that the increase in non-payment is generally in line with regional variables. In the Center

West Bank non-payment only started in 2011 and although it has the lowest non-payment percentage it
shows the highest increase going from 0% in 2010 to 44% in 2013.
.
Non-payment in the Northern West Bank increased significantly in 2012 compared to the previous year.
The Southern West Bank and Gaza have however, not seen any significant increases during this period
with an average non-payment level of around 50% for the southern West Bank, and Gaza consistently not
paying at all for IEC invoices.
The table below summarizes the regional distribution of non-payment to the IEC for the period 2010-
2013. For a better appreciation of the scale and location of the non-payment during the period, charts have
been developed and included in Appendix G (see Appendix G: Cost of purchase electricity vs. Net
Lending and direct payment) to provide details of non-payment percentage per region for the West Bank
and Gaza.

This section has enabled us to understand the extent of non-payment from Distributors to the IEC in the
West Bank and Gaza. The overall data collected provided clear evidence that non-payment has been
consistently increasing in the West Bank and had always existed in the Gaza Strip. It further identifies the
main regions and Distributors accountable for this increase.

3.1.4. Largest Non-Payers to IEC
To further identify the origin of the non-payment, an analysis of the largest non-payers to the IEC in the
West Bank and Gaza was performed and revealed the following results.
The largest non-payer to the IEC is GEDCO with a total amount of non-payment reaching 1,738,750,017
ILS (471,205,967 US$). During the 2010-2013 reporting period, GEDCOs’ contribution to the overall
non-payment to the IEC reached 41.8% while in 2013 it only purchased 21% of the total electricity sold to
the Palestinian Territories from the IEC.
JDECO is the second largest contributor to non-payment reaching a total of 1,095,484,015 ILS
(296,879,137 US$). Although this figure is quite significant, it is worth noting that JDECO’s contribution
to the total IEC non-payment reached 26.3% while it accounted for around 40% of the total electricity
purchases to the IEC in 2013.
The table below provides a more detailed list of the largest non-payers for the period 2010-2013 as well as
an indication of the percentage of electricity they purchased from IEC in 2013.

3.1.5. Net Lending and poverty
To identify the external factors that contribute to non-payment, it was also necessary to understand
whether there is a link between non-payment to IEC and poverty. The assessment work therefore
compared the non-payment in ILS/kWh to the IEC in 2013 data with the MOSA poverty data for the same
year.
In 2013, the District with the lowest poverty rate was Nablus District with a poverty rate of 5.9% and non-
payment about 40.4%30. Qalqiliya has the highest poverty rate of 15.9% and non-payment of 23.1% as
shown in the chart below. An area with one of the highest non-payment percentage is the Jericho District
(outside JDECO concession area) with 82.7% of non-payment, but the poverty rate of 13.8% is lower than
other areas in the West Bank.
This shows that non-payment from the Palestinian Distributors to IEC is not connected to the poverty
level of the customers supplied by these Distributors. For example, Nablus governorate which has one of
the lowest poverty rates is one of the largest contributors to Net Lending and non-payment. This shows
that poverty levels are not one of the main factors leading to non-payment of Distributors to IEC.

3.3 Electricity Losses
Distributors and other sector stakeholders often indicate that electricity losses are a major contributor to
non-payment. It was therefore necessary to analyze the amount of losses and their link to non-payment.
Electricity losses can be defined as difference between the amounts of electricity purchased from the
different electricity suppliers (mainly from IEC) and the electricity consumed by the end users as
measured by their electricity meters.
Losses can be categorized into two types: technical losses and non-technical losses. Technical losses are
losses on the electricity network (lines, cables, transformers, etc.), and these losses are the result of
inherent resistance of electrical conductors and can be verified using load flow software analysis and
measurements. Non-technical losses are the electricity which gets lost due to theft and errors of metering
and billing. The losses locations are illustrated in the next diagram.

The total electricity losses (which are the difference between the purchased electricity from all sources 36
as measured at the connection points and the sold electricity to the customers as measured by their meters
for the different DISCOs) did not vary much during the period 2010-2013; remaining steady at 23-30%
although this is above the levels reported by other regional Distributors such as those in Jordan which has
average losses of 13%.

The total losses as shown in the table and chart above include both technical and non-technical losses. The
split between technical and non-technical losses cannot be determined as Distributors do not have proper
measurement/monitoring tools installed on the network and are not equipped with the required technical
software tools to analyze the losses. To obtain this split, it is necessary to perform a technical study to
calculate the actual level of technical losses and then determine the difference between the total losses and
the technical losses to obtain the total non-technical losses. The only loss studies for West Bank and Gaza
are at least 10 years old which prevents us from making any conclusions based on these studies.
Nevertheless, during discussions, DISCOs indicated that they estimate the split between technical and
non-technical losses to be 50%: 50%. This estimation is based on their experience of the sector and self-
judgment only.
In terms of financial value, the cost of losses (technical and non-technical) during the period 2010-2013 in
West Bank was as follows:
                                              Table 8: Cost of losses in the West Bank
                                               2010                  2011                  2012              2013

The table above shows that cost of losses increased by 80% during the period while its significance
compared to non-payment dropped during the same period. This is mainly due to the fact that, as detailed
in the previous sections, non-payment has seen a sharp increase since 2011.

It should be noted that in the absence of the relevant information, in particular the amount of kWh
purchased from the IEC and Egypt, the percentage for Gaza losses were estimated by GEDCO. Based on
the current available information, losses were estimated at 14% in 2010, 19% in 2011 and in 2012 and



PwC                                                                                      Page 31
23% in 2014. It is recommended that an in depth study and analysis to calculate the actual amount of
losses is carried out.
Technical losses could be reduced by strengthening the electricity network with the installation of new
lines to reduce overloaded networks, the installation of capacitor banks to increase power factor, etc. This
means that the reduction of technical losses can only take place with financial investment in the network.
Non-technical losses can be reduced by increasing inspections, enforcing the law and taking legal and
punitive actions against the customers who steal electricity.
In order to measure the impact of a reduction of losses on the non-payment two loss reduction scenarios
are proposed below. These scenarios show that loss reduction would reduce the non-payment levels by
19% (with 2013 figures). The table reveals that the impact of reducing the losses on non-payment is
decreasing yearly as other important factors have started influencing non-payment, such as the collection
rates and the tariff margin.
The following two scenarios provide estimates on the savings for West Bank Distributors through a
decrease in technical and non-technical losses. The 2 scenarios are based on the assumption noted above,
that technical losses and non-technical losses are nearly equal.
       Scenario 1: technical losses reduced by 25% and non-technical losses reduced by 25%; i.e. total
        losses = 18.75% in 2013 instead of 25%.
       Scenario 2: technical losses reduced by 25% and non-technical losses reduced by 50%; i.e. total
        losses = 15.63% in 2013 instead of 25%.

3.4 Collection from customers
Another reason mentioned by sector stakeholders to explain non-payment to IEC is the low collection rate
from customers. The following section seeks to understand whether the collection is actually low and its
impact on non-payment to the IEC.

An analysis of customer payment behavior was undertaken using data from all DISCOs and selected
municipalities. The analysis also included a survey, which was distributed to a representative sample of
customers throughout West Bank and Gaza to better understand their consumption patterns and payment
attitudes. The result of this exercise and complete analysis is available in Appendix H.

3.4.1      Overall information on collection
Customer collection (which is the ratio between yearly total collections to the value of yearly total sales)
in the West Bank and Gaza is not as low as is widely believed in the Palestinian Territories. In 2013, the
average collection rate in the West Bank reached 81% while it reached 71% in the Gaza Strip.

Unfortunately the trend of payment from customer has been declining in all regions in the West Bank
with the sharpest drop at JDECO with a collection rate of 97% in 2012 going down to 83% in 2013.
In Gaza collection has been continually increasing from a rate of 47% in 2009 and reaching 71% in 2013.

In comparing the yearly collection totals from Distributors to the cost of purchased electricity from the
IEC and the payments processed, it appears that up to 2010, for most DISCOs in the West Bank the
collection level was sufficient to cover the IEC invoices. The only exception is JDECO which collected
the necessary funds to also cover costs up to 2011.
In Gaza during 2010-2013, the amounts collected were never sufficient to cover the purchase not even
reaching 50% of the costs. This clearly indicates that if with the collection reaching 71% GEDCO cannot
cover 50% of the IEC costs it will not be able to cover the cost of the purchase even with 100% collection.
While GEDCO is the main contributor to the non-payment, customer collection is only one of the causes
of non-payment.
GEDCO has been actively searching for solutions to increase the collection rate. With the support of
PENRA and donors, GEDCO successfully initiated a prepaid meter pilot project which enabled the utility
to collect about 1 million ILS (0.28 million US$) in 2013. GEDCO is currently requesting to extend the
installation of prepaid meters throughout the Strip. The preparation of a strategy for installing prepaid
meters in Gaza based on lessons learnt from West Bank Distributors is included as a recommendation in
the next section.
Chart 8 provides an overview of the collection to purchase cost from all electricity sources between 2010
and 2013 for the major DISCOs in the West Bank and Gaza. The analysis shows that as of 2012, amounts
collected by DISCOs were insufficient to cover electricity purchases. The chart illustrates the current
situation and clearly shows the decline in collection in the West Bank and the increase in Gaza.

Various attempts to increase collection by DISCOs have been taken in previous years including the
installation of pre-paid meters at scale. Appendix I provides further information based on the
geographical distribution of prepaid meters in the West Bank. In the past two years, JDECO has started
smart meter37 pilot projects, which look to increase the collection amounts and better monitor the losses.
Municipalities and village council’s collections38: The average collection rate of the main municipalities
and village council’s is estimated to be high . This is due the installation of large amounts of prepaid
meters39 in these areas. Qalqiliya reported the following collection rates.

Illar40 reported a collection rate averaging 100% in the past years with the operation of 100% prepaid
meters. Tulkarem did not report the collection rate, but it is estimated to be between 60% and 70% due to
poor collection from Tulkarem refugee camp which represents about 10% of Tulkarem’ total sales but has
a collection level of zero.
3.4.2           Collection per customer’s category
An assessment of the collection levels per customer category was performed to identify the payment
performances of the different customer categories and propose if necessary targeted actions per customer
category. Distributors issue monthly electricity bills to their customers serviced through postpaid
electricity meters for the cost of electricity consumed during the previous month, while customers with
prepaid electricity meters pay in advance for their future consumption.

   3. Others including “industrial users connected at low voltage level, industrial users connected at
        medium voltage level, water pumps, agricultural areas, street lights and temporary services”.
The first 2 categories comprise more than 75% of the total DISCOs’ sales and more than 95% of the total
number of customers.
A detailed chart providing information on the ratio of the different customer category in each DISCO is
available below. Observations on the data collected on customer category can be summarized as follows:
The only pattern which could be identified is that there is a higher level of collection from commercial
customers compared to all other categories in the West Bank and Gaza.
     NEDCO: Collections from the Residential category are moderate (around 82%) and have seen a
      yearly decrease (to 78%) in 2012. This could be explained by the transfer of villages (comprising
      mainly of residential customers with lower collection rates) into NEDCO in 2011 and 2012.
      Collections from the Commercial category went down from 95% in 2010 to 70% in 201241 mainly
      due to non-payment by governmental institutions42.
      Collections from the “Other” category are low probably due to the fact that water pumps and street
      lights are either owned by a municipality or the PA who do not systematically pay for their bills. For
      example, in 2012, sales for street lights amounted to around 5 million ILS which represents 2% of
      NEDCO’s total sales while collection for street lights was close to zero. The same year, sales for
      water pumps amounted to 16 million ILS which represents 8.9% of NEDCO’s total sales while
      collection was also close to zero.
     JDECO: Collections from the Residential category are high but decreased rapidly in 2013 dropping
      to 86%. Based on anecdotal evidence, it is believed that some residential customers stopped paying
      their bills after learning that the IEC deducted non-payments from clearance revenues (Net Lending)
      in November 2012. Collections from the Commercial category are high (90-100%) and no collection
      problems are noticed within this category. This could be due to JDECO’s ability to exercise its rights
      to disconnect electricity and take legal actions more easily against Commercial customers who are
      larger, easier to find and approach.
      Collections from the “Other” category are high except for 2013 which saw a sudden drop mainly due
      to the deterioration in the collection of payments from industrial medium voltage customers: non-
      payment of major PA water wells in Bethlehem area and military academy in Jericho.
     HEPCO: Collections from the residential category are low averaging between 71% and 75% during
      the period 2009-2013, with 2013 witnessing the lowest collection rate for the period.
      The collections from the “Other” category decreased gradually after 2010 due to the reduction in
      collection from street lighting and the governmental services 42. Sales to municipalities for street lights
      in 2013 were about 6.7 million ILS which represented about 2.2% of HEPCO’s total sales while
      collections for street lights reached around 57%. Sales for Governmental institutions amounted to
      around 6.2 million ILS which represented 3.1% of the total sales whilst the collection was close to nil.
     GEDCO: Collections from the residential category are low (62%-77%) but 2013 registered the
      highest collection rate. The yearly increase in collection could be partially explained by the automatic
      salary deductions implemented by the PA for civil servants in Gaza to cover part of their debt to
      GEDCO. The salary deductions from PA civil servants in Gaza amounted to 134 million ILS in 2013
      representing more than 30% of the total collections. Similarly, the collection from commercial
      customers is relatively high, reaching 92% in the period 2011-2013 and the collection for the “Other”
      category43 is average and reaching around 77% but steadily increasing by 2 to 3% yearly since 2010.

3.4.3       Reasons for non-payment according to customers
In order to identify and understand the reasons and factors affecting non-payment from customers to
Distributors, a survey was performed in the West Bank and Gaza. The results of the survey do not reflect
actual personal payment behavior of customers, but their personal views on the reasons of non-payment in
the country.
The vast majority of respondents believe the cost of electricity is high and this is the main reason for non-
payment by customers. During the study, it was also possible to evaluate the proportion of household
income that the monthly electricity invoices represented. This ratio reached 8.15% in the West Bank and
11.91% in Gaza. It is interesting to note that while respondents perceive electricity to be sold at a high
costs, an EBRD research paper48 dated 2005 provides “benchmarks used in measuring affordabil ity from
various sources” in different countries (IPA energy, WHO and WB) which range between 10 -15% of the
household income.
In the West Bank, other important reasons communicated to explain non-payment by customers were
related to the low source of income, the fact that many do not pay and the refugee status.
In Gaza, in addition to the high cost of electricity, respondents indicated that non-payment was due to the
low level of income in Gaza and the dissatisfaction of customer in the service provided.
The responses were analyzed by calculating the mean scores of responses based on a Likert scale of one
to five with one being the strongest and five being the weakest. The tables below represent the strongest
indicators for nonpayment. In addition a color coded system was employed to identify critical factors in
the decision of respondents not to pay, which follows below:
      Black was a main or critical factor in non-payment
      Red was a strong factor in non-payment
      Yellow was a potential or weak factor in non-payment
      Green was a non-factor in non-payment

     NEDCO was not in operation in 2009 so the data for this year is not included.

   The commercial customers’ data are included in the data of the “other” customers as we could no t obtain from HEPCO the split between the two
categories.

   TEDCO data is not included in the chart as TEDCO sells most of the electricity to 18 villages on bulk meters and not directly to the end customers

While the analysis above provides an insight into participant’s perceptions of the reasons for non-
payment, it was also decided to evaluate the willingness of customers to pay for their invoices.
The analysis as reported in table below was inconclusive. There is no clear pattern for willingness to pay
based on income, invoice or percentage of invoice to household income. It is likely that additional factors
are most probably influencing the behavior of customers; such as a culture of non-payment. The table
nevertheless, clearly illustrates that in areas where large amounts of pre-paid meters are installed (more
than 70%); the willingness to pay by customers serviced with postpaid meters living in this area is very
high.
Furthermore, Jerusalem and Ramallah (JDECO concession area) have the highest percentage of
willingness to pay which could be explained by the prosecution action that is taken against offenders who
are in arrears or by culture of payment in these areas. Jericho has the lowest percentage of willingness to
pay but also the highest price rate compared to income. The main reason for low willingness to pay in this
governorate can perhaps be explained by the high percentage that electricity bills represent on the
household income for customers in this area.
To further challenge the results received from the analysis of electricity payment, we also included in the
survey a few questions on payments to other utilities and basic services. The results of these questions
were enlightening as they revealed that in the West Bank, over 80% of respondents stated that they
regularly pay for other utilities such as water, telephone, and internet. In West Bank, the reasons cited for
paying for these bills were related to the fear of penalty or punishment (56% of respondent) and the
perception of the importance of the service itself (21.8%). In Gaza, 52% of respondents justified the
payment of other utilities bills for fear of penalty or punishment (28.8%), to remain debt free (23.7%) and
due to the perception of that the prices were acceptable (22.4%).

It is important to note that only those respondents served by postpaid meters are included in table 15.
Respondents with pre-paid meters are required to pay for the electricity service in advance.
Approximately 57.6% of all respondent are serviced by postpaid meters, with the balance of 42.4%
serviced by prepaid meters.

The next step towards understanding customers’ behavior and defining the most suitable actions to
implement to achieve an increase in collection was to identify the factors which can encourage customers
to pay. While results differed slightly between the West Bank and Gaza, customers in both locations
believe that flexibility in payment schedule – mainly related to the settlement of arrears - should
encourage more customers to pay. In the West Bank survey respondents also indicated that the installation
of pre-paid meters should settle the issue of non-payment. In the Gaza Strip respondents believe that
enhancing the level of service –essentially uninterrupted provision of electricity - should certainly lead to
an increase in payment.

Payment behavior of civil servants
The survey also included questions on payment behavior, which captured civil servant’s behavior and
concluded that over half (52.6%) indicated they were compelled to wait for their salary before paying
their bill,
     While 5.3% indicated they borrow money to pay their electricity bills.
     And over 42% however, stated that they simply don't pay because they can't.
The total number of respondents employed in the public sector that participated in this study was 82. Of
the 82 respondents, 38 answered the question related to the irregular payment of salaries and how it
affects their ability to settle their electricity invoices. The remaining respondents in this category were
serviced through a prepaid meter for their electricity needs.
It should be noted that during the months where salary payments for Civil Servants are delayed,
Distributors in West Bank typically give these employees a monthly credit of 50-100 ILS.

3.5 Tariff Analysis

One of the factors commonly attributed to the non-payment in the West Bank and Gaza is the high sales
tariff for customers.
The sales tariff is calculated based on the purchase tariff from the IEC to which a markup is added
according to an approved approach and methodology (“Cost plus” Approach). This approach should
ensure that the operational cost of the DISCOs including acceptable levels of technical and non-technical
losses, working capital needs and future investments, are covered and should allow for a limited profit


PwC                                                                                 Page 39
margin. The regulatory authority is entitled to set future benchmarks for certain Key Performance
Indicators (“KPIs”) for certain components such as technical and non-technical losses to be covered by
the tariff.
To understand the impact of the tariff on the non-payment, this section will first analyze the purchase
tariff, followed by the markup and finally look at the sales tariff including the governmental subsidy
component.

3.5.1              Purchase Tariff
Most of the Distributors purchase electricity from the IEC at a tariff set by the Israeli Power Utility
Authority (PUA), with the following main characteristics:
 It is a LV or MV bulk flat tariff for all connection points except for JDECO, where the Time of Use
   tariff (ToU) is applied;
 It is fixed by the PUA without any consultations with the Palestinian Distributors or Authorities.
 It is a tariff designed for the Israeli electricity market, not customized for the Palestinian market. It
   includes beside other components for example an unknown percentage49 to cover the development of
   the renewable energy sector in Israel; which Palestinians recipients do not benefit from.
The tariff applied by the PUA in the Palestinian Territories is a bulk tariff for Low Voltage for
connection points connected at the low voltage and is a medium voltage bulk tariff for connection points
connected at the medium voltage:

                                  Table 17: Israeli Tariff as 16.5.2013: Fixed rates – Agorot per kWh
        Residential                    General                   Street lighting              Low Voltage bulk tariff           Medium Voltage bulk

             54.03                        55.61                         47.63                             52.55                            45.27


The purchase tariff set unilaterally by the PUA is contested by the PA which considers that it does not
reflect appropriate costs as it does not consider the Palestinian electricity Distributors as one unit. The PA
believes that, as the largest single customer to the IEC, the tariff should be an export tariff which only
includes the cost components applicable to the PA consumption and from which all other components
such as the renewable energy component should be removed.
Payment conditions applied to Palestinian Distributors are the same as the ones applied to Israeli
residential and commercial customers. They only have 11 days to pay the IEC after which they are
imposed a late fee of 8.75%50. Palestinian Distributors, which purchase electricity with a yearly amount of
over 2 billion ILS (560 million US$), believe that their payment conditions should be different from those
from Israeli residential or commercial customers. It is recommended that payment conditions be revised
to appropriate wholesale levels, recognizing the fact that Distributors are large companies with their own
costs, and who need to read meters and issue invoices for thousands of customers, collect money from
them and are only then in a position to pay the IEC.
The Palestinian Authority has been involved in talks with its Israeli counterpart for the past 10 years to
negotiate a commercial agreement which should resolve the above mentioned issues and in particular
agree on a special export tariff to the Palestinian Distributors with fair payment conditions. Unfortunately,
progress on reaching an agreement has slow, and needs to be brought to a conclusion.

3.5.2               Tariff margin51
A new tariff approach and methodology was approved by the BoD of PERC in 2011. Details of the
approach are summarized below:
   1- It is a cost plus tariff: the tariff must recover all the regulated expenses plus a profit equal to the
       Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).
   2- It includes the following 11 types of customers: residential, residential prepaid, commercial,
       commercial prepaid, industrial low voltage, industrial medium voltage, water pumps, agricultural,
       street lights, temporarily connection and temporarily prepaid connection. The tariff varies
       according to the customer category and the voltage level.
   3- It is a 5 step tariff for residential customers with postpaid meter and flat for all other customer
       categories; with the exception of customers serviced through medium voltage for which the Time
       of Use (ToU) tariff applies. The residential step tariff is an ascending tariff with the first step
       having the lowest price.
   4- It includes Governmental subsidy.
        5- It includes a threshold for total losses set at 22.5% the first year (2011) and gradually decreasing
           after.
The sales tariff was set to cover the cost of electricity purchased from IEC as well as the operational
expenses and allow for an acceptable profit margin for Distributors.
Following implementation of the above Chart 14: Comparing purchase and sales tariff 2009-2013
methodology, the Tariff Margin reached 54%
in the West Bank and 40% in Gaza in 2011. 0.80                         73%
There was a sharp decrease in the margin in 0.70

market. The margin continued to decrease in                                                           16%

2012 mostly due to the governmental decision to 0.00
partly subsidize the tariff and not to increase the      2009     2010      2011      2012       2013
sales tariff to the customers. The margin
                                                                  West Bank         Gaza Strip
remained in place for 2013.
The tariff margin has decreased in the West Bank between 2010 and 2013 going from 54% to 40% largely
due to:
   1- The high increase of the purchase cost ofelectricity from IEC, and
   2- The subsidies included in the tariff which are mostly not repaid by the Government52.
The removal of subsidy and decrease in losses threshold in the tariff should bring the tariff margin under
54%. While a fair tariff margin can be calculated at 50-52% for 2013 in the current context53, it would be
necessary for the PA to reach a fair commercial agreement with IEC to reach this goal.
During the period 2010-2013, the cost of electricity purchased from the IEC (estimations) increased by
62%. This increase was the result of the rise in the purchase tariff from the IEC by 34% during this period
and the increase of the quantity of electricity purchased from the IEC by 22% during the same period.


51
     The difference between the sales and the purchase tariff is defined as the tariff margin.


52
  Governmental subsidies are detailed chapter 3.7.2 and Annex L provides details of governmental subsidies including repayment
53
  Comparing 2011 margin of 54% reduced by 2%-4% including reduced losses threshold in PERC tariff methodology and excluding any governmental
subsidy.

The following paragraphs attempt to provide additional information to explain why the margin went down
so dramatically:
The average purchase tariff from the IEC decreased by 12% from 2009 to 2010 while the sales tariff
decreased by 3%. This explains the high percentage of collection to purchase54 value in 2010 as shown in
Chart 13. From 2011 to 2013 the purchase tariff increased steadily. In 2011 it increased by 7% compared
to 2010. During the same time, the sales tariff decreased by 4%. 2012 was particularly challenging as the
purchase tariff increased by 17% compared to 2011 while the sales tariff only increased by 6.5%.
The purchase tariff in Gaza is set by the IEC and is similar to the West Bank. However, the sales’ tariff in
Gaza is lower than the one in the West Bank and is set by GEDCO rather than by PERC (which still has
not exercised its mandate in the Strip). The sales tariff in Gaza is 70% of the sales tariff in the West Bank.
The sales tariff has not changed in Gaza for the last 3 years, largely due to:
1- Political reasons; and
2- A shortage of electricity supply to customers: GEDCO is not willing to increase the tariff for the
costumers while daily electricity cuts last between 6-12 hours.
The tariff margin in Gaza is 16% in 2013, if PERC tariff methodology is applied in Gaza then the tariff
margin should be increased to 50-52%. This means that the sales tariff in Gaza will be the same as in
West Bank and requires the sales tariff to be increased by 36% without taking into consideration the high
cost of generating electricity from Gaza power plant. Should this increase be implemented it must be
conditioned at least with serious enhancement in the quality of the electricity service to the population in
the Gaza Strip which would require an increase in the supply and the capacity of the grid.
Given this, the PA has (with the support of the international community) plans to supply the Gaza Power
Plant with natural gas to reduce the generating cost and to utilize collections from customers to pay for
IEC invoices. In addition to reducing the costs, this action will also enable it to run at full capacity which
will then reduce the power shortages in Gaza.
The following charts illustrate the average sales and purchase tariffs in West Bank and Gaza for the
period 2009-2013 based on our analysis of the data received from the different Distributors.

While it is important to ensure that the mark up guarantees the payback of Distributor’s costs and includes
some profit, the tariff as currently implemented is standard and does not take into consideration the reality
on the ground as shown below. The tariff currently implemented fails to take into consideration the
following points:
 Collections reached around 81% in the West Bank in 2013 rather than 100% and this figure showed a
    drop from 90% in 2011, the first year the unified tariff was implemented.
 Technical and Non-technical losses are above the acceptable range to PERC of 22.5% reaching 25%
    in 2013.
 Governmental subsidies are not systematically paid although they amount to 4% of the electricity
    purchase value, and not all Distributors implement the subsidy scheme for specific social cases 55.
 Furthermore, although it is important to offer a life line tariff, this tariff should only target the poor
    customers and should not be applied to all customers as is the case presently.
The tariff for the prepaid meters would also need to be reviewed in particular for commercial customers.
For this customer category the prepaid meters tariff has a fixed charge of zero and is 4.5% less than the
tariff of the commercial customer with postpaid meter.

3.5.3              Sales Tariff
After analyzing the purchase tariff and the margin, it is also necessary to examine if the sales tariff
implemented by Distributors follows the approved tariff methodology issued by PERC which should
cover the operation costs of Distributors including the cost of IEC invoices.
The Palestinian Territories have a unified sales tariff which was approved by the Cabinet in 2011 and has
only been applied in the West Bank since. The electricity sales tariff 56 is recommended by the PERC for
all DISCOs - except for the East Jerusalem area where the tariff is set by the PUA directly - and for
municipalities who adopt the PERC tariff following MOLG instructions.

55
     As detailed in the next sub-section Governmental Subsidies in West Bank.


56
     The tariff is recommended by PERC to PENRA which approves it and transmits it to the cabinet for endorsement.



PwC                                                                                                   Page 43
GEDCO does not apply the unified sales tariff introduced by PERC but rather sets its own tariff which has
not changed for the last 3 years. The political situation in Gaza has not permitted PERC to exercise its
mandate on GEDCO.
PERC issued the first unified tariff in the West Bank in mid-2011, and was mandated to review the tariff
on a yearly basis57. One should note that the sales tariff prior to 2011 was determined individually by each
utility since the electricity sector only started to be regulated after the issuance by PERC of the first
unified tariff in West Bank which was then applied by all DISCOs.
The average sales tariff applied in the West Bank is higher than the average sales tariff for customers in
Israel. The West Bank residential tariff is 11% higher than its Israeli equivalent and the commercial tariff
in the West Bank is 15% higher than the Israeli commercial tariff. These figures corroborate customer’s
claims that electricity prices are too high. Chart 13 below illustrates these disparities.

An in-depth analysis of the sales tariff for the different 3 customer categories was performed for the
period 2009-2013 to assess tariff variations between the categories and whether this could partially
explain the non-payment issue.
The analysis revealed variances in the value of the sales tariff within categories between different
DISCOs as shown in the chart below. This is due to the fact that:
       The residential tariff is a step tariff and not a flat tariff. This results in variation based on
        consumption.
       Different tariffs are applied for customers with prepaid meters and customers with postpaid. The
        prepaid meter tariff does not include a fixed charge fee and is 4.5% lower than the postpaid meter
        tariff. As an example of the variation of these tariffs, we observed that the tariff for commercial
        customer with postpaid meter is 0.667 ILS/kWh whilst for a commercial customer with a prepaid
        meter it is 0.637 ILS/kWh. It is worth noting that in the past years, prepaid meters were installed in
        large quantities in the northern region of the West Bank as shown in Chart 11 Appendix I58.

3.5.4                Governmental Subsidies in West Bank59
Over the past few years, the PA has taken a number of tariff decisions to compensate for the various
increases in IEC sales tariffs and to prevent high prices impacting on end use customers. These subsidies
complement PERCs’ initiative to implement a step tariff for residential areas with the first step being a
life line tariff available for all but essentially aiming to give the poor people with low consumption a
reduced tariff. The impact of these subsidies on non-payment needs to be assessed to determine their
impact and allow appropriate action to be taken. It is also necessary to understand whether these subsidies
have been paid to Distributors by the government.
The different subsidy tariff decisions were initiated in 2011 mostly at the initiative of the government and
essentially to maintain public order and avoid public unrest after some demonstrations against increase in
prices occurred in the West Bank in the midst of the “Arab Spring”. The governmental subsidies did not
take into consideration the actual cost of electricity and the capacity of the PA to cover the subsidies
amounts. The subsidies approved by the cabinet during the period can be classified into the following
categories:
Type 1: Subsidy for each kWh sold by DISCOs60
 Cabinet Decision No. (4/94/13) for the year 2011: PERCs’ calculation of the end customer’s tariff
   reflects losses which are estimated to reach 20%. The government commits to pay to DISCOs any
   amounts for losses which go beyond 20%, if any. This decision was valid from 20/06/2011 until
   01/09/2012 in the West Bank.
 Cabinet Decision No. (04/14/14) for the year 2012: On 28 August 2012, following an increase in the
   purchase price from the IEC by 8.9% a new tariff was issued. The IEC price was only reflected up to
   25% in the costumer tariff and the remaining 75% was covered by the government in the form of
   subsidies. Decision No. (4/94/13) mentioned above was cancelled the day Decision No. (04/14/14)
   was approved.
 Cabinet Decision No. (7/45/14) for the year 2013: approved on 5 March 2013. This decision
   concerned electricity debts related to local authorities and DISCOs and included among its articles “A

        new tariff was issued, in line with the increase of 8.8% in the purchase price from the IEC. The
        government will subsidize 2.6 agora per kWh on this new tariff”.
Type 2: Subsidy for each kWh sold to all customers in Jericho area as in the following decision
 Cabinet Decision No. (14/04/14) for the year 2012: Following an increase in the purchase price of
   electricity from Jordan for the Jericho area by more than 75% (from 33 agora to 57 agora), on 1st June
   2012, PERC agreed not to reflect the increase in the sales price which was of 49 agora, and the
   government decided to subsidize the difference.
According to data provided by DISCOs, the PA only reimbursed 20% of the subsidies funds that they
owed DISCOs according to the decisions approved by the cabinet between 2011 and2013 (see Table 18
below). The outstanding subsidy payment amounts (unpaid amounts) represents around 4% of the
estimated cost of the purchased electricity for the period 2011-2013. This reveals the significant burden
that unpaid subsidies are representing on the non-payment to IEC issue and questions the effectiveness of
such a mechanism if the PA is not in a position to fund it. Annex L provides further details on the costs of
subsidies and the government payment of subsidies for DISCOs.
The non-payment by the government of the subsidies also leads Distributors to reduce the subsidy
amounts from their payments to the IEC. IEC in return collects this amount through Net Lending.
It should be noted that MOLG indicated that no municipality had been compensated through the subsidy
mechanisms.

3.6 Efficiency and transparency of Distributors
While the previous sections exposed GEDCO and JDECO as the main contributor to non-payment in
absolute figures, it is important to highlight that in terms of percentage of payments to IEC invoice,
municipalities are also not performing well. While GEDCO remains the largest non-payer in absolute
value and percentage, 4 municipalities are presently part of the top 5 largest non-payers in the West Bank.
Although the sections above have clearly identified significant factors affecting payment, it is important
to understand whether municipalities and DISCOs are performing efficiently and are diligently paying for
their invoices.

The information collected during the study has allowed the analysis to isolate the amount collected by
West Bank Distributors from the Palestinian customers and not paid to the IEC. This is estimated to
amount to 595,415,998 ILS in 2013 which represents 37% of the collected amount in that year. This
amount is probably disbursed by the different Distributors in the West Bank to cover the costs of:
 Operating expenses: to cover the operational costs of the Distributors such as salaries, network
   maintenance expenses, etc. are estimated at 0.065 ILS/kWh purchased based on a high level analysis
   on the public financial statements of JDECO, HEPCO and NEDCO amounted to 242,098,907 ILS
   (representing approximately 41% of the amount collected but not paid to the IEC).
 Capital expenses: Covering the cost of capital investment for network expansion of 120 million ILS
   (estimated at 20% of the amount collected and not paid to the IEC).
 Municipal finance and shareholder’s finance: as defined in the introduction of the report amount to
   242 million ILS which corresponds to the remaining amounts from the collection which are not paid
   to IEC (representing about 40% of the difference).
For Gaza, the difference amounts to 139,544,004 ILS which represents 34% of collection, and is
estimated to be utilized to cover:
 Operating expenses: Estimated at 0.065 ILS/kWh purchase amounting to 102,746,221 ILS
    representing 74% of the difference.

     Capital expenses: 20% of the difference amounting to 27,908,801 ILS.
     Other: The remaining amount of 8,888,982 ILS.
DISCOs and municipalities indicated they could not provide detailed descriptions for the “municipal
finance and shareholder finance” amounts. Moreover, DISCOs and municipalities indicated they could
not provide their audited financial statements for the previous year. It was therefore not possible to know
for certain what the excess cash registered as “municipal finance and shareholder finance” was used for.
Nevertheless, DISCOs indicated that they use the excess cash for shareholder loans, advance dividend
payments and other stakeholder payments. It is obvious that the system is not transparent and lacks proper
procedures. The efficiency of DISCOs needs to be improved to ensure that amounts collected from
customers to cover the cost of the electricity service include IEC payments, operational expenses, and
capital expenses but exclude shareholder finance.
The lack of efficiency of municipalities has been pointed out by many stakeholders and it is widely
believed that municipalities do not have segregated accounts. This makes it difficult to maintain distinct
accounts for the different municipal services.
In addition, municipalities indicated that they do not systematically receive revenues from the PA for
taxes transfers, subsidies and other services which then leads them to proceed with automatic
compensation from funds collected from electricity services.
All the above clearly indicated that actions are required by the PA and from municipalities and DISCOs to
improve the payments process and ensure its transparency.


3.7 Other reasons for non–payment
3.7.1        Analysis on Special areas
The purpose of this section is to observe whether certain areas contribute more to high losses (the total of
technical and non-technical losses) and low collection. The areas selected represent all geographical areas
and include different customer types such as refugee camps and other specific sensitive areas.
The customers in these areas are supplied with electricity from different DISCOs, but the collection
behavior and volume of losses are different than for costumers outside the areas.
The analysis of the special areas did not reveal a common pattern for all these areas but rather showed that
each area has specific issues which are detailed per area below.
 JDECO- Refugee Camps
JDECO serves 13 camps within its jurisdiction, one of them is located in Jerusalem in area C21 and the
remaining camps are located in the West Bank in area A21. JDECO reported the following consumption
characteristics in camps in 2013.
It is important to note that the average consumption per customer inside the camps is equivalent to 175%
of the average customer outside the camps. This disparity is mainly due to electricity theft which leads to
increased consumption without accompanying growth in the number of customers. It is believed that
some small commercial facilities also contribute to the problem by opening businesses inside the camps,
benefitting from the camp location to avoid payment of their electricity bills.
The table below shows that the uncollected sales from the camps reached around 29 million ILS in 2013,
which represents 20% of the total JDECO uncollected sales for that year. Increasing the collection inside
the camps from 30% to 95% would increase JDECOs’ total collection from 83% to 87%, which equates to
approximately 26.5 million ILS.




PwC                                                                      Page 48
While customers in the camps only represent 5.3% of JDECO’s total customers, their total losses 63 (63%)
amount to around 21% of JDECO’s total losses in 2013. Reducing the losses in the camps to a mere 20%
would save JDECO around 37 million ILS/year.
Shuafat camp located in Jerusalem area has the highest collection rate reaching 75% while all the other
camps located in West Bank have a collection rate in the range of 15%-20%. Although the collection rate
is very high in Shuafat refugee camp electricity losses are very high, reaching 60% (believed to be non-
technical losses essentially).

 NEDCO65- Refugee camps66
While the average consumption per customer inside and outside the camps is almost similar, collection in
the camps is very low and has been decreasing consistently. As is the case for HEPCO, the decrease in
collection is mainly the result of a lack of punitive measures for non-payers due to NEDCO’s inability to
take legal actions against them. Increasing the collection rate in the camps to the same level as the average
collection rate for NEDCO would result in a yearly revenue increase for NEDCO of around 9 million ILS
(which represents 4% of the total sales).

   The consumption of electricity by the camps is measured by monitoring meters installed by JDECO at each of the transformers supplying the camps.
The reading of these monitoring meters is then compared to the reading of the customer’s meters inside the camps to estimate the total losses (technical
and non-technical losses).
64
   More historical data was not provided.

   NEDCO does not have monitoring meters installed at the transformers supplying the old city and therefore could not report on the total area
consumption and losses.

To further refine the analysis of non-payment in the refugee camps, focus groups were held to determine
the motives of non-payment and understand the perception of the electricity Distributors in major camps.
The overall perception of Distributors is negative as they are alleged to be solely profit oriented and
failing or slow to meet the needs of their customers. Contributing factors to this perception included poor
communication skills by Distributors, the lack of customer services, and the lack of concern showed by
the Distributors to the residents of the camp.
Participants further complained about the high cost of electricity at a time of acute unemployment and
dire economic situation. The lack of economic opportunities, the high taxation, and penalties all
contribute negatively to the customer’s willingness to pay for electricity bills.
The electricity network in both camps was reported to be in poor condition and technicians mandated to
fix electricity problems were not only delayed but also reported to be lacking in courtesy. The lack of
payment points for customers to go and settle their invoices as well as the absence of other basic customer
services (i.e., recharging of prepaid meters) were also reported as points of concern.
Representatives of the Popular Committee69 in the Amari Refugee Camp also reported that one of the
byproducts of the accumulation of arrears was the impact on housing prices. For example, if someone
owns a home valued at JD 20,000 in a refugee camp with JD 10,000 in accumulated arrears, the buyer
would simply offset the difference between the value of the home and the amount of the arrears paying it
directly to the Distributor. Finally, the unprofessional behavior of electricity Distributor technicians was
also raised by the Popular Committee representatives who indicated that this behavior conveyed a
negative image of the Distributor which then discouraged customers from paying or communicating with
them.


 Gaza Strip Refugee Camps Focus Group70
The perception of Distributors in the Gaza focus group was quite negative with comments such as: “poor
service”, “being solely profit oriented”, “lacking empathy” and “having prices that are too high”.
Contributing factors to this perception included poor communication skills by Distributor employees
including a lack of empathy towards ordinary citizens.
Participants overwhelmingly highlighted that electricity costs including payment of arrears represented a
huge burden on households. In several instances, participants complained about the direct deduction from
civil servants family members’ salaries of 170 ILS/month. Participants also requested that amnesties be
granted to customers with accumulated arrears.
Participants appealed for an organizational restructuring of GEDCO to improve customer services, revise
electricity prices and pricing policies including perceived excessive taxation and penalties. GEDCO
collectors were pointed out and criticized for receiving commissions on collections from end users.

 HEPCO- Hebron old City (H2)71
Collection in H271 area has been decreasing consistently throughout the years. The decrease in collection
is mainly as a result of weak law enforcement for non-payers due to HEPCO’s inability to take legal
actions against them in H2 area. Contributing to the issue is the fact that we believe that an increasing

   Popular Committees supervise projects sponsored by local and international institutions, donor entities/countries and UNRWA. They also seek to
promote social interaction inside the camps, in addition to their coordination role with institutions working outside the camps.

   Following the 1995 Oslo Agreement and subsequent 1997 Hebron Agreement, Palestinian cities were placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Palestinian Authority, with the exception of Hebron, which was split into two sectors: H1 controlled by the Palestinian Authority and H2 controlled by
Israel. Around 120,000 Palestinians live in H1, while around 30,000 Palestinians along with around 700 Israelis remain under Israeli military control in
H2.

raise the collection rate from the old city to average collection rate for HEPCO for 2013 of 95%, it would
result in an increase of HEPCO’s yearly revenue by 14 million ILS (which represents 7% of the total
sales).

 NEDCO - Howwarah and Einabos Villages
These 2 villages are located close to Nablus city in area A21 and whilst they had high collection rates in
2010, this deteriorated in 2011 and 2012. In parallel with the drop in collection, electricity consumption
increased rapidly during these years largely due to the access to free electricity.

The collection rate of these two villages has dropped significantly during the reported period.
Unfortunately we could not immediately identify the reasons for this sharp decrease. A more thorough
analysis including site visits would be necessary to understand the drop.

The table above shows that collection rate from Nablus old city is high and the consumption per capita is
in the national average. The old city of Nablus is under area A21 which is fully controlled by the PA; this
may explain the difference between Nablus old city which is under area A21 and Hebron old city which is
under area H271.

   The losses in Hebron old city are not reported. HEPCO does not have monitoring meters installed at the transformers supplying the old city and could
therefore not report on the total area consumption and losses.

       Social cases
Cabinet Decision No. (7/45/14) approved on 5 March 2013. This decision concerns electricity debts
related to local authorities and DISCOs and included among its articles “The Government will cover the
monthly cost of the first 150kWh for social cases registered at MOSA”.
8,759 social cases, supplied by three DISCOs, benefited from the Governmental subsidy Decision during
the reported period. While these DISCOs supplied the social cases with a monthly 150kWh free of charge,
the Government has not yet compensated the DISCOs. The absence of governmental reimbursement is
affecting DISCOs and contributes to the non-payment issue.

       Incentives
On 30/12/2012 the Camps agreement was adopted including the following: All debts starting January
2008 up to the end of December 2012 will be covered by the government for those costumers accepting
this agreement.
Cabinet Decision No (7/45/14) for the year 2013: approved on 5 March 2013. This decision concerns
electricity debts related to local authorities and DISCOs. The decision offered the following incentives for
costumers to pay their bills.
        o Any customer committed to pay his invoice will be rewarded with a 10% deduction on his monthly
          invoice. This deduction will be subsidized by the government.
        o Any indebted customer who pays an additional 10% to his bill to reimburse his debt will be offered
          a 10% cancellation to his debt. This cancellation will be subsidized by the government.
The incentive schemes mentioned above and approved by the Government aimed to enhance DISCO’s
collections by targeting the camps and cancelling old debts in exchange of payments. These incentive
schemes were contested by Palestinian Political Fractions and people outside the camps which were
demanding that customers outside the camps should also benefit from these advantages. These protests
led the government to extend these cabinet decisions to all customers outside the camps. Yet, the camp
agreement was never implemented and the status quo continued.
Even without being implemented, these incentive schemes created discontent within the Palestinian
population outside camps which is assumed to have impacted these customers’ payments of electricity
invoices.

 4.          Conclusion
4.1.     Summary of analysis
In the past years, non-payment has reached unprecedented levels in the West Bank and Gaza and
represents a significant financial burden for the Palestinian Authority. The previous sections of the report
have analyzed in detail the data collected to understand the main causes of this non-payment. This
concluding section summarizes the main findings related to the non-payment.
To present a consolidated representation of the non-payment situation issue, we have analyzed its impact
throughout the end to end financial payment cycle:
1.    Purchases from IEC and other Suppliers
2.    Losses between quantity purchased and quantity invoiced (sold) to customers
3.    Collected amount from sold electricity
4.    Payments to IEC and other Suppliers
5.    Non-Payment amount split between Net Lending and Debt
The graph below illustrates the financial impact of the payment shortages in the payment cycle as well as
issues arising from the purchase and sales tariff levels.

The analysis in the previous sections revealed that the 92% of the total contribution to non-payments
during the period was caused by 10 Distributors in the West Bank + GEDCO. Out of the 92%, GEDCO
and JDECO are the largest contributors to the non-payment representing 68% of the total non-payment of
electricity in the West Bank and Gaza. GEDCO contributed to 55.4% of the total West Bank and Gaza
Net Lending during the period while JDECO contributed to 68.7% of the total West Bank and Gaza debt
up to February 2014.
Electricity losses are considered to be excessive although they remained stable throughout the period. In
addition, it emerged that Distributors do not have the necessary tools to measure losses properly and that
the split between technical and non-technical losses is mostly based on estimates. Due to losses
amounting to 479 million ILS in the West Bank and 247 million ILS in Gaza in 2013, the invoiced
electricity sales could barely cover the cost of electricity purchases.
The collections from customers continuously decreased with the exception of Gaza which has witnessed a
constant increase mostly due to the deductions by MOF of the civil servant salaries. Nevertheless, the
collection in Gaza is still lower than in the West Bank.
The sales tariff does not take into consideration the limitations of the market. The sales tariff includes a
governmental subsidy which was only partially paid by the PA to the Distributors and the actual losses for
most of the Distributors are higher than the lost threshold included in the tariff methodology. Regardless
of these, the sales tariff to the Palestinian customer is still high and higher than the sales tariff to the
Israeli consumers, which is mostly due to the high purchase tariff from the IEC.
Cash collected by Distributors from electricity invoices were not systematically utilized to cover
electricity related matters. Distributors choose to cover their operational expenses and other expenses such
as municipal finance and shareholder finance before settling their invoices to the IEC. These clearly
reveal a governance issue within Distributors which needs to be urgently addressed to improve their
efficiency and the level of payments to the IEC.
Special areas such as refugee camps exhibited most of the issues mentioned above, resulting in high levels
of non-payment. Nevertheless, these areas did not contribute greatly to the overall non-payment as they
only represent a small number of customers and a limited proportion of total invoiced amounts.

4.2.   Invoice reconciliation and cycle
The analysis revealed that there are no procedures for the invoicing of electricity from the IEC to the
Palestinian Distributors and that the process currently implemented is not harmonized for all Distributors
and lacks transparency.
Distributors in various areas of the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip do not have access to meters and do
not receive IEC invoices regularly. In the absence of information on electricity charges, many Distributors
do not pay for electricity that has been delivered.
Furthermore, as the PUA does not provide detailed information on purchase price of electricity including
the components of the tariff applied to Distributors in the West Bank and Gaza, the opacity of the invoice
process becomes more acute.
In addition, the interest rate for late payment unilaterally set by the PUA is high and reflects that of a
retail (residential/small commercial) customer rather than that of a wholesale customer represented by the
Palestinian market.
Finally, the Israeli deductions from the clearance revenue are not implemented in a consistent and fully
transparent manner and do not follow clearly agreed upon procedures, and are therefore difficult to
predict. Debts should appear on the invoices and be reconciled with the payments.

The IEC has recently provided important data related to invoices to its Palestinian counterparts, which has
enabled a much stronger reconciliation of net-lending accounts. IEC is now also regularly providing
invoices, which is necessary for payment requirements to be understood. Further institutionalized
regulated and transparent cooperation between the IEC, PUA and PETL is recommended, in order to
improve information and payment flows.

4.3.   Non-Payment from Distributors to the IEC
Between 2010 and 2013, Palestinian electricity Distributors in the West Bank did not pay 37% of their
total bills to IEC and this figure reached 100% in Gaza.
The total contribution of the Top 10+1 (GEDCO) non-payers reached 92%. GEDCO is largest non-payer
accounting for more than 1.7 billion (471 million US$) or 41.8% of the total non-payments to the IEC
between 2009 and 2013 while it only purchased 21% of the total electricity sold by the IEC in 2013.
During the same period, JDECO was the second largest non-payer contributing to more than 1.1 billion
ILS (297 million US$) or 26.3%e of the total IEC non-payments while accounting for around 40% of the
total electricity purchases to the IEC in 2013.
The remaining 9 Distributors between them accounted for 1 billion ILS (271 million US$) or 24% of the
total non-payment. The split between these Distributors is as follows: HEPCO: 7.4%, NEDCO: 7.2%,
Tulkarem municipality: 3.5%, SELCO: 2.8%, Qalqiliya: 1.1%, TEDCO: 1%, Qabatia council: 0.2%, Beit
Awwa village: 0.5%, Beit Ummar: 0.4%.
As mentioned previously, non-payment from GEDCO essentially comprises Net Lending while non-
payment from JDECO mainly includes debts to the IEC. Substantial reduction in non-payment will only
take place by ensuring that measures implemented target these two DISCOs and are tailored to respond to
the specific issues and patterns found in the two utilities.
Non-payment during the period in the Palestinian Territory also constantly and rapidly increased. In 2010,
37% of the total electricity invoiced was not paid and this figure jumped to 58% in 2013.
The level and increase in non-payment can be attributed to a variety of factors as detailed in the report
including losses, collection, tariff and efficiency of Distributors. The study nevertheless showed that non-
payment from the Palestinian Distributors to IEC is not connected to the poverty level of the customers
supplied by these Distributors.


PwC                                                                      Page 55
4.4.    Electricity Losses
Although the level of losses remained the same in the past years, its level is still above acceptable limits.
Distributors do not have proper tools to measure losses and cannot differentiate between technical and
non-technical losses. GEDCO, in particular, does not have the necessary tools to assess the losses on its
grid and it cannot access the meters which would allow for proper measurement and classification of
losses.
Losses in GEDCO and JDECO concession area are reported to reach significantly high levels and should
be dealt with as a priority.
In the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the levels of electricity losses result in significant revenue losses –
these amounted to 726 million ILS. In the West Bank, due to losses, the amounts invoiced to end
customers only cover the cost of purchases from the IEC and do not cover Distributor’s costs such as
operating costs, investments costs, profits or dividends. The amount invoiced for customers in Gaza only
accounts for two thirds of the electricity purchases for the Strip while one third of the purchased quantity
(247 million ILS) was lost either as a technical or non-technical loss.

4.5.    Collection from customers
The overall collection rate in the West Bank and Gaza for the period between 2010 and 2013 is better than
expected but the trend shows that customer payment has consistently been decreasing in the West Bank
and increasing in the Gaza Strip. The increase in payment rate could be attributed to the successful
implementation of an automatic deduction from civil servant salaries for electricity bills in Gaza.
Overall, the Special Areas and the Palestinian Authority are the poorest payers and their performances are
suspected to negatively impact the payment behavior of other customers.
The main reasons attributed to the deterioration of the collection rate in the West Bank can be
summarized as follows:
1. Israeli deductions from the clearance revenue which gives the impression that customer bills are paid
   for by the PA: for example, the collection rate for JDECO dropped to 83% in 2013 following the first
   Israeli deduction to cover parts of the JDECO debts to the IEC.
2. PA introduced incentives for customers committed to pay their bills and for the indebted customers to
   reschedule their debts. As an example JDECO deducted 14 million ILS from committed customers
   since starting this initiative and cancelled 8 million ILS of debt for indebted customers and yet the
   Palestinian Government did not compensate JDECO for these amounts.
3. Unpaid bills from the PA institutions in particular for water pumps. As a result, most of the DISCOs
   are calculating their debts to MOF with the unpaid consumption of the PA institutions and
   compensating themselves. This unilateral settlement between the DISCOs and MOF is not done
   consistently or systematically and is time consuming. The payment by the PA of its electricity
   consumption can raise the collection by 3%-5%.
4. Municipalities do not pay for their bills for municipal services like street lights and water pumping
   bills. Were these to be paid, it would increase the collection by 1.5%-2.5%.
5. The subsidy that is made available for social cases is not repaid by the government to the DISCOs
   which then contribute to a lower collection rate.
6. Low collection from special areas like camps and certain villages. If these could be increased to
   benchmark levels, collection rates would increase by 4%-6%.
7. Quality of the services received from Distributors in the West Bank and Gaza has been severely
   criticized by customers.

4.6.      Tariff
The purchase tariff is set unilaterally by the PUA as a bulk tariff for medium or low voltage. This
purchase tariff appears very high for the nature of the supply relationship, and with payment conditions
that do not reflect this relationship. The purchase tariff is not fully transparency as it includes many
unknown costs.
The Palestinian Authority has been involved in talks with its Israeli counterpart for the past 10 years to
negotiate a commercial agreement. Progress on reaching an agreement has been slow and must be
concluded to give appropriate and clear pricing of electricity sales.74
Starting 2011, PERC has been setting the sales tariff to the Palestinian customers based on a cost plus
approach to cover the cost of electricity purchased from IEC as well as the operational expenses and
acceptable profit margin for Distributors. The methodology stipulated that the tariff would undergo yearly
reviews and amendments to include benchmarks for certain KPIs like losses and operating cost in order to
enhance the efficiency of DISCOs. Unfortunately, the tariff has not been reviewed since its
implementation. Nevertheless, PERC is currently in the process of reviewing the different tariff
components including the impact of removing subsidies and the inclusion of certain financial and quality
KPIs.
The difference between the sales and the purchase tariff, which is the tariff margin, reached 54% after the
new tariff was implemented. When the tariff was first applied, this margin was considered to be sufficient
to cover all the cost of Distributors and estimated to even allow them to earn small profits.
Since then, the tariff margin has decreased in the West Bank going from 54% to 40% between 2010 and
2013 largely due to:
1- The subsidies included in the tariff which are mostly not repaid by the Government; and
2- The high increase of the purchase electricity from IEC.
Distributors did not collect enough to cover all their financial obligations including electricity purchase
and operating costs.
Therefore in order to avoid an increase of sales tariff, PETL should finalize the commercial agreement
with the IEC, PERC should set benchmarks for Distributors to reduce operational expenses and
Distributors should cooperate with relevant electricity authorities to improve their efficiency.
In Gaza, the average purchase tariff from all the sources is nearly equal to the average sales tariff.
GEDCO should review at least its commercial tariff which is currently 20% less than West Bank
commercial tariff.
With the support of the international community, the PA has plans to supply the Gaza Power Plant with
natural gas to reduce the generating cost and to utilize collections from customers to pay for IEC invoices.
In addition to reducing the costs, this action will also enable it to run at full capacity which will then
reduce the power shortages in Gaza.
As mentioned above, in 2011 the PA introduced subsidies amounting to 200 million ILS up to the end of
2013 as part of the tariff. These governmental subsidies were adopted for political reasons essentially to
satisfy customers. Unfortunately due to the weak financial situation of the PA, MOF only repaid 40
million ILS out of the 200 million ILS total. The non-payment of these subsidies created more deficits to
Distributors which often chose to compensate for this cost by reducing their payments to the IEC. The
subsidies outstanding payment (unpaid amounts) represents about 4% of the estimated cost of the
purchase of electricity of West Bank Distributors during the period 2011-2013.



74
   The PA and IEC are willing to reach a commercial agreement, but IEC stated that paying the debt will facilitate the negotiations of the commercial
agreement.

4.7.    Efficiency and transparency of Distributors
According to the Electricity law only licensed Distributors can sell electricity to customers. The law was
implemented in 2009 to compel municipalities to join DISCOs and reach the target of operation of four
efficient DISCOs in the Palestinian Territories, three in the West Bank and one in Gaza. While many
municipalities never joined DISCOs, the existing DISCOs (which built structures to serve complete
regions) remained highly inefficient in the absence of functioning economy of scales. On the other hand
municipalities kept their inefficient structure.
In addition to that Distributors (especially municipalities and village) have opaque financial systems with
unclear payment mechanism and municipalities were reported not to proceed with segregation of
accounts.
DISCOs also appear to be only moderately transparent showing an inability to report properly on their
finances. They are considered to be highly influenced by the internal political environment in which they
operate.
The analysis included in section 3.6 related to the efficiency and transparency of Distributors revealed that
Distributors chose to cover operation costs, investment costs and payments to shareholders before paying
invoices to the IEC which is one of the reasons for the Non-Payment in the West Bank. Distributors were
reported to finance their shareholders through dividends and loans reaching 242 million ILS, although
they did not complete their invoice payments to the IEC.
NEDCO, HEPCO and SELCO, in particular, indicated they use part of the collection and proceed with ad
hoc payments to their municipal shareholders.
Municipalities on the other hand disburse funds collected from electricity sales to cover the payment of
other services such as education health, project finance, rehabilitation projects, etc. All these payments are
categorized under “municipal finance”.
4.8.    Others reasons for non-payment
The analysis of the special area revealed that collection in these areas is usually low, but significant
differences in collection trend and behavior were nevertheless observed identified in these areas. In terms
of absolute figures, the contribution of these areas to non-payment is quite low as they do not cover
extensive areas or large numbers of customers For example; special areas in JDECO (refugee camps) only
represent 21% of JDECO non-payment to IEC in 2013.
Nevertheless, in refugee camps, the consumption per capita reached unprecedented level and losses –
believed to be non-technical - are significantly higher than in the rest of the Palestinian Territories.
Specific issues related to affordability and arrears in these areas were addressed by the PA through
incentive and subsidy for social cases as detailed in section 3.7.2. Unfortunately, the subsidies for social
cases were never paid by the government which negatively impacted the non-payment. Incentives to
refugee camps on the other hand were never implemented due to refusal of refugee customer camps to
pay for their electricity consumption.
The special arrears analyzed in this report (in particular the refugee camps and the old city of Hebron) are
considered to be areas requiring special political attention to address issues related to non-payment. Law
enforcement in these areas is challenging and requires endorsement of the highest authority from the PA
as well as the representatives of these areas.
Distributors in coordination with the PA should nevertheless continue to address these issues, it is crucial
for the utilities to also deal with the problem of public perception through media campaigns and customer
engagement training for their employees
This focus on the special areas should not prevent the Distributors from acting to address non-payment in
all other areas. For example, the JDECO refugee camps only contribute 27% of the total JDECO losses,
meaning that 73% of the losses are actually located within the remaining area of JDECO jurisdiction.

 5.               PA action plans and current donor programs
Introduction
The development and implementation of an inclusive operational and financial action plan by all sector
stakeholders is essential to address the issue of non-payment, losses and reduce “Net Lending” in the
West Bank and Gaza.
This section looks to present and assess the various Palestinian stakeholders’ action plans and the sectorial
activities carried by donor programs to determine the extent to which these plans are addressing or will
address non-payment of electricity and/or reduction of losses. In assessing each action proposed by these
plans, we have also proposed amendments to the actions building on the analysis provided in the previous
sections of this report. A summary of a revised action plan that builds on these actions and activities for
the short, medium and long term is then presented.
It is essential to note that the proposed revised action plan builds on the existing plans of the PA and the
current donor programs. Although anticipated to lead to improvements in payment performance, the
different actions suggested in the revised action plan should be implemented as part of a cohesive broader
plan monitored and regulated by a coordination entity comprising all sector stakeholders. The action plan
recommends the development of the electricity sector through continued institutional reform combined
with legal and regulatory improvements and supported by infrastructure development, particularly to
consolidate and monitor electricity supply and strengthen PENRAs’ capacity to enforce payments.
Finally, the revised action plan builds on conclusions stemming from the analysis in this report and builds
on current strategies and actions implemented by PENRA and the PA supported by the international
donor community.

5.1.         Stakeholders’ existing and planned action plans
The current unstable fiscal situation in the Palestinian Territories has constrained the PA’s abilities to
intensify its actions and policies aimed at significantly reducing Net Lending which represents major
burden on its finances. To reach this objective, with the support of donors, the PA adopted specific
measures to increase collections and reduce debts from customers to Distributors and from Distributors to
IEC.
In 2008 with the support of the World Bank, Norway, and the European Investment Bank, the PA initiated
the “Electric Utility Management Project (EUMP)” with the overall objective of improving the efficiency
and quality of electricity supply in the Palestinian areas through: (i) financing of critical investments for
the strengthening and rehabilitation/ extensions of the transmission and distribution system in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip and (ii) assisting with the implementation of sector reforms, capacity building and
training. The intended outcome of this ongoing project is to contribute to a reduction in the non-payment
issue in West Bank and Gaza. Under this program and with the support of the donor community, the PA
initiated the following institutional and infrastructure developments:

       Establishment of PERC and funding of its startup operation cost for more than 3 years75
       Establishment of PETL and funding of its startup operation up to mid-201575
       Establishment of NEDCO and partial coverage of its 2 years operation cost
       Promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency programs
       Procurement and installation of large numbers of prepaid meters
       Rehabilitation of low voltage and medium voltage electricity network
       Construction of 4 high voltage substations and development of the associated distribution systems.

With the support from the European Union, in 2011, the PA initiated the reform of the electricity sector
including the restructuring of its institution as well as the building of the capacity of its employees.
In addition to these programs and in light of the deteriorating situation in the sector (namely a sharp drop
in payments of electricity bills from Distributors and end-customers), the PA took a set of measures to
expand its control over the sector and increase collection. The following measures were adopted and
implemented in the last 2 years:
      In 2012, the PA (represented by the Prime Minister Dr. Salam Fayyad) agreed with the representatives
       of the refugee camp committees to start a new era of payments from the camps costumers. This
       agreement, detailed in Appendix J was based on incentives for costumers to pay their bills as well as
       penalties for electricity thefts. Nevertheless, following protests by customers outside camps and
       political factions the agreement was not implemented. Protestors had required the agreement to be
       extended from camp customers to all customers. To act in response to this demand, the cabinet
       proposed the implementation of measures to encourage customers to pay for their electricity debts by
       offering incentives to customers who were prepared to commit to paying for their invoices. In 2013,
       an agreement was signed with Distributors and endorsed by the cabinet offering deductions on
       monthly electricity bills to customers with no arrears and deductions on arrears for customers who
       accepted a schedule to settle their arrears. The cost of these deductions was to be covered by the PA in
       the form of subsidy. Although the agreement was implemented it did not have a major impact on the
       reduction of the non-payment.
      In 2012, the Palestinian President ratified an amendment to the Electricity Law to include punitive
       actions for electricity theft. This measure led Palestinian Courts to penalize offenders (i.e.: extract on
       court order from Al Quds newspaper).

      On 9 February 2014, the Government established a Special Committee comprising members of MOF,
       MOLG, MOI, MOE and PENRA to solve the electricity debt issue. On 25 February 2014, following
       recommendations from the Special Committee, the cabinet issued a decision stating that:
       1. All electricity Distributors, within a maximum period of 30 days from the date of issuance of this
           decision, are required to reschedule the reimbursement of their debts to MOF which were
           deducted from the Ministry’s clearing account for the benefit of the IEC.
       2. All electricity Distributors shall commit to pay for their electricity bills received from the IEC
          excluding the allotment corresponding to the governmental subsidy to support the electricity
          sector.
       3. The cabinet is empowered to proceed with lawsuits against representatives of Distributors in the
          case where it has been proven that public money has been compromised.
       4. All benefits and financial aids from the Ministry of Finance and/or any governmental body shall
          be halted to any electricity Distributors failing to abide by the rules and regulations set in this
          decision.
       5. All electricity Distributors are required to provide MOF and PENRA with their IEC billing and
          payment information within 3 business days of receiving the invoice or making payment to IEC.
       6. To ensure the successful implementation of the present agreement, all electricity Distributors must
          apply for a meeting with the special electricity committee, where the committee shall examine the
          status of each Distributor and propose tailored recommendations for approval by the cabinet.
       7. The special electricity committee will perform quarterly reviews of all rules and regulations
          included in this decision and will update and propose amendments to the cabinet whenever
          deemed necessary.
While the cabinet responses attempted to address the issue of non-payment, Palestinian institutions
developed distinct operational actions plans to tackle the issue and proposed specific measures to reduce
the Net Lending. Most of these actions are detailed in their action plans which with the assistance from
the World Bank, were collected from the relevant institutions and are included in Appendix J of the
report.

5.2.       Assessment of Palestinian stakeholder’s existing and planned action plans
To ensure a cohesive approach and understanding of the different measures implemented by the PA, the
actions have been classified in line with the conclusions of the analysis.
The following section lists the different actions implemented by the PA in response to non-payment,
provides a comprehensive description of these actions as well as an assessment detailing the impact of


PwC                                                                                    Page 61
these actions as reported in the top down and bottom up analysis of the report. The section also suggests
future areas of focus to build on these actions.

5.2.1.     Fundamental actions
Establishment of Special Committee comprising members of MOF, MOLG, MOI, MOE and PENRA to
solve the electricity debt issue.
This cabinet decision is one of the most important recent actions from the PA to solve the non-payment
issue. The Special Committee which took office early 2014 has already been very active in proposing
different specific actions to improve payment results, as can be seen from the action list below.
Proposed improvement: Although the Committee had been mandated to make recommendations to the
cabinet on actions to tackle the debt issue, it was strongly recommended that the mandate of this entity to
deal with the issue of non-payment in a cohesive way should be increased further. The Committee should
be empowered to lead all the activities related to non-payment and monitor the implementation of these
activities. It is suggested that the Committee supervises and coordinates with all Palestinian stakeholders
and donor communities the implementation of the revised action plan. In order to ensure the success of
the Committee it is recommended to have a secretariat established to support the committee and perform
daily tasks related to the mandate of the Committee. The expanded roles and responsibilities of the
Committee will need to be developed and agreed with all sector stakeholders. The secretariat could be
supported by the donor community.

5.2.2.     Invoice reconciliation and cycle
Establish a central database between MOF, PETL and Distributors
This web-based database will connect the MOF with all Distributors providing a separate access to
Distributors via secured login information system to enter the following data:
1- Scanned copies of IEC monthly invoices
2- Connection point codes and invoice amounts
3- Scanned copy of payments executed to IEC
4- Cost of electricity sales to PA institutions supplied by Distributors
This database will be linked to the MOF database to enable Distributors to monitor revenues that they are
entitled to from the MOF and follow up on transfers. In addition, PETL will receive copies of monthly
invoices from the IEC for all connection points and will record this data in the database and perform
comparisons with the data entered by Distributors.
This database, currently being developed by USAID through its ICI project, is expected to be operational
by July 2014. It will be an essential tool to monitor non-payment and take rapid corrective actions. A few
challenges as detailed below await the effective operation of this database:
 Sustainability: The database is being designed through a donor funded project expected to terminate
    shortly. The Web-site source code will be delivered to the Ministry of Finance (MOF), hence the
    programing language will available to MOF. Therefore, MOF will be able to make any updates on the
    website after the one year warranty.
 Cooperation: The significance of this database relies exclusively on the full and continuous
    cooperation of all stakeholders including the IEC which should commit to provide PETL with a copy
    of monthly invoices and small villages which might not have the capability to transfer required
    information to the database.
Proposed improvement: It is recommended that with the assistance of the international donor community,
the PA shall guarantee the sustainability of the operation and maintenance of this database by allocating
the specialized personal and funds.




PwC                                                                      Page 62
It is recommended for this database to be connected to the IEC which will require the full cooperation of
the IEC, or to ensure the development of parallel database connecting PETL to the IEC for transfer of data
and information between these entities on invoicing and payments. The on-going USAID-financed ICI
project plans to have a screen for IEC on the website. The Palestinian MOF and PETL will be able to
identify IEC authorities on this website.
In addition, it is recommended to establish a shared services centre to consolidate IT support processes
from all Distributors into a standalone entity serving them back. As part of the consolidation, the
processes should be reengineered and standardized to eliminate costs through economies of scale,
eliminate redundant activities, reduce head count and delivery of high-quality services. The estimated cost
of such a shared service centre is 3.5 million US$; however it is estimated to save about 2 million US$ of
Distributor’s operational costs each year.

5.2.3.     Non-Payment from Distributors to the IEC
Commercial agreement between PETL and IEC
This action is included in both the action plans of the MOF and PENRA. The purpose of this commercial
agreement is to ensure a transparent commercial relationship between PETL, the sole electricity buyer
authorized by law and the IEC. The Palestinian counterpart to the agreement is aiming for a reduced price
(export tariff) and improved payment conditions. The IEC, in return will require payment guarantees
which could be provided through external support.. Currently the IEC only has bilateral supplier to
customer relationships with each connection point owner.
This action is expected to significantly reduce non-payment as it is expected to
 Increase the DISCOs sales tariff margin and increase their ability to pay IEC invoices following the
   expected reduction in the purchase price.
 Secure continuous channel and flow of information with the IEC allowing for better monitoring of
   payments.
 Enhance the payment conditions for PETL which will in turn improve the Palestinian DISCOs
   payment schedule.
Proposed improvement: This action will not only require the cooperation of the relevant IEC stakeholders
including PUA, the IEC and the electricity officer from the Israeli Civil Administration but also the
commitment of PETL to pay IEC invoices and provide guarantees for such commitment. This action
should be monitored by the Special Committee.
International support could be possible to facilitate the negotiations between the Palestinian and Israeli
parties as well as the provision of financial guarantees to the IEC.

Distributors to pay all invoices excluding government subsidies and to report to MOF and PENRA on
IEC invoices and payments within 3 business days of receiving the invoice or making payment to the
IEC.
This cabinet action driven by the Special Committee to solve the debt issue, demonstrates the
governments’ commitment to cutting back non-payment and ensuring that Palestinian financial
obligations towards the IEC are met in due time.
Proposed improvement: While the impact of this action on the reduction of the non-payment is very
promising, its success cannot be ensured as explained below. The action aims to induce Distributors to
pay for their invoices but neglects to address the payment of subsidies. Whereas Distributors could pledge
to pay, the subsidy share excluded from the equation would go unpaid and would add up as debt to the
IEC anticipated to be deducted from the clearance revenue on behalf of the Distributors. According to
anecdotal evidence, this decision seems to have been taken following MOFs’ inability to comply with a
previous cabinet decision requiring the ministry to proceed with the payment of subsidy to Distributors. It


PwC                                                                      Page 63
is recommended that the subsidy component is removed from this action to ensure its successful
implementation.
The action further requires Distributors to report to MOF and PENRA on IEC invoices and payments. The
establishment and maintenance of lasting communication channels for the transmission of information
and reporting from Distributors is essential for proper monitoring of this action and it is recommended
that this responsibility is transferred to the Special Committee rather than only involving MOF and
PENRA.
This action will also need to be complemented by follow up legal actions in cases of non-payment as
described in pillar 4 “legal pillar”. The constant flow of information on payments from the Distributors
will enable the PA to take quick legal actions against offenders and prevent payment of additional fees
resulting from late payment. The analysis of the monthly direct payment data76 from Distributors revealed
that the absence of payment from NEDCO to IEC during the first half of 2013 led the utility to pay
increased fees later in the year to compensate for late payment of invoices.
In light of the current political relations between West Bank and Gaza this action may not realistically
apply to GEDCO for the immediate future.

Legal actions from Cabinet against Distributors not complying with the decision if proven that public
money is compromised.
This action included in the action plans of MOF, MOLG & PENRA is in line with the cabinet decision
“Approving the guarantees of electricity payments” issued in February 2014. The legal actions can lead to
removal of municipal councils or requests to the anticorruption committee to investigate if non-payment
to IEC is considered to be miss financial management and public money is compromised. In such an event
the management of the Distributors can be brought to court.
Renewable Energy
One of the main objectives of the renewable energy projects included in the PENRA action plan is to
diversity the supply of electricity and reduce the amounts purchased from the IEC thereby decreasing the
energy dependence on the IEC.
During the last quarter of 2012 the cabinet approved the Palestinian Renewable Strategy up to 2020. The
strategy aims to generate a total of 240GWh from the different renewable sources through a 2 phased
approach. The first phase will run from 2012 to 2015 while the second phase will extend from 2016 to
2020. Phase I focuses on the promotion of renewable sources, the issuance of relevant regulations and the
implementation of the Palestinian Solar Initiative (PSI) supporting the installation of 5 MW solar power
on rooftops of buildings with 1,000 residential customers during the period 2013-2015. To ensure the
implementation of the PSI initiative PERC issued the first Feed in Tariff (FIT) regulations and the project
was launched early 2013. In the first half of 2013, the private sector expressed interest in installing solar
power systems on rooftops. Unfortunately, shortly after, MOFs’ inability to pay the FIT through DISCOs
caused a major setback to the implementation of the initiative. To overcome this drawback, PERC
proposed to the cabinet that the DISCOs should finance the FIT through their payment in concept of
licensing fees that shall be transferred to MOF to finance PERC. This proposal was unsuccessful as only
two DISCOs are licensed and some even took the initiative to suspend payments to customers.
Nevertheless, a few DISCOs chose to self-finance the initiative in some municipal buildings and public
buildings in camps as an act of social responsibility.
Proposed improvement: A proposal to overcome this setback would be to accelerate the issuance of net
metering regulations and finalize consultations between DISCOs and PENRA on this issue. In addition
soft financing to encourage the energy renewable projects for the private sector similar to the Energy

PwC                                                                       Page 64
Efficiency initiative launched by the AFD 77 could be introduced to support the implementation of
renewable projects.
This action is closely linked to the reduction of non-payment. Therefore to encourage the implementation
of renewable projects it is recommended that:
 PERC/PENRA be encouraged to issue net metering regulations;
 A revolving fund is established to ensure the implementation of small size solar power project in
    public buildings, which could be financed by donors through this fund similarly to the AFD finance of
    the revolving fund for energy efficiency;
 Soft loans mechanisms are developed by Palestinian banks for the private sector to implement small
    size renewable projects; and
 Donors may assist the PA to achieve the objectives set in the renewable strategy by providing the
    necessary financing tools. The implementation of medium or large scale renewable projects by the
    private sector require the generation cost for these projects to be competitive with the IEC purchase
    price. If these prices are higher, it will require subsidy from the MOF or will result in an increase in
    the sales price of electricity to the Palestinian customers.

Energy efficiency measures
This action plan is introduced in the PENRA action plan. PENRA has set indicative targets for energy
efficiency and proposed a 5% saving in the overall end user electricity demand by 2020. To support this
aim, PENRA committed 4 million US$ of AFD funding to launch the second phase of a project to
promote energy efficiency. This included the introduction of a revolving fund for implementing energy
efficiency projects within public buildings and providing subsidized loans (with zero interest) for the
private sector to implement energy efficiency projects, in addition to providing funds to operate a
specialized energy efficiency unit at PENRA.
Energy efficiency projects should reduce amounts of electricity purchased from, as well as the payments
made to the IEC which will contribute to a reduction in non-payments. In addition the revolving fund
introduced for public buildings has proven to be successful as it has reduced the PA’s electricity
consumption invoiced by DISCOs, which in turn has led to a reduction in non-payments from the PA to
DISCOs.
The World Bank has launched a tender to conduct a study aimed at improving PENRA’s understanding of
the Energy Efficiency potential in the West Bank and Gaza. This work will provide an assessment and an
action plan to develop energy efficiency projects in the West Bank and Gaza in the short, medium and
long-term. The action plan will incorporate a roadmap for the development of legal, regulatory,
institutional and capacity-building initiatives to support this action plan.
Proposed improvement: It is nevertheless recommended that a comprehensive assessment of the revolving
fund is performed to examine the possibility of increasing its current funding level and copying the model
to support renewable energy programs.

5.2.4.             Electricity Losses
Legal actions according to the amended electricity law
This action included in the JDECO action plan is in line with the amended electricity law which clearly
classified electricity theft as a crime. JDECO is planning to initiate legal actions against 15,000 customers
accused of stealing electricity or suspected of non-payment. This action is closely linked with the
reduction of non-technical losses which represent a financial burden on all DISCOs and on the reduction
of non-payment.
Proposed improvement: This action will require actual law enforcement

77
     As detailed in Action II.4



PwC                                                                       Page 65
Installation of monitoring meters to measure non-technical losses
Monitoring meters will be fixed adjacent to transformers supplying multiple customers to enable
Distributors to compare the measurements of these meters with the measurements of the meters of the
customers supplied by these same transformers. This technique is already being implemented by JDECO
and enables the utility to identify high losses areas. PENRA is keen to extend this action to the widest
possible area in the West Bank and Gaza by installing an additional 4,000 monitoring meters with the
total cost of 3 million US$.
Proposed improvement: Exposing electricity theft can contribute to a reduction in non-payment if
complemented by measures aimed at cutting these losses such as network inspections, disconnection of
illegal connection and legal penalties.

Rehabilitation of electricity networks
This action developed in PENRA and DISCOs’ action plans includes rehabilitating the network to reduce
technical losses and removing networks considered hazardous for the public. PENRA and DISCOs have
carried out a significant number of rehabilitation projects and intend to continue with this activity to
further eliminate technical losses and remove all dangerous networks.
Proposed improvement: This action is highly related to the reduction of non-payment requiring it to be
monitored with specific KPI’s linked to loss reduction and to “Distributors project financing”. It is
recommended that the rehabilitation of electricity network to be used in the awareness campaign as
examples of PA and donors efforts to reduce Net Lending.

5.2.5.     Collection from customers
Installation of prepaid meters and smart metering systems
This action is introduced in DISCOs and PENRA action plans. Prepaid meters have been largely installed
in the northern and southern areas of West Bank since 2006 and in fewer locations in the central area of
West Bank. In 2013 GEDCO installed 5,000 prepaid meters as pilot project and following the success of
their operation, GEDCO is interested in continuing with further installations.
The installation of prepaid meters assumed to increase the collection, have been creating difficulties for
DISCOs which lack automatic integration systems between their billing systems and the systems of the
various brands of meters. In addition, DISCOs are not inspecting the meters, only recharging customer’s
meter cards in their offices. It is highly recommended that DISCOs are incentivized to inspect and read
the consumption readings of all prepaid meters as they do for postpaid meters.
DISCOs in an effort to reduce the non-technical losses have requested smart meter pilot projects which
can communicate remotely with the DISCOs on customer consumption and behavior.
Proposed improvement: This action, highly related to the reduction of non-payment, should be
accompanied by more frequent measurement and inspection of these meters by DISCOs, as well as a
review of the tariff structure for these meters by PERC. PENRA needs to secure 3 million US$ to finance
prepaid meters for Gaza and West Bank and to implement smart meters pilot projects. An assessment of
the impact of prepaid meters is required before proceeding with the implementation of this work. It will
also be necessary to proceed with a review of the tariff as is suggested in the updated action plan.

Conduct continuous awareness campaigns
This action included in the PENRA, PERC and DISCOs action plans is currently being implemented by
PENRA and PERC who are running donor funded awareness campaigns for energy efficiency and prepaid
meters. No assessment has yet been performed to measure the impact of these campaigns on the targeted
audiences. DISCOs also regularly launch awareness campaigns on electricity theft, energy efficiency, etc.



PwC                                                                     Page 66
PERC and PENRA have developed concepts for new awareness campaigns focusing on renewable
energy, energy efficiency and prevention of electricity theft. The conduct of these campaigns is subject to
donor funding.
Proposed improvement: Awareness campaigns against electricity theft will need to use unconventional
messages and methods to impact the Palestinian population. Looking to tackle this issue by addressing
thieves only will not be sufficient. The campaign will need to illustrate the various effects of electricity
theft including power outages, tariff increases, and even casualties from electrocution following handling
of illegal connections. The awareness campaign should address these issues in an integrated manner using
suitable communication channels, through partnership with private sector, women unions, NGO’s and
governmental institutions. It should be held during a mid-term period and include seminars, workshops,
lectures in schools. Only by utilizing a variety of means will the campaign significantly contribute to the
reduction of non-payment.

5.2.6.             Tariff
Consolidation of connection points into high voltage substations
This action included in PENRAs’ action plan aims to consolidate all collection points into the 4
substations currently being built and intended to be controlled by PETL. This project involves the
construction of associated distribution systems, and will offer the following advantages:
 A reduction in the number of connection points (70% of the connection points in the northern region
   and southern region will be consolidated into the substations in the north and the south and 10
   connection points will be consolidated in the central substations).
 Enable PETL to benefit from a lower purchase price of up to 5% resulting from the shifting to a
   higher voltage.
 Enable PETL to act as a single buyer to the IEC operating under a commercial agreement with IEC.
In addition to the construction of the 4 substations financed by a loan from the EIB, PENRA and PETL
are planning to construct a fifth substation in the central area of West Bank with costs estimated at around
16 million US$. This substation is needed to cover the load growth in the northern area of Ramallah and
replace some of the existing connection points in that area.
Proposed improvement: The construction of the substations is crucial for the development of the
electricity infrastructure in the Palestinian Territories. This improvement can only succeed if associated
with the development of the distribution system associated with these substations to transfer electricity
from the substations to the Palestinian load centers. PENRA is therefore requesting an additional 8 million
US$ to be disbursed from donors to cover the cost of installation of the distribution system and the
procurement of associated goods.
This project is expected to reduce the purchase price of electricity, and this could be further decreased
should a commercial agreement be reached. This reduction is therefore likely to contribute significantly to
the reduction of non-payment by having a sufficient tariff margin and transparent relation with the IEC.
To ensure success in this area it will also be necessary to provide PETL 78 with the required support to
operate the substations. The consolidation of PETL will be a newly founded institution, and as such it is
strongly recommended that technical and financial assistance for its operation is provided to guarantee the
future sustainability of PETL.

5.2.7.              Efficiency and transparency of Distributors
Transfer of electricity services from municipalities to DISCOs to be finalized.

78
     The World Bank is financing starting and operation costs of PETL, but sustainability is not ensured unless PA or other donors step in.




PwC                                                                                                        Page 67
This action included in the action plans of MOLG and PENRA is required by the electricity law. MOLG
observed that to ensure the success of the transfers it was necessary to draw up a compensation
mechanism for municipalities for the cash losses resulting from the transfers. MOLG noted that the
transfer of the electricity services from Nablus and Jenin cities to NEDCO only came after an agreement
between PERC, MOLG and MOF with these municipalities to transfer their electricity services to
NEDCO in exchange of a monthly compensation from the MOF equivalent to 20% of their sales.
It should be noted that the transfer agreement also stipulated that debts from customers to these
municipalities would be collected by NEDCO and later transferred to the municipalities after deducting
NEDCO’s collection expenses.
The establishment of DISCOs crucial for the development of the sector is required by the electricity law.
The law is also expected to influence strongly the payments to DISCOs, as these organizations only deal
with electricity services, and are not influenced by any other services.
Proposed improvement: This action will need to be supplemented by technical assistance to
municipalities to allow them to engage in suitable municipal finance practices and secure other income
generating sources such as license fees, different types of municipal taxes, etc.
In addition the compensation mechanism which has been approved for transferring municipalities needs
to be assessed as its implementation has proven to be extremely costly. It would be necessary to evaluate
the financial impact of the process and search for possible alternative compensation scheme.

Funding for municipal projects to be conditioned on payment of electricity invoices
This action is included in the action plans of the MOF, MOLG and PENRA. It stipulates that all benefits
and financial aids to municipalities from the MOF and/or any other governmental entities shall be
suspended should municipalities refuse to abide by the rules and regulations. Conditioning financing of
projects to IEC payments and reporting is intended to demonstrate to municipalities that the non-payment
of invoices affects the fiscal position of the PA with a manifest impact on the development of the country.
Proposed improvement: Exemption of vital projects related to health and education from this action will
be determined following a transparent assessment process and should then be communicated to all. To
ensure that this happens, it is highly recommended that the Special Committee is asked to monitor the
implementation of this action.
This action which can contribute highly to the reduction of non-payments requires the cooperation and
commitment of all Palestinian institutions as well as the reaching of an agreement with donors and
MOPAD following extensive consultations.

5.2.8.             Others reasons for non-payment
Government to cover the monthly cost of the first 150kWh for social cases registered at MOSA.
The action is included in PENRA’s action plan as well as in MOSA’s plan and is part of the cabinet
decision “Endorsement of MOU between DISCOs and local authorities” issued on 5 March 201379.
MOSA reported multiple obstacles in the implementation of this action resulting from the fact that the
transfer would go from MOF to the different Distributors, due to the following factors:
     The high number of stakeholders impacted by the action and the lack of a detailed comprehensive
        implementation mechanism resulted in multiple discordant interpretations for its application.
     Other fees imposed on social cases by some of the Distributors providing electricity such as
        collecting old debts or street lightening fees. This assistance might not be used to cover the
        electricity cost alone but some other fees requested by the Distributors.


79
     Appendix E point 1.2.



PwC                                                                     Page 68
            To benefit from this assistance social cases should be serviced through prepaid meters. In the
             West Bank, around 10,000 households out of approximately 50,000 social cases households are
             serviced through prepaid meters and can thus benefit from this assistance.
In light of the above, MOSA has requested that the Cabinet modify the mechanism to add 50 ILS to the
monthly cash transfer for MOSA of all social cases. This amendment should enable MOSA to overcome
the obstacles faced implementing the assistance to the social cases. MOSA estimated that the cost of this
mechanism would reach 30,000,000 ILS annually to cover 50,000 social case families in the West Bank.
This action is expected to contribute to the reduction of non-payment as part of the electricity bills from
social cases will be covered by the PA. It is also expected that it will encourage social cases to settle the
remaining amount which they owe.
Proposed improvement: In light of MOSA’s observations concerning the flaws in the mechanism, some
changes could be implemented to improve this action or for it to be replaced it by a more result based
oriented action.
Suggestion 1: update action:
     The current sales tariff values the cost of 150 kWh to equate to around 100 ILS; subsidy to social
        cases is recommended to be 100 ILS rather than 50 ILS as proposed by MOSA. This would cover
        the first 150kWh that the government committed to cover on behalf of these social cases.
     While there is a high risk that MOF delays the subsidy payment to MOSA for social cases, it is
        recommended that DISCOs avoid disconnecting electricity from these cases if the non-payment is
        less than 6 months (i.e. 600 ILS).
     It is recommended that municipalities exempt social cases from street lighting fee payments.
     Installing prepaid meters for social cases, but if sufficient quantities of prepaid meters are not
        available within the different Distributors, then the Distributors shall implement the new
        mechanism until the prepaid meters are available.

Segregation of electricity accounts of municipalities and village councils.
This action included in the MOLG action plan requires municipalities distributing electricity to segregate
their electricity accounts from all other municipal account and to utilize this segregated account solely for
electricity services. MOLG noted that while this action was adopted in 2010 MOLG financial controllers
failed to monitor its implementation and the MOF suspended the transfer of municipal revenues to these
municipalities who then in turn ceased to operate with the segregated accounts principle.
Proposed improvement: This action will hopefully significantly reduce non-payments. With the
implementation of this action, financial controllers will be in a position to report directly to the MOLG
and the MOF on accounts segregation and cash flows related to electricity services.

5.2.9.            To be frozen or canceled
Distributors to reschedule arrears to MOF in line with the deductions
This action was agreed by PA institutions and is included in the action plans of MOF, MOLG and
PENRA. It is in line with the cabinet decision “Approving the guarantees of electricity payments” issued
in February 201480. The mechanism and criteria for rescheduling the arrears is not described, but it is
assumed that it will be made on a case by case basis following discussions between MOF and Distributors
and that it will take into account the amounts of MOF arrears to these Distributors for the supply of
electricity to PA public buildings and services.
The PA is also expected to carefully define the rescheduling of arrears without undermining the
Distributors’ ability to pay for new IEC invoices and operate efficiently.

Proposed improvement: It is highly recommended that the Special Committee in coordination with PERC
proceeds with an analysis of the impact of rescheduling on the Distributors’ arrears. In the meantime the
payments from the Distributors to MOF should be frozen for a period of one year before re-evaluating the
situation.

Distributors to settle arrears through revenue deductions from MOF81
This action included in MOF’s action plan proposes the settlement of Distributor’s debts in West Bank in
return for a reduction in the amounts that the Israeli Ministry of Finance is deducting from these entities
for electricity bills to the IEC. This settlement, which should be transferred from the MOF to these
entities, would be funded from the following revenue sources:
    1- Transportation fees: MOF deducted 69 million ILS for these fees payable to municipalities for
         the period January 2011 to March 2014
    2- Property tax: MOF deducted 72.9 million ILS for the taxes due to municipalities for the period
         January 2011 to March 2014
    3- Profession license fees: MOF deducted 11.3 million ILS for these fees owed to municipalities for
         the period from January 2011 to March 2014
    4- Others: MOF deducted 20.9 million ILS for the period January 2011to March 2014
This action enabled the MOF to compensate up to 173 million ILS for the period from January 2011 to
March 2014 for the lack of collection from municipalities in West Bank. It also served as a tool for the
MOF to pressure municipalities involved in electricity distribution to pay for their IEC bills.
Proposed improvement: The Special Committee in coordination with PERC should analyze the impact of
the debt rescheduling on Distributors. In the meantime and for a period of at least one year, the debt from
the Distributors to MOF should be frozen. In the meantime, MOF should ensure timely payments of
future public services electricity bills to Distributors including the electricity bills of the water wells.
Incentives for customers to pay their debts and 100% of their invoices
This action, included in PENRA action plan, is in line with the cabinet decision “Endorsement of MOU
between DISCOs and local authorities” issued on 5 March 201382.
DISCOs are currently implementing this decision but MOF has not been compensating the utilities
accordingly. The impact of this action on the reduction of the non-payment is perceived to be negative as
DISCOs are compelled to compensate for the loss from their revenues.
Proposed improvement: In the absence of proper compensation from MOF it is recommended that this
action is cancelled.

5.2.10.            New action suggested
Capacity building for PERC and PETL
Various actions in the Action Plan are dependent on the efficiency and capacity of PERC and PETL. It is
therefore recommended that both institutions receive the required assistance to implement these actions.
In addition, it is anticipated that the mandate of PERC and PETL will be extended to the Gaza Strip which
will require additional costs to ensure these institutions operate efficiently in Gaza.
PERC:
   Operational costs including training costs to guarantee the sustainability of the institution,
      especially if the mandate of PERC is extended to cover Gaza.
   Technical Assistance to support with the preparation of the tariff review and benchmarking
      between the different DISCOs.

   Operational costs to guarantee the sustainability of the institution, especially if the mandate of
      PETL is extended to cover Gaza.
   Technical and legal assistance for the commercial agreement with the IEC.
   Assistance to design a proper financial and technical IT system.

5.3.      Conclusion of the assessment and revised action plan
The assessment of the different actions initiated by the PA reveals that all of the factors contributing to
non-payment have been addressed by the different institutional stakeholders in a fragmented manner
during the past years. These actions were nevertheless insufficient to reduce non-payment. The lack of
success of these actions can be explained by internal and external political reasons as well as the fact the
implementation of a few of these actions has recently started and will need time to show results. In
addition, a few actions were found to have insignificant impact, some of them even resulting in increase
in the non-payment; for example the governmental subsidies and incentives.
Concerning political reasons, one of the internal political reasons for the failure of some actions is the lack
of comprehensive approach to non-payment by the PA by different Palestinian stakeholders - PENRA,
MOF, MOLG and MOSA – taking independent actions without prior consultation or coordination
amongst themselves and with other sector stakeholders.
In addition, until recently due to divergent opinions between the PA and some Distributors, there was no
clear policy to compel Distributors to pay their invoices to the IEC before proceeding with the settlement
of other internal expenses. PENRA indicated that following the cabinet decision to create the ministerial
committee to deal with the debt positive signals were received from Distributors agreeing to increase their
payments to the IEC.
The failure of the PA to negotiate the payment of invoices from the refugee camps is also highly
dependent on internal Palestinian politics and requires high level political interventions.
The main external reason affecting the successful implementation of some actions is the slow progress
between Palestinian and Israeli counterparts in reaching a commercial agreement on tariffs.

The suggested action plan developed below builds on the assessment of different action of the PA
mentioned above. The plan proposes a comprehensive approach of the non-payment problem through
propositions related to every cause of non-payment identified in the analysis as follows:
      Invoice reconciliation and cycle
      Non-payment from Distributors to IEC
      Electricity losses
      Collection from customers to Distributors
      Tariff
      Efficiency of Distributors
      Others – Special areas
The updated plan further ranks the actions according to their level of priority (high – medium –low) and
the level of involvement of donors requested for its implementation (financial and non-financial support).
An outline of the suggested plan below summarizes the actions to be implemented according to cause and
priority.

      1. Data gathering
The analysis presented in this report was prepared following an extensive data gathering
process 85 which was made possible by the generous contribution from several Israeli and
Palestinian stakeholders 86 . The data gathering process was carried out using the following
method:



85
    During this data gathering exercise, the authors noted that the IEC did not provide the PA with detailed information related to
deductions, purchase cost and consumption between September 2009 and early 2014. This data was provided to PA in September 2013,
following World Bank intervention. Recommendations to improve information flow between stakeholders is provided later in the report
in the Action plan section (Section 4)

Step 1: Data gathering “Top-down” from Israeli utility, IEC
The World Bank with authorization from PENRA initiated a process of high level discussions
with the Israeli parties including:
 Meetings with the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Israeli Ministry of Finance and IEC.
 Drafting a list of required data from the IEC.
Following these discussions, the IEC agreed to provide the World Bank with the following data
items:
 Monthly deduction made from the clearance revenue on each connection point –i.e. its
    contribution to the Net Lending- from January 2010 up to December 2013 in ILS.
 Direct payments made by each connection point to the IEC to cover the cost of electricity
    purchased or part as from January 2010 up to December 2013 in ILS.
 Outstanding debt owed to the IEC for each connection point as of February 2014 in ILS.
 Yearly consumption in kWh for each connection point for the years 2010, 2011, 2012 and
    2013.
Data on yearly invoiced cost of electricity sold to each connection point was not available
which led the authors of this report to proceed with estimations to complete missing areas of
information.

Step 2: Data gathering from Palestinian Distributors: “Bottom-up approach”
With the assistance of the World Bank, data for the period 2009-2013 was collected from the
following Distributors:
1. DISCOs: JDECO, NEDCO, GEDCO, HEPCO, SELCO and TEDCO.
2. Municipalities and village councils: Tulkarem, Qalqiliya, Yabed, Illar, Bani Naim, Salfit,
    Jayyus, Sa’ier, Tarqumia, Beit Awwa and Ithna.
The data collected from these Distributors included:
 Monthly IEC data from 01/2009 to 12/2013 on: purchase from the IEC in ILS and kWh,
   payments to the IEC in ILS and outstanding debt owed to the IEC in ILS.
 Annual Customer category data from 2009 to 2013 on: number of customers per category,
   sales per customer category in ILS and kWh, and outstanding debt.
 Data for special areas of low collection and/or high losses.
 Data outlining losses for the period 2009-2013.
 Governmental subsidy data.
 Data on low consumption customers.
The municipalities and village councils of Salfit, Jayyus, Sa’ier, Tarqumia, Beit Awwa and
Ithna did not respond to the requests and did not provide any data87.
The remaining municipalities and village councils provided only partial data claiming that the
requested data could not be extracted from their billing system in the required format.
DISCOs provided most of the data requested with the exception of GEDCO who could not
provide information on purchase data from the IEC as it had not received IEC bills. Finally data
received from SELCO was not utilized in the report as it appeared to contain a certain number
of inconsistencies.
The data received from both the IEC and different Palestinian stakeholders was crossed
checked to ensure the robustness of both sets of data. After a few reviews and the receipt of
updated data from stakeholders, no further serious discrepancies were uncovered.

Step 3: Collection of action plans on means to improve non-payments of electricity
services and reduce Net Lending from the Palestinian institutions
Action plans from Palestinian Institutions involved in the sector were collected, including:
PENRA, PERC, MOF, MOLG and MOSA. The content of these actions plans and proposed
updates were discussed with stakeholders during follow up meetings.

Step 4: Administration of 1038 customer survey questionnaire to electricity customers
A customer survey and focus groups were conducted in areas with the highest levels of non-
payment of electricity bills to collect detailed information on the nature and reasons of
customers’ non-payment to their electricity providers in West Bank and Gaza. Activities
completed included:
• Focus groups: Three focus group meetings were held (One in the North of the West Bank,
    one in the South of the West Bank, and one in the Gaza strip).
•     Subscribers’ questionnaire: A questionnaire was prepared to collect data on the socio-
      economic profiles of subscribers, subscribers’ utilities and obligations, electricity usage and
      consumption, and efficiency of electricity providers. The survey was initially piloted with
      35 customers to ensure its clarity and robustness.
•     Survey: The survey covered a representative household of Palestinian customers in areas
      with high level of non-payment.

      2. Data analysis
             a. High level data analysis
Following the completion of the information and data collection phase, preliminary high level
analysis began to identify the areas and connection points with high non-payment behavior. The
analysis was based on clear KPIs such as consumption cost, payment to the IEC, collection
rate, outstanding debt to the IEC for electricity purchases and high losses.
Finally, a comparison of the information and data received from the different Palestinian
electricity Distributors and stakeholders with the data received from the IEC was carried out to
cross check and highlight any discrepancies.

              b. Customers survey analysis
Following completion and collection of the questionnaires, a process of coding and data entry
with SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) software was used to reflect and illustrate
the customers’ answers. Descriptive statistics such as cross tabulations were employed to
measure the relationships between certain variables and to develop a better understanding of the
reasons for non-payment for electricity services.

      3. Identifying external factors
A desk review of previous studies, published information, and other data and information on
micro-economic factors affecting the Net Lending was performed. This included specific data,
research and documents from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics library.
Finally, the survey questionnaire included questions which could provide insights on micro-
economic factors affecting the Net Lending. These questions were related mainly to pricing of
alternative energy sources, affordability of electricity, household income and poverty, and
regularity of payment of salaries.

      4. Strategies and action plan
             a. Assessing PA’s existing and planned strategies
The Palestinian stakeholders’ action plans and the sectorial activities carried by donor were also
assessed to determine the extent to which these plans are addressing or will address non-
payment of electricity or reduction of losses. Each action was individually assessed and
proposed amendments to each specific action have been suggested based on the analysis from
the collected data.
             b. Revised Action Plan
Following the completion of the above activities, a summary of the key actions were set out in
an overall action plan, for execution over three distinct time periods:
    1- Short term actions (< 12 months)
    2- Medium term actions (12 to 36 months)
    3- Long term actions (> 36 months)

Appendix F Payment flow to the IEC

Palestinian Distributors behave in three ways after receiving monthly electricity bills from IEC
(see diagram 3): (i) they pay in full the total amount; (ii) they pay part of the bill; or (iii) they
do not pay the bill at all. If partial or no payment is made then the IEC either deducts the unpaid
amount or part of it from the Clearance revenue or registers the remaining amounts as debt on
the connection point.

From the IEC’s perspective, the payment on each of the connection points is done through
direct payment from the connection point owner and through the transferred amount from the
Clearance revenue, which has been deducted by the Israeli Ministry of Finance (“Net lending”).
The diagram below illustrates the flow of payments for IEC through two main channels:
1. Direct channel: payments are made directly by the owner of the connection point
   (DISCOs, Municipality, Village council and private sector) to an IEC bank account at Cairo
   Amman Bank. A small number of connection point owners pay directly to IEC offices with
   checks or cash.
2. Indirect channel: payments are made through deductions from the Clearance revenue by
   the Israeli Ministry of Finance (Net Lending). The IEC informs the Israeli Ministry of
   Finance of the amounts due by Palestinian electricity Distributors. The Israeli Ministry of
   Finance deducts these amounts from PA’s clearance revenues and transfers the funds to the
   IEC.

The Chart shows that in 2013, the Palestinian electricity Distributors accumulated debt to IEC reached 715 million ILS                                                 (193 million US$ equivalent).
The Chart clearly shows that the cost of purchased electricity has increased between 2010 and 2013 by 62%. It also reveals that up to 2012 direct payments
from Palestinian Distributors were gradually increasing although they never reached the level of the actual cost of purchase electricity. In 2013, the direct
payment decreased by 178 million ILS (48 million US$ equivalent). Some sector stakeholders believe that this decrease was the result of the substantial
amount (1,079 million ISL - 292 million US$ equivalent) which was deducted by the Israeli Ministry of Finance from the clearance revenue for the benefit of
the IEC and which led the people to believe that their unpaid bills could be taken care of by the Palestinian Authority.

The Chart finally clarifies that deductions by the Israeli Authorities through the Clearance revenue is not systematic or regular. Net Lending figures vary
throughout the years between 2010 and 2013 and not clear pattern can be found.
Analyzing the yearly figures in the Chart shows that in 2010 the payment received by the IEC (direct payment and the Net Lending) exceeded the estimated
cost of the purchased electricity by 45 million ILS. This indicated that during that year, funds were transferred to the IEC through the clearance mechanism to
compensate for what is believed to be part of the pre 2010 debt. In 2010 the Net Lending represented 37% of the estimated cost of purchased electricity and
there was no accumulated debt from the previous year, therefore, the 37% is also the percentage of total non-payment for 2010. The non-payment in 2010
totaled 545 million ILS.
In 2011, IEC recovered 487 million ILS (132 million US$ equivalent) of non-paid amounts by Palestinian Electricity Distributors through Net Lending
(representing 29% of estimated cost of purchased electricity). However, the IEC still had 171 million ILS of outstanding debt from Palestinian electricity
providers, which carried over the following year. In 2011 the Net Lending represented 29% of the estimated cost of purchased electricity and the added debt
represented 10% of the estimated cost of purchased electricity; therefore the non-payment in 2011 was 39% of the estimated cost of the purchased electricity,
which equates to 658 million ILS. The estimated cost of purchased electricity in 2011 increased by 14% compared to 2010.
In 2012 the payment received by the IEC (direct payment and the Net Lending) exceeded the estimated cost of the purchased electricity by 43 million ILS
which meant a reduction of the accumulated debt to the IEC by this amount. In 2012 the Net Lending represented 49% of the estimated cost of purchased
electricity. This percentage is considered as the non-payment percentage as no additional debt was added that year. The non-payment in 2012 was equal to
1,180 million ILS. Based on these values, the non-payment increased by 10% in 2012 compared to 2011 and by 12% compared to 2010. The estimated cost of
purchased electricity increased by 31% compared to 2011 and by 49% compared to 2010.
In 2013 the payment received by the IEC (direct payment and the Net Lending) was 1,694 million ILS. This was 715 million ILS less than the estimated cost
of the purchased electricity which meant that the debt to the IEC increased by this amount. In 2013 the Net Lending represented 29% of the estimated cost of
purchased electricity and the added debt represented 30% of the estimated cost of purchased electricity therefore the non-payment in 2013 was 58% of the
estimated cost of the purchased electricity and is equal to 1,406 million ILS. This shows that non-payment increased by 10% in 2013 compared to 2012 and by
12% compared to 2011. The estimated cost of purchased electricity increased by 9% compared to 2012.

Appendix H: Customer survey and focus group –profile of respondents

The study's respondents were chosen from areas with the highest levels of electricity bill non-
payment. In the West Bank, 615 questionnaires were administered in 103 localities within 11
governorates while in the Gaza Strip, 423 questionnaires were administered in 23 localities
within 5 governorates.
The criteria for selecting the sample were as follows:
1- Jurisdictions where high level data collection and analysis was performed
2- For JDECO area: survey areas with losses above 30%
3- Coverage of all refugee camps within DISCOs.
4- Coverage of all major cities
5- All Distributors supplying more than one city, village or camp to be included in the survey

In the West Bank: Hebron, Jerusalem and Ramallah/Al-Bireh included the bulk of the
respondents, slightly more than 62%. 58 localities were covered in the West Bank: 11 localities
for Hebron, 36 for Ramallah/Al-Bireh and 11 for Jerusalem.
In the Gaza Strip: Gaza, North Gaza, and Deir Al Balah governorates represented 72.58% of
the respondents. 14 localities were covered (3 in Gaza, 5 in North Gaza, and 6 in Khan Yunis)
out of a total of 23 Gaza Strip localities.
The study also recorded the demographic profiles of Palestinian respondents. The criteria
consisted of age, education level, employment status and sector, number of household
members, and working household members, as well as the average monthly income at a
household level. The completed profiles of the study respondents can be summarized as
follows:
     West Bank respondents: 38.14 years on average with secondary education level 97 .
      Bethlehem, Tubas and Ramallah/Al-Bireh governorates displayed the highest average
      education levels while Nablus, Qalqiliya, and Tulkarem showed the lowest.
     Gaza Strip respondents: 45.07 years on average with primary and secondary education
      levels with only slight variations between governorates98.
West Bank respondents are more likely to be active in the labor market than Gaza Strip
respondents. West Bank respondents showed a higher propensity to be employed in the private
sector or self-employed while Gaza Strip respondents tended to be unemployed or retired, and
thus, less active in the labor force.
West Bank respondents have on average 5.86 members per household, with an average of 1.43
employed. In the Gaza Strip, this figure rises to 7.34 persons per household with only 0.78
employed or working.
The information related to the profile of the respondent could explain some of the answers
received and needs to be taken into consideration when suggesting possible future actions to
increase the collection rate from customers. It is reasonable to believe that the behavior of
customers varies according to age, employment situation and number of household members.
Specific media campaigns addressing the customer non-payment issue should be tailored to
address the different population categories, and look to mainly target the most commonly found
customer profile.

Appendix J: Palestinian stakeholders action plans


1. Palestinian Authority (PA) Decisions

1.1.    “Camps agreement” issued on December 30, 2012 between the Prime Minister
and the Representative Committees of camps
Late 2012 the Palestinian government approved a decision known as the “ Camps agreement”
in which the government addressed electricity debts of refugees’ camps. The decision proposes
incentives for customers to pay their bills as well as penalties for electricity thefts. This
agreement can be summarized as follows:

          All arrears of customers who agree to pay for their actual and upcoming electricity bills
           will be cancelled;
          Tariff for the first 150 KWh for residential customers will be at cost;
          Utilities will cover electricity bills of some public institutions in the camps.
          The electricity tariff in the camps will be aligned with the tariff for regular customers
          Camp representatives in collaboration with MOSA will review all social cases in the
           camps
          PENRA will provide utilities with performing equipment and goods to rehabilitate the
           electricity networks in the camps.
          Utilities will install prepaid meters for customers
          If more than one customer is connected to the same meter they will be separated and the
           utility will install a prepaid meter for each customer at no cost.

1.2.  Cabinet Decision Number (‫ﻑ‬.‫ﺱ‬/‫ﻭ‬.‫ﻡ‬/45/54/70) of 2013 issued on 5 March 2013
“Endorsement of MoU between DISCOs and local authorities”
This decision concerns electricity debts related to local authorities and DISCOs. The decision
offers incentives for customers to pay their bills and penalties for electricity thefts.
     Any customer committed to pay his invoice will be rewarded with a 10% deduction on
         his monthly invoice. This deduction will be subsidies by the government.
     Any indebted customer who pays an additional 10% to his bill to reimburse his debt
         will be offered a 10% cancellation to his debt. This cancellation will be subsidies by the
         government.
     The Government will cover the monthly cost of the first 150kWh for social cases
         registered at MOSA.

1.3.   Cabinet decision “formulation of special committee to follow up the electricity
debts number (‫ﺡ‬.‫ﺭ‬/‫ﻭ‬.‫ﺭ‬/40/70)”
The Cabinet on 9 February 2014 established a special committee to handle the electricity debts.
This committee chaired by PENRA and includes members from MOI, MOLG, MOE and MOF
is responsible for proposing to the Prime Minister recommendations on solving the electricity
debt issues.

1.4.       Cabinet decision “Approving the guarantees of electricity payments”
On 25 of February 2014 the Cabinet took the decision (‫ﺡ‬7‫ﺭ‬/         /17/21/56) “Approving the
                                                                 ‫ﻭ‬7‫ﻡ‬
Guarantees of Electricity Payments”, which states the following:

       8. All electricity distributing entities have to and within a maximum of 30 days from the
          date of the issuance of this decision: reschedule all debts due on them for the Ministry
PwC                                                                        Page 107
         of Finance which is resulted from the electricity deduction from the Ministry’s clearing
         account to the IEC.
      9. All electricity distributing entities have to shall commit to paying all of the IEC bill
         deducted of it the government’s support percentage of the monthly electricity bill which
         is approved by the government to support the electricity sector.
      10. The cabinet and in accordance with the recommendations of the electricity Special
          Committee, have the right to take all legal actions against the representatives of any
          electricity distributing entity in the case where it has been proven that the public money
          has been compromised.
      11. All benefits and financial aids from the Ministry of Finance and/or any governmental
          body shall be halted to any electricity distributing entity not abiding by the rules and
          regulations set in this decision.
      12. All electricity distributing entities have to supply the Ministry of Finance and the
          Palestinian Natural Resources Authority with the supporting documents to pay any
          amounts due from them to the IEC in a date maximum of 3 working days from the date
          of payment.
      13. Any electricity distributing entity and to enforce its ability to carry out the rules and
          regulations of this decision, has to apply for a meeting with the special electricity
          committee, where the committee shall study the case of the distributing entity and
          submits recommendation for each case separately to the ministers cabinet; and the
          cabinet will decide on the case.
      14. The special electricity committee has to review all the rules and regulations of this
          decision every three months and has to give recommendations about it for the minister’s
          cabinet.
      15. Any rules and regulations going against this decision shall be cancelled.

2. Ministry of Finance action plan
The MOF in cooperation with all relevant Palestinian stakeholders is working towards
increasing level of payments to IEC and reducing the Net Lending by taking the following
measures:
1- MOF is member of the ministerial committee that is working on following up the electricity
   debts.
2- MOF is currently working on establishing an interactive data base to include
   comprehensive information on Net Lending where this database will be connected with the
   MOF financial system and managed by MOF to ensure sustainability where information
   will be gathered from municipalities, PENRA, DISCOS, PETL, and IEC. This data base
   should be able to provide us with all missing and needed information that is needed to have
   a clear picture about the Net Lending situation, the database is supposed to be ready by July
   2014. MOF will consult the relevant international partners (including the World Bank) to
   get feedback about the structure and functions of this database.
3- MOF is following up with the GoI through the Palestinian- Israeli joint committee to get
   full detailed information about the deductions from the clearance against electricity and
   health. This information will be validated with relative PA institution and will be used in
   the data base.
4- The council of ministries has recently issued a decree about the settlement of the electricity
   debt by the relevant utilities, Distributors, where MOF is involved in following up this
   decree to ensure its implementation, while doing so MOF is working with different
   institutions to study the financial effect of the different government decisions about the
PwC                                                                        Page 108
      electricity subsidies. Besides that MOF will continue its pressure on municipalities to
      reschedule and reconcile the dent to MOF and will consider some measurements to
      encourage municipalities to do so.

MOF has provided data concerning the settlements that is done between MOF and the various
municipalities, DISCOs and village councils in West Bank in exchange of the reduction that
Israeli Ministry of Finance is doing on these entities electricity bills to IEC. The settlement is
made on four different revenue sources which should be transferred from MOF to these entities,
as follows:
      5- Transportation fees: MOF has deducted 69 million ILS in the period January 2011-
         March 2014
      6- Property tax: MOF has deducted 72.9 million ILS in the period January 2011-March
         2014
      7- Profession license fees: MOF has deducted 11.3 million ILS in the period January
         2011-March 2014
      8- Others: MOF has deducted 20.9 million ILS in the period January 2011-March 2014

This indicates that MOF could only collect back from the different electricity Distributors an
amount of 173 million ILS in the period January 2011-March 2014.

3. Ministry of Local Government action plan
 The MOLG efforts to reduce the Net Lending focus on two areas:

    1- Improve collections in the local councils and increase their payments to IEC.
    2- Assist in the process of establishing DISCOs with actions to encourage local councils to
         join electricity distribution companies.
 To improve the collection and the payment to IEC from the local authorities, MOLG is taking
 the following actions:

        Ordering the local councils to separate the electricity financial accounts from other
         accounts and to exclusively disburse from this account to pay for electricity services.
         The account being under the responsibility of the electricity department. This order has
         been valid and operational since 2009;
       Placing financial supervisors at local councils who did not follow this order to ensure
         its execution;
       Monitoring the commitment of the local councils to settle electricity payments, issue
         monthly payment statements and send these statements to the directorates of the Local
         Governments;
       Instructing MOF to pay transportation expenses only to local councils who settle the
         payment of at least 10 monthly bills of electricity a year. MOF has engaged to commit
         to this instruction;
       Encouraging the local councils to install prepaid meters to improve their electricity
         collections, to issue self-financed bids, and to follow up on this matter with PENRA to
         secure the supply of prepaid meters to the local councils;
       Dissolving municipal councils who did not commit to pay their electrical bills to the
         supplier, and assigning Special Committees from the public sector to manage these
         municipalities;
      1. Circulating tariff decisions and supervising their implementation through MOLG
         supervision teams;
      2. Auditing the unpaid electricity while performing assurance on the payment slips;
PwC                                                                      Page 109
      3. Requesting the local councils to propose electricity debt payment schedules and in
         cooperation with MOF, monitoring their commitment to this schedule;
      4. Linking local councils projects to the electricity debt payment and releasing the project
         funds upon clearance from MOF on the approved settlement of these payments;
      5. Binding the local councils to schedule their subscribers debts through the prepaid
         meters to improve the collection and enable them to pay their monthly supplies bills
         and their scheduled debts;
      6. Rejecting approvals of budgets of councils who have not initiated a debt scheduling
         scheme.


While to support the transfer of the electricity service from the local authorities to DISCOs,
MOLG is taking the following actions:
  Requesting the local councils to transfer their electricity services to DISCOs as
      stipulated in the general electricity law;
  In cooperation with PENRA, promoting the integration of local councils electricity
      services to DISCOs in workshops;
  Facilitating and accelerating the transfer of electricity services from the local councils
      to DISCOs;
  Signing of numerous special agreements with relevant governmental bodies (MOF,
      PENRA, Organizing and Local Governance Council)to transfer the electricity services
      from the local councils to DISCOs;
  Encouraging the local councils to join DISCOs by performing a financial analysis
      measuring the impact of the transfer of the electricity distribution services from the
      local councils to DISCOs;
  MOLG assisted with the transfer of the electricity department employees from the local
      councils to DISCOs such as Nablus and Jenin electricity services to NEDCO;
  MOLG followed up on the matter of the local councils that have joined the distribution
      companies getting their compensations due from the MOF, though the MOF did not
      commit to paying the due amounts which led to a decline in the local council’s desire in
      joining the distribution companies.

4. Ministry of Social Affairs action plan
MOSA actions in the West Bank essentially consist of ensuring the implementation of Cabinet
decision dated 5 March 2013 related to the endorsement of MoU between the local authorities
and DISCOs (ref: 3.5.2 bullet point 3: The Government will cover the monthly cost of the first
150kWh for social cases registered at MOSA). The implementation of this decision has faced
multiple obstacles due to factors as listed below:

         High number of stakeholders involved suggesting different interpretations and
          implementation mechanisms for the decision.
         The number of local councils receiving electricity through local cooperative
          associations which are reluctant to cooperate on this decision.
         Other fees imposed by some of the Distributors that distribute electricity such as
          collecting old debts or street lightening fees.
         A number of local councils officially informed the Ministry of their refusal to
          implement the decision as they collect other services fees through the electricity bills.
         To benefit from this assistance social cases should have prepaid meters installed.
          Unfortunately, only around 10,000 households out of approximately 50,000 social cases
PwC                                                                       Page 110
          families in the West Bank have pre-aid meters and could thus benefit from this
          assistance.

In light of the above, MOSA has requested the Cabinet to modify the mechanism to add 50 ILS
to the monthly cash transfer for MOSA beneficiaries who have prepaid meter installed. This
amendment should enable MOSA to extend the electricity support to all households with pre-
paid meters in West Bank cities, villages and refugee camps. MOSA estimated the cost of this
mechanism to reach 30,000,000 ILS annually to cover 50,000 social cases families in the West
Bank.

MOSA reported that the current mechanism is only implemented by three DISCOs who have
not yet been compensated by MOF as shown in the table below

                    DISCOs implementing assistance to social cases in the West Bank
DISCO                              Number of benefited cases                     Cost ILS

TEDCO                                                           1984                         2,338,547

SELCO                                                           3805                         4,638,260

Total                                                          8,759                        10,541,452
The above table shows that the average monthly payment for each social case is 100 ILS (not
50ILS as proposed by MOSA).

5. Palestinian Electricity Regulation Council (PERC) action plan
PERC action plan to reduce the Net Lending is summarized below.

      Government’s role
      1- Government to pay all its financial commitments to the Distributors
      2- To limit the government subsidy to social case


      PERC’s role
      1- Continue monitoring the performance of the electricity Distributors according to PERC
         approved KPIs
      2- Review the tariff methodology and subsidy decisions
      3- Follow up with DISCOs on action plan to reduce losses and increase collection, and
         consider the investment required within the tariff.
      4- Cooperate with all stakeholders to implement the Cabinet decisions and the creation of
         electricity database within the PA institutions.
      5- Attempts to include GEDCO within the work of PERC and start implementing PERC
         regulations in Gaza.
      6- Cooperate with MOSA to determine the proper basis for including social cases in the
         Governmental subsidies including the refugee camps.
      7- Cooperate with all stakeholders to complete the establishment of DISCOs in the north
         and south.
      8- In cooperation with all DISCOs, implement a media awareness campaign against the
         electricity theft.
      9- Cooperate with relevant parties, especially judiciary parties to fight against electricity
         theft.

Clearance mechanism Mechanism through which indirect taxes are collected by Israel on behalf of the
“Maqasa”            PA and normally refunded via clearance procedures which were agreed in the
                    1994 Oslo accords (Protocol of Economic Relations also called the ‘Paris
                    Protocol’2).
Net Lending                       For the purpose of this engagement Net Lending refers to the indirect payment
                                  made by the PA to IEC through deductions by the Israeli Ministry of Finance on
                                  clearance revenues collected on behalf of the PA. These deductions are made to
                                  cover portion of the unpaid electricity bills from Palestinian electricity
                                  Distributors.
Debt/outstanding debt Open payments for all connection points in the West Bank and Gaza to IEC for the
                      purchase of electricity which has not been paid by the connection point owner or
                      covered by the Net Lending

                                                  Executive Summary
Non-Payment for Electricity Services in the Palestinian Territories
1.    The Palestinian Territories (West Bank and Gaza Strip) are highly dependent on energy imports
      from neighboring countries due to the lack of domestic energy resources. The Palestinian Territories
      consumed 5,430 GWh of electricity as of 2013 (1,581 GWh in the Gaza Strip and 3,849 GWh in the
      West Bank). The Israeli Electricity Corporation (IEC) is the largest supplier of electricity providing
      the Territories with around 88% of its total electricity consumption. In 2013, 4,778 GWh were
      imported from IEC amounting to 2.4 billion ILS (US$ 660 million).
2.    In this context, the Palestinian Authority (PA) -with support from the international community- has
      been actively engaged in a comprehensive reform of the electricity sector to increase its overall
      efficiency for the benefit of the Palestinian population. The commitment and involvement of all
      stakeholders in this extensive restructuring has resulted in the creation of a well-structured electricity
      market. Additionally, the international community has been facilitating the strengthening,
      rehabilitation and extension of the transmission and distribution systems in order for the PA to be
      able to meet the growing demand for electricity in the Palestinian Territories.
3.    Alongside the steady increase in electricity consumption, non-payment for electricity imported from
      the IEC has increased over the past few years, amounting to 58% of its total cost (equivalent to
      1,407 million ILS or US$ 381.3 million in 2013). Non-payment of IEC’s electricity bills by
      Palestinian electricity distributors, including municipalities, village councils and Distribution
      Companies (DISCOs) remains a key challenge to the electricity sector and to the overall fiscal
      position of the PA. Outstanding payments owed to the IEC are either (i) deducted from the PA’s
      clearance revenues by the Israeli Ministry of Finance and registered as “Net lending3” or (ii) are
      accumulated as debt owed to the IEC.
4.    Net lending reduced the PA’s available revenues by an estimated 1 billion ILS in 2012 (US$ 280
      million), representing 13.5% of the PA’s total revenues. The IEC only recovered part of the n on-paid
      bills by Palestinian electricity distributors through Net lending, which led the outstanding debt to
      grow over the years reaching a total of 1.172 billion ILS (US$ 330 million) as of February 2014.
      Even if a settlement of this historic debt is agreed upon by Palestinian and Israel stakeholders,
      additional debt would continue to accumulate in the future unless decisive actions are taken to
      address the underlying issues of non-payment for electricity services in the Palestinian Territories.
5.    More recently, to complement the electricity sector reform, the Palestinian Energy and Natural
      Resources Authority (PENRA) initiated several measures specially targeted at reducing electricity
      non-payment. These measures include amendments to the Electricity Law covering punitive actions
      for electricity theft. While the initiatives introduced by PENRA may have a positive effect, a
      cohesive strategy is required to successfully deal with this problem.
6.    This assessment aims to more precisely understand the sources and reasons for non-payment of
      electricity in the Palestinian Territories and to develop an action plan based on current programs and

Results of the assessment
7.    To present a comprehensive overview, the report has assessed the impact of non-payment for
      electricity services throughout the complete financial payment cycle as follows:
        a. IEC’s invoice cycle:

        There are no procedures for the invoicing of electricity from the IEC to the Palestinian
        distributors. The current process is not harmonized for all electricity distributors and lacks
        transparency. Distributors in various areas of the West Bank and Gaza do not have access to
        meters located in area C in the West Bank, and meters near the borders between Gaza and Israel.
        Further, some electricity distributors claim that they do not receive IEC’s invoices on regular
        basis, which results in them not paying their bills.
        Any late payment leads to the addition of a late payment fee or an added interest. Interest rates for
        late payment are set unilaterally by the Israeli Public Utility Authority (PUA) and are high
        compared to commercial interest rates in both the Israeli and the Palestinian markets.
        While Israeli deductions from the clearance revenues collected on behalf of the PA are not
        implemented in a transparent manner, some progress has recently been recorded. IEC, for
        example, provided PENRA and the World Bank with critical data and information to complete
        this assessment. Since then, the Palestinian Electricity Transmission Company Ltd. (PETL) stated
        that IEC has been sending regularly their invoices. This process should lead to an
        institutionalized, regulated and transparent cooperation between the IEC, PUA and PETL.

        b. Non-payment by Palestinian electricity distributors to the IEC:

        In the period 2010 to 2013, Palestinian electricity distributors in the West Bank did not pay 37%
        of their bills to the IEC. During the same period, non-payment reached 100% in Gaza.
        The Top 10+1 group of non-payers, which included the largest ten non-payers in the West Bank
        and the Gaza Electricity Distribution Company (GEDCO), represented 92% of the total non-
        payment of Palestinian electricity distributors to IEC.
        GEDCO was the single largest non-payer, accounting for more than 1.7 billion (US$ 471 million)
        or 41.8% of the total non-payments to the IEC from 2009 to 2013. During the same period,
        JDECO was the second largest non-payer contributing to more than 1.1 billion ILS (US$ 297
        million) or 26.3% of the total IEC non-payments.

        c. Electricity Losses:

        Electricity losses were high and steady at 23-30% between 2010 and 2013. Distributors did not
        have proper tools to measure losses and could not differentiate between technical and non-
        technical losses. GEDCO, in particular, did not have the necessary tools to assess its losses and
        could not access the meters required for an appropriate measurement and categorization of losses.
        Losses in GEDCO and JDECO concession areas were reported to reach very high levels and
        should be dealt with as a priority.
        In 2013, electricity losses caused significant revenue loss to Palestinian distributors – estimated at
        726 million ILS (US$ 201 million). Due to high electricity losses, revenues from invoiced
        amounts to end customers in the West Bank were only able to cover the cost of electricity
        purchased from the IEC and did not cover the electricity distributor’s operating and investment
        costs. The amount invoiced to customers in Gaza only accounted for two thirds of the electricity
        purchases for the whole Gaza Strip while one third of the purchased quantity (247 million ILS)
        was lost either as a technical or a non-technical loss.

             d. Collection from customers:

             The overall bill collection rate from end customers in the West Bank and Gaza for the period
             2010-2013 was better than expected, but customer payment has consistently been decreasing in
             the West Bank and increasing in the Gaza Strip. The increase of payment in Gaza can perhaps be
             attributed to a program to roll-out pre-paid meters across Gaza and the successful implementation
             of an automatic electricity bill deduction from civil servant salaries.
             Overall, Special areas such as refugee camps, i.e. areas with low collection rates and high
             electricity losses, and institutions of the Palestinian Authority are the poorest payers. Their poor
             payment performance is also claimed to negatively impact the payment behavior of other
             customers.
             The main reasons attributed to the deterioration of the collection rate in the West Bank can be
             summarized as follows:
                  Israeli deductions from the clearance revenue, e.g. November 2012, give the impression that
                   customer bills are and will be paid for by the PA.
                  PA introduced incentives for customers committed to pay their bills and for the indebted
                   customers to reschedule their debts. As an example JDECO deducted 14 million ILS from
                   committed customers since starting this initiative and cancelled 8 million ILS of debt for
                   indebted customers. However, the Palestinian Government did not compensate JDECO for
                   these amounts. Also, the Israeli deductions from clearance revenue in November 2012 and
                   PA’s measures for indebted customers created a disincentive for committed cu stomers, which
                   resulted in a significant decrease in JDECO’s collection rate from 96% in 2012 to 83% in
                   2013.
                  Unpaid bills from PA institutions, in particular for water pumping, resulted in most of the
                   electricity distributors unilaterally settling their debts4 to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) from
                   the unpaid consumption of the PA institutions. This unilateral settlement between the
                   DISCOs and MOF was not done consistently or systematically and was time consuming. If
                   PA institutions would pay for their electricity consumption, collection rates could increase by
                   3-5%.
                  Municipalities are not paying for their bills for services such as street lighting and water
                   pumping. If municipalities would pay for these services, collection rates could increase by
                   1.5-2.5%.
                  Subsidies made available by DISCOs for social cases but then not repaid by the government
                   also contribute to a lower collection rate.
                  Special areas, such as refugee camps and certain villages have low collection rates. If bill
                   collection rates from these Special areas could be increased to benchmark levels, collection
                   rates would increase by 4-6%.
                  The quality of the service provided by Palestinian electricity distributors to customers in the
                   West Bank and Gaza is deemed to also be one of the reasons for the deterioration of the
                   collection rate. Customers have voiced severe criticism on a declining service quality.

             e. Tariff analysis:

             The purchase tariff is set unilaterally by the Israeli Electricity Regulator (PUA) as a bulk tariff for
             medium or low voltage. This is contested by the Palestinian Authority (PA) as it does not
             consider the Palestinian electricity distributors as one unit. As the largest single customer to the

PwC                                                                                                                 Page 7
             Israeli Electricity Corporation (IEC), it is recommended that the tariff be set at an export
             wholesale price only including the cost components applicable to PA’s consumption and
             removing non-applicable components, such as the renewable energy component.
             The PA has been involved in talks with its Israeli counterpart for the past 10 years to negotiate a
             commercial agreement for the sale and purchase of electricity, i.e. Power Purchase Agreement.
             However, progress on reaching an agreement has been slow, and it is recommended that this
             process is brought to a conclusion as soon as possible.
             As for the sales tariff, the Palestinian Electricity Regulator (PERC) has been setting the sales
             tariff to the Palestinian customers since 2011 based on a cost plus approach to cover the cost of
             electricity purchased from IEC as well as the operational expenses and an acceptable profit
             margin for electricity distributors. According to the methodology, the tariff would be reviewed
             yearly and be amended to include benchmarks for certain key performance indicators (KPIs),
             including losses and operating costs in order to enhance the efficiency of DISCOs. PERC is
             currently in the process of reviewing the tariff for the first time, which will include reviewing the
             different tariff components, such as the impact of removing subsidies and the inclusion of certain
             financial and quality KPIs.
             The difference between the sales and the purchase tariff, also known as tariff margin, reached
             54% after the new tariff was implemented in 2011. When the tariff was first applied, this margin
             was considered to be sufficient to cover all the cost of electricity distributors and was estimated to
             even allow them to earn a small profit. Since then, the tariff margin has decreased in the West
             Bank between 2010 and 2013 from 54% to 40% largely due to (i) subsidies included in the tariff,
             which are mostly not repaid by the Government, and (ii) a significant increase in the amount of
             electricity purchased from the IEC.
             In order to avoid an increase in the sales tariff, the Palestinian Electricity Transmission Company
             Ltd. (PETL) should finalize the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the IEC at a lower
             wholesale tariff, while PERC should set benchmarks for electricity distributors to reduce their
             operational expenses. At the same time, electricity distributors should cooperate with relevant
             electricity authorities to improve their efficiency. This further requires that all revenues from
             electricity services are primarily used to cover its purchase and operating costs.
             As for Gaza, the average purchase tariff from all the sources5 is nearly equal to the average sales
             tariff. GEDCO should review at least its commercial tariff, which is currently 20% less than the
             commercial tariff in the West Bank.
             In order to reduce electricity generation cost from the Gaza Power Plant and to eventually use bill
             collections from customers to pay for IEC invoices, the PA has plans to supply the plant with
             natural gas instead of diesel. In addition to reducing the costs, this action by PA will also enable
             the plant to run at full capacity, which will then reduce the power shortages in Gaza.
             In the West Bank, the PA introduced subsidies amounting to 200 million ILS (US$ 55 million) as
             part of the tariff between 2011 and the end of 2013. These governmental subsidies were adopted
             for political reasons essentially to satisfy customers and to prevent public disturbance as a result
             of electricity price increase. Unfortunately, due to the weak financial situation of the PA, MOF
             only repaid 40 million ILS (US$ 10.8 million) out of the 200 million ILS owed to electricity
             distributors6. The non-payment of these subsidies created more deficits to electricity distributors,
             which often chose to compensate for this cost by reducing their payments to the IEC. The
             outstanding unpaid subsidies owed to electricity distributors were 10.5 million ILS (US$ 2.9
             million) representing about 4% of the estimated electricity purchase cost of distributors in the
             West Bank between 2011-2013.

             f. Efficiency and transparency of Palestinian electricity distributors:

             According to the Palestinian Electricity law nº13, only licensed electricity distributors can sell
             electricity to customers. The law was implemented in 2009 to integrate municipalities, which
             were providing electricity services, in four efficient Distribution Companies (DISCOs) in the
             Palestinian Territories, three in the West Bank and one in Gaza. While many municipalities never
             joined the DISCOs, the existing DISCOs -which built structures to serve complete regions-,
             remained highly inefficient due to the absence of economies of scale. In parallel, those
             municipalities that did not join the DISCOs, kept their inefficient structure.
             Distributors –and particularly municipalities and villages- have opaque financial systems with
             unclear payment mechanisms. MOLG reported that some municipalities have not yet proceeded
             with segregating their accounts. DISCOs also appear to be only moderately transparent showing
             an inability to report properly on their finances. Palestinian electricity distributors seem to be
             highly influenced by the internal political environment in which they operate.
             Distributors choose to cover operational costs, investment costs and payments to shareholders
             before paying invoices to the IEC, which is one of the reasons for non-payment in the West Bank.
             Distributors were reported to have financed their shareholders through dividends and loans
             totaling 242 million ILS (US$ 67 million) in 2013, in spite of not completing their invoice
             payments to the IEC. NEDCO, HEPCO and SELCO, in particular, indicated that they use part of
             the collection from customers to fund ad-hoc payments to their municipal shareholders.
             Municipalities, on the other hand, disburse funds collected from electricity sales to cover the
             payment of other services, such as education, health, project finance and rehabilitation projects.
             All these payments are vaguely categorized under “municipal finance”.

             g. Other reasons for Non-payment of electricity:

             The analysis of the special areas7 revealed that collection there is usually low, but significant
             differences in collection trends and behavior are nonetheless observed. In terms of absolute
             figures, the contribution of these areas to non-payment is quite low because they do not cover
             extensive areas or large numbers of customers, e.g. special areas in JDECO (refugee camps) only
             represent 5% of the total customers and 21% of JDECO non-payment to IEC in 2013.

             It is critical to note, however, that in refugee camps the consumption per capita reached
             unprecedented levels, and non-technical losses are also significantly higher than in the rest of the
             Palestinian Territories.
             Specific issues related to affordability and arrears in these areas were addressed by the PA
             through the introduction of incentives and subsidies for the benefit of social cases. Unfortunately,
             the subsidies for social cases were not paid by the government to the electricity distributors thus
             impacting the non-payment negatively. On the other hand, incentives to refugee camps were
             never implemented due to the refusal of customers in refugee camps to pay for their electricity
             consumption.
             The special arrears analyzed in this assessment, in particular the refugee camps and the old city of
             Hebron, are considered to be areas that require special political attention in order to constructively
             tackle non-payment. Law enforcement in these areas is challenging and indeed requires the
             endorsement of PA’s highest authority as well as the representatives of these areas.

            Distributors, in coordination with the PA, should nevertheless continue to address these issues. It
            is also crucial for DISCOs to improve public perception by launching media campaigns and
            developing customer service trainings for their employees.
            The graph below illustrates the financial impact of the payment shortages in the payment cycle as
            well as issues arising from the purchase and sales tariff levels.

         supported by donors to assess the extent to which these plans are addressing or will address non-
         payment for electricity services. The action plan proposed in this assessment incorporates both
         insights drawn from the analytical results and from the strategies currently being implemented by

      PENRA and the PA –and supported by the international donor community. To be effective, the
      different actions suggested in the proposed action plan should be implemented as part of a cohesive
      broader plan monitored and regulated by a coordination entity comprising all sector stakeholders.

9.    The action plan recommends to further develop the Palestinian electricity sector by continuing its
      on-going institutional reform, improving its legal and regulatory environment and developing key
      infrastructure to consolidate and monitor electricity supply. The success of the proposed action plan
      is highly reliant on steady donor support, which will need to be coordinated with a Special
      Committee that bears overall responsibility for the action plan, including the collaboration of all
      stakeholders, and monitoring payment improvement and progress in related aspects.

10. The action plan puts forward a set of recommendations classified by priority level (see Section 5.3 of
    the assessment for the complete list). The high priority recommendations are the following:

           Expand the mandate of the existing “Net lending” governmental committee to be able to
            manage and monitor all actions proposed in the action plan to reduce non-payment. The
            performance of this specialized committee, which will ensure that all actions are coordinated
            and implemented correctly, is a precondition for the successful implementation of the action
            plan.
           Continue capacity-building activities for PERC and PETL to ensure that both institutions are
            ready to implement satisfactorily key actions proposed in the plan.
           Finalize a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between PETL and the IEC, which will (i) settle
            the issues related to the invoice cycle with the definition of clear invoice and payment
            procedures, (ii) set the purchase tariff at wholesale levels, and (iii) reduce non-payment to the
            IEC.
           Establish a web-based database between PETL and the IEC to ensure timely transfer of
            invoices and payments to the IEC and to establish a reliable system to monitor payment
            cycles for all electricity stakeholders.
           Install monitoring meters to measure and identify the location of non-technical losses in the
            Palestinian Territories and be able to take appropriate actions.
           Rehabilitate electricity networks to reduce technical losses.
           Install additional prepaid meters and smart metering systems to increase collections and
            timely payment from customers.
           Conduct regular awareness campaigns.
           Enable law enforcement and implementation of the legal actions arising under the amended
            electricity law.

11. The chart below illustrates the saving targets that could be reached with the cohesive implementation
    of all high priority actions proposed in the action plan. The saving targets set in the chart entails an
    increase in customer collection up to 93%, assumes a tariff margin set at around 0.52, with losses
    reduced to a mere 15.25% and revenue from electricity services used only to cover electricity
    expenses.

    1.           Introduction
In the past few years, the Palestinian Authority - with support from the international community - has
been actively engaged in a comprehensive reform of the electricity sector to increase its overall efficiency
for the benefit of the Palestinian population. The commitment and involvement of all stakeholders in this
extensive restructuring has transformed the sector and led to the creation of a well-structured electricity
market. The Palestinian electricity sector now displays proper legal and regulatory frameworks, a
suitable market model, well defined institutions and identifiable key market players.
In 2013, 88% of the total electricity purchased and provided to the Palestinian Territories (West Bank and
Gaza) was supplied by the Israeli Electricity Corporation (IEC). The Palestinian Authority has faced
many challenges over the years to both ensure the proper operation of the sector and secure the timely
payments of invoices by Distributors to the IEC.
The non-payments or partial payments of these bills create deficits for the IEC which then leads the
Israeli government to proceed with monthly deductions from the clearance revenue (tax and customs
transfer) owed to the PA. The deducted amounts are transferred by the Israeli Ministry of Finance to the
IEC, which then registers the remaining amount (if any) as debt. As a result, these non-payments are
either accounted for as deductions from the clearance revenue - mechanism also known as Net Lending -
or accumulated as debt9.
Sector stakeholders have attributed the reasons for the non-payment to a variety of factors which can be
summarized as follows:
    Electricity Losses whether technical or non-technical which result in shortfall between the
        quantity of electricity sold and invoiced by the IEC and the quantity of electricity which is sold to
        customers.
    Collection from Customers of electricity invoiced by Distributors which is believed to be low
        and continuously decreasing.
    Tariff at which electricity is sold to the customers is considered to be high and some Distributors
        indicated it did not even cover their costs. In addition, Distributors also indicated during the
        assessment workshop that the purchase tariff from IEC is deemed to be high and payment terms
        are unfair10.
    Efficiency and transparency of Distributors is being questioned. This includes allegations that
        Distributors use the collected cash for other purposes than the settlement of invoices and
        operational costs. Revenues collected by Distributors from electricity sales are customarily
        consumed to cover the cost of purchased electricity, the operational expenses, the capital
        expenses, dividends for shareholders and other costs. In the Palestinian territories. Many
        DISCOs11 do not properly settle their invoices and use part of the collection to make ad hoc
        payments to their shareholders 12 . Municipalities and village councils are also reported to use
        funds collected from electricity for other services such as payment of education health, municipal
        projects finance, etc. All these payments are categorized under “municipal finance”.
The objective of this report is to support the on-going efforts to improve the payment for electricity
services and reduce “Net Lending” in the West Bank and Gaza by: a) more precisely understanding the
sources and reasons for non-payment for electricity within the Palestinian Territories, b) assessing current
donor programs and PENRA actions aimed at addressing non-payment of electricity, and c) developing

an action plan that builds on the current donor programs to further improve payment for electricity in the
Palestinian Territories.
The purpose of the assessment is to understand the reason for the non-payment and determine whether it
is the result of the factors listed above. The detailed methodology followed to perform the assessment is
provided in Appendix A. The list of data received from the IEC in provided in Appendix B and the data
gathered by the Palestinian Distributors and Municipalities in Appendix C of the report.
The analysis of the reasons for non-payment in this report is based on an assessment of the consumption
and payment data collected from the IEC between 2010-2013 for 286 connection points between the
Palestinian Territories and Israel and data collected from Distributors covering the period between 2009-
2013. The report includes an assessment of non-payment by customers (from Palestinian residential and
commercial sectors, etc. to Palestinian Distributors), as well as non-payment by Palestinian Distributors
to the IEC. The report also includes the conclusions of a survey and focus groups. Based on this
assessment and taking into consideration existing strategies and proposed actions by the PA and the
donor community, the report finally provides a detailed action plan with suggestions on how to improve
non-payment and reduce Net Lending in the Palestinian Territories.

 2.                Overview of the Palestinian Electricity Sector
This chapter provides an overview of the electricity sector in the Palestinian Territories (West Bank and
Gaza). It explains the set-up of the sector and the existing framework within which the issues were
addressed and the recommendations developed. It examines the electricity supply chain in the West Bank
and Gaza as well as the institutional set up and the main sector actors. Finally, it outlines the political
context within which the sector is operating.

2.1.         Electricity Supply
The Palestinian Territories are highly dependent on electricity supplies from the Israeli Electricity
Corporation (Chart 1). Diagram 1 below illustrates the electricity supply mechanism where Palestinian
loads to the West Bank and Gaza are distributed through the IEC controlled lines, which extend from the
IEC substations. The Palestinian network only starts beyond the network connection points which are
also currently under the administration of the IEC.
In 2014, 286 Low Voltage (LV) and Medium Voltage (MV) connection points belonging to 173
connection point owners13 service the Palestinian Territories. Ten of these connection points supply the
Gaza Strip while the remaining 276 supply the Palestinian areas in the West Bank. The capacity of the
MV connection point is greater than that of the LV connection point which creates an opportunity to
extend the network by installing additional transformers and lines within the Palestinian Territories when
required. The Palestinian Authority (PA) with the support of the World Bank, the European Investment
Bank (EIB) and other donors initiated the “Electric Utility Management Project (EUMP)” which includes
the consolidation of a large number of the existing connection points in the West Bank into 4 high voltage
substations financed by the EIB. The project, initiated in 2008 is currently under implementation with the
first substation expected to be operational by the end of 2014. The operation of these PA owned
substations should increase Palestinian control over imported electricity from Israel and pave the way for
the PA to finalize negotiations on a commercial agreement with the IEC to supply the West Bank, and
potentially reduce the price of electricity to customers14.

In addition to the supply from the IEC, a medium voltage connection line from Jordan supplies the West
Bank city of Jericho with around 5% of the total West Bank electricity supply as of 2013. In Gaza, a fuel
operated power plant provides the Strip with around 29% of Gaza’s total supply, while as of 2013; an
additional 8% is supplied from Egypt to Rafah, in the southern area of Gaza.

2.2.      Institutional Setup
 In the last few years, the Palestinian Authority with the support of the donor community committed to
 initiate a comprehensive restructuring of the electricity sector. An extensive reform process began which
 led to the establishment of robust institutions and provided the Palestinian Territories with one of the best
 structured markets in the Middle East. In 2009, the Palestinian Authority issued the electricity law which
 formulates this institutional set up and started with its implementation defined in Diagram 2.

        Of the six DISCOs currently operating, only two (JDECO and NEDCO) received distribution
        licenses from PENRA upon recommendation of PERC in 2011, in line with the electricity law. All
        other DISCOs are still operating without a formal license.
        The electricity regulator PERC has not, until recently, been able to have any authority over GEDCO
        due to political differences between the West Bank and Gaza authorities. Although this situation is
        expected to improve shortly with reconciliation talks between the two parties under way, GEDCO is
        yet to apply the unified tariff prevalent in the West Bank under PERC’s recommendations.
        Comprehensive tables including all data related to DISCOs including collection, tariff, losses,
        customer profile, etc. is attached in Appendix C.
      Municipalities and village councils: It is important to note that around 150 municipalities and
       village councils in the northern and southern regions of West Bank have not transferred their
       electricity services to DISCOs. The consumption of these municipalities and village councils
       represents about 22% of the total electricity purchased from the IEC to West Bank, and about 17% of
       the total purchased electricity from the IEC by the Palestinian Territories in 2013. The major
       municipalities and village councils not included in West Bank DISCOs are shown below.

2.5.          The Sector in the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza
              Strip
In the 1993 interim agreement on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, it was agreed that the “powers and
responsibilities”20 of the Palestinian electricity sector would remain with the Israeli Civil Administration,
and would not be transferred to the Palestinian Authority. In Article 10 of this agreement, both sides
agreed to continue their negotiations on Electricity matters with the aim of reaching a final settlement 2. In
the interim, the status quo in the electricity sector in the West Bank and Gaza will persist. This includes
free, unrestricted and secure access for IEC personnel and equipment to the Palestinian electricity grid.
As of today, no agreement has been reached regarding the transfer of the power and responsibilities of the
electricity sector from the Israeli Civil Administration to the Palestinian Authority with the exception of
the Gaza Strip where the “power and responsibility” were transferred after the Israeli Disengagement
from Gaza Strip in 2005.
It is worth noting that currently, while the Israeli Civil Administration is responsible for the power and
responsibilities of the sector, it is not in a position to enforce some rules and regulations falling under this
mandate such as setting the tariff on the Palestinian Distributors. The approval of the Israeli Civil
Administration is still required for the installation of any new connection points as well as for the increase
in capacity of existing connection points in the West Bank and Gaza. Finally, its approval is required for
the installation of any new electricity lines in area C21.

     The Oslo II Accord divided the West Bank into three administrative divisions: Areas A, B and C :
     - Area A (full civil and security control by the Palestinian Authority): circa 3% of the West Bank, exclusive East Jerusalem (first phase, 1995). This
         area includes eight Palestinian cities and their surrounding areas (Nablus, Jenin, Tulkarem, Qalqiliya, Ramallah, Bethlehem, Jericho and 80 percent
         of Hebron), with no Israeli settlements. Entry into this area is forbidden to all Israeli citizens.
     - Area B (Palestinian civil control and joint Israeli-Palestinian security control): circa 23-25% (first phase, 1995). This area includes some 440
         Palestinian villages and their surrounding lands, and no Israeli settlements.
     - Area C (full Israeli civil and security control): circa 72-74% (first phase, 1995): “areas of the West Bank outside Areas A and B, which, except for
         the issues that will be negotiated in the permanent status negotiations, will be gradually transferred to Palestinian jurisdiction in accordance with
         this Agreement″.

 3.            Analysis and key findings
Analysis of the data collected from stakeholders during the review revealed the magnitude of the non-
payment issue as well as its distribution throughout the West Bank and Gaza. It exposes the main non-
payers in the Palestinian Territories as well as the causes of the non-payment. This chapter describes the
non-payment issue, in particular the extent and main contributors as a starting point to understand the
reasons identified for non-payment during the data analysis. Electricity losses, collection levels, level of
purchase and sales tariff, governmental subsidies, and efficiency and transparency of sector participants
(external and internal) were identified as the main factors contributing to the non-payment described
below.

3.1 IEC invoice reconciliation and cycle
The IEC issues monthly invoices to connection point owners. These need to be paid within 11 days of the
date of issue. Any delay in payment leads to a 10% annual late fee charge.
While the IEC bills are issued monthly, a number of Distributors 22 (mainly municipalities and village
councils) indicated that these bills were rarely received by connection point owners or that the receipt was
often delayed. The receipt of bills by connection point owner is the starting point to ensure proper and
timely payment of invoices. An efficient mechanism to guarantee invoice deliveries and monitoring of
payments should be designed and implemented to secure this operation. The invoice process needs to be
fully transparent as most of the connection points are located in area C21, where Palestinians have no
access to connection points and this prevents them from reading the meters and verifying the accuracy of
IEC’s invoices.

3.2 Non-payment of Distributors to the IEC
Although non-payment of electricity bills to the IEC started as early as 2002, the issue became a concern
and priority for the PA in 2007 when the levels of non-payment showed significant year on year increases,
resulting in 1407 million ILS (381 million US$) being due in 2013.
The non-payment and partial payment of electricity bills creates receivables for the IEC which then leads
the Israeli government to proceed with monthly deductions from the clearance revenue (tax and customs
transfer) owed to the PA. These amounts are transferred by the Israeli Ministry of Finance to the IEC,
who then registers the remaining amount (if any) as debt from each connection point. As a result, these
non-payments from the owners of connections points are either accounted for as deductions from the
clearance revenue mechanism also known as Net Lending- or accumulated as debt. The absence of
mechanism to monitor payments to the IEC makes it impossible to check if duplicate payments are made
to the IEC by the connection point owner or through deductions from the clearance revenue.
Discrepancies were actually detected between the monthly Net Lending amounts as registered at MOF
and the IEC financial data as shown in Appendix E.

  GEDCO stated it had not received any IEC invoices for the past 3 years. PENRA started receiving these invoices at the beginning of 2014 and has
been transmitting them to GEDCO shortly after.

3.1.1.       Non-payment figures
The analysis of the data23 shows that for the period 2010-2013, the total non-payment amounts for the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip reached 4.16 billion ILS (1,135 million US$ equivalent) 24. This amount
translates into non-payment of 37% of the total invoiced amount for the West Bank and 100% for Gaza.
During that period, the Israeli Ministry of Finance proceeded with arbitrary deductions –following IEC’s
request- from the clearance revenue to partially compensate the non-payments. The amounts deducted and
the frequency of deductions does not follow a set calendar or pattern and seem to occur following requests
from the IEC to the Israeli Ministry of Finance and negotiations between the Israeli Government and the
PA Ministry of Finance. These deductions are recorded as Net Lending on the PA’s balance sheet and are
shown as receivables against Distributors under the assets’ category. The amounts which are not
deducted are recorded as debts which are expected to either be paid by Distributors in future bills or will
be later deducted through the clearance mechanism as Net Lending. A detailed description of the
deductions from the clearance revenues is provided in Appendix F.
In 2012, the Israeli Ministry of Finance deducted a significant amount in comparison with the previous
years to compensate for Distributor’s accumulated debt. This led the Net Lending to increase to
unprecedented levels that year reaching 13.5% of the total PA revenues. The clearance revenue that year
amounted for 70.3% of the total PA revenues25 and Net Lending reached 19.2% of the total clearance
revenue amount. These percentages and amounts illustrate both the dependence of the PA on the
clearance revenue for its general budget and the burden represented by Net Lending on the PA general
budget. The following table compares the clearance revenue and the electricity Net Lending for the period
2010-2013.

During this period non-payment to the IEC from the West Bank amounted to 2.422 billion ILS (664.7
million US$ equivalent) from which the Israeli Ministry of Finance deducted 1.25 billion ILS (334.7
million US$ equivalent) registered as Net Lending for the PA and the remaining amount of 1,172 billion
ILS (330 million US$ equivalent) was registered as outstanding debt24 to IEC.
During the same period, non-payment to the IEC from Gaza amounted to 1.74 billion ILS (471 million
US$ equivalent) representing 100% of the total cost of IEC invoices for Gaza. 89% of this amount was
deducted by the Israeli Ministry of Finance while the remaining 11% was recorded as outstanding debt to
the IEC. The amounts of the overall non-payment are substantial and could be used by the PA for other
priority expenditures in the electricity or other sectors.


3.1.2. Geographical distribution of non-payment 2010-2013
The next step to understand the extent of non-payment in the Palestinian Territory is to analyze the
regional level of non-payment. The analysis clearly revealed that Gaza comprises the highest non-
payments in absolute amounts (GEDCO concession area) with a total amount of 1.739 billion ILS (471
million US$ equivalent). The West Bank central region (JDECO concession area) is next with a total
amount of 1.096 billion ILS (297 million US$ equivalent). This clearly indicates that solving the non-
payment issue in the Palestinian Territories will require focusing mainly on these two geographical areas
which together represent almost 70% of the non-payments during the reporting period.

3.1.3. Progression of non-payment over the period 2010-2013
It is essential to acknowledge that during this reporting period, the price of electricity purchased by
Palestinian Distributors from the IEC increased by 33%28 going from 0.33 ILS/kWh to 0.44 ILS/kWh,
since the increasing cost of electricity is one factor in terms of willingness to pay.
Non-payment during the period constantly and rapidly increased. In 201029 non-payment reached 37% of
the total electricity cost and it jumped to 58% of the total electricity cost in 2013.
This non-payment can be attributed to several factors including, the increase in the purchase price from
the IEC and a corresponding decline in willingness to pay, the decline in collection from customers and
the 2012 large deduction executed by the Israeli authority through the clearance mechanism which gave
Distributors and customers the impression that non-payment would automatically be compensated by the
PA.

To confirm whether non-payment was widespread in the Palestinian Territories or was only affecting
certain regions more significantly, the data was broken up into regions. In the West Bank, the overall
trend reveals that the increase in non-payment is generally in line with regional variables. In the Center

West Bank non-payment only started in 2011 and although it has the lowest non-payment percentage it
shows the highest increase going from 0% in 2010 to 44% in 2013.
.
Non-payment in the Northern West Bank increased significantly in 2012 compared to the previous year.
The Southern West Bank and Gaza have however, not seen any significant increases during this period
with an average non-payment level of around 50% for the southern West Bank, and Gaza consistently not
paying at all for IEC invoices.
The table below summarizes the regional distribution of non-payment to the IEC for the period 2010-
2013. For a better appreciation of the scale and location of the non-payment during the period, charts have
been developed and included in Appendix G (see Appendix G: Cost of purchase electricity vs. Net
Lending and direct payment) to provide details of non-payment percentage per region for the West Bank
and Gaza.

This section has enabled us to understand the extent of non-payment from Distributors to the IEC in the
West Bank and Gaza. The overall data collected provided clear evidence that non-payment has been
consistently increasing in the West Bank and had always existed in the Gaza Strip. It further identifies the
main regions and Distributors accountable for this increase.

3.1.4. Largest Non-Payers to IEC
To further identify the origin of the non-payment, an analysis of the largest non-payers to the IEC in the
West Bank and Gaza was performed and revealed the following results.
The largest non-payer to the IEC is GEDCO with a total amount of non-payment reaching 1,738,750,017
ILS (471,205,967 US$). During the 2010-2013 reporting period, GEDCOs’ contribution to the overall
non-payment to the IEC reached 41.8% while in 2013 it only purchased 21% of the total electricity sold to
the Palestinian Territories from the IEC.
JDECO is the second largest contributor to non-payment reaching a total of 1,095,484,015 ILS
(296,879,137 US$). Although this figure is quite significant, it is worth noting that JDECO’s contribution
to the total IEC non-payment reached 26.3% while it accounted for around 40% of the total electricity
purchases to the IEC in 2013.
The table below provides a more detailed list of the largest non-payers for the period 2010-2013 as well as
an indication of the percentage of electricity they purchased from IEC in 2013.

3.1.5. Net Lending and poverty
To identify the external factors that contribute to non-payment, it was also necessary to understand
whether there is a link between non-payment to IEC and poverty. The assessment work therefore
compared the non-payment in ILS/kWh to the IEC in 2013 data with the MOSA poverty data for the same
year.
In 2013, the District with the lowest poverty rate was Nablus District with a poverty rate of 5.9% and non-
payment about 40.4%30. Qalqiliya has the highest poverty rate of 15.9% and non-payment of 23.1% as
shown in the chart below. An area with one of the highest non-payment percentage is the Jericho District
(outside JDECO concession area) with 82.7% of non-payment, but the poverty rate of 13.8% is lower than
other areas in the West Bank.
This shows that non-payment from the Palestinian Distributors to IEC is not connected to the poverty
level of the customers supplied by these Distributors. For example, Nablus governorate which has one of
the lowest poverty rates is one of the largest contributors to Net Lending and non-payment. This shows
that poverty levels are not one of the main factors leading to non-payment of Distributors to IEC.

3.3 Electricity Losses
Distributors and other sector stakeholders often indicate that electricity losses are a major contributor to
non-payment. It was therefore necessary to analyze the amount of losses and their link to non-payment.
Electricity losses can be defined as difference between the amounts of electricity purchased from the
different electricity suppliers (mainly from IEC) and the electricity consumed by the end users as
measured by their electricity meters.
Losses can be categorized into two types: technical losses and non-technical losses. Technical losses are
losses on the electricity network (lines, cables, transformers, etc.), and these losses are the result of
inherent resistance of electrical conductors and can be verified using load flow software analysis and
measurements. Non-technical losses are the electricity which gets lost due to theft and errors of metering
and billing. The losses locations are illustrated in the next diagram.

The total electricity losses (which are the difference between the purchased electricity from all sources 36
as measured at the connection points and the sold electricity to the customers as measured by their meters
for the different DISCOs) did not vary much during the period 2010-2013; remaining steady at 23-30%
although this is above the levels reported by other regional Distributors such as those in Jordan which has
average losses of 13%.

The total losses as shown in the table and chart above include both technical and non-technical losses. The
split between technical and non-technical losses cannot be determined as Distributors do not have proper
measurement/monitoring tools installed on the network and are not equipped with the required technical
software tools to analyze the losses. To obtain this split, it is necessary to perform a technical study to
calculate the actual level of technical losses and then determine the difference between the total losses and
the technical losses to obtain the total non-technical losses. The only loss studies for West Bank and Gaza
are at least 10 years old which prevents us from making any conclusions based on these studies.
Nevertheless, during discussions, DISCOs indicated that they estimate the split between technical and
non-technical losses to be 50%: 50%. This estimation is based on their experience of the sector and self-
judgment only.
In terms of financial value, the cost of losses (technical and non-technical) during the period 2010-2013 in
West Bank was as follows:
                                              Table 8: Cost of losses in the West Bank
                                               2010                  2011                  2012              2013

 Cost of losses ILS (Incl. VAT)                 267,607,997          356,760,251            430,189,017      479,216,164


 Cost of losses US$ (Incl. VAT)                  71,744,771           99,653,701            111,737,407      133,115,601

The table above shows that cost of losses increased by 80% during the period while its significance
compared to non-payment dropped during the same period. This is mainly due to the fact that, as detailed
in the previous sections, non-payment has seen a sharp increase since 2011.

It should be noted that in the absence of the relevant information, in particular the amount of kWh
purchased from the IEC and Egypt, the percentage for Gaza losses were estimated by GEDCO. Based on
the current available information, losses were estimated at 14% in 2010, 19% in 2011 and in 2012 and



PwC                                                                                      Page 31
23% in 2014. It is recommended that an in depth study and analysis to calculate the actual amount of
losses is carried out.
Technical losses could be reduced by strengthening the electricity network with the installation of new
lines to reduce overloaded networks, the installation of capacitor banks to increase power factor, etc. This
means that the reduction of technical losses can only take place with financial investment in the network.
Non-technical losses can be reduced by increasing inspections, enforcing the law and taking legal and
punitive actions against the customers who steal electricity.
In order to measure the impact of a reduction of losses on the non-payment two loss reduction scenarios
are proposed below. These scenarios show that loss reduction would reduce the non-payment levels by
19% (with 2013 figures). The table reveals that the impact of reducing the losses on non-payment is
decreasing yearly as other important factors have started influencing non-payment, such as the collection
rates and the tariff margin.
The following two scenarios provide estimates on the savings for West Bank Distributors through a
decrease in technical and non-technical losses. The 2 scenarios are based on the assumption noted above,
that technical losses and non-technical losses are nearly equal.
       Scenario 1: technical losses reduced by 25% and non-technical losses reduced by 25%; i.e. total
        losses = 18.75% in 2013 instead of 25%.
       Scenario 2: technical losses reduced by 25% and non-technical losses reduced by 50%; i.e. total
        losses = 15.63% in 2013 instead of 25%.

3.4 Collection from customers
Another reason mentioned by sector stakeholders to explain non-payment to IEC is the low collection rate
from customers. The following section seeks to understand whether the collection is actually low and its
impact on non-payment to the IEC.

An analysis of customer payment behavior was undertaken using data from all DISCOs and selected
municipalities. The analysis also included a survey, which was distributed to a representative sample of
customers throughout West Bank and Gaza to better understand their consumption patterns and payment
attitudes. The result of this exercise and complete analysis is available in Appendix H.

3.4.1      Overall information on collection
Customer collection (which is the ratio between yearly total collections to the value of yearly total sales)
in the West Bank and Gaza is not as low as is widely believed in the Palestinian Territories. In 2013, the
average collection rate in the West Bank reached 81% while it reached 71% in the Gaza Strip.

Unfortunately the trend of payment from customer has been declining in all regions in the West Bank
with the sharpest drop at JDECO with a collection rate of 97% in 2012 going down to 83% in 2013.
In Gaza collection has been continually increasing from a rate of 47% in 2009 and reaching 71% in 2013.

In comparing the yearly collection totals from Distributors to the cost of purchased electricity from the
IEC and the payments processed, it appears that up to 2010, for most DISCOs in the West Bank the
collection level was sufficient to cover the IEC invoices. The only exception is JDECO which collected
the necessary funds to also cover costs up to 2011.
In Gaza during 2010-2013, the amounts collected were never sufficient to cover the purchase not even
reaching 50% of the costs. This clearly indicates that if with the collection reaching 71% GEDCO cannot
cover 50% of the IEC costs it will not be able to cover the cost of the purchase even with 100% collection.
While GEDCO is the main contributor to the non-payment, customer collection is only one of the causes
of non-payment.
GEDCO has been actively searching for solutions to increase the collection rate. With the support of
PENRA and donors, GEDCO successfully initiated a prepaid meter pilot project which enabled the utility
to collect about 1 million ILS (0.28 million US$) in 2013. GEDCO is currently requesting to extend the
installation of prepaid meters throughout the Strip. The preparation of a strategy for installing prepaid
meters in Gaza based on lessons learnt from West Bank Distributors is included as a recommendation in
the next section.
Chart 8 provides an overview of the collection to purchase cost from all electricity sources between 2010
and 2013 for the major DISCOs in the West Bank and Gaza. The analysis shows that as of 2012, amounts
collected by DISCOs were insufficient to cover electricity purchases. The chart illustrates the current
situation and clearly shows the decline in collection in the West Bank and the increase in Gaza.

Various attempts to increase collection by DISCOs have been taken in previous years including the
installation of pre-paid meters at scale. Appendix I provides further information based on the
geographical distribution of prepaid meters in the West Bank. In the past two years, JDECO has started
smart meter37 pilot projects, which look to increase the collection amounts and better monitor the losses.
Municipalities and village council’s collections38: The average collection rate of the main municipalities
and village council’s is estimated to be high . This is due the installation of large amounts of prepaid
meters39 in these areas. Qalqiliya reported the following collection rates.

Illar40 reported a collection rate averaging 100% in the past years with the operation of 100% prepaid
meters. Tulkarem did not report the collection rate, but it is estimated to be between 60% and 70% due to
poor collection from Tulkarem refugee camp which represents about 10% of Tulkarem’ total sales but has
a collection level of zero.
3.4.2           Collection per customer’s category
An assessment of the collection levels per customer category was performed to identify the payment
performances of the different customer categories and propose if necessary targeted actions per customer
category. Distributors issue monthly electricity bills to their customers serviced through postpaid
electricity meters for the cost of electricity consumed during the previous month, while customers with
prepaid electricity meters pay in advance for their future consumption.

   3. Others including “industrial users connected at low voltage level, industrial users connected at
        medium voltage level, water pumps, agricultural areas, street lights and temporary services”.
The first 2 categories comprise more than 75% of the total DISCOs’ sales and more than 95% of the total
number of customers.
A detailed chart providing information on the ratio of the different customer category in each DISCO is
available below. Observations on the data collected on customer category can be summarized as follows:
The only pattern which could be identified is that there is a higher level of collection from commercial
customers compared to all other categories in the West Bank and Gaza.
     NEDCO: Collections from the Residential category are moderate (around 82%) and have seen a
      yearly decrease (to 78%) in 2012. This could be explained by the transfer of villages (comprising
      mainly of residential customers with lower collection rates) into NEDCO in 2011 and 2012.
      Collections from the Commercial category went down from 95% in 2010 to 70% in 201241 mainly
      due to non-payment by governmental institutions42.
      Collections from the “Other” category are low probably due to the fact that water pumps and street
      lights are either owned by a municipality or the PA who do not systematically pay for their bills. For
      example, in 2012, sales for street lights amounted to around 5 million ILS which represents 2% of
      NEDCO’s total sales while collection for street lights was close to zero. The same year, sales for
      water pumps amounted to 16 million ILS which represents 8.9% of NEDCO’s total sales while
      collection was also close to zero.
     JDECO: Collections from the Residential category are high but decreased rapidly in 2013 dropping
      to 86%. Based on anecdotal evidence, it is believed that some residential customers stopped paying
      their bills after learning that the IEC deducted non-payments from clearance revenues (Net Lending)
      in November 2012. Collections from the Commercial category are high (90-100%) and no collection
      problems are noticed within this category. This could be due to JDECO ’s ability to exercise its rights
      to disconnect electricity and take legal actions more easily against Commercial customers who are
      larger, easier to find and approach.
      Collections from the “Other” category are high except for 2013 which saw a sudden drop mainly due
      to the deterioration in the collection of payments from industrial medium voltage customers: non-
      payment of major PA water wells in Bethlehem area and military academy in Jericho.
     HEPCO: Collections from the residential category are low averaging between 71% and 75% during
      the period 2009-2013, with 2013 witnessing the lowest collection rate for the period.
      The collections from the “Other” category decreased gradually after 2010 due to the reduction in
      collection from street lighting and the governmental services 42. Sales to municipalities for street lights
      in 2013 were about 6.7 million ILS which represented about 2.2% of HEPCO’s total sales while
      collections for street lights reached around 57%. Sales for Governmental institutions amounted to
      around 6.2 million ILS which represented 3.1% of the total sales whilst the collection was close to nil.
     GEDCO: Collections from the residential category are low (62%-77%) but 2013 registered the
      highest collection rate. The yearly increase in collection could be partially explained by the automatic
      salary deductions implemented by the PA for civil servants in Gaza to cover part of their debt to
      GEDCO. The salary deductions from PA civil servants in Gaza amounted to 134 million ILS in 2013
      representing more than 30% of the total collections. Similarly, the collection from commercial
      customers is relatively high, reaching 92% in the period 2011-2013 and the collection for the “Other”
      category43 is average and reaching around 77% but steadily increasing by 2 to 3% yearly since 2010.

3.4.3       Reasons for non-payment according to customers
In order to identify and understand the reasons and factors affecting non-payment from customers to
Distributors, a survey was performed in the West Bank and Gaza. The results of the survey do not reflect
actual personal payment behavior of customers, but their personal views on the reasons of non-payment in
the country.
The vast majority of respondents believe the cost of electricity is high and this is the main reason for non-
payment by customers. During the study, it was also possible to evaluate the proportion of household
income that the monthly electricity invoices represented. This ratio reached 8.15% in the West Bank and
11.91% in Gaza. It is interesting to note that while respondents perceive electricity to be sold at a high
costs, an EBRD research paper48 dated 2005 provides “benchmarks used in measuring affordabil ity from
various sources” in different countries (IPA energy, WHO and WB) which range between 10 -15% of the
household income.
In the West Bank, other important reasons communicated to explain non-payment by customers were
related to the low source of income, the fact that many do not pay and the refugee status.
In Gaza, in addition to the high cost of electricity, respondents indicated that non-payment was due to the
low level of income in Gaza and the dissatisfaction of customer in the service provided.
The responses were analyzed by calculating the mean scores of responses based on a Likert scale of one
to five with one being the strongest and five being the weakest. The tables below represent the strongest
indicators for nonpayment. In addition a color coded system was employed to identify critical factors in
the decision of respondents not to pay, which follows below:
      Black was a main or critical factor in non-payment
      Red was a strong factor in non-payment
      Yellow was a potential or weak factor in non-payment
      Green was a non-factor in non-payment

     NEDCO was not in operation in 2009 so the data for this year is not included.

   The commercial customers’ data are included in the data of the “other” customers as we could no t obtain from HEPCO the split between the two
categories.

   TEDCO data is not included in the chart as TEDCO sells most of the electricity to 18 villages on bulk meters and not directly to the end customers

While the analysis above provides an insight into participant’s perceptions of the reasons for non -
payment, it was also decided to evaluate the willingness of customers to pay for their invoices.
The analysis as reported in table below was inconclusive. There is no clear pattern for willingness to pay
based on income, invoice or percentage of invoice to household income. It is likely that additional factors
are most probably influencing the behavior of customers; such as a culture of non-payment. The table
nevertheless, clearly illustrates that in areas where large amounts of pre-paid meters are installed (more
than 70%); the willingness to pay by customers serviced with postpaid meters living in this area is very
high.
Furthermore, Jerusalem and Ramallah (JDECO concession area) have the highest percentage of
willingness to pay which could be explained by the prosecution action that is taken against offenders who
are in arrears or by culture of payment in these areas. Jericho has the lowest percentage of willingness to
pay but also the highest price rate compared to income. The main reason for low willingness to pay in this
governorate can perhaps be explained by the high percentage that electricity bills represent on the
household income for customers in this area.
To further challenge the results received from the analysis of electricity payment, we also included in the
survey a few questions on payments to other utilities and basic services. The results of these questions
were enlightening as they revealed that in the West Bank, over 80% of respondents stated that they
regularly pay for other utilities such as water, telephone, and internet. In West Bank, the reasons cited for
paying for these bills were related to the fear of penalty or punishment (56% of respondent) and the
perception of the importance of the service itself (21.8%). In Gaza, 52% of respondents justified the
payment of other utilities bills for fear of penalty or punishment (28.8%), to remain debt free (23.7%) and
due to the perception of that the prices were acceptable (22.4%).

It is important to note that only those respondents served by postpaid meters are included in table 15.
Respondents with pre-paid meters are required to pay for the electricity service in advance.
Approximately 57.6% of all respondent are serviced by postpaid meters, with the balance of 42.4%

The next step towards understanding customers’ behavior and defin ing the most suitable actions to
implement to achieve an increase in collection was to identify the factors which can encourage customers
to pay. While results differed slightly between the West Bank and Gaza, customers in both locations
believe that flexibility in payment schedule – mainly related to the settlement of arrears - should
encourage more customers to pay. In the West Bank survey respondents also indicated that the installation
of pre-paid meters should settle the issue of non-payment. In the Gaza Strip respondents believe that
enhancing the level of service –essentially uninterrupted provision of electricity - should certainly lead to
an increase in payment.

Payment behavior of civil servants
The survey also included questions on payment behavior, which captured civil servant’s behavior and
concluded that over half (52.6%) indicated they were compelled to wait for their salary before paying
their bill,
     While 5.3% indicated they borrow money to pay their electricity bills.
     And over 42% however, stated that they simply don't pay because they can't.
The total number of respondents employed in the public sector that participated in this study was 82. Of
the 82 respondents, 38 answered the question related to the irregular payment of salaries and how it
affects their ability to settle their electricity invoices. The remaining respondents in this category were
serviced through a prepaid meter for their electricity needs.
It should be noted that during the months where salary payments for Civil Servants are delayed,
Distributors in West Bank typically give these employees a monthly credit of 50-100 ILS.

3.5 Tariff Analysis

One of the factors commonly attributed to the non-payment in the West Bank and Gaza is the high sales
tariff for customers.
The sales tariff is calculated based on the purchase tariff from the IEC to which a markup is added
according to an approved approach and methodology (“Cost plus” Approach). This approach should
ensure that the operational cost of the DISCOs including acceptable levels of technical and non-technical
losses, working capital needs and future investments, are covered and should allow for a limited profit


PwC                                                                                 Page 39
margin. The regulatory authority is entitled to set future benchmarks for certain Key Performance
Indicators (“KPIs”) for certain components such as technical and non-technical losses to be covered by
the tariff.
To understand the impact of the tariff on the non-payment, this section will first analyze the purchase
tariff, followed by the markup and finally look at the sales tariff including the governmental subsidy
component.

3.5.1              Purchase Tariff
Most of the Distributors purchase electricity from the IEC at a tariff set by the Israeli Power Utility
Authority (PUA), with the following main characteristics:
 It is a LV or MV bulk flat tariff for all connection points except for JDECO, where the Time of Use
   tariff (ToU) is applied;
 It is fixed by the PUA without any consultations with the Palestinian Distributors or Authorities.
 It is a tariff designed for the Israeli electricity market, not customized for the Palestinian market. It
   includes beside other components for example an unknown percentage49 to cover the development of
   the renewable energy sector in Israel; which Palestinians recipients do not benefit from.
The tariff applied by the PUA in the Palestinian Territories is a bulk tariff for Low Voltage for
connection points connected at the low voltage and is a medium voltage bulk tariff for connection points
connected at the medium voltage:

                                  Table 17: Israeli Tariff as 16.5.2013: Fixed rates – Agorot per kWh
        Residential                    General                   Street lighting              Low Voltage bulk tariff           Medium Voltage bulk

             54.03                        55.61                         47.63                             52.55                            45.27


The purchase tariff set unilaterally by the PUA is contested by the PA which considers that it does not
reflect appropriate costs as it does not consider the Palestinian electricity Distributors as one unit. The PA
believes that, as the largest single customer to the IEC, the tariff should be an export tariff which only
includes the cost components applicable to the PA consumption and from which all other components
such as the renewable energy component should be removed.
Payment conditions applied to Palestinian Distributors are the same as the ones applied to Israeli
residential and commercial customers. They only have 11 days to pay the IEC after which they are
imposed a late fee of 8.75%50. Palestinian Distributors, which purchase electricity with a yearly amount of
over 2 billion ILS (560 million US$), believe that their payment conditions should be different from those
from Israeli residential or commercial customers. It is recommended that payment conditions be revised
to appropriate wholesale levels, recognizing the fact that Distributors are large companies with their own
costs, and who need to read meters and issue invoices for thousands of customers, collect money from
them and are only then in a position to pay the IEC.
The Palestinian Authority has been involved in talks with its Israeli counterpart for the past 10 years to
negotiate a commercial agreement which should resolve the above mentioned issues and in particular
agree on a special export tariff to the Palestinian Distributors with fair payment conditions. Unfortunately,
progress on reaching an agreement has slow, and needs to be brought to a conclusion.

3.5.2               Tariff margin51
A new tariff approach and methodology was approved by the BoD of PERC in 2011. Details of the
approach are summarized below:
   1- It is a cost plus tariff: the tariff must recover all the regulated expenses plus a profit equal to the
       Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).
   2- It includes the following 11 types of customers: residential, residential prepaid, commercial,
       commercial prepaid, industrial low voltage, industrial medium voltage, water pumps, agricultural,
       street lights, temporarily connection and temporarily prepaid connection. The tariff varies
       according to the customer category and the voltage level.
   3- It is a 5 step tariff for residential customers with postpaid meter and flat for all other customer
       categories; with the exception of customers serviced through medium voltage for which the Time
       of Use (ToU) tariff applies. The residential step tariff is an ascending tariff with the first step
       having the lowest price.
   4- It includes Governmental subsidy.
        5- It includes a threshold for total losses set at 22.5% the first year (2011) and gradually decreasing
           after.
The sales tariff was set to cover the cost of electricity purchased from IEC as well as the operational
expenses and allow for an acceptable profit margin for Distributors.
Following implementation of the above Chart 14: Comparing purchase and sales tariff 2009-2013
methodology, the Tariff Margin reached 54%
in the West Bank and 40% in Gaza in 2011. 0.80                         73%

partly subsidize the tariff and not to increase the      2009     2010      2011      2012       2013
sales tariff to the customers. The margin
                                                                  West Bank         Gaza Strip
remained in place for 2013.
The tariff margin has decreased in the West Bank between 2010 and 2013 going from 54% to 40% largely
due to:
   1- The high increase of the purchase cost ofelectricity from IEC, and
   2- The subsidies included in the tariff which are mostly not repaid by the Government52.
The removal of subsidy and decrease in losses threshold in the tariff should bring the tariff margin under
54%. While a fair tariff margin can be calculated at 50-52% for 2013 in the current context53, it would be
necessary for the PA to reach a fair commercial agreement with IEC to reach this goal.
During the period 2010-2013, the cost of electricity purchased from the IEC (estimations) increased by
62%. This increase was the result of the rise in the purchase tariff from the IEC by 34% during this period
and the increase of the quantity of electricity purchased from the IEC by 22% during the same period.


51
     The difference between the sales and the purchase tariff is defined as the tariff margin.

  Governmental subsidies are detailed chapter 3.7.2 and Annex L provides details of governmental subsidies including repayment
53
  Comparing 2011 margin of 54% reduced by 2%-4% including reduced losses threshold in PERC tariff methodology and excluding any governmental
subsidy.

The following paragraphs attempt to provide additional information to explain why the margin went down
so dramatically:
The average purchase tariff from the IEC decreased by 12% from 2009 to 2010 while the sales tariff
decreased by 3%. This explains the high percentage of collection to purchase54 value in 2010 as shown in
Chart 13. From 2011 to 2013 the purchase tariff increased steadily. In 2011 it increased by 7% compared
to 2010. During the same time, the sales tariff decreased by 4%. 2012 was particularly challenging as the
purchase tariff increased by 17% compared to 2011 while the sales tariff only increased by 6.5%.
The purchase tariff in Gaza is set by the IEC and is similar to the West Bank. However, the sales’ tariff in
Gaza is lower than the one in the West Bank and is set by GEDCO rather than by PERC (which still has
not exercised its mandate in the Strip). The sales tariff in Gaza is 70% of the sales tariff in the West Bank.
The sales tariff has not changed in Gaza for the last 3 years, largely due to:
1- Political reasons; and
2- A shortage of electricity supply to customers: GEDCO is not willing to increase the tariff for the
costumers while daily electricity cuts last between 6-12 hours.
The tariff margin in Gaza is 16% in 2013, if PERC tariff methodology is applied in Gaza then the tariff
margin should be increased to 50-52%. This means that the sales tariff in Gaza will be the same as in
West Bank and requires the sales tariff to be increased by 36% without taking into consideration the high
cost of generating electricity from Gaza power plant. Should this increase be implemented it must be
conditioned at least with serious enhancement in the quality of the electricity service to the population in
the Gaza Strip which would require an increase in the supply and the capacity of the grid.
Given this, the PA has (with the support of the international community) plans to supply the Gaza Power
Plant with natural gas to reduce the generating cost and to utilize collections from customers to pay for
IEC invoices. In addition to reducing the costs, this action will also enable it to run at full capacity which
will then reduce the power shortages in Gaza.

period 2009-2013 based on our analysis of the data received from the different Distributors.

While it is important to ensure that the mark up guarantees the payback of Distributor’s costs and includes
some profit, the tariff as currently implemented is standard and does not take into consideration the reality
on the ground as shown below. The tariff currently implemented fails to take into consideration the
following points:
 Collections reached around 81% in the West Bank in 2013 rather than 100% and this figure showed a
    drop from 90% in 2011, the first year the unified tariff was implemented.
 Technical and Non-technical losses are above the acceptable range to PERC of 22.5% reaching 25%
    in 2013.
 Governmental subsidies are not systematically paid although they amount to 4% of the electricity
    purchase value, and not all Distributors implement the subsidy scheme for specific social cases 55.
 Furthermore, although it is important to offer a life line tariff, this tariff should only target the poor
    customers and should not be applied to all customers as is the case presently.
The tariff for the prepaid meters would also need to be reviewed in particular for commercial customers.
For this customer category the prepaid meters tariff has a fixed charge of zero and is 4.5% less than the
tariff of the commercial customer with postpaid meter.

3.5.3              Sales Tariff
After analyzing the purchase tariff and the margin, it is also necessary to examine if the sales tariff
implemented by Distributors follows the approved tariff methodology issued by PERC which should
cover the operation costs of Distributors including the cost of IEC invoices.
The Palestinian Territories have a unified sales tariff which was approved by the Cabinet in 2011 and has
only been applied in the West Bank since. The electricity sales tariff 56 is recommended by the PERC for
all DISCOs - except for the East Jerusalem area where the tariff is set by the PUA directly - and for
municipalities who adopt the PERC tariff following MOLG instructions.

55
     As detailed in the next sub-section Governmental Subsidies in West Bank.


56
     The tariff is recommended by PERC to PENRA which approves it and transmits it to the cabinet for endorsement.



PwC                                                                                                   Page 43
GEDCO does not apply the unified sales tariff introduced by PERC but rather sets its own tariff which has
not changed for the last 3 years. The political situation in Gaza has not permitted PERC to exercise its
mandate on GEDCO.
PERC issued the first unified tariff in the West Bank in mid-2011, and was mandated to review the tariff
on a yearly basis57. One should note that the sales tariff prior to 2011 was determined individually by each
utility since the electricity sector only started to be regulated after the issuance by PERC of the first
unified tariff in West Bank which was then applied by all DISCOs.
The average sales tariff applied in the West Bank is higher than the average sales tariff for customers in
Israel. The West Bank residential tariff is 11% higher than its Israeli equivalent and the commercial tariff
in the West Bank is 15% higher than the Israeli commercial tariff. These figures corroborate customer’s
claims that electricity prices are too high. Chart 13 below illustrates these disparities.

An in-depth analysis of the sales tariff for the different 3 customer categories was performed for the
period 2009-2013 to assess tariff variations between the categories and whether this could partially
explain the non-payment issue.
The analysis revealed variances in the value of the sales tariff within categories between different
DISCOs as shown in the chart below. This is due to the fact that:
       The residential tariff is a step tariff and not a flat tariff. This results in variation based on
        consumption.
       Different tariffs are applied for customers with prepaid meters and customers with postpaid. The
        prepaid meter tariff does not include a fixed charge fee and is 4.5% lower than the postpaid meter
        tariff. As an example of the variation of these tariffs, we observed that the tariff for commercial
        customer with postpaid meter is 0.667 ILS/kWh whilst for a commercial customer with a prepaid
        meter it is 0.637 ILS/kWh. It is worth noting that in the past years, prepaid meters were installed in
        large quantities in the northern region of the West Bank as shown in Chart 11 Appendix I58.

3.5.4                Governmental Subsidies in West Bank59
Over the past few years, the PA has taken a number of tariff decisions to compensate for the various
increases in IEC sales tariffs and to prevent high prices impacting on end use customers. These subsidies
complement PERCs’ initiative to implement a step tariff for residential areas with the first step being a
life line tariff available for all but essentially aiming to give the poor people with low consumption a
reduced tariff. The impact of these subsidies on non-payment needs to be assessed to determine their
impact and allow appropriate action to be taken. It is also necessary to understand whether these subsidies
have been paid to Distributors by the government.
The different subsidy tariff decisions were initiated in 2011 mostly at the initiative of the government and
essentially to maintain public order and avoid public unrest after some demonstrations against increase in
prices occurred in the West Bank in the midst of the “Arab Spring”. The governmental subsidies did not
take into consideration the actual cost of electricity and the capacity of the PA to cover the subsidies
amounts. The subsidies approved by the cabinet during the period can be classified into the following
categories:
Type 1: Subsidy for each kWh sold by DISCOs60
 Cabinet Decision No. (4/94/13) for the year 2011: PERCs’ calculation of the end customer’s tariff
   reflects losses which are estimated to reach 20%. The government commits to pay to DISCOs any
   amounts for losses which go beyond 20%, if any. This decision was valid from 20/06/2011 until
   01/09/2012 in the West Bank.
 Cabinet Decision No. (04/14/14) for the year 2012: On 28 August 2012, following an increase in the
   purchase price from the IEC by 8.9% a new tariff was issued. The IEC price was only reflected up to
   25% in the costumer tariff and the remaining 75% was covered by the government in the form of
   subsidies. Decision No. (4/94/13) mentioned above was cancelled the day Decision No. (04/14/14)
   was approved.
 Cabinet Decision No. (7/45/14) for the year 2013: approved on 5 March 2013. This decision
   concerned electricity debts related to local authorities and DISCOs and included among its articles “A

        new tariff was issued, in line with the increase of 8.8% in the purchase price from the IEC. The
        government will subsidize 2.6 agora per kWh on this new tariff”.
Type 2: Subsidy for each kWh sold to all customers in Jericho area as in the following decision
 Cabinet Decision No. (14/04/14) for the year 2012: Following an increase in the purchase price of
   electricity from Jordan for the Jericho area by more than 75% (from 33 agora to 57 agora), on 1st June
   2012, PERC agreed not to reflect the increase in the sales price which was of 49 agora, and the
   government decided to subsidize the difference.
According to data provided by DISCOs, the PA only reimbursed 20% of the subsidies funds that they
owed DISCOs according to the decisions approved by the cabinet between 2011 and2013 (see Table 18
below). The outstanding subsidy payment amounts (unpaid amounts) represents around 4% of the
estimated cost of the purchased electricity for the period 2011-2013. This reveals the significant burden
that unpaid subsidies are representing on the non-payment to IEC issue and questions the effectiveness of
such a mechanism if the PA is not in a position to fund it. Annex L provides further details on the costs of
subsidies and the government payment of subsidies for DISCOs.
The non-payment by the government of the subsidies also leads Distributors to reduce the subsidy
amounts from their payments to the IEC. IEC in return collects this amount through Net Lending.
It should be noted that MOLG indicated that no municipality had been compensated through the subsidy
mechanisms.

3.6 Efficiency and transparency of Distributors
While the previous sections exposed GEDCO and JDECO as the main contributor to non-payment in
absolute figures, it is important to highlight that in terms of percentage of payments to IEC invoice,
municipalities are also not performing well. While GEDCO remains the largest non-payer in absolute
value and percentage, 4 municipalities are presently part of the top 5 largest non-payers in the West Bank.
Although the sections above have clearly identified significant factors affecting payment, it is important
to understand whether municipalities and DISCOs are performing efficiently and are diligently paying for
their invoices.

The information collected during the study has allowed the analysis to isolate the amount collected by
West Bank Distributors from the Palestinian customers and not paid to the IEC. This is estimated to
amount to 595,415,998 ILS in 2013 which represents 37% of the collected amount in that year. This
amount is probably disbursed by the different Distributors in the West Bank to cover the costs of:
 Operating expenses: to cover the operational costs of the Distributors such as salaries, network
   maintenance expenses, etc. are estimated at 0.065 ILS/kWh purchased based on a high level analysis
   on the public financial statements of JDECO, HEPCO and NEDCO amounted to 242,098,907 ILS
   (representing approximately 41% of the amount collected but not paid to the IEC).
 Capital expenses: Covering the cost of capital investment for network expansion of 120 million ILS
   (estimated at 20% of the amount collected and not paid to the IEC).
 Municipal finance and shareholder’s finance: as defined in the introduction of the report amount to
   242 million ILS which corresponds to the remaining amounts from the collection which are not paid
   to IEC (representing about 40% of the difference).
For Gaza, the difference amounts to 139,544,004 ILS which represents 34% of collection, and is
estimated to be utilized to cover:
 Operating expenses: Estimated at 0.065 ILS/kWh purchase amounting to 102,746,221 ILS
    representing 74% of the difference.


PwC                                                                           Page 47
     Capital expenses: 20% of the difference amounting to 27,908,801 ILS.
     Other: The remaining amount of 8,888,982 ILS.
DISCOs and municipalities indicated they could not provide detailed descriptions for the “municipal
finance and shareholder finance” amounts. Moreover, DISCOs and municipalities indicated they could
not provide their audited financial statements for the previous year. It was therefore not possible to know
for certain what the excess cash registered as “municipal finance and shareholder finance” was used for.
Nevertheless, DISCOs indicated that they use the excess cash for shareholder loans, advance dividend
payments and other stakeholder payments. It is obvious that the system is not transparent and lacks proper
procedures. The efficiency of DISCOs needs to be improved to ensure that amounts collected from
customers to cover the cost of the electricity service include IEC payments, operational expenses, and
capital expenses but exclude shareholder finance.
The lack of efficiency of municipalities has been pointed out by many stakeholders and it is widely
believed that municipalities do not have segregated accounts. This makes it difficult to maintain distinct
accounts for the different municipal services.
In addition, municipalities indicated that they do not systematically receive revenues from the PA for
taxes transfers, subsidies and other services which then leads them to proceed with automatic
compensation from funds collected from electricity services.
All the above clearly indicated that actions are required by the PA and from municipalities and DISCOs to
improve the payments process and ensure its transparency.


3.7 Other reasons for non–payment
3.7.1        Analysis on Special areas
The purpose of this section is to observe whether certain areas contribute more to high losses (the total of
technical and non-technical losses) and low collection. The areas selected represent all geographical areas
and include different customer types such as refugee camps and other specific sensitive areas.
The customers in these areas are supplied with electricity from different DISCOs, but the collection
behavior and volume of losses are different than for costumers outside the areas.
The analysis of the special areas did not reveal a common pattern for all these areas but rather showed that
each area has specific issues which are detailed per area below.
 JDECO- Refugee Camps
JDECO serves 13 camps within its jurisdiction, one of them is located in Jerusalem in area C21 and the
remaining camps are located in the West Bank in area A21. JDECO reported the following consumption
characteristics in camps in 2013.
It is important to note that the average consumption per customer inside the camps is equivalent to 175%
of the average customer outside the camps. This disparity is mainly due to electricity theft which leads to
increased consumption without accompanying growth in the number of customers. It is believed that
some small commercial facilities also contribute to the problem by opening businesses inside the camps,
benefitting from the camp location to avoid payment of their electricity bills.
The table below shows that the uncollected sales from the camps reached around 29 million ILS in 2013,
which represents 20% of the total JDECO uncollected sales for that year. Increasing the collection inside
the camps from 30% to 95% would increase JDECOs’ total collection from 83% to 87%, which equates to
approximately 26.5 million ILS.




PwC                                                                      Page 48
While customers in the camps only represent 5.3% of JDECO’s total customers, their total losses 63 (63%)
amount to around 21% of JDECO’s total losses in 2013. Reducing the losses in the camps to a mere 20%
would save JDECO around 37 million ILS/year.
Shuafat camp located in Jerusalem area has the highest collection rate reaching 75% while all the other
camps located in West Bank have a collection rate in the range of 15%-20%. Although the collection rate
is very high in Shuafat refugee camp electricity losses are very high, reaching 60% (believed to be non-
technical losses essentially).

 NEDCO65- Refugee camps66
While the average consumption per customer inside and outside the camps is almost similar, collection in
the camps is very low and has been decreasing consistently. As is the case for HEPCO, the decrease in
collection is mainly the result of a lack of punitive measures for non-payers due to NEDCO’s inability to
take legal actions against them. Increasing the collection rate in the camps to the same level as the average
collection rate for NEDCO would result in a yearly revenue increase for NEDCO of around 9 million ILS
(which represents 4% of the total sales).

   The consumption of electricity by the camps is measured by monitoring meters installed by JDECO at each of the transformers supplying the camps.
The reading of these monitoring meters is then compared to the reading of the customer’s meters inside the camps to estimate the total losses (technical
and non-technical losses).

   More historical data was not provided.

   NEDCO does not have monitoring meters installed at the transformers supplying the old city and therefore could not report on the total area
consumption and losses.

To further refine the analysis of non-payment in the refugee camps, focus groups were held to determine
the motives of non-payment and understand the perception of the electricity Distributors in major camps.
The overall perception of Distributors is negative as they are alleged to be solely profit oriented and
failing or slow to meet the needs of their customers. Contributing factors to this perception included poor
communication skills by Distributors, the lack of customer services, and the lack of concern showed by
the Distributors to the residents of the camp.
Participants further complained about the high cost of electricity at a time of acute unemployment and
dire economic situation. The lack of economic opportunities, the high taxation, and penalties all
contribute negatively to the customer’s willingness to pay for electricity bills .
The electricity network in both camps was reported to be in poor condition and technicians mandated to
fix electricity problems were not only delayed but also reported to be lacking in courtesy. The lack of
payment points for customers to go and settle their invoices as well as the absence of other basic customer
services (i.e., recharging of prepaid meters) were also reported as points of concern.
Representatives of the Popular Committee69 in the Amari Refugee Camp also reported that one of the
byproducts of the accumulation of arrears was the impact on housing prices. For example, if someone
owns a home valued at JD 20,000 in a refugee camp with JD 10,000 in accumulated arrears, the buyer
would simply offset the difference between the value of the home and the amount of the arrears paying it
directly to the Distributor. Finally, the unprofessional behavior of electricity Distributor technicians was
also raised by the Popular Committee representatives who indicated that this behavior conveyed a
negative image of the Distributor which then discouraged customers from paying or communicating with
them.


 Gaza Strip Refugee Camps Focus Group70
The perception of Distributors in the Gaza focus group was quite negative with comments such as: “poor
service”, “being solely profit oriented”, “lacking empathy” and “having prices that are too high”.
Contributing factors to this perception included poor communication skills by Distributor employees
including a lack of empathy towards ordinary citizens.
Participants overwhelmingly highlighted that electricity costs including payment of arrears represented a
huge burden on households. In several instances, participants complained about the direct deduction from
civil servants family members’ salaries of 170 ILS/month. Participants also requested that amnesties be
granted to customers with accumulated arrears.
Participants appealed for an organizational restructuring of GEDCO to improve customer services, revise
electricity prices and pricing policies including perceived excessive taxation and penalties. GEDCO
collectors were pointed out and criticized for receiving commissions on collections from end users.

 HEPCO- Hebron old City (H2)71
Collection in H271 area has been decreasing consistently throughout the years. The decrease in collection
is mainly as a result of weak law enforcement for non-payers due to HEPCO’s inability to take legal
actions against them in H2 area. Contributing to the issue is the fact that we believe that an increasing

   Following the 1995 Oslo Agreement and subsequent 1997 Hebron Agreement, Palestinian cities were placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Palestinian Authority, with the exception of Hebron, which was split into two sectors: H1 controlled by the Palestinian Authority and H2 controlled by
Israel. Around 120,000 Palestinians live in H1, while around 30,000 Palestinians along with around 700 Israelis remain under Israeli military control in
H2.

number of customers believe that the PA is directly paying for their invoices to IEC. If it were possible to
raise the collection rate from the old city to average collection rate for HEPCO for 2013 of 95%, it would
result in an increase of HEPCO’s yearly revenue by 14 million ILS (which represents 7% of the total
sales).

 NEDCO - Howwarah and Einabos Villages
These 2 villages are located close to Nablus city in area A21 and whilst they had high collection rates in
2010, this deteriorated in 2011 and 2012. In parallel with the drop in collection, electricity consumption
increased rapidly during these years largely due to the access to free electricity.

The table above shows that collection rate from Nablus old city is high and the consumption per capita is
in the national average. The old city of Nablus is under area A21 which is fully controlled by the PA; this
may explain the difference between Nablus old city which is under area A21 and Hebron old city which is
under area H271.

  The losses in Hebron old city are not reported. HEPCO does not have monitoring meters installed at the transformers supplying the old city and could
therefore not report on the total area consumption and losses.

       Social cases
Cabinet Decision No. (7/45/14) approved on 5 March 2013. This decision concerns electricity debts
related to local authorities and DISCOs and included among its articles “The Government will cover the
monthly cost of the first 150kWh for social cases registered at MOSA” .
8,759 social cases, supplied by three DISCOs, benefited from the Governmental subsidy Decision during
the reported period. While these DISCOs supplied the social cases with a monthly 150kWh free of charge,
the Government has not yet compensated the DISCOs. The absence of governmental reimbursement is
affecting DISCOs and contributes to the non-payment issue.

       Incentives
On 30/12/2012 the Camps agreement was adopted including the following: All debts starting January
2008 up to the end of December 2012 will be covered by the government for those costumers accepting
this agreement.
Cabinet Decision No (7/45/14) for the year 2013: approved on 5 March 2013. This decision concerns
electricity debts related to local authorities and DISCOs. The decision offered the following incentives for
costumers to pay their bills.
        o Any customer committed to pay his invoice will be rewarded with a 10% deduction on his monthly
          invoice. This deduction will be subsidized by the government.
        o Any indebted customer who pays an additional 10% to his bill to reimburse his debt will be offered
          a 10% cancellation to his debt. This cancellation will be subsidized by the government.
The incentive schemes mentioned above and approved by the Government aimed to enhance DISCO’s
collections by targeting the camps and cancelling old debts in exchange of payments. These incentive
schemes were contested by Palestinian Political Fractions and people outside the camps which were
demanding that customers outside the camps should also benefit from these advantages. These protests
led the government to extend these cabinet decisions to all customers outside the camps. Yet, the camp
agreement was never implemented and the status quo continued.
Even without being implemented, these incentive schemes created discontent within the Palestinian
population outside camps which is assumed to have impacted these customers’ payments of electricity
invoices.

 4.          Conclusion
4.1.     Summary of analysis
In the past years, non-payment has reached unprecedented levels in the West Bank and Gaza and
represents a significant financial burden for the Palestinian Authority. The previous sections of the report
have analyzed in detail the data collected to understand the main causes of this non-payment. This
concluding section summarizes the main findings related to the non-payment.
To present a consolidated representation of the non-payment situation issue, we have analyzed its impact
throughout the end to end financial payment cycle:
1.    Purchases from IEC and other Suppliers
2.    Losses between quantity purchased and quantity invoiced (sold) to customers
3.    Collected amount from sold electricity
4.    Payments to IEC and other Suppliers
5.    Non-Payment amount split between Net Lending and Debt
The graph below illustrates the financial impact of the payment shortages in the payment cycle as well as
issues arising from the purchase and sales tariff levels.

The analysis in the previous sections revealed that the 92% of the total contribution to non-payments
during the period was caused by 10 Distributors in the West Bank + GEDCO. Out of the 92%, GEDCO
and JDECO are the largest contributors to the non-payment representing 68% of the total non-payment of
electricity in the West Bank and Gaza. GEDCO contributed to 55.4% of the total West Bank and Gaza
Net Lending during the period while JDECO contributed to 68.7% of the total West Bank and Gaza debt
up to February 2014.
Electricity losses are considered to be excessive although they remained stable throughout the period. In
addition, it emerged that Distributors do not have the necessary tools to measure losses properly and that
the split between technical and non-technical losses is mostly based on estimates. Due to losses
amounting to 479 million ILS in the West Bank and 247 million ILS in Gaza in 2013, the invoiced
electricity sales could barely cover the cost of electricity purchases.
The collections from customers continuously decreased with the exception of Gaza which has witnessed a
constant increase mostly due to the deductions by MOF of the civil servant salaries. Nevertheless, the
collection in Gaza is still lower than in the West Bank.
The sales tariff does not take into consideration the limitations of the market. The sales tariff includes a
governmental subsidy which was only partially paid by the PA to the Distributors and the actual losses for
most of the Distributors are higher than the lost threshold included in the tariff methodology. Regardless
of these, the sales tariff to the Palestinian customer is still high and higher than the sales tariff to the
Israeli consumers, which is mostly due to the high purchase tariff from the IEC.
Cash collected by Distributors from electricity invoices were not systematically utilized to cover
electricity related matters. Distributors choose to cover their operational expenses and other expenses such
as municipal finance and shareholder finance before settling their invoices to the IEC. These clearly
reveal a governance issue within Distributors which needs to be urgently addressed to improve their
efficiency and the level of payments to the IEC.
Special areas such as refugee camps exhibited most of the issues mentioned above, resulting in high levels
of non-payment. Nevertheless, these areas did not contribute greatly to the overall non-payment as they
only represent a small number of customers and a limited proportion of total invoiced amounts.

4.2.   Invoice reconciliation and cycle
The analysis revealed that there are no procedures for the invoicing of electricity from the IEC to the
Palestinian Distributors and that the process currently implemented is not harmonized for all Distributors
and lacks transparency.
Distributors in various areas of the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip do not have access to meters and do
not receive IEC invoices regularly. In the absence of information on electricity charges, many Distributors
do not pay for electricity that has been delivered.
Furthermore, as the PUA does not provide detailed information on purchase price of electricity including
the components of the tariff applied to Distributors in the West Bank and Gaza, the opacity of the invoice
process becomes more acute.
In addition, the interest rate for late payment unilaterally set by the PUA is high and reflects that of a
retail (residential/small commercial) customer rather than that of a wholesale customer represented by the
Palestinian market.
Finally, the Israeli deductions from the clearance revenue are not implemented in a consistent and fully
transparent manner and do not follow clearly agreed upon procedures, and are therefore difficult to
predict. Debts should appear on the invoices and be reconciled with the payments.

The IEC has recently provided important data related to invoices to its Palestinian counterparts, which has
enabled a much stronger reconciliation of net-lending accounts. IEC is now also regularly providing
invoices, which is necessary for payment requirements to be understood. Further institutionalized
regulated and transparent cooperation between the IEC, PUA and PETL is recommended, in order to
improve information and payment flows.

4.3.   Non-Payment from Distributors to the IEC
Between 2010 and 2013, Palestinian electricity Distributors in the West Bank did not pay 37% of their
total bills to IEC and this figure reached 100% in Gaza.
The total contribution of the Top 10+1 (GEDCO) non-payers reached 92%. GEDCO is largest non-payer
accounting for more than 1.7 billion (471 million US$) or 41.8% of the total non-payments to the IEC
between 2009 and 2013 while it only purchased 21% of the total electricity sold by the IEC in 2013.
During the same period, JDECO was the second largest non-payer contributing to more than 1.1 billion
ILS (297 million US$) or 26.3%e of the total IEC non-payments while accounting for around 40% of the
total electricity purchases to the IEC in 2013.
The remaining 9 Distributors between them accounted for 1 billion ILS (271 million US$) or 24% of the
total non-payment. The split between these Distributors is as follows: HEPCO: 7.4%, NEDCO: 7.2%,
Tulkarem municipality: 3.5%, SELCO: 2.8%, Qalqiliya: 1.1%, TEDCO: 1%, Qabatia council: 0.2%, Beit
Awwa village: 0.5%, Beit Ummar: 0.4%.
As mentioned previously, non-payment from GEDCO essentially comprises Net Lending while non-
payment from JDECO mainly includes debts to the IEC. Substantial reduction in non-payment will only
take place by ensuring that measures implemented target these two DISCOs and are tailored to respond to
the specific issues and patterns found in the two utilities.
Non-payment during the period in the Palestinian Territory also constantly and rapidly increased. In 2010,
37% of the total electricity invoiced was not paid and this figure jumped to 58% in 2013.
The level and increase in non-payment can be attributed to a variety of factors as detailed in the report
including losses, collection, tariff and efficiency of Distributors. The study nevertheless showed that non-
payment from the Palestinian Distributors to IEC is not connected to the poverty level of the customers
supplied by these Distributors.

4.4.    Electricity Losses
Although the level of losses remained the same in the past years, its level is still above acceptable limits.
Distributors do not have proper tools to measure losses and cannot differentiate between technical and
non-technical losses. GEDCO, in particular, does not have the necessary tools to assess the losses on its
grid and it cannot access the meters which would allow for proper measurement and classification of
losses.
Losses in GEDCO and JDECO concession area are reported to reach significantly high levels and should
be dealt with as a priority.
In the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the levels of electricity losses result in significant revenue losses –
these amounted to 726 million ILS. In the West Bank, due to losses, the amounts invoiced to end
customers only cover the cost of purchases from the IEC and do not cover Distributor’s costs such as
operating costs, investments costs, profits or dividends. The amount invoiced for customers in Gaza only
accounts for two thirds of the electricity purchases for the Strip while one third of the purchased quantity
(247 million ILS) was lost either as a technical or non-technical loss.

4.5.    Collection from customers
The overall collection rate in the West Bank and Gaza for the period between 2010 and 2013 is better than
expected but the trend shows that customer payment has consistently been decreasing in the West Bank
and increasing in the Gaza Strip. The increase in payment rate could be attributed to the successful
implementation of an automatic deduction from civil servant salaries for electricity bills in Gaza.
Overall, the Special Areas and the Palestinian Authority are the poorest payers and their performances are
suspected to negatively impact the payment behavior of other customers.
The main reasons attributed to the deterioration of the collection rate in the West Bank can be
summarized as follows:
1. Israeli deductions from the clearance revenue which gives the impression that customer bills are paid
   for by the PA: for example, the collection rate for JDECO dropped to 83% in 2013 following the first
   Israeli deduction to cover parts of the JDECO debts to the IEC.
2. PA introduced incentives for customers committed to pay their bills and for the indebted customers to
   reschedule their debts. As an example JDECO deducted 14 million ILS from committed customers
   since starting this initiative and cancelled 8 million ILS of debt for indebted customers and yet the
   Palestinian Government did not compensate JDECO for these amounts.
3. Unpaid bills from the PA institutions in particular for water pumps. As a result, most of the DISCOs
   are calculating their debts to MOF with the unpaid consumption of the PA institutions and
   compensating themselves. This unilateral settlement between the DISCOs and MOF is not done
   consistently or systematically and is time consuming. The payment by the PA of its electricity
   consumption can raise the collection by 3%-5%.
4. Municipalities do not pay for their bills for municipal services like street lights and water pumping
   bills. Were these to be paid, it would increase the collection by 1.5%-2.5%.
5. The subsidy that is made available for social cases is not repaid by the government to the DISCOs
   which then contribute to a lower collection rate.
6. Low collection from special areas like camps and certain villages. If these could be increased to
   benchmark levels, collection rates would increase by 4%-6%.
7. Quality of the services received from Distributors in the West Bank and Gaza has been severely
   criticized by customers.




PwC                                                                       Page 56
4.6.      Tariff
The purchase tariff is set unilaterally by the PUA as a bulk tariff for medium or low voltage. This
purchase tariff appears very high for the nature of the supply relationship, and with payment conditions
that do not reflect this relationship. The purchase tariff is not fully transparency as it includes many
unknown costs.
The Palestinian Authority has been involved in talks with its Israeli counterpart for the past 10 years to
negotiate a commercial agreement. Progress on reaching an agreement has been slow and must be
concluded to give appropriate and clear pricing of electricity sales.74
Starting 2011, PERC has been setting the sales tariff to the Palestinian customers based on a cost plus
approach to cover the cost of electricity purchased from IEC as well as the operational expenses and
acceptable profit margin for Distributors. The methodology stipulated that the tariff would undergo yearly
reviews and amendments to include benchmarks for certain KPIs like losses and operating cost in order to
enhance the efficiency of DISCOs. Unfortunately, the tariff has not been reviewed since its
implementation. Nevertheless, PERC is currently in the process of reviewing the different tariff
components including the impact of removing subsidies and the inclusion of certain financial and quality
KPIs.
The difference between the sales and the purchase tariff, which is the tariff margin, reached 54% after the
new tariff was implemented. When the tariff was first applied, this margin was considered to be sufficient
to cover all the cost of Distributors and estimated to even allow them to earn small profits.
Since then, the tariff margin has decreased in the West Bank going from 54% to 40% between 2010 and
2013 largely due to:
1- The subsidies included in the tariff which are mostly not repaid by the Government; and
2- The high increase of the purchase electricity from IEC.
Distributors did not collect enough to cover all their financial obligations including electricity purchase
and operating costs.
Therefore in order to avoid an increase of sales tariff, PETL should finalize the commercial agreement
with the IEC, PERC should set benchmarks for Distributors to reduce operational expenses and
Distributors should cooperate with relevant electricity authorities to improve their efficiency.
In Gaza, the average purchase tariff from all the sources is nearly equal to the average sales tariff.
GEDCO should review at least its commercial tariff which is currently 20% less than West Bank
commercial tariff.
With the support of the international community, the PA has plans to supply the Gaza Power Plant with
natural gas to reduce the generating cost and to utilize collections from customers to pay for IEC invoices.
In addition to reducing the costs, this action will also enable it to run at full capacity which will then
reduce the power shortages in Gaza.
As mentioned above, in 2011 the PA introduced subsidies amounting to 200 million ILS up to the end of
2013 as part of the tariff. These governmental subsidies were adopted for political reasons essentially to
satisfy customers. Unfortunately due to the weak financial situation of the PA, MOF only repaid 40
million ILS out of the 200 million ILS total. The non-payment of these subsidies created more deficits to
Distributors which often chose to compensate for this cost by reducing their payments to the IEC. The
subsidies outstanding payment (unpaid amounts) represents about 4% of the estimated cost of the
purchase of electricity of West Bank Distributors during the period 2011-2013.



74
   The PA and IEC are willing to reach a commercial agreement, but IEC stated that paying the debt will facilitate the negotiations of the commercial
agreement.

4.7.    Efficiency and transparency of Distributors
According to the Electricity law only licensed Distributors can sell electricity to customers. The law was
implemented in 2009 to compel municipalities to join DISCOs and reach the target of operation of four
efficient DISCOs in the Palestinian Territories, three in the West Bank and one in Gaza. While many
municipalities never joined DISCOs, the existing DISCOs (which built structures to serve complete
regions) remained highly inefficient in the absence of functioning economy of scales. On the other hand
municipalities kept their inefficient structure.
In addition to that Distributors (especially municipalities and village) have opaque financial systems with
unclear payment mechanism and municipalities were reported not to proceed with segregation of
accounts.
DISCOs also appear to be only moderately transparent showing an inability to report properly on their
finances. They are considered to be highly influenced by the internal political environment in which they
operate.
The analysis included in section 3.6 related to the efficiency and transparency of Distributors revealed that
Distributors chose to cover operation costs, investment costs and payments to shareholders before paying
invoices to the IEC which is one of the reasons for the Non-Payment in the West Bank. Distributors were
reported to finance their shareholders through dividends and loans reaching 242 million ILS, although
they did not complete their invoice payments to the IEC.
NEDCO, HEPCO and SELCO, in particular, indicated they use part of the collection and proceed with ad
hoc payments to their municipal shareholders.
Municipalities on the other hand disburse funds collected from electricity sales to cover the payment of
other services such as education health, project finance, rehabilitation projects, etc. All these payments are
categorized under “municipal finance”.
4.8.    Others reasons for non-payment
The analysis of the special area revealed that collection in these areas is usually low, but significant
differences in collection trend and behavior were nevertheless observed identified in these areas. In terms
of absolute figures, the contribution of these areas to non-payment is quite low as they do not cover
extensive areas or large numbers of customers For example; special areas in JDECO (refugee camps) only
represent 21% of JDECO non-payment to IEC in 2013.
Nevertheless, in refugee camps, the consumption per capita reached unprecedented level and losses –
believed to be non-technical - are significantly higher than in the rest of the Palestinian Territories.
Specific issues related to affordability and arrears in these areas were addressed by the PA through
incentive and subsidy for social cases as detailed in section 3.7.2. Unfortunately, the subsidies for social
cases were never paid by the government which negatively impacted the non-payment. Incentives to
refugee camps on the other hand were never implemented due to refusal of refugee customer camps to
pay for their electricity consumption.
The special arrears analyzed in this report (in particular the refugee camps and the old city of Hebron) are
considered to be areas requiring special political attention to address issues related to non-payment. Law
enforcement in these areas is challenging and requires endorsement of the highest authority from the PA
as well as the representatives of these areas.
Distributors in coordination with the PA should nevertheless continue to address these issues, it is crucial
for the utilities to also deal with the problem of public perception through media campaigns and customer
engagement training for their employees
This focus on the special areas should not prevent the Distributors from acting to address non-payment in
all other areas. For example, the JDECO refugee camps only contribute 27% of the total JDECO losses,
meaning that 73% of the losses are actually located within the remaining area of JDECO jurisdiction.

 5.               PA action plans and current donor programs
Introduction
The development and implementation of an inclusive operational and financial action plan by all sector
stakeholders is essential to address the issue of non-payment, losses and reduce “Net Lending” in the
West Bank and Gaza.
This section looks to present and assess the various Palestinian stakeholders’ action plans and the sectorial
activities carried by donor programs to determine the extent to which these plans are addressing or will
address non-payment of electricity and/or reduction of losses. In assessing each action proposed by these
plans, we have also proposed amendments to the actions building on the analysis provided in the previous
sections of this report. A summary of a revised action plan that builds on these actions and activities for
the short, medium and long term is then presented.
It is essential to note that the proposed revised action plan builds on the existing plans of the PA and the
current donor programs. Although anticipated to lead to improvements in payment performance, the
different actions suggested in the revised action plan should be implemented as part of a cohesive broader
plan monitored and regulated by a coordination entity comprising all sector stakeholders. The action plan
recommends the development of the electricity sector through continued institutional reform combined
with legal and regulatory improvements and supported by infrastructure development, particularly to
consolidate and monitor electricity supply and strengthen PENRAs’ capacity to enforce payments.
Finally, the revised action plan builds on conclusions stemming from the analysis in this report and builds
on current strategies and actions implemented by PENRA and the PA supported by the international
donor community.

5.1.         Stakeholders’ existing and planned action plans
The current unstable fiscal situation in the Palestinian Territories has constrained the PA ’s abilities to
intensify its actions and policies aimed at significantly reducing Net Lending which represents major
burden on its finances. To reach this objective, with the support of donors, the PA adopted specific
measures to increase collections and reduce debts from customers to Distributors and from Distributors to
IEC.
In 2008 with the support of the World Bank, Norway, and the European Investment Bank, the PA initiated
the “Electric Utility Management Project (EUMP)” with the overall objective of improving the efficiency
and quality of electricity supply in the Palestinian areas through: (i) financing of critical investments for
the strengthening and rehabilitation/ extensions of the transmission and distribution system in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip and (ii) assisting with the implementation of sector reforms, capacity building and
training. The intended outcome of this ongoing project is to contribute to a reduction in the non-payment
issue in West Bank and Gaza. Under this program and with the support of the donor community, the PA
initiated the following institutional and infrastructure developments:

       Establishment of PERC and funding of its startup operation cost for more than 3 years75
       Establishment of PETL and funding of its startup operation up to mid-201575
       Establishment of NEDCO and partial coverage of its 2 years operation cost
       Promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency programs
       Procurement and installation of large numbers of prepaid meters
       Rehabilitation of low voltage and medium voltage electricity network
       Construction of 4 high voltage substations and development of the associated distribution systems.

With the support from the European Union, in 2011, the PA initiated the reform of the electricity sector
including the restructuring of its institution as well as the building of the capacity of its employees.
In addition to these programs and in light of the deteriorating situation in the sector (namely a sharp drop
in payments of electricity bills from Distributors and end-customers), the PA took a set of measures to
expand its control over the sector and increase collection. The following measures were adopted and
implemented in the last 2 years:
      In 2012, the PA (represented by the Prime Minister Dr. Salam Fayyad) agreed with the representatives
       of the refugee camp committees to start a new era of payments from the camps costumers. This
       agreement, detailed in Appendix J was based on incentives for costumers to pay their bills as well as
       penalties for electricity thefts. Nevertheless, following protests by customers outside camps and
       political factions the agreement was not implemented. Protestors had required the agreement to be
       extended from camp customers to all customers. To act in response to this demand, the cabinet
       proposed the implementation of measures to encourage customers to pay for their electricity debts by
       offering incentives to customers who were prepared to commit to paying for their invoices. In 2013,
       an agreement was signed with Distributors and endorsed by the cabinet offering deductions on
       monthly electricity bills to customers with no arrears and deductions on arrears for customers who
       accepted a schedule to settle their arrears. The cost of these deductions was to be covered by the PA in
       the form of subsidy. Although the agreement was implemented it did not have a major impact on the
       reduction of the non-payment.
      In 2012, the Palestinian President ratified an amendment to the Electricity Law to include punitive
       actions for electricity theft. This measure led Palestinian Courts to penalize offenders (i.e.: extract on
       court order from Al Quds newspaper).

      On 9 February 2014, the Government established a Special Committee comprising members of MOF,
       MOLG, MOI, MOE and PENRA to solve the electricity debt issue. On 25 February 2014, following
       recommendations from the Special Committee, the cabinet issued a decision stating that:
       1. All electricity Distributors, within a maximum period of 30 days from the date of issuance of this
           decision, are required to reschedule the reimbursement of their debts to MOF which were
           deducted from the Ministry’s clearing account for the benefit of the IEC.
       2. All electricity Distributors shall commit to pay for their electricity bills received from the IEC
          excluding the allotment corresponding to the governmental subsidy to support the electricity
          sector.
       3. The cabinet is empowered to proceed with lawsuits against representatives of Distributors in the
          case where it has been proven that public money has been compromised.
       4. All benefits and financial aids from the Ministry of Finance and/or any governmental body shall
          be halted to any electricity Distributors failing to abide by the rules and regulations set in this
          decision.
       5. All electricity Distributors are required to provide MOF and PENRA with their IEC billing and
          payment information within 3 business days of receiving the invoice or making payment to IEC.
       6. To ensure the successful implementation of the present agreement, all electricity Distributors must
          apply for a meeting with the special electricity committee, where the committee shall examine the
          status of each Distributor and propose tailored recommendations for approval by the cabinet.
       7. The special electricity committee will perform quarterly reviews of all rules and regulations
          included in this decision and will update and propose amendments to the cabinet whenever
          deemed necessary.
While the cabinet responses attempted to address the issue of non-payment, Palestinian institutions
developed distinct operational actions plans to tackle the issue and proposed specific measures to reduce
the Net Lending. Most of these actions are detailed in their action plans which with the assistance from
the World Bank, were collected from the relevant institutions and are included in Appendix J of the
report.

5.2.       Assessment of Palestinian stakeholder’s existing and planned action plans
To ensure a cohesive approach and understanding of the different measures implemented by the PA, the
actions have been classified in line with the conclusions of the analysis.
The following section lists the different actions implemented by the PA in response to non-payment,
provides a comprehensive description of these actions as well as an assessment detailing the impact of

these actions as reported in the top down and bottom up analysis of the report. The section also suggests
future areas of focus to build on these actions.

5.2.1.     Fundamental actions
Establishment of Special Committee comprising members of MOF, MOLG, MOI, MOE and PENRA to
solve the electricity debt issue.
This cabinet decision is one of the most important recent actions from the PA to solve the non-payment
issue. The Special Committee which took office early 2014 has already been very active in proposing
different specific actions to improve payment results, as can be seen from the action list below.
Proposed improvement: Although the Committee had been mandated to make recommendations to the
cabinet on actions to tackle the debt issue, it was strongly recommended that the mandate of this entity to
deal with the issue of non-payment in a cohesive way should be increased further. The Committee should
be empowered to lead all the activities related to non-payment and monitor the implementation of these
activities. It is suggested that the Committee supervises and coordinates with all Palestinian stakeholders
and donor communities the implementation of the revised action plan. In order to ensure the success of
the Committee it is recommended to have a secretariat established to support the committee and perform
daily tasks related to the mandate of the Committee. The expanded roles and responsibilities of the
Committee will need to be developed and agreed with all sector stakeholders. The secretariat could be
supported by the donor community.

5.2.2.     Invoice reconciliation and cycle
Establish a central database between MOF, PETL and Distributors
This web-based database will connect the MOF with all Distributors providing a separate access to
Distributors via secured login information system to enter the following data:
1- Scanned copies of IEC monthly invoices
2- Connection point codes and invoice amounts
3- Scanned copy of payments executed to IEC
4- Cost of electricity sales to PA institutions supplied by Distributors
This database will be linked to the MOF database to enable Distributors to monitor revenues that they are
entitled to from the MOF and follow up on transfers. In addition, PETL will receive copies of monthly
invoices from the IEC for all connection points and will record this data in the database and perform
comparisons with the data entered by Distributors.
This database, currently being developed by USAID through its ICI project, is expected to be operational
by July 2014. It will be an essential tool to monitor non-payment and take rapid corrective actions. A few
challenges as detailed below await the effective operation of this database:
 Sustainability: The database is being designed through a donor funded project expected to terminate
    shortly. The Web-site source code will be delivered to the Ministry of Finance (MOF), hence the
    programing language will available to MOF. Therefore, MOF will be able to make any updates on the
    website after the one year warranty.
 Cooperation: The significance of this database relies exclusively on the full and continuous
    cooperation of all stakeholders including the IEC which should commit to provide PETL with a copy
    of monthly invoices and small villages which might not have the capability to transfer required
    information to the database.
Proposed improvement: It is recommended that with the assistance of the international donor community,
the PA shall guarantee the sustainability of the operation and maintenance of this database by allocating
the specialized personal and funds.

It is recommended for this database to be connected to the IEC which will require the full cooperation of
the IEC, or to ensure the development of parallel database connecting PETL to the IEC for transfer of data
and information between these entities on invoicing and payments. The on-going USAID-financed ICI
project plans to have a screen for IEC on the website. The Palestinian MOF and PETL will be able to
identify IEC authorities on this website.
In addition, it is recommended to establish a shared services centre to consolidate IT support processes
from all Distributors into a standalone entity serving them back. As part of the consolidation, the
processes should be reengineered and standardized to eliminate costs through economies of scale,
eliminate redundant activities, reduce head count and delivery of high-quality services. The estimated cost
of such a shared service centre is 3.5 million US$; however it is estimated to save about 2 million US$ of
Distributor’s operational costs each year.

5.2.3.     Non-Payment from Distributors to the IEC
Commercial agreement between PETL and IEC
This action is included in both the action plans of the MOF and PENRA. The purpose of this commercial
agreement is to ensure a transparent commercial relationship between PETL, the sole electricity buyer
authorized by law and the IEC. The Palestinian counterpart to the agreement is aiming for a reduced price
(export tariff) and improved payment conditions. The IEC, in return will require payment guarantees
which could be provided through external support.. Currently the IEC only has bilateral supplier to
customer relationships with each connection point owner.
This action is expected to significantly reduce non-payment as it is expected to
 Increase the DISCOs sales tariff margin and increase their ability to pay IEC invoices following the
   expected reduction in the purchase price.
 Secure continuous channel and flow of information with the IEC allowing for better monitoring of
   payments.
 Enhance the payment conditions for PETL which will in turn improve the Palestinian DISCOs
   payment schedule.
Proposed improvement: This action will not only require the cooperation of the relevant IEC stakeholders
including PUA, the IEC and the electricity officer from the Israeli Civil Administration but also the
commitment of PETL to pay IEC invoices and provide guarantees for such commitment. This action
should be monitored by the Special Committee.


Distributors to pay all invoices excluding government subsidies and to report to MOF and PENRA on
IEC invoices and payments within 3 business days of receiving the invoice or making payment to the
IEC.
This cabinet action driven by the Special Committee to solve the debt issue, demonstrates the
governments’ commitment to cutting back non-payment and ensuring that Palestinian financial
obligations towards the IEC are met in due time.
Proposed improvement: While the impact of this action on the reduction of the non-payment is very
promising, its success cannot be ensured as explained below. The action aims to induce Distributors to
pay for their invoices but neglects to address the payment of subsidies. Whereas Distributors could pledge
to pay, the subsidy share excluded from the equation would go unpaid and would add up as debt to the
IEC anticipated to be deducted from the clearance revenue on behalf of the Distributors. According to
anecdotal evidence, this decision seems to have been taken following MOFs’ inability to comply with a
previous cabinet decision requiring the ministry to proceed with the payment of subsidy to Distributors. It
is recommended that the subsidy component is removed from this action to ensure its successful
implementation.



PwC                                                                      Page 63
The action further requires Distributors to report to MOF and PENRA on IEC invoices and payments. The
establishment and maintenance of lasting communication channels for the transmission of information
and reporting from Distributors is essential for proper monitoring of this action and it is recommended
that this responsibility is transferred to the Special Committee rather than only involving MOF and
PENRA.
This action will also need to be complemented by follow up legal actions in cases of non-payment as
described in pillar 4 “legal pillar”. The constant flow of information on payments from the Distributors
will enable the PA to take quick legal actions against offenders and prevent payment of additional fees
resulting from late payment. The analysis of the monthly direct payment data76 from Distributors revealed
that the absence of payment from NEDCO to IEC during the first half of 2013 led the utility to pay
increased fees later in the year to compensate for late payment of invoices.
In light of the current political relations between West Bank and Gaza this action may not realistically
apply to GEDCO for the immediate future.

Legal actions from Cabinet against Distributors not complying with the decision if proven that public
money is compromised.
This action included in the action plans of MOF, MOLG & PENRA is in line with the cabinet decision
“Approving the guarantees of electricity payments” issued in February 2014. The legal actions c an lead to
removal of municipal councils or requests to the anticorruption committee to investigate if non-payment
to IEC is considered to be miss financial management and public money is compromised. In such an event
the management of the Distributors can be brought to court.
Renewable Energy
One of the main objectives of the renewable energy projects included in the PENRA action plan is to
diversity the supply of electricity and reduce the amounts purchased from the IEC thereby decreasing the
energy dependence on the IEC.
During the last quarter of 2012 the cabinet approved the Palestinian Renewable Strategy up to 2020. The
strategy aims to generate a total of 240GWh from the different renewable sources through a 2 phased
approach. The first phase will run from 2012 to 2015 while the second phase will extend from 2016 to
2020. Phase I focuses on the promotion of renewable sources, the issuance of relevant regulations and the
implementation of the Palestinian Solar Initiative (PSI) supporting the installation of 5 MW solar power
on rooftops of buildings with 1,000 residential customers during the period 2013-2015. To ensure the
implementation of the PSI initiative PERC issued the first Feed in Tariff (FIT) regulations and the project
was launched early 2013. In the first half of 2013, the private sector expressed interest in installing solar
power systems on rooftops. Unfortunately, shortly after, MOFs’ inability to pay the FIT through DISCOs
caused a major setback to the implementation of the initiative. To overcome this drawback, PERC
proposed to the cabinet that the DISCOs should finance the FIT through their payment in concept of
licensing fees that shall be transferred to MOF to finance PERC. This proposal was unsuccessful as only
two DISCOs are licensed and some even took the initiative to suspend payments to customers.
Nevertheless, a few DISCOs chose to self-finance the initiative in some municipal buildings and public
buildings in camps as an act of social responsibility.
Proposed improvement: A proposal to overcome this setback would be to accelerate the issuance of net
metering regulations and finalize consultations between DISCOs and PENRA on this issue. In addition
soft financing to encourage the energy renewable projects for the private sector similar to the Energy
Efficiency initiative launched by the AFD 77 could be introduced to support the implementation of
renewable projects.


76
     See Appendix D
77
     As detailed in Action II.4



PwC                                                                       Page 64
This action is closely linked to the reduction of non-payment. Therefore to encourage the implementation
of renewable projects it is recommended that:
 PERC/PENRA be encouraged to issue net metering regulations;
 A revolving fund is established to ensure the implementation of small size solar power project in
    public buildings, which could be financed by donors through this fund similarly to the AFD finance of
    the revolving fund for energy efficiency;
 Soft loans mechanisms are developed by Palestinian banks for the private sector to implement small
    size renewable projects; and
 Donors may assist the PA to achieve the objectives set in the renewable strategy by providing the
    necessary financing tools. The implementation of medium or large scale renewable projects by the
    private sector require the generation cost for these projects to be competitive with the IEC purchase
    price. If these prices are higher, it will require subsidy from the MOF or will result in an increase in
    the sales price of electricity to the Palestinian customers.

Energy efficiency measures
This action plan is introduced in the PENRA action plan. PENRA has set indicative targets for energy
efficiency and proposed a 5% saving in the overall end user electricity demand by 2020. To support this
aim, PENRA committed 4 million US$ of AFD funding to launch the second phase of a project to
promote energy efficiency. This included the introduction of a revolving fund for implementing energy
efficiency projects within public buildings and providing subsidized loans (with zero interest) for the
private sector to implement energy efficiency projects, in addition to providing funds to operate a
specialized energy efficiency unit at PENRA.
Energy efficiency projects should reduce amounts of electricity purchased from, as well as the payments
made to the IEC which will contribute to a reduction in non-payments. In addition the revolving fund
introduced for public buildings has proven to be successful as it has reduced the PA’s electricity
consumption invoiced by DISCOs, which in turn has led to a reduction in non-payments from the PA to
DISCOs.
The World Bank has launched a tender to conduct a study aimed at improving PENRA’s understanding of
the Energy Efficiency potential in the West Bank and Gaza. This work will provide an assessment and an
action plan to develop energy efficiency projects in the West Bank and Gaza in the short, medium and
long-term. The action plan will incorporate a roadmap for the development of legal, regulatory,
institutional and capacity-building initiatives to support this action plan.
Proposed improvement: It is nevertheless recommended that a comprehensive assessment of the revolving
fund is performed to examine the possibility of increasing its current funding level and copying the model
to support renewable energy programs.

5.2.4.      Electricity Losses
Legal actions according to the amended electricity law
This action included in the JDECO action plan is in line with the amended electricity law which clearly
classified electricity theft as a crime. JDECO is planning to initiate legal actions against 15,000 customers
accused of stealing electricity or suspected of non-payment. This action is closely linked with the
reduction of non-technical losses which represent a financial burden on all DISCOs and on the reduction
of non-payment.
Proposed improvement: This action will require actual law enforcement

Installation of monitoring meters to measure non-technical losses
Monitoring meters will be fixed adjacent to transformers supplying multiple customers to enable
Distributors to compare the measurements of these meters with the measurements of the meters of the



PwC                                                                       Page 65
customers supplied by these same transformers. This technique is already being implemented by JDECO
and enables the utility to identify high losses areas. PENRA is keen to extend this action to the widest
possible area in the West Bank and Gaza by installing an additional 4,000 monitoring meters with the
total cost of 3 million US$.
Proposed improvement: Exposing electricity theft can contribute to a reduction in non-payment if
complemented by measures aimed at cutting these losses such as network inspections, disconnection of
illegal connection and legal penalties.

Rehabilitation of electricity networks
This action developed in PENRA and DISCOs’ action plans includes rehabilitating the network to reduce
technical losses and removing networks considered hazardous for the public. PENRA and DISCOs have
carried out a significant number of rehabilitation projects and intend to continue with this activity to
further eliminate technical losses and remove all dangerous networks.
Proposed improvement: This action is highly related to the reduction of non-payment requiring it to be
monitored with specific KPI’s linked to loss reduction and to “Distributors project financing”. It is
recommended that the rehabilitation of electricity network to be used in the awareness campaign as
examples of PA and donors efforts to reduce Net Lending.

5.2.5.     Collection from customers
Installation of prepaid meters and smart metering systems
This action is introduced in DISCOs and PENRA action plans. Prepaid meters have been largely installed
in the northern and southern areas of West Bank since 2006 and in fewer locations in the central area of
West Bank. In 2013 GEDCO installed 5,000 prepaid meters as pilot project and following the success of
their operation, GEDCO is interested in continuing with further installations.
The installation of prepaid meters assumed to increase the collection, have been creating difficulties for
DISCOs which lack automatic integration systems between their billing systems and the systems of the
various brands of meters. In addition, DISCOs are not inspecting the meters, only recharging customer ’s
meter cards in their offices. It is highly recommended that DISCOs are incentivized to inspect and read
the consumption readings of all prepaid meters as they do for postpaid meters.
DISCOs in an effort to reduce the non-technical losses have requested smart meter pilot projects which
can communicate remotely with the DISCOs on customer consumption and behavior.
Proposed improvement: This action, highly related to the reduction of non-payment, should be
accompanied by more frequent measurement and inspection of these meters by DISCOs, as well as a
review of the tariff structure for these meters by PERC. PENRA needs to secure 3 million US$ to finance
prepaid meters for Gaza and West Bank and to implement smart meters pilot projects. An assessment of
the impact of prepaid meters is required before proceeding with the implementation of this work. It will
also be necessary to proceed with a review of the tariff as is suggested in the updated action plan.

Conduct continuous awareness campaigns
This action included in the PENRA, PERC and DISCOs action plans is currently being implemented by
PENRA and PERC who are running donor funded awareness campaigns for energy efficiency and prepaid
meters. No assessment has yet been performed to measure the impact of these campaigns on the targeted
audiences. DISCOs also regularly launch awareness campaigns on electricity theft, energy efficiency, etc.
PERC and PENRA have developed concepts for new awareness campaigns focusing on renewable
energy, energy efficiency and prevention of electricity theft. The conduct of these campaigns is subject to
donor funding.




PwC                                                                      Page 66
Proposed improvement: Awareness campaigns against electricity theft will need to use unconventional
messages and methods to impact the Palestinian population. Looking to tackle this issue by addressing
thieves only will not be sufficient. The campaign will need to illustrate the various effects of electricity
theft including power outages, tariff increases, and even casualties from electrocution following handling
of illegal connections. The awareness campaign should address these issues in an integrated manner using
suitable communication channels, through partnership with private sector, women unions, NGO’s and
governmental institutions. It should be held during a mid-term period and include seminars, workshops,
lectures in schools. Only by utilizing a variety of means will the campaign significantly contribute to the
reduction of non-payment.

5.2.6.             Tariff
Consolidation of connection points into high voltage substations
This action included in PENRAs’ action plan aims to consolidate all collection points into the 4
substations currently being built and intended to be controlled by PETL. This project involves the
construction of associated distribution systems, and will offer the following advantages:
 A reduction in the number of connection points (70% of the connection points in the northern region
   and southern region will be consolidated into the substations in the north and the south and 10
   connection points will be consolidated in the central substations).
 Enable PETL to benefit from a lower purchase price of up to 5% resulting from the shifting to a
   higher voltage.
 Enable PETL to act as a single buyer to the IEC operating under a commercial agreement with IEC.
In addition to the construction of the 4 substations financed by a loan from the EIB, PENRA and PETL
are planning to construct a fifth substation in the central area of West Bank with costs estimated at around
16 million US$. This substation is needed to cover the load growth in the northern area of Ramallah and
replace some of the existing connection points in that area.
Proposed improvement: The construction of the substations is crucial for the development of the
electricity infrastructure in the Palestinian Territories. This improvement can only succeed if associated
with the development of the distribution system associated with these substations to transfer electricity
from the substations to the Palestinian load centers. PENRA is therefore requesting an additional 8 million
US$ to be disbursed from donors to cover the cost of installation of the distribution system and the
procurement of associated goods.
This project is expected to reduce the purchase price of electricity, and this could be further decreased
should a commercial agreement be reached. This reduction is therefore likely to contribute significantly to
the reduction of non-payment by having a sufficient tariff margin and transparent relation with the IEC.
To ensure success in this area it will also be necessary to provide PETL 78 with the required support to
operate the substations. The consolidation of PETL will be a newly founded institution, and as such it is
strongly recommended that technical and financial assistance for its operation is provided to guarantee the
future sustainability of PETL.

5.2.7.              Efficiency and transparency of Distributors
Transfer of electricity services from municipalities to DISCOs to be finalized.
This action included in the action plans of MOLG and PENRA is required by the electricity law. MOLG
observed that to ensure the success of the transfers it was necessary to draw up a compensation
mechanism for municipalities for the cash losses resulting from the transfers. MOLG noted that the
transfer of the electricity services from Nablus and Jenin cities to NEDCO only came after an agreement

78
     The World Bank is financing starting and operation costs of PETL, but sustainability is not ensured unless PA or other donors step in.




PwC                                                                                                        Page 67
between PERC, MOLG and MOF with these municipalities to transfer their electricity services to
NEDCO in exchange of a monthly compensation from the MOF equivalent to 20% of their sales.
It should be noted that the transfer agreement also stipulated that debts from customers to these
municipalities would be collected by NEDCO and later transferred to the municipalities after deducting
NEDCO’s collection expenses.
The establishment of DISCOs crucial for the development of the sector is required by the electricity law.
The law is also expected to influence strongly the payments to DISCOs, as these organizations only deal
with electricity services, and are not influenced by any other services.
Proposed improvement: This action will need to be supplemented by technical assistance to
municipalities to allow them to engage in suitable municipal finance practices and secure other income
generating sources such as license fees, different types of municipal taxes, etc.
In addition the compensation mechanism which has been approved for transferring municipalities needs
to be assessed as its implementation has proven to be extremely costly. It would be necessary to evaluate
the financial impact of the process and search for possible alternative compensation scheme.

Funding for municipal projects to be conditioned on payment of electricity invoices
This action is included in the action plans of the MOF, MOLG and PENRA. It stipulates that all benefits
and financial aids to municipalities from the MOF and/or any other governmental entities shall be
suspended should municipalities refuse to abide by the rules and regulations. Conditioning financing of
projects to IEC payments and reporting is intended to demonstrate to municipalities that the non-payment
of invoices affects the fiscal position of the PA with a manifest impact on the development of the country.
Proposed improvement: Exemption of vital projects related to health and education from this action will
be determined following a transparent assessment process and should then be communicated to all. To
ensure that this happens, it is highly recommended that the Special Committee is asked to monitor the
implementation of this action.
This action which can contribute highly to the reduction of non-payments requires the cooperation and
commitment of all Palestinian institutions as well as the reaching of an agreement with donors and
MOPAD following extensive consultations.

5.2.8.             Others reasons for non-payment
Government to cover the monthly cost of the first 150kWh for social cases registered at MOSA.
The action is included in PENRA’s action plan as well as in MOSA’s plan and is part of the cabinet
decision “Endorsement of MOU between DISCOs and local authorities” issued on 5 March 201379.
MOSA reported multiple obstacles in the implementation of this action resulting from the fact that the
transfer would go from MOF to the different Distributors, due to the following factors:
     The high number of stakeholders impacted by the action and the lack of a detailed comprehensive
        implementation mechanism resulted in multiple discordant interpretations for its application.
     Other fees imposed on social cases by some of the Distributors providing electricity such as
        collecting old debts or street lightening fees. This assistance might not be used to cover the
        electricity cost alone but some other fees requested by the Distributors.
     To benefit from this assistance social cases should be serviced through prepaid meters. In the
        West Bank, around 10,000 households out of approximately 50,000 social cases households are
        serviced through prepaid meters and can thus benefit from this assistance.


79
     Appendix E point 1.2.



PwC                                                                     Page 68
In light of the above, MOSA has requested that the Cabinet modify the mechanism to add 50 ILS to the
monthly cash transfer for MOSA of all social cases. This amendment should enable MOSA to overcome
the obstacles faced implementing the assistance to the social cases. MOSA estimated that the cost of this
mechanism would reach 30,000,000 ILS annually to cover 50,000 social case families in the West Bank.
This action is expected to contribute to the reduction of non-payment as part of the electricity bills from
social cases will be covered by the PA. It is also expected that it will encourage social cases to settle the
remaining amount which they owe.
Proposed improvement: In light of MOSA’s observations concerning the flaws in the mechanism, some
changes could be implemented to improve this action or for it to be replaced it by a more result based
oriented action.
Suggestion 1: update action:
     The current sales tariff values the cost of 150 kWh to equate to around 100 ILS; subsidy to social
        cases is recommended to be 100 ILS rather than 50 ILS as proposed by MOSA. This would cover
        the first 150kWh that the government committed to cover on behalf of these social cases.
     While there is a high risk that MOF delays the subsidy payment to MOSA for social cases, it is
        recommended that DISCOs avoid disconnecting electricity from these cases if the non-payment is
        less than 6 months (i.e. 600 ILS).
     It is recommended that municipalities exempt social cases from street lighting fee payments.
     Installing prepaid meters for social cases, but if sufficient quantities of prepaid meters are not
        available within the different Distributors, then the Distributors shall implement the new
        mechanism until the prepaid meters are available.

Segregation of electricity accounts of municipalities and village councils.
This action included in the MOLG action plan requires municipalities distributing electricity to segregate
their electricity accounts from all other municipal account and to utilize this segregated account solely for
electricity services. MOLG noted that while this action was adopted in 2010 MOLG financial controllers
failed to monitor its implementation and the MOF suspended the transfer of municipal revenues to these
municipalities who then in turn ceased to operate with the segregated accounts principle.
Proposed improvement: This action will hopefully significantly reduce non-payments. With the
implementation of this action, financial controllers will be in a position to report directly to the MOLG
and the MOF on accounts segregation and cash flows related to electricity services.

5.2.9.            To be frozen or canceled
Distributors to reschedule arrears to MOF in line with the deductions
This action was agreed by PA institutions and is included in the action plans of MOF, MOLG and
PENRA. It is in line with the cabinet decision “Approving the guarantees of electricity payments” issued
in February 201480. The mechanism and criteria for rescheduling the arrears is not described, but it is
assumed that it will be made on a case by case basis following discussions between MOF and Distributors
and that it will take into account the amounts of MOF arrears to these Distributors for the supply of
electricity to PA public buildings and services.
The PA is also expected to carefully define the rescheduling of arrears without undermining the
Distributors’ ability to pay for new IEC invoices and operate efficiently.
Proposed improvement: It is highly recommended that the Special Committee in coordination with PERC
proceeds with an analysis of the impact of rescheduling on the Distributors’ arrears. In the meantime the
payments from the Distributors to MOF should be frozen for a period of one year before re-evaluating the
situation.

Distributors to settle arrears through revenue deductions from MOF81
This action included in MOF’s action plan proposes the settlement of Distributor’s debts in West Bank in
return for a reduction in the amounts that the Israeli Ministry of Finance is deducting from these entities
for electricity bills to the IEC. This settlement, which should be transferred from the MOF to these
entities, would be funded from the following revenue sources:
    1- Transportation fees: MOF deducted 69 million ILS for these fees payable to municipalities for
         the period January 2011 to March 2014
    2- Property tax: MOF deducted 72.9 million ILS for the taxes due to municipalities for the period
         January 2011 to March 2014
    3- Profession license fees: MOF deducted 11.3 million ILS for these fees owed to municipalities for
         the period from January 2011 to March 2014
    4- Others: MOF deducted 20.9 million ILS for the period January 2011to March 2014
This action enabled the MOF to compensate up to 173 million ILS for the period from January 2011 to
March 2014 for the lack of collection from municipalities in West Bank. It also served as a tool for the
MOF to pressure municipalities involved in electricity distribution to pay for their IEC bills.
Proposed improvement: The Special Committee in coordination with PERC should analyze the impact of
the debt rescheduling on Distributors. In the meantime and for a period of at least one year, the debt from
the Distributors to MOF should be frozen. In the meantime, MOF should ensure timely payments of
future public services electricity bills to Distributors including the electricity bills of the water wells.
Incentives for customers to pay their debts and 100% of their invoices
This action, included in PENRA action plan, is in line with the cabinet decision “Endorsement of MOU
between DISCOs and local authorities” issued on 5 March 201382.
DISCOs are currently implementing this decision but MOF has not been compensating the utilities
accordingly. The impact of this action on the reduction of the non-payment is perceived to be negative as
DISCOs are compelled to compensate for the loss from their revenues.
Proposed improvement: In the absence of proper compensation from MOF it is recommended that this
action is cancelled.

5.2.10.            New action suggested
Capacity building for PERC and PETL
Various actions in the Action Plan are dependent on the efficiency and capacity of PERC and PETL. It is
therefore recommended that both institutions receive the required assistance to implement these actions.
In addition, it is anticipated that the mandate of PERC and PETL will be extended to the Gaza Strip which
will require additional costs to ensure these institutions operate efficiently in Gaza.
PERC:
   Operational costs including training costs to guarantee the sustainability of the institution,
      especially if the mandate of PERC is extended to cover Gaza.
   Technical Assistance to support with the preparation of the tariff review and benchmarking
      between the different DISCOs.
   Assist PERC in following up the implementation of the DISCOs KPIs.
   Technical Assistance to design information system to connect PERC to have a continuous flow of
      data with all the DISCOs.

5.3.      Conclusion of the assessment and revised action plan
The assessment of the different actions initiated by the PA reveals that all of the factors contributing to
non-payment have been addressed by the different institutional stakeholders in a fragmented manner
during the past years. These actions were nevertheless insufficient to reduce non-payment. The lack of
success of these actions can be explained by internal and external political reasons as well as the fact the
implementation of a few of these actions has recently started and will need time to show results. In
addition, a few actions were found to have insignificant impact, some of them even resulting in increase
in the non-payment; for example the governmental subsidies and incentives.
Concerning political reasons, one of the internal political reasons for the failure of some actions is the lack
of comprehensive approach to non-payment by the PA by different Palestinian stakeholders - PENRA,
MOF, MOLG and MOSA – taking independent actions without prior consultation or coordination
amongst themselves and with other sector stakeholders.
In addition, until recently due to divergent opinions between the PA and some Distributors, there was no
clear policy to compel Distributors to pay their invoices to the IEC before proceeding with the settlement
of other internal expenses. PENRA indicated that following the cabinet decision to create the ministerial
committee to deal with the debt positive signals were received from Distributors agreeing to increase their
payments to the IEC.
The failure of the PA to negotiate the payment of invoices from the refugee camps is also highly
dependent on internal Palestinian politics and requires high level political interventions.
The main external reason affecting the successful implementation of some actions is the slow progress
between Palestinian and Israeli counterparts in reaching a commercial agreement on tariffs.

The suggested action plan developed below builds on the assessment of different action of the PA
mentioned above. The plan proposes a comprehensive approach of the non-payment problem through
propositions related to every cause of non-payment identified in the analysis as follows:
      Invoice reconciliation and cycle
      Non-payment from Distributors to IEC
      Electricity losses
      Collection from customers to Distributors
      Tariff
      Efficiency of Distributors
      Others – Special areas
The updated plan further ranks the actions according to their level of priority (high – medium –low) and
the level of involvement of donors requested for its implementation (financial and non-financial support).
An outline of the suggested plan below summarizes the actions to be implemented according to cause and
priority.

      1. Data gathering
The analysis presented in this report was prepared following an extensive data gathering
process 85 which was made possible by the generous contribution from several Israeli and
Palestinian stakeholders 86 . The data gathering process was carried out using the following
method:



85
    During this data gathering exercise, the authors noted that the IEC did not provide the PA with detailed information related to
deductions, purchase cost and consumption between September 2009 and early 2014. This data was provided to PA in September 2013,
following World Bank intervention. Recommendations to improve information flow between stakeholders is provided later in the report
in the Action plan section (Section 4)

Step 1: Data gathering “Top-down” from Israeli utility, IEC
The World Bank with authorization from PENRA initiated a process of high level discussions
with the Israeli parties including:
 Meetings with the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Israeli Ministry of Finance and IEC.
 Drafting a list of required data from the IEC.
Following these discussions, the IEC agreed to provide the World Bank with the following data
items:
 Monthly deduction made from the clearance revenue on each connection point –i.e. its
    contribution to the Net Lending- from January 2010 up to December 2013 in ILS.
 Direct payments made by each connection point to the IEC to cover the cost of electricity
    purchased or part as from January 2010 up to December 2013 in ILS.
 Outstanding debt owed to the IEC for each connection point as of February 2014 in ILS.
 Yearly consumption in kWh for each connection point for the years 2010, 2011, 2012 and
    2013.
Data on yearly invoiced cost of electricity sold to each connection point was not available
which led the authors of this report to proceed with estimations to complete missing areas of
information.

Step 2: Data gathering from Palestinian Distributors: “Bottom-up approach”
With the assistance of the World Bank, data for the period 2009-2013 was collected from the
following Distributors:
1. DISCOs: JDECO, NEDCO, GEDCO, HEPCO, SELCO and TEDCO.
2. Municipalities and village councils: Tulkarem, Qalqiliya, Yabed, Illar, Bani Naim, Salfit,
    Jayyus, Sa’ier, Tarqumia, Beit Awwa and Ithna.
The data collected from these Distributors included:
 Monthly IEC data from 01/2009 to 12/2013 on: purchase from the IEC in ILS and kWh,
   payments to the IEC in ILS and outstanding debt owed to the IEC in ILS.
 Annual Customer category data from 2009 to 2013 on: number of customers per category,
   sales per customer category in ILS and kWh, and outstanding debt.
 Data for special areas of low collection and/or high losses.
 Data outlining losses for the period 2009-2013.
 Governmental subsidy data.
 Data on low consumption customers.
The municipalities and village councils of Salfit, Jayyus, Sa’ier, Tarqumia, B eit Awwa and
Ithna did not respond to the requests and did not provide any data87.
The remaining municipalities and village councils provided only partial data claiming that the
requested data could not be extracted from their billing system in the required format.
DISCOs provided most of the data requested with the exception of GEDCO who could not
provide information on purchase data from the IEC as it had not received IEC bills. Finally data
received from SELCO was not utilized in the report as it appeared to contain a certain number
of inconsistencies.
The data received from both the IEC and different Palestinian stakeholders was crossed
checked to ensure the robustness of both sets of data. After a few reviews and the receipt of
updated data from stakeholders, no further serious discrepancies were uncovered.

Step 3: Collection of action plans on means to improve non-payments of electricity
services and reduce Net Lending from the Palestinian institutions
Action plans from Palestinian Institutions involved in the sector were collected, including:
PENRA, PERC, MOF, MOLG and MOSA. The content of these actions plans and proposed
updates were discussed with stakeholders during follow up meetings.

Step 4: Administration of 1038 customer survey questionnaire to electricity customers
A customer survey and focus groups were conducted in areas with the highest levels of non-
payment of electricity bills to collect detailed information on the nature and reasons of
customers’ non-payment to their electricity providers in West Bank and Gaza. Activities
completed included:
• Focus groups: Three focus group meetings were held (One in the North of the West Bank,
    one in the South of the West Bank, and one in the Gaza strip).
•     Subscribers’ questionnaire: A questionnaire was prepared to collect data on the socio-
      economic profiles of subscribers, subscribers’ utilities and obligations, electricity usage and
      consumption, and efficiency of electricity providers. The survey was initially piloted with
      35 customers to ensure its clarity and robustness.
•     Survey: The survey covered a representative household of Palestinian customers in areas
      with high level of non-payment.

      2. Data analysis
             a. High level data analysis
Following the completion of the information and data collection phase, preliminary high level
analysis began to identify the areas and connection points with high non-payment behavior. The
analysis was based on clear KPIs such as consumption cost, payment to the IEC, collection
rate, outstanding debt to the IEC for electricity purchases and high losses.
Finally, a comparison of the information and data received from the different Palestinian
electricity Distributors and stakeholders with the data received from the IEC was carried out to
cross check and highlight any discrepancies.

              b. Customers survey analysis
Following completion and collection of the questionnaires, a process of coding and data entry
with SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) software was used to reflect and illustrate
the customers’ answers. Descriptive statistics such as cross tabulations were employed to
measure the relationships between certain variables and to develop a better understanding of the
reasons for non-payment for electricity services.

      3. Identifying external factors
A desk review of previous studies, published information, and other data and information on
micro-economic factors affecting the Net Lending was performed. This included specific data,
research and documents from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics library.
Finally, the survey questionnaire included questions which could provide insights on micro-
economic factors affecting the Net Lending. These questions were related mainly to pricing of
alternative energy sources, affordability of electricity, household income and poverty, and
regularity of payment of salaries.

      4. Strategies and action plan
             a. Assessing PA’s existing and planned strategies
The Palestinian stakeholders’ action plans and the sectorial activities carried by donor were also
assessed to determine the extent to which these plans are addressing or will address non-
payment of electricity or reduction of losses. Each action was individually assessed and
proposed amendments to each specific action have been suggested based on the analysis from
the collected data.
             b. Revised Action Plan
Following the completion of the above activities, a summary of the key actions were set out in
an overall action plan, for execution over three distinct time periods:
    1- Short term actions (< 12 months)
    2- Medium term actions (12 to 36 months)
    3- Long term actions (> 36 months)

Appendix F Payment flow to the IEC

Palestinian Distributors behave in three ways after receiving monthly electricity bills from IEC
(see diagram 3): (i) they pay in full the total amount; (ii) they pay part of the bill; or (iii) they
do not pay the bill at all. If partial or no payment is made then the IEC either deducts the unpaid
amount or part of it from the Clearance revenue or registers the remaining amounts as debt on
the connection point.

From the IEC’s perspective, the payment on each of the connection points is done through
direct payment from the connection point owner and through the transferred amount from the
Clearance revenue, which has been deducted by the Israeli Ministry of Finance (“Net lending”).
The diagram below illustrates the flow of payments for IEC through two main channels:
1. Direct channel: payments are made directly by the owner of the connection point
   (DISCOs, Municipality, Village council and private sector) to an IEC bank account at Cairo
   Amman Bank. A small number of connection point owners pay directly to IEC offices with
   checks or cash.
2. Indirect channel: payments are made through deductions from the Clearance revenue by
   the Israeli Ministry of Finance (Net Lending). The IEC informs the Israeli Ministry of
   Finance of the amounts due by Palestinian electricity Distributors. The Israeli Ministry of
   Finance deducts these amounts from PA’s clearance revenues and transfers the funds to the
   IEC.

The Chart shows that in 2013, the Palestinian electricity Distributors accumulated debt to IEC reached 715 million ILS                                                 (193 million US$ equivalent).
The Chart clearly shows that the cost of purchased electricity has increased between 2010 and 2013 by 62%. It also reveals that up to 2012 direct payments
from Palestinian Distributors were gradually increasing although they never reached the level of the actual cost of purchase electricity. In 2013, the direct
payment decreased by 178 million ILS (48 million US$ equivalent). Some sector stakeholders believe that this decrease was the result of the substantial
amount (1,079 million ISL - 292 million US$ equivalent) which was deducted by the Israeli Ministry of Finance from the clearance revenue for the benefit of
the IEC and which led the people to believe that their unpaid bills could be taken care of by the Palestinian Authority.

throughout the years between 2010 and 2013 and not clear pattern can be found.
Analyzing the yearly figures in the Chart shows that in 2010 the payment received by the IEC (direct payment and the Net Lending) exceeded the estimated
cost of the purchased electricity by 45 million ILS. This indicated that during that year, funds were transferred to the IEC through the clearance mechanism to
compensate for what is believed to be part of the pre 2010 debt. In 2010 the Net Lending represented 37% of the estimated cost of purchased electricity and
there was no accumulated debt from the previous year, therefore, the 37% is also the percentage of total non-payment for 2010. The non-payment in 2010
totaled 545 million ILS.
In 2011, IEC recovered 487 million ILS (132 million US$ equivalent) of non-paid amounts by Palestinian Electricity Distributors through Net Lending
(representing 29% of estimated cost of purchased electricity). However, the IEC still had 171 million ILS of outstanding debt from Palestinian electricity
providers, which carried over the following year. In 2011 the Net Lending represented 29% of the estimated cost of purchased electricity and the added debt
represented 10% of the estimated cost of purchased electricity; therefore the non-payment in 2011 was 39% of the estimated cost of the purchased electricity,
which equates to 658 million ILS. The estimated cost of purchased electricity in 2011 increased by 14% compared to 2010.
In 2012 the payment received by the IEC (direct payment and the Net Lending) exceeded the estimated cost of the purchased electricity by 43 million ILS
which meant a reduction of the accumulated debt to the IEC by this amount. In 2012 the Net Lending represented 49% of the estimated cost of purchased
electricity. This percentage is considered as the non-payment percentage as no additional debt was added that year. The non-payment in 2012 was equal to
1,180 million ILS. Based on these values, the non-payment increased by 10% in 2012 compared to 2011 and by 12% compared to 2010. The estimated cost of
purchased electricity increased by 31% compared to 2011 and by 49% compared to 2010.
In 2013 the payment received by the IEC (direct payment and the Net Lending) was 1,694 million ILS. This was 715 million ILS less than the estimated cost
of the purchased electricity which meant that the debt to the IEC increased by this amount. In 2013 the Net Lending represented 29% of the estimated cost of
purchased electricity and the added debt represented 30% of the estimated cost of purchased electricity therefore the non-payment in 2013 was 58% of the
estimated cost of the purchased electricity and is equal to 1,406 million ILS. This shows that non-payment increased by 10% in 2013 compared to 2012 and by
12% compared to 2011. The estimated cost of purchased electricity increased by 9% compared to 2012.

Appendix H: Customer survey and focus group –profile of respondents

The study's respondents were chosen from areas with the highest levels of electricity bill non-
payment. In the West Bank, 615 questionnaires were administered in 103 localities within 11
governorates while in the Gaza Strip, 423 questionnaires were administered in 23 localities
within 5 governorates.
The criteria for selecting the sample were as follows:
1- Jurisdictions where high level data collection and analysis was performed
2- For JDECO area: survey areas with losses above 30%
3- Coverage of all refugee camps within DISCOs.
4- Coverage of all major cities
5- All Distributors supplying more than one city, village or camp to be included in the survey

In the West Bank: Hebron, Jerusalem and Ramallah/Al-Bireh included the bulk of the
respondents, slightly more than 62%. 58 localities were covered in the West Bank: 11 localities
for Hebron, 36 for Ramallah/Al-Bireh and 11 for Jerusalem.
In the Gaza Strip: Gaza, North Gaza, and Deir Al Balah governorates represented 72.58% of
the respondents. 14 localities were covered (3 in Gaza, 5 in North Gaza, and 6 in Khan Yunis)
out of a total of 23 Gaza Strip localities.
The study also recorded the demographic profiles of Palestinian respondents. The criteria
consisted of age, education level, employment status and sector, number of household
members, and working household members, as well as the average monthly income at a
household level. The completed profiles of the study respondents can be summarized as
follows:
     West Bank respondents: 38.14 years on average with secondary education level 97 .
      Bethlehem, Tubas and Ramallah/Al-Bireh governorates displayed the highest average
      education levels while Nablus, Qalqiliya, and Tulkarem showed the lowest.
     Gaza Strip respondents: 45.07 years on average with primary and secondary education
      levels with only slight variations between governorates98.
West Bank respondents are more likely to be active in the labor market than Gaza Strip
respondents. West Bank respondents showed a higher propensity to be employed in the private
sector or self-employed while Gaza Strip respondents tended to be unemployed or retired, and
thus, less active in the labor force.
West Bank respondents have on average 5.86 members per household, with an average of 1.43
employed. In the Gaza Strip, this figure rises to 7.34 persons per household with only 0.78
employed or working.
The information related to the profile of the respondent could explain some of the answers
received and needs to be taken into consideration when suggesting possible future actions to
increase the collection rate from customers. It is reasonable to believe that the behavior of
customers varies according to age, employment situation and number of household members.
Specific media campaigns addressing the customer non-payment issue should be tailored to
address the different population categories, and look to mainly target the most commonly found
customer profile.

1. Palestinian Authority (PA) Decisions

1.1.    “Camps agreement” issued on December 30, 2012 between the Prime Minister
and the Representative Committees of camps
Late 2012 the Palestinian government approved a decision known as the “ Camps agreement”
in which the government addressed electricity debts of refugees’ camps. The decision proposes
incentives for customers to pay their bills as well as penalties for electricity thefts. This
agreement can be summarized as follows:

          All arrears of customers who agree to pay for their actual and upcoming electricity bills
           will be cancelled;
          Tariff for the first 150 KWh for residential customers will be at cost;
          Utilities will cover electricity bills of some public institutions in the camps.
          The electricity tariff in the camps will be aligned with the tariff for regular customers
          Camp representatives in collaboration with MOSA will review all social cases in the
           camps
          PENRA will provide utilities with performing equipment and goods to rehabilitate the
           electricity networks in the camps.
          Utilities will install prepaid meters for customers
          If more than one customer is connected to the same meter they will be separated and the
           utility will install a prepaid meter for each customer at no cost.

1.2.  Cabinet Decision Number (‫ف‬.‫س‬/‫و‬.‫م‬/45/54/70) of 2013 issued on 5 March 2013
“Endorsement of MoU between DISCOs and local authorities”
This decision concerns electricity debts related to local authorities and DISCOs. The decision
offers incentives for customers to pay their bills and penalties for electricity thefts.
     Any customer committed to pay his invoice will be rewarded with a 10% deduction on
         his monthly invoice. This deduction will be subsidies by the government.
     Any indebted customer who pays an additional 10% to his bill to reimburse his debt
         will be offered a 10% cancellation to his debt. This cancellation will be subsidies by the
         government.
     The Government will cover the monthly cost of the first 150kWh for social cases
         registered at MOSA.

1.3.   Cabinet decision “formulation of special committee to follow up the electricity
debts number (‫ح‬.‫ر‬/‫و‬.‫ر‬/40/70)”
The Cabinet on 9 February 2014 established a special committee to handle the electricity debts.
This committee chaired by PENRA and includes members from MOI, MOLG, MOE and MOF
is responsible for proposing to the Prime Minister recommendations on solving the electricity
debt issues.

1.4.       Cabinet decision “Approving the guarantees of electricity payments”
On 25 of February 2014 the Cabinet took the decision (‫ح‬7‫ر‬/‫و‬7‫م‬/17/21/56) “Approving the
Guarantees of Electricity Payments”, which states the following:

       8. All electricity distributing entities have to and within a maximum of 30 days from the
          date of the issuance of this decision: reschedule all debts due on them for the Ministry
PwC                                                                        Page 107
         of Finance which is resulted from the electricity deducti on from the Ministry’s clearing
         account to the IEC.
      9. All electricity distributing entities have to shall commit to paying all of the IEC bill
         deducted of it the government’s support percentage of the monthly electricity bill which
         is approved by the government to support the electricity sector.
      10. The cabinet and in accordance with the recommendations of the electricity Special
          Committee, have the right to take all legal actions against the representatives of any
          electricity distributing entity in the case where it has been proven that the public money
          has been compromised.
      11. All benefits and financial aids from the Ministry of Finance and/or any governmental
          body shall be halted to any electricity distributing entity not abiding by the rules and
          regulations set in this decision.
      12. All electricity distributing entities have to supply the Ministry of Finance and the
          Palestinian Natural Resources Authority with the supporting documents to pay any
          amounts due from them to the IEC in a date maximum of 3 working days from the date
          of payment.
      13. Any electricity distributing entity and to enforce its ability to carry out the rules and
          regulations of this decision, has to apply for a meeting with the special electricity
          committee, where the committee shall study the case of the distributing entity and
          submits recommendation for each case separately to the ministers cabinet; and the
          cabinet will decide on the case.
      14. The special electricity committee has to review all the rules and regulations of this
          decision every three months and has to give recommendations about it for the minister’s
          cabinet.
      15. Any rules and regulations going against this decision shall be cancelled.

2. Ministry of Finance action plan
The MOF in cooperation with all relevant Palestinian stakeholders is working towards
increasing level of payments to IEC and reducing the Net Lending by taking the following
measures:
1- MOF is member of the ministerial committee that is working on following up the electricity
   debts.
2- MOF is currently working on establishing an interactive data base to include
   comprehensive information on Net Lending where this database will be connected with the
   MOF financial system and managed by MOF to ensure sustainability where information
   will be gathered from municipalities, PENRA, DISCOS, PETL, and IEC. This data base
   should be able to provide us with all missing and needed information that is needed to have
   a clear picture about the Net Lending situation, the database is supposed to be ready by July
   2014. MOF will consult the relevant international partners (including the World Bank) to
   get feedback about the structure and functions of this database.
3- MOF is following up with the GoI through the Palestinian- Israeli joint committee to get
   full detailed information about the deductions from the clearance against electricity and
   health. This information will be validated with relative PA institution and will be used in
   the data base.
4- The council of ministries has recently issued a decree about the settlement of the electricity
   debt by the relevant utilities, Distributors, where MOF is involved in following up this
   decree to ensure its implementation, while doing so MOF is working with different
   institutions to study the financial effect of the different government decisions about the
PwC                                                                        Page 108
      electricity subsidies. Besides that MOF will continue its pressure on municipalities to
      reschedule and reconcile the dent to MOF and will consider some measurements to
      encourage municipalities to do so.

MOF has provided data concerning the settlements that is done between MOF and the various
municipalities, DISCOs and village councils in West Bank in exchange of the reduction that
Israeli Ministry of Finance is doing on these entities electricity bills to IEC. The settlement is
made on four different revenue sources which should be transferred from MOF to these entities,
as follows:
      5- Transportation fees: MOF has deducted 69 million ILS in the period January 2011-
         March 2014
      6- Property tax: MOF has deducted 72.9 million ILS in the period January 2011-March
         2014
      7- Profession license fees: MOF has deducted 11.3 million ILS in the period January
         2011-March 2014
      8- Others: MOF has deducted 20.9 million ILS in the period January 2011-March 2014

This indicates that MOF could only collect back from the different electricity Distributors an
amount of 173 million ILS in the period January 2011-March 2014.

3. Ministry of Local Government action plan
 The MOLG efforts to reduce the Net Lending focus on two areas:

    1- Improve collections in the local councils and increase their payments to IEC.
    2- Assist in the process of establishing DISCOs with actions to encourage local councils to
         join electricity distribution companies.
 To improve the collection and the payment to IEC from the local authorities, MOLG is taking
 the following actions:

        Ordering the local councils to separate the electricity financial accounts from other
         accounts and to exclusively disburse from this account to pay for electricity services.
         The account being under the responsibility of the electricity department. This order has
         been valid and operational since 2009;
       Placing financial supervisors at local councils who did not follow this order to ensure
         its execution;
       Monitoring the commitment of the local councils to settle electricity payments, issue
         monthly payment statements and send these statements to the directorates of the Local
         Governments;
       Instructing MOF to pay transportation expenses only to local councils who settle the
         payment of at least 10 monthly bills of electricity a year. MOF has engaged to commit
         to this instruction;
       Encouraging the local councils to install prepaid meters to improve their electricity
         collections, to issue self-financed bids, and to follow up on this matter with PENRA to
         secure the supply of prepaid meters to the local councils;
       Dissolving municipal councils who did not commit to pay their electrical bills to the
         supplier, and assigning Special Committees from the public sector to manage these
         municipalities;
      1. Circulating tariff decisions and supervising their implementation through MOLG
         supervision teams;
      2. Auditing the unpaid electricity while performing assurance on the payment slips;
PwC                                                                      Page 109
      3. Requesting the local councils to propose electricity debt payment schedules and in
         cooperation with MOF, monitoring their commitment to this schedule;
      4. Linking local councils projects to the electricity debt payment and releasing the project
         funds upon clearance from MOF on the approved settlement of these payments;
      5. Binding the local councils to schedule their subscribers debts through the prepaid
         meters to improve the collection and enable them to pay their monthly supplies bills
         and their scheduled debts;
      6. Rejecting approvals of budgets of councils who have not initiated a debt scheduling
         scheme.


While to support the transfer of the electricity service from the local authorities to DISCOs,
MOLG is taking the following actions:
  Requesting the local councils to transfer their electricity services to DISCOs as
      stipulated in the general electricity law;
  In cooperation with PENRA, promoting the integration of local councils electricity
      services to DISCOs in workshops;
  Facilitating and accelerating the transfer of electricity services from the local councils
      to DISCOs;
  Signing of numerous special agreements with relevant governmental bodies (MOF,
      PENRA, Organizing and Local Governance Council)to transfer the electricity services
      from the local councils to DISCOs;
  Encouraging the local councils to join DISCOs by performing a financial analysis
      measuring the impact of the transfer of the electricity distribution services from the
      local councils to DISCOs;
  MOLG assisted with the transfer of the electricity department employees from the local
      councils to DISCOs such as Nablus and Jenin electricity services to NEDCO;
  MOLG followed up on the matter of the local councils that have joined the distribution
      companies getting their compensations due from the MOF, though the MOF did not
      commit to paying the due amounts which led to a decline in the local council’s desire in
      joining the distribution companies.

4. Ministry of Social Affairs action plan
MOSA actions in the West Bank essentially consist of ensuring the implementation of Cabinet
decision dated 5 March 2013 related to the endorsement of MoU between the local authorities
and DISCOs (ref: 3.5.2 bullet point 3: The Government will cover the monthly cost of the first
150kWh for social cases registered at MOSA). The implementation of this decision has faced
multiple obstacles due to factors as listed below:

         High number of stakeholders involved suggesting different interpretations and
          implementation mechanisms for the decision.
         The number of local councils receiving electricity through local cooperative
          associations which are reluctant to cooperate on this decision.
         Other fees imposed by some of the Distributors that distribute electricity such as
          collecting old debts or street lightening fees.
         A number of local councils officially informed the Ministry of their refusal to
          implement the decision as they collect other services fees through the electricity bills.
         To benefit from this assistance social cases should have prepaid meters installed.
          Unfortunately, only around 10,000 households out of approximately 50,000 social cases
PwC                                                                       Page 110
          families in the West Bank have pre-aid meters and could thus benefit from this
          assistance.

In light of the above, MOSA has requested the Cabinet to modify the mechanism to add 50 ILS
to the monthly cash transfer for MOSA beneficiaries who have prepaid meter installed. This
amendment should enable MOSA to extend the electricity support to all households with pre-
paid meters in West Bank cities, villages and refugee camps. MOSA estimated the cost of this
mechanism to reach 30,000,000 ILS annually to cover 50,000 social cases families in the West
Bank.

MOSA reported that the current mechanism is only implemented by three DISCOs who have
not yet been compensated by MOF as shown in the table below

                    DISCOs implementing assistance to social cases in the West Bank
DISCO                              Number of benefited cases                     Cost ILS

NEDCO                                                          297099                        3,564,645

TEDCO                                                           1984                         2,338,547

SELCO                                                           3805                         4,638,260

Total                                                          8,759                        10,541,452
The above table shows that the average monthly payment for each social case is 100 ILS (not
50ILS as proposed by MOSA).

5. Palestinian Electricity Regulation Council (PERC) action plan
PERC action plan to reduce the Net Lending is summarized below.

      Government’s role
      1- Government to pay all its financial commitments to the Distributors
