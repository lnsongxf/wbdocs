Oyster culture in Chanthaburi, Thailand
Molluscs feed low on the food chain, which make them a relatively cheap source of protein. Culture plots can
be established and managed by individual farmers, a cluster of farmers, or the community. This neat and well-managed
stretch of oyster culture units in Chantaburi Province, Thailand, reflects some of the advantages of community-based
aquaculture management in terms of an equitable and conflict-free access to the water resource, clean culture environment
and improved incomes. Off-bottom culture techniques include polyethylene rafts, longlines, racks and cages.

   various scales. Spatial planning takes place at the local, regional, national and international levels and often results in the creation of a
   spatial plan. Spatial planning also entails a system that is not only spatial, but one that also engages processes and secures outcomes
   that are sustainable, integrated and inclusive (FAO, 2013).

    The FAO workshop “Increasing Public Understanding and Acceptance of Aquaculture – the Role of Truth, Transparency and Transformation” was held in
    Vigo, Spain, in October 2015. The workshop covered a number of core topics related to the perceptions of aquaculture, including transparency and
    ethics, communication, collaboration, responsibilities and new approaches to better management of sector performance and perceptions (FAO,

Notes:
•	 Some of the main tools and models are described in Annex 4.
•	 Scoping is also needed for zoning and the design of management areas.
• 	Ehler and Douvere (2009) describe marine spatial planning (MSP) as “a public process of analyzing and allocating the spatial and temporal distribution
   of human activities in marine areas to achieve ecological, economic, and social objectives that are usually specified through a political process”.
   Meaden et al. (2016) provide a comprehensive listing of additional information about MSP, including worldwide examples where MSP has been applied

There is considerable potential to expand inland aquaculture in Africa to improve food security. The first step in aquaculture planning
is identifying areas that have potential for aquaculture. In this scoping process, it is important to review any existing coastal zone
management plan to establish whether it facilitates aquaculture development. Legal and regulatory frameworks should establish
clear mechanisms for aquaculture zoning and site selection in waterbodies considered “common property” and the granting of
tenure rights, including aquaculture licences.

Shrimp aquaculture ponds in Sinaloa, Mexico
The Mexican National programme for Aquaculture Management was created to: (i) enable an orderly and competitive aquaculture
sector that is sustainable; and (ii) regulate and administrate the sector using processes and tools such as the delimitation of aquaculture
zones. In this programme, shrimp farming in Sinaloa State is used as one example to illustrate how aquaculture is managed through
aquaculture production units or aquaculture zones.

Tilapia cage culture in Beihai, China
When there are several farms in an enclosed or well contained waterbody, it is essential to develop and implement an area management
plan to minimize risks of disease and environmental risks.
Tilapia is cultured in many types of production systems. This flexibility makes the fish attractive to farmers in many parts of the world
for subsistence and commercial production. Tilapia is also a favourite for many consumers. Fish from this farm in China is destined for
the American market, although consumption is increasing locally. This strong demand is supporting increased production around the
world in ponds and cages, in fresh and brackish water. However, as the industry grows, the risks also grow. Farmers must do their part
to reduce environmental and disease risks on each farm as part of a larger resource management system that will protect the quality
of water resources and the livelihoods for producers. Standardizing production practices and coordinating disease risks through area
management strategies are key aspects for ensuring sustainable growth of the industry.

   Even though each farmer may collect some information and may have access to meteorological forecasts,
   these may not be enough for early warning on local extreme events. Simple information collected and shared on
   a permanent basis (e.g. water temperature, oxygen, transparency, water level, fish behaviour, salinity) can be
   highly relevant for decision-making, especially when changes can produce dramatic consequences. For example,
   temperatures above or below average can trigger diseases, or can bring anoxic water to the surface or trigger
   algal blooms that kill fish. The monitoring of environmental variables such as oxygen and water transparency can
   also indicate excessive nutrient output from farms, etc. The sharing of monitoring information in common areas
   combined with early warning systems can assist rapid response to diseases and other threats such as algal blooms
   and anoxic bouts. In general, environmental monitoring systems should follow a risk-based approach that recognizes
   that increased risk requires increased monitoring efforts. The involvement and value of locally collected information
   should be seen as very relevant to farmers to better understand the biophysical processes and become part of the
   solution, e.g. rapid adaptation measures and early warning, long-term behavioural and investment changes. Key
   activities include training of local stakeholders on the value of the information, monitoring, and use of the feedback
   for decision-making. It is also advisable to provide/implement some simple network/platform to receive and analyse
   the information, to coordinate and connect with broader forecasts and monitoring systems, and to provide timely
   feedback that is useful to local stakeholders. In such cases, well organized AMAs can generate information and
   facilitate feedback for faster responses.
   A recent consultation on developing an environmental monitoring system to strengthen fisheries and aquaculture
   resilience and improve early warning in the Lower Mekong Basin took place in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2015 (FAO, 2017).

                                             It is essential both to ensure adequate performance is being generated against current objectives and to warrant that aquaculture is maintaining relevance with
                                             community expectations. Monitoring the implementation of the management plan should include environmental, social and governance indicators.

                                              Aquaculture Zoning, Site Selection and Area Management | 395
  The ecosystem approach to aquaculture provides the conceptual guideline for spatial planning
      and management. This publication describes the major steps related to these activities.
 The rationale for and objectives of each step, the ways (methodologies) to implement it, and the
  means (tools) that are available to enable a methodology are described in a stepwise fashion.
    Recommendations to practitioners and policy-makers are provided. A separate policy brief
   accompanies this paper. The benefits from spatial planning and management are numerous
    and include higher productivity and returns for investors, and more effective mitigation of
     environmental, economic and social risks, the details of which are provided in this paper.

                  This publication is organized in two parts. Part one is the “Guidance”;
   it is the main body of the document and describes the processes and steps for spatial planning,
   including aquaculture zoning, site selection and area management. Part two of the publication
       includes six annexes that present key topics, including: (i) binding and non-legally binding
international instruments, which set the context for sustainable national aquaculture; (ii) biosecurity
    zoning; (iii) aquaculture certification and zonal management; (iv) an overview of key tools and
 models that can be used to facilitate and inform the spatial planning process; (v) case studies from
 ten countries – Brazil, Chile, China, Indonesia, Mexico, Oman, the Philippines, Turkey, Uganda and
         the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; and (vi) a workshop report.

   The country case studies illustrate key aspects of the implementation of spatial planning and
 management at the national level, but mostly within local contexts. Take-home messages include
  the ways in which institutional, legal and policy issues are addressed to implement the process,
                                       or parts of the process.
