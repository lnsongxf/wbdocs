This report was prepared under the guidance of Ms. Mudita Chamroeun (senior rural
development specialist, World Bank) and Mr. Paavo Eliste (senior economist, World
Bank).

This report has been prepared by independent consultants Mr. James Stanelle and Ms.
Mak Solieng. Excellent and extensive advice was received from Mr. Brett Ballard
(advisor, AusAID) and Mr. Sovith Sin (senior program manager, AusAID). Peer-
review comments were provided by Mr. Craig Meisner (sector manager - Research
and Extension, Cambodia Agricultural Value Chain Program).

The report also benefited from valuable comments from participants in the
dissemination workshop held on November 17, 2011 in Phnom Penh Hotel, which
was chaired by Mr. Sokhun Rithykhun (acting director general, Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry). The participants of the workshop included
members of the Government, Development Partners, and private sector in Cambodia.

Ms Narya Ou provided excellent assistance in various aspects of the management and
administration of the project, and the preparation of the final document.

This report was commissioned by World Bank and the AusAID under the Cambodia
Food Crisis Capacity Support Partnership (FCCSP) Trust Fund, which is funded by
AusAID. The FCCSP is a joint AusAID - World Bank initiative to support Royal
Government of Cambodia and stakeholders to address the constraints in smallholder
agriculture and social protection that have been identified in the context of the food
and financial crises.

Executive Summary

Changes in seed industry are needed to increase agricultural
productivity and meet the government’s rice export targets

Rice is not just a crop but also the staple food in Cambodia. A major thrust of the
seed program in Cambodia involves rice. Some local rice varieties are important to
communities and must be maintained, but it is crucial that they are also improved for
better grain quality, higher yields, resistance to diseases or environmental stresses,
and less farm input requirement. Many Khmer farmers live near the subsistence level
and any new rice variety, even if it promises higher yields, could be seen as a threat to
their local heritage.


The use of quality seeds is a main component for realizing the yield potential and
increasing agricultural productivity. A modern seed industry contains a variety
development, seed production, quality control and processing, marketing and
governmental oversight. As the sector matures in Cambodia, each of these factors
becomes more important and plays a more prominent role in the growth if the
agricultural sector. As farmer is the final user of seed, the seed industry has to reshape
itself to better respond to the specific needs and develop products, which will yield
well and thrive in the conditions where they will be planted.


Changes in the seed production supply system are required to meet country’s
export targets. The government’s target to export 1 million tons of milled rice by
2015 poses challenges for Cambodian rice farmers. Successful implementation
depends on the cooperation and efforts of several government agencies. Full irrigation
of ca 800,000 ha of rice-cultivated area is required to meet this ambitious export
target. Improved access to irrigation is prerequisite for expanded production quality
seed.

Cambodia’s seed industry is weak without clear structure and
coordination

The seed industry in Cambodia lacks any official structure and overall
coordination. As of 2011, there is a fledgling formal structure by the Cambodian
Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI), which develops new rice
varieties and produces foundation seeds for rice. The institute also provides seed
production trainings to community seed producers as well as rice millers, who are
interested in buying consistent rice products from farmers. Another smaller network
for formal rice seed production and distribution is AQIP Seed Company, which is
owned by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) and Seed
Growers Association of Cambodia. There are also a few small-scale private
producers, who work directly under MAFF.


                                           xxi
Only 20 percent of total rice land is cultivated using quality seed. The term
“quality seed” refers to known varieties, which are produced under some type of seed
production program. There are farmers, however, who understand the benefits of
quality seed but cannot afford to buy it. Improving community access to quality seed
suitable for their plantation area, land conditions etc, is one of the most essential
methods to increase productivity.


There is a fast-growing gap between the demand and supply of quality seed. It is
estimated that the market demand for quality seed will grow from 23,000 metric ton
(Mt) in 2009-2010 to 38,500 Mt by 2015, and it will top 50,000 Mt by 2020. In the
contrast, the potential expansion of the seed supply within the next five years (2011-
2015) could reach about only 8,500 Mt. This means by 2015, there is going to be a
gap of some 30,000 - 32,000 Mt between supply and demand.


Private seed producers and community based seed production groups have
emerged as a response to increased demand for quality seed. The seed growers
involved in both the formal and informal systems have been trained by CARDI in
seed production methods and understand the need to maintain pure seed lines. At the
community levels, farmers don’t only produce seed for other farmers but also teach
other community members how to grow, store, and maintain their own planting stock.
Village seed programs are especially effective because potential seed users have
direct access to the seed grower and seed fields. In some cases, these community
groups have worked with rice traders to create projects and produce a value added
product directly to the final consumer.


Limited capital and outdated equipment are main challenges of the
Cambodia’s seed sector

The main constraints of the seed production supply in Cambodia are a capital
deficit, low diversification, and a lack of mechanized equipment and facilities.
These limitations force suppliers to use increasingly expensive hand labor, which
evades opportunities for higher quality seed production at a cheaper price. A lack of
operational capital is the most serious constraint as it greatly slows down the new
variety development and release. Due to limited resources, CARDI can produce only
seeds for guaranteed purchases. This has resulted in unfilled orders during the high
demand years and in sharp losses in the poor years, when expensive supply seed has
to be sold for milling at a great loss.


Cambodia’s hot and humid climate rapidly deteriorates seeds both in growth
and storage phases. Research shows that the level of rice germination falls below 80-
85 percent within 6-8 months after harvest. Therefore, any seed produced beyond
immediate planting needs is used for milling. Production costs of these seeds cannot
be recouped. When seed producers’ budgets are constrained, they often plan their
seed production based on conservative seed sales estimates.


                                         xxii
Cambodia’s seed market is weakly integrated. Information about seeds and seed
use is ineffectively communicated through the value chain, within the public sector
and between public and private sectors. Agro-input dealers are often ill equipped to
serve farmers in a productive manner and aren’t committed to servicing the farmer’s
needs.


Seed supply system also lacks consistency in quality and customer support. The
rice production system uses locally produced and mostly unimproved grain as seed
with variable quality to produce a crop with lower yields and poor quality. Farmers
often fail to receive sound agronomic advice and post-sale services from local shops.
Therefore, many farmers plant low quality seed without fertilizers and refuse to buy
other products.


The National Seed Law was passed in 2004 already. The raw structure for the
national seed program has been established, but without its accompanying Rules and
Regulations, the operational interpretation does not yet exist. No national seed quality
standards have yet been developed under the law.


Recommendations for policy actions

Recommendations for structuring the rice seed industry in Cambodia include the
following:


1. Enforce the implementation of the seed law by assisting the General
   Directorate of Agriculture in drafting the Rules and Regulations of the Seed
   Law.


Cambodia has passed a seed law but an appropriate English translation of the law
does not exist yet. The law will require a proper English translation before it can be
assessed appropriately. The following actions are needed:
   •   An expert consultant on seed law and policy will have to be hired to research
       the law; interpret its meaning for the Cambodian seed industry; consult with
       MAFF, CARDI, and seed industry officials; and write the Rules and
       Regulations to accompany the Seed Law.
   •   It is strongly recommended that the consultant be familiar with the seed
       programs in neighboring countries like Thailand (which is based on the United
       States seed system)
   •   The General Directorate of Agriculture has to begin putting together a
       program of plant breeders’ rights that will include a provision for variety
       owners to enforce their rights through civil proceedings. However, actual
       enactment of that rule and UPOV (the International Union for the Protection
       of New Varieties of Plants) membership is still a distance into the future.

   •   Seed certification is the normal program for seed production quality control in
       a country. Because of the current small-scale agricultural seed production, a
       seed certification program is not warranted at this time and would possibly
       add unneeded bureaucracy to the system. It is recommended that the structure
       of a voluntary certification be added to the rules and regulations so that it can
       be added as needed.


2. Develop a national seed quality standard and establish a modern seed-testing
   laboratory by CARDI that will function in seed certification, regulation, and
   variety development programs.


A strong and functional seed-testing laboratory is essential to understanding the
quality of the seed being traded in a country. Basic seed laboratories test seed for
germination, physical purity, and seed moisture and work in conjunction with seed
certification and seed regulatory programs. Labs can also add further services that
look at viability and storage potential of seed and can aid in other seed research as
well. A seed laboratory should be established and placed at CARDI. CAVAC is
considering the funding of the completion of an existing rice quality laboratory at
CARDI. The following actions are needed:
   •   As soon as the project and work plan are officially approved, a seed consultant
       should be contracted to assist CARDI in making the lab functional. The
       consultant should make his initial visit as the project implementation starts.
   •   During this initial visit, the consultant should prepare his action plan for the
       complete seed lab establishment, assess the industry needs and the CARDI
       location, and compile a list of equipment and training needs. The consultant
       should also look at how the lab will function and solicit business. At this
       point, the laboratory director and staff should already be selected and have
       begun working with the consultant. Their training needs should also be
       assessed at this time.
   •   Staff will have to be trained, which can be accomplished by sending the
       technicians to a functioning lab (possibly Thailand) for a number of weeks of
       training. They should be scheduled to return back before the second visit of
       the consultant.
   •   Arrangements will have to be with MAFF or other agencies to fund the on-
       going operation of the seed laboratory over time.
   •   Order seed laboratory equipment and arrange for the laboratory building or
       rooms to be built or remodeled for lab use.
   •   After the equipment arrives, an on-site set-up and start-up of the seed lab
       should be done in the second visit by the seed consultant, who will work with
       the lab staff for a few days in order to provide the necessary technical
       orientation and support needed.


3. Provide CARDI with budgetary assistance for increased production of
Foundation seed and supply them with some equipment that would make their
seed production and research programs more efficient and less dependent on
manual labor.



                                         xxiv
   •   CARDI needs to expand its research capacity toward improved varieties that
       are suitable to different needs beside premium rice. The varieties that are well
       suited for subsistence purposes and that are adaptable to varied climate and
       field conditions are in high demand (79,000 Mt)
   •   CARDI needs to establish good links and to work with many seed
       stakeholders including structural and non-structural, particularly large and
       medium scale, private, and state institutions to ensure a transparent technical
       operation for seed quality assurance as they are using seed sources from
       CARDI.
   •   Support to CARDI’s seed production would mean that greater amounts of seed
       would be available to rice farmers and significant returns could be generated
       in CS production (Each kg of FS planted could generate around $700 profit).

3. Increase investments in agricultural research to strengthen linkages between
   research and extension services, as they tend to work separately.


This results in researchers generating technologies and new varieties for the extension
workers who may not understand or be able to apply these technologies in the real
farm conditions. The following actions are needed:
   •   Develop a roadmap for research and extension integration, which provides
       concept and framework of integration, their respective roles and commitments,
       and the working approach.
   •   Some extension officers should be assigned to join the CARDI-OFAT
       research activities and CARDI’s researchers should be assigned to join the
       extension activities as well. This participation should be done for all research
       and extension programs, and they should be integrated in their action plan. In
       this way, any issue related to information and technologies as well as research-
       extension process that arise can be addressed in a timely and effective manner.
   •   In designing a research proposal, CARDI needs to have one component on
       extension of research results to research on how its research results should be
       applied in real farm conditions. The extension worker can participate or join
       this component from the onset of research; they should not wait until the
       results are generated because it will be too late to develop an extension
       approach.
   •   In the seed program, there is opportunity for a Joint Research Extension
       Project on Community Based Seed Production Technique operated by
       collaboration among CARDI, PDA, and Extension Officers at the provincial
       level. Through the process of promoting community based seed production
       supply, the researchers and extension workers can explore possibilities to
       develop linkages between research and extension services.

5. Provide training and establish an agro-input dealers’ network in order to
provide additional private sector extension services to the Khmer farmers.


Rice and vegetable farmers who purchase seed and/or other inputs are receiving
products of variable quality, without proper advisory services. The following actions
are needed:
   •    Establish a network of private sector agro-input dealers who have been
       trained in the use of seed, fertilizers, pesticides, mechanics, and who will
       demonstrate their products to potential customers. Use these dealers as
       additional private sector extension service that will perform after sales service
       to help and retain customers.
   •   Encourage development of a professional association/network that
       participating input dealers can use their group power to help farmers and
       influence policy makers. In Cambodia, IDE has established a network of
       Farm Business Enterprises (FBE) for vegetable growers. Internationally, IFDC
       and CNFA are the two NGO’s who have used this model in other countries.

6. Increase awareness on improved varieties and quality seed as the key factors
for crop improvement.


Support and promote the farmer/seed grower training activities by CARDI and other
appropriate institutions. The following actions are needed:
   •   Assist and expand CARDI’s current training and development programs to
       assist farmers at the community level in the following: (i) Purifying, growing,
       and maintaining local varieties; and (ii) growing, maintaining, and distributing
       CARDI seed released varieties through OFAT.
   •   Other programs in Cambodia such as CEDAC (Cambodian Centre for Study
       and Development in Agriculture) are aimed at community seed production to
       add a value added approach for organic rice. Support could be given to these
       programs. Alternatively, a community seed production/value added program
       could be instituted that would market local rice products more directly to
       consumers giving farmers a greater return for their product


7. Improve the integration of the seed industry by strengthening connections
within the public sector, and ties between public and private sectors.


Work must be done to identify the key players, and to introduce them to each other,
and to coordinate their efforts. This also would include on-farm rice seed tests,
demonstrations, and field days—not only for the farmer, but also to unify the key rice
players. The following actions are needed:
   •   CAVAC is a project that is working within extension and value chain
       enhancement, and there is a possibility to do extension coordination and
       training with CAVAC—others may exist as well. This program should work




                                         xxvi
       with MAFF, CARDI, and the Department of Extension to work together to
       coordinate extension activities within the value chain.
   •   Procure a consultant who has extension experience in crops testing, on-farm
       demonstrations, farmer meetings, and field days to work with MAFF, CARDI,
       Extension, seed farms, and PDA’s to uncover pertinent information that can be
       presented to farmers about their seed and input choices.
   •   Fund CARDI in expanding its test plots and farmer demonstration plots in rice
       growing areas of the country.


8. Improve capacity and management of seed production farms, including rice,
vegetable and other cereal seed, at the community level.


Much of the current control of theses farms comes directly from MAFF. It is believed
that increased local control would contribute to increased operational efficiency and
greater productivity. More local control of these facilities may help the seed farms to
better service farmer seed buyers with increasing amounts of high quality seed and
better information. The following actions are needed:
   •   Evaluate the MAFF seed production farms and where appropriate, restructure
       them so that they can better serve their farmer clientele.
   •   Write a business plan for the farm that would provide increasing service and
       products to local farmers and give the farm a financial basis. This plan would
       look at all aspects of farm operation and identify the aspects that are profitable
       so that the farm can be more successful. This would most likely include
       reasonable overhead payments to MAFF. Local consultants should be
       available to assist in this process.




                                         xxvii
1. Introduction

1.      The use of quality seed is a major component of increased yields in crop
production. Quality seed and seed programs in a country does not emerge by
happenstance; it is created by a combination of many factors that include variety
development, seed production, quality control, processing, marketing, and
governmental oversight. As the seed sector in a country matures, each of these
factors becomes more important and plays a more important role in the growth of the
agricultural sector.


2.      The seed program in Cambodia is interestingly different from that in
many other developing countries. In many nations, especially those of the former
Soviet Union bloc, traditional seed programs are in place; however, they are often
mired with antiquated procedures and unworkable practices. Moreover, they are
frequently staffed with bureaucrats, making for an existing system that simply does
not function. Cambodia’s system is nearly the antithesis: there is almost no vestige
of the former system, but production and sales of seed continue with a strong belief in
the need for quality seed.


3.      Even without a true seed program in Cambodia, farmers understand the
need to plant quality seed to increase crop yields. Also, seed growing farmers often
understand the methods employed to maintain genetic and physical purity of their
seed crops. Furthermore governmental bodies understand the need for oversight of the
industry without instituting burdensome regulatory scrutiny that would hamper its
growth. That being said, it is imperative that Cambodia’s seed industry—still in its
infancy— be structured correctly, so that it can grow from many, small groups of
locally selling seed growers to an industry capable of functioning in the international
market.


4.      When structuring this growing seed industry, it is important to look at
current practices and to incorporate these practices into programs. Starting new
programs, which may use steps that are alien to participants in the industry, are
ineffective. For example, it would be prudent to build on the current quality control
systems of seed production rather than to start a new type of seed certification
program. It is critical to use good workable programs and to build them into national
programs without confusing the farmer participants with new procedures or rules they
cannot comprehend.


5.      Since a major thrust of the seed program in Cambodia involves rice, it is
important to consider its role in the average Cambodian’s life. Rice is not just a
crop: it is the staple food.. Specific rice types and flavors are important and must be
maintained, but it is important that they are also improved. Local varieties are
important to individual communities and the loss of those varieties for the sake of an



                                          1
increased yield would be considered a loss of local heritage. Many farmers exist at or
near the subsistence level and may be unwilling to give up known varieties for new,
superior types because they understand the capabilities and restrictions of their own
variety. Any new type, even if it was a higher yielding variety, could be a threat to
their lifestyle. The fear is that its agronomic needs could cause it to fail and to bring
on a local food crisis. These factors that tie the rice to the people must be considered
when designing a seed system in Cambodia. This is especially true when rice is being
produced at a subsistence basis or on a small family plot; a major part of any farmer’s
decision will include how a change in variety or field practice will affect the field’s
ability to produce sufficient amounts of food and cash to his or her family.


6.     Cambodia’s climate must also be accounted for in any decisions
regarding seed. Its heat and humidity causes rapid deterioration of seed viability and
germination in rice and other seeds in both the growth and storage phases. CARDI
research has shown that the level of rice germination falls below 80-85 percent within
6-8 months after harvest; this means that seed must be planted during the growing
season following harvest. Therefore, any seed produced beyond immediate planting
needs for the next crop is used for milling; seed production costs for that seed cannot
be recouped. When seed producers’ budgets are constrained, they often plan their
seed production based on conservative seed sales estimates.




                                           2
2. Government Oversight

8.      It is often the goal of governmental officials to control the seed industry
through seed laws and programs. However, the role of government regarding seed
laws, seed certification, seed laboratories, and other seed offices should be limited to
protecting the farmer and the final seed buyer from inadvertent quality lapses or
fraudulent acts. If the government can fulfill this role without burdening the industry,
it allows the seed industry to grow and to be flexible in its development.


2.1. General directorate of agriculture (GDA)

9.      The individuals involved with seed programs at the GDA grasp the
proper type of governmental oversight needed in the Cambodian seed industry.
There was no indication of a need or desire to establish burdensome oversight
mechanisms. They seemed to believe that programs that allow for the production of
quality seed for planting should be their role; moreover, they seem to understand that
producing this seed without major governmental interference will be most effective
method to do so.. The current seed law does not contain rules and regulations for its
enforcement often creating situations where individuals have differing opinions about
procedures. This is further evidence to draft and to approve the rules and regulations
for the seed law.


2.2. Seed law

10.    A seed law gives the structure for seed sales within a country. The true
purpose of a seed law is to protect the final seed buyer from a product that will not
perform up to expectations. The law will usually provide for certain quality standards
and adherence to seed production and quality control activities. .

11.     Cambodia has passed a seed law, which could possibly be similar to
nearby countries; however, it is impossible to determine because no official or
accurate translation exists at the time of this writing. A 2004 version of a seed law
written in English was obtained–this version was much like European seed laws that
include substantial governmental oversight and would not allow for the emerging seed
industry to function as it is currently. . It is not known how or why this earlier version
was changed prior to enacting the current law. Discussions with seed officials from
the GDA imply that the current seed law is not the same as this earlier draft. There are
no rules and regulations for the law at this time; for a law to be interpreted and
enforced, consistent rules and regulations are required. The first step for a seed
program in Cambodia would be to translate the law into English. A qualified




                                            3
consultant would then be needed to assist the GDA, MAFF and CARDI in drafting
and approving the regulations.


2.3. Plant breeders rights

12.     With the advent of private sector plant breeding companies, a system had
to be installed that would allow variety owners to maintain control over the use
of their varieties and to derive an income from them. Laws for the establishment
of Plant Breeders Rights (also known as Plant Variety Protection) were written for
this purpose. To standardize these laws between countries, the International Union for
the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) treaty was established.

13.    Individual countries that wish to establish a set of plant breeders’ rights
must enact a law that complies with the UPOV treaty and then apply to UPOV for
acceptance as a treaty signatory. UPOV membership would allow for the importing of
many current private varieties that would grow well in this country.

14.    Since Cambodia does not have a functioning seed law with accompanying
rules and regulations, it is still at some distance from UPOV membership. The
General Directorate of Agriculture has begun putting together a program of plant
breeders’ rights that will include a provision for variety owners to enforce their rights
through civil proceedings. However, actual enactment of that rule and UPOV
membership is still a distance into the future.

15.     A plant breeders’ rights position is important to the growth of the seed
industry in Cambodia. Multi-national seed companies are often hesitant to allow
their varieties to be shipped into a country because of the fear of the loss of control of
that variety. Loss of control means that subsequent generations of that variety could
be planted without compensation to the parent company. Since the best and newest
crop characteristics are often contained in these new varieties, a lack of plant
breeders’ rights laws would mean that large seed companies would not be entering
Cambodia. More importantly, the best seed would not be reaching the farmers.

16.     Enforcement of plant breeders’ rights must also be addressed. Although
some governmental regulatory oversight in the form of border control, stop sales, and
seizures might be important, a system that would allow for civil remedies by the seed
company to stop infractions would most likely have to be included in the seed
regulations.


2.4. Seed certification


17.     Seed certification is a program of quality control in seed production that
establishes procedures and minimum quality standards in seed production. Seed
production within a certification system does not guarantee that certified seed is high
quality, but instead says that the seed has been subjected to certain practices,


                                            4
procedures, and rules. Thus, because seed has been subjected to the certification
process, it has a good chance that it is of high quality. Seed certification is based on a
generational system: i) Foundation seed (FS) is the most closely controlled class and
grown from seed supplied by the breeder or owner of the variety; ii) Registered seed
(RS) is grown from Foundation seed and is a multiplication class of seed that has
standards that are less strict than Foundation class; iii) Certified class or the
Commercial seed (CS) is the progeny of Registered seed and uses standards less
stringent than Registered seed. Many countries use a system called the limited
generation system: the three classes are all that are allowed and that
Certified/Commercial seed can only be grown for grain and not for further seed
production. Where the limited generation system is not used, as is the case in
Cambodia, Commercial seed can be continually used for further production as long as
minimum standards are met. In this case, successive generations of Commercial seed
might be given a classification of C1, C2, C3, C4…and so forth. The possibility of
genetic contamination and therefore lower field performance increases with more
generations from the Foundation seed to the current Commercial level. Generally, it is
recommended to renew the Commercial seed every three years.


18.     The seed law authorizes seed certification systems in a country with
certification standards often written into the rules and regulations. A
Certification system in a country can either be mandatory or voluntary. Mandatory
systems are common in Europe and Central Asia and are usually operated through
ministries of agriculture. Mandatory systems require that all seed produced in the
country must go through a certification program to assure that the seed produced has
some assurance of good quality. A mandatory seed certification program works best
in a country that has a strong structure and is able to identify and control the seed
grown and planted within its borders. In countries where the government does not
have this level of control, seed production and importation often goes unnoticed by
the governmental authority and therefore much of the seed being distributed to
farmers for planting is not subject to any third-party oversight.


19.      Voluntary seed certification programs exist in other parts of the world
including the United States, Canada, and as near to Cambodia as Thailand.
Voluntary seed certification is used at the discretion of the owner of the seed variety.
Seed certification is managed by a governmental agency or designated to be operated
by a non-governmental group—often a seed grower’s association and subject to
oversight under the seed law. The final seed product is tagged with an official label
that is recognized as quality seed. Non-certified seed produced in those countries with
voluntary programs is most often produced by private companies under their own
quality control programs and are backed by the producing company’s reputation. This
is not to say that there is no governmental oversight over non-certified seed in
countries with voluntary certification programs. Governmental seed regulatory
programs (described later) are necessary to monitor seed production quality systems,
especially in countries with a voluntary seed certification program because of the
possibility of non-complying seed—either inadvertent or intentional.




                                            5
20.     Seed certification programs use standards and procedures that are
consistent from internationally so that seed labeled in one country can easily be
shipped to another. It is also done so that seed buyers in the country of import can be
assured that the seed they purchased is comparable to that produced in their own
country. In the current world of multi-national seed companies and international
trade, seed certification is a major tool used to insure the quality and consistency of
seed shipped across borders. Most often countries with active seed certification
programs are members of multi-national seed certification groups or trade treaties
such as the Association of Official Seed Certifying Agencies (ASOCA) or the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that establish
uniform standards for seed in international commerce.


21.     A most likely scenario for seed certification in Cambodia would be the use
of the voluntary system. It is the system used in Thailand, a major seed power in the
region. Current seed production is more informal in Cambodia and much of current
seed production would never even be exposed to true certification. This system would
also be the logical extension of the current quality control program (formal and
informal) now used in the country by seed producers.


22.    Although seed certification is an excellent program that protects the seed
buyer, it is currently not necessary to implement a seed certification here at this
time. The following are the reasons for this recommendation:
   •   Farmers are already aware of the value of using good seed in their crop
       production;
   •   Increasing amounts of rice and other crop seeds are being produced by trained
       farmers under quality seed production systems;
   •   Small holder agriculture allows for farmers to scrutinize seed production plots;
   •   Increasing amounts of rice seed is produced by community farmer
       associations where potential seed buyers and users are able to watch the seed
       production process of the local seed grower;
   •   A seed certification program would impose added costs on either the
       government or the seed grower for programs that are already evolving without
       expenditures;
   •   Production of seed for the international market is not a possible option at this
       point; and
   •   The system would be virtually unused.

23.    The biggest possible beneficiary of a seed certification program would be
the AQIP Seed Company. However, they currently use their own quality control
system that seems to be working for them. The company said that if such a system
was in place they would use it, but it is not currently essential to their needs.




                                          6
2.5. Seed regulatory programs and truth in labeling

24.     Seed regulatory programs designated under the seed law provide for
truth in labeling oversight programs in the seed trade. This requires that any seed
sold must conform to the information listed on its label. Governmental regulatory
inspectors can sample seed. If germination, mechanical purity, or other labeled
information is found to be incorrect, the seed lot can be removed from sale, destroyed,
or fines can be issued to labelers for infractions. Additionally, regulatory oversight
handles customer complaints for seed non-performance. Seed buyers in countries
with voluntary certification programs tend to be more informed about seed choices
because they may be relying on the reputation of a seed company rather than the
independent third party quality control of a seed certification program.

25.     Since seed quality is difficult to ascertain by simply looking in the bag, the
seed label is the method that seed buyers use to understand the quality of the
seed they buy. It therefore becomes important that the label information is correct; a
governmental seed regulatory program can help to insure that mislabeling, either
inadvertent or intentional, does not occur. Truth in labeling does not insure that the
seed is of good quality; it states that it conforms to the label information. For
instance, a seed label saying 0 percent germination would be truthfully labeled and
often legal, but the seed would be of poor quality.

26.     In countries such as Cambodia where the level of farmer sophistication is
lower than in other countries, it would be necessary to establish minimum levels
for germination, purity, and weed content on the labels. These levels are often set
by crop type and are designated in the Seed Law Rules and Regulations. Minimum
label requirements would be essential in Cambodia.


2.6. Seed testing laboratory

27.     A seed laboratory is an integral part of seed system. Physical
characteristics such as seed purity, moisture, germination, presence of disease, and
weed seed content are determined through an analysis in a laboratory. Seed analysts
are trained and in some circumstances are specialists in specific areas of analysis. A
seed laboratory is essential to the operation of an official seed certification programs
and for seed regulatory functions. Results from seed tests are used for seed labeling
purposes. In addition, a seed laboratory can also function as an aid in a variety of
development and research programs.

28.     Consistency of results over time and location is important because of the
possible movement of seed lots from place to place. Seed laboratories are
accredited through the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA) to provide
consistent test results through approved methods and testing apparatus. Accreditation
means that the laboratory has the correct testing equipment, consistent procedures,
and its analysts have the training and expertise to perform consistent and accurate
seed tests.


                                           7
29.      There is no seed laboratory in Cambodia, and to have a functioning seed
industry in the country, one will be necessary at some point. The lack of a seed
laboratory does not imply that little is known about the physical quality of rice seed.
Close work in small seed plots means that farmers can easily remove contaminating
impurities. Also, sun drying of the seed insures storable seed moistures. Farmer seed
growers have been trained to perform a simple and fairly accurate germination test on
their seed before the planting season. Seed is soaked in water for a day and then 100
seeds are counted and rolled into a cloth towel. After 24 hours a reasonable
indication of germination can be read by counting the number of shoots beginning to
emerge. Almost universally, farmers growing seed for distribution or sale performed
this test one or more times before planting the seed.

30.     A seed laboratory is essential for a country with a seed program. Placing a
lab at CARDI would be the logical step, especially since they are anticipating a grant
to complete CARDI’s existing rice quality lab as part of a CAVAC project. (The
recommendations are for a consultant to help setup the seed lab; this consultant would
have to look at the needs in light of existing equipment). The addition of the seed
testing lab to the quality lab would seem to be a good fit. According to the Seed
Bureau Equipment Company, a prominent lab equipment supplier in the US, a
complete lab capable of meeting ISTA standards including a double chamber
germinator could be purchased and delivered for $110,000. Supplies for yearly
operations would be about $1,000 to $1,500 per year using existing CARDI staff.


2.7. Variety testing and registration


31.     At this point, the only new rice varieties being developed in Cambodia
come through the CARDI system. There currently seems to be little chance for any
other entities to develop and release new varieties; AQIP would like to have their own
variety development program, but their sales and financial position seem to preclude
that possibility for some time to come.


32.     In most national seed programs, potential new public varieties being
considered for release go through a program of testing and review to see if the
potential variety qualifies for release. There are two components to this testing
known as DUS and VCU. The first, DUS is the acronym for Distinctiveness,
Uniformity, and Stability. In other words, the variety must have some differences
from existing varieties, those characteristics must be similar in all plants of that
variety, and the plants of that variety must maintain that uniqueness over generations.
The second, VCU testing, stands for ‘Value for Cultivation’ meaning that, the plant of
the variety must grow, thrive, and yield well in its area of adaptation.


33.     In most cases a body independent of the developing agency performs this
review of potential varieties. However, in Cambodia, CARDI both develops the
varieties and approves their release. The potential problem is that if and when other


                                          8
entities begin to produce new varieties, there may be a conflict of interest for CARDI,
being in a position to approve or reject those new varieties. The potential for this in
the near future is low, and CARDI seems to be performing this duty because of the
lack of involvement by any other body.


34.     Many countries have official seed lists that limit the use of varieties to
those that have been tested for use within their borders. These lists are created to
protect the farmer from varieties that will not grow well in the local environment, but
the lists are often restrictive and inclusion may be arbitrary. A major problem with
variety lists in countries like Cambodia is that much of the cultivated land is often
planted with varieties not on the list. Local varieties or those brought into the country
through unofficial means are often not on the list. Hence, the purpose of protecting
the farmers from bad varieties often does not cover most of the seed planted.
Sometimes the inconvenience or the cost of testing to be put on the list may be more
than seed companies want to deal with, thereby keeping good varieties out of the
country.

35.      The 2004 draft for the seed law contained wording that would establish
such a list, but discussions with the GDA led to the belief that it does not want to
have such a list to allow farmers to have easier access to new varieties. CARDI’s
variety test program is a viable alternative to this list. CARDI tests for variety
adaptability on its new varieties; it also allows this information to be available to seed
buyers. The list becomes a recommended list of available varieties, but it does not
restrict the sales of other, non-tested varieties. If at some time in the future, seed
companies wanted to provide seed in Cambodia, CARDI could also make this testing
service available for a fee for other, outside varieties..


2.8. Analysis on paddy production and rice export policy of the RGC


36.     The RGC Policy (RGC, 2010) to promote paddy production and rice
exports sets forward a number of policy measures related to paddy production,
collection and processing, logistics, and marketing. The following actions are
related to the quality of seed production: (i) increasing paddy productivity by using
high yielding seed and modern farming techniques; (ii) addressing the issues of
standards, classification, and quality according to international norms; (iii)
strengthening institutional capacity of the government in defining the rice quality
standards in Cambodia; and (iv) creating the independent certification system.


37.     Specific actions for the implementation of these policy measures include
the following:
   •   Facilitating import procedures for rice seeds, fertilizers, agricultural inputs,
       and machineries, as well as to provide tax incentives for the importation of
       materials and equipments;
   •   Providing incentives to local seed producers and distributors through a
       determination by MAFF of a number of prioritized varieties to be promoted


                                            9
        and disseminated, and a preparation of a legal framework and mechanisms by
        MAFF to promote seed production and distribution by the end of 20101; and
    •   Strengthening and expanding the capacity of CARDI, agricultural
        experimentation stations, and the Agricultural Development Center for Seed
        Production, Research, and Technical Training.


2.8.1. Action related to seed legal framework


38.     Seed law is developed with the purpose to protect the ownership rights
and quality control of seeds. Both MAFF and GDA are responsible for the
implementation of seed law including the development of detailed articles.
Simultaneously, the ownership rights of new seeds are being certified by MIME after
all technical tests are completed and officially approved by MAFF. In case of seed
importation from abroad, MAFF will be responsible for seed tests. The registration of
private seed companies is done by the Ministry of Commerce; the registration of seed
associations is done by the Ministry of Interior; and the registration of community
seed based organizations is done by MAFF.


40.     The feedback from private seed producers on the new seed law indicates
that they would like to see the establishment of a clear legal framework for seed
production. The producers hope that this will facilitate their businesses; some
producers have faced difficulties in registration in its absence. Although seed quality
and ownership rights are concerns for the seed producers, the perception of the private
sector is that new law would support the development of the seed sector. The
feedback indicates that the private sector would like to see the continued open trade
policy of the government and improvements in the general business environment.

2.8.2. Actions related to seed production supply

41.    MAFF, through GDA, is currently producing quality seed for distribution
to farmers with the support of the ADB funded Pilot Seed Production Project
(2010-2011). A total of 450 ha of seed production is taking place in the following
three GDA sites: Tuol Samrong Seed Farm in Battambang Province (200 ha); contract
farming in Trapeang Thmar in Banteay Meanchey Province (50 ha); and Kampong
Thom Province (200 ha). It is expected that a few thousands metric tons of good seed
(IR66) produced from this project will be available for the farmers in the coming
season 2010-2011. The project will end in June 2011; the continuity of this seed
production is not known.



1
  The following ten varieties developed and released by MAFF are being promoted: (i) Sen Pidor,
Chulsar and IR66 for early duration varieties; (ii) Phka Roumduol, Phka Roumdeng, Chan Sen Sar, and
Phka Romiet for medium duration varieties; and (iii) Reang Chey, CAR4 and CAR6 for late duration
varieties. The legal framework and mechanisms to promote these seeds for production and distribution
is being prepared.



                                                10
43.     Discussions with key individuals revealed that GDA seed production is
not being perceived as undermining private seed production—at least not in the
short term. It is seen as an additional source of supply of seed to fill the unmet
demand by farmers who have had difficulty accessing quality seeds. In the long-term,
GDA seed production is not perceived to be sustainable due to limited financial
support, which is dependent on donor funding. Maintaining the on-going seed
production and distribution activities for free seed distribution, coupled with the
limited human resources to coordinate and facilitate the quality seed production are
problematic. The Government’s role in seed production is therefore primarily related
to providing services, and creating an enabling policy environment, promoting the use
of good quality seeds, ensuring quality control, and strengthening seed law
enforcement. Other responsibilities of the government would include promoting the
use of high quality seed among smallholder farmers; producing a foundation seed for
seed producers; and supporting the private seed producers with necessary technical
assistance to enable them produce high quality seed.

3. Rice Seeds Production Supply System in
Cambodia

3.1. Rice seed production supply chain

47.    Rice seed is produced and distributed through a formal, although small,
seed production network consisting mostly of the AQIP Seed Company, MAFF’s
Tuol Samrong Seed Farm, OFAT Farmers Cooperators, NGOs, and a few rice
exporters that have recently emerged. At the same time, a less formal rice seed
production system is also producing quality seed and functioning at the community
level with individuals who have been trained by CARDI, NGO’s, projects, or by rice
exporters or millers seeking to buy a consistent product from a farmer network. At
present, existing farmer networks are still small—some have about 90 members.
Champei and the other eight Agricultural Development Communities, along with the
CEDAC Farmers Seed Associations are some examples that can be promoted and
empowered.

48.     Geographically, quality seed is distributed within the 15 provinces of the
country where AQIP’s sales network is developed. This includes the provinces of
Kandal, Takeo, Kampong Speu, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng, Kampong Cham, Kampong
Thom, Kampong Chhnang, Kampot, Pursat, Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Siem
Reap, Kratie, and Stung Treng, which are the major rice growing areas of the country.
Farmers buying AQIP seed are not the only users of that seed. They also share some
quality seed from the first season production with neighboring farmers; however, it is
difficult to estimate their numbers accurately. For an accurate expansion of quality
seed use, a more thorough assessment must be conducted.

3.1.1. The formal rice seed production system

The Cambodian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI)

49.    CARDI’s mandate within the seed system is to maintain local genetic
variability, to develop new rice varieties, to release those varieties, to produce and
maintain a supply of parent seed (breeder and foundation) to supply to private seed
growers, and to educate farmers and seed growers about those rice varieties and
production techniques.


50.    CARDI maintains a long-term genetic seed bank for rice. An amount of
2,557 samples of current seed varieties, local landraces, and wild rice relatives are
maintained in freezer units for breeding purposes. The main purpose of this facility is
to maintain the genetic variability of the rice genome for the country. This collection



                                          12
is actively used in their breeding program and samples are periodically checked for
viability and samples are regenerated when necessary. The International Rice
Research Institute (IRRI) maintains a backup set of samples for everything stored at
the CARDI facility.

51.     CARDI’s variety development program used the following process to
select superior plants from existing varieties. Selection is a slow process that relies
on plants that exhibit superior traits to be hand selected and then propagated. Since
2006, a backcrossing program has been used where a popular variety is hand crossed
with another for the purpose of introducing one new, superior trait into that variety.
After five successive generations, all plants not conforming to the parent variety with
the one new trait are culled and the subsequent pure line is replanted. After the fifth
year, most of the genetic variation is removed from the resultant variety and the new
variety can be released. More recently, a genetic test is now being performed that can
identify the desired plants in earlier generations; this can eliminate several years from
the development process. The backcross method of variety development is important
because it uses the existing varieties that farmers are familiar with and know how to
grow. It then adds a single trait that will make the new variety superior to the former.
By using these existing varieties, it is hoped that farmers will accept these new
varieties more readily because of the similarity to the varieties they are using
presently. CARDI has been doing variety development for over 15 years. I that time,
it has released 39 new varieties—including both wet and dry season strains.
However, only the more popular varieties are being grown for Foundation seed
production at this time. Varieties development and seed production process at CARDI
are presented in Figure 1.

                                           13
52.     Currently, CARDI is producing about 5Mt of FS on 2.5ha of land base on
order. Much of the fieldwork is performed via hand labor. In addition to this being a
comparatively expensive option (detailed are discussed in Section 3.3.1), hand labor
will also become a major challenge when the demand for high quality FS will
inevitably increase in the future. To ensure quality seed, all fieldwork must be
completed timely in accordance with both varieties and the seasons. Moreover, seed
processing after harvest must be completed quickly. According to theory, seed lots
should begin the drying process within 24 hours after harvest. Field operations like
transplanting, harvesting, and threshing are important activities that require heavy
hand labor. These operations should be mechanized, not only for effectiveness and
efficiency, but also for applying quality production procedures and ensuring good
results. Roguing and other seed field maintenance jobs involved in quality seed
production will remain as hand labor—even after mechanization.

53.     Produced rice seed is being sold to AQIP Seed Company, MAFF’s Tuol
Samrong Seed Farm, NGOs, and a few rice export companies at USD$3.5/kg. FS
is also used in research: OFAT with Farmers Cooperators for new varieties’
adaptation and introduction. CARDI also produces small amounts of RS and GS for
customers who have such needs. In 2009, quality seed (including 2.3Mt of FS, 3.1Mt
of RS and 11Mt of GS) was sent out from CARDI through sale, research, and for
other reasons.


           Figure 2: Formal rice seed production system supply chain




                                         14
54.    CARDI currently has four major constraints in the production of FS that
need to be improved. These constraints will need to be addressed because of the
impending demand for quality seed in the near future. The four constraints are as
follows:

1) The first is institutional constraints. These include (a) coordination and
   integration with other departments of MAFF, (b) logistics arrangements as a semi-
   autonomous institution, and (c) high staff turnover.

                a) In regards to coordination and integration with other
                   departments, both MAFF and CARDI need to cooperate with the
                   GDA for enhancing production. They must also cooperate with
                   the Department of Extension for promoting the released seeds
                   and research findings. Presently, the activities and roadmap for
                   institutional linkage and integration of these departments is not
                   clear, nor is it well coordinated.

                b) Regarding logistics procedures, the process of logistics
                   procedures is very complicated and time consuming. As a seed
                   source service institution, CARDI needs to establish good links
                   and to work with many seed stakeholders including structural and
                   non-structural, particularly large and medium scale, private, and
                   state institutions to ensure a transparent technical operation for
                   seed quality assurance as they are using seed sources from
                   CARDI.

                c) Turnover at CARDI is high. When trained staff members leave
                   CARDI, the retraining and capacity building of new staff is
                   costly and time consuming. In addressing this problem, CARDI
                   must improve staff salary and create an attractive employment
                   program.


2) The second is Technical physical constraints. One of the technical issues for
   CARDI is the unclear chain with AQIP in seed quality control. Because this
   private company uses the seed source from CARDI, developing transparent
   operation processes and a clear chain for seed inspection is crucial.


3) The third constraint lies in the existing facilities and equipment. CARDI
   lacks adequate storage facilities for keeping seed in good condition. In terms of
   equipment, CARDI needs a tractor, plough, thresher, and seed grader for cleaning
   and grading seeds. A facility for seed quality testing will also be needed—this can
   be a simple laboratory with the requisite capacity building to ensure the operation
   and functionality of the seed lab.. Improved access to facilities and equipment will
   allow for faster and more accurate planting and harvesting of seed fields—while
   using less hand labor. Both of these constraints are interrelated to the last
   constraint: a lack of capital.




                                          15
4) The last constraint is the lack of operating capital. Because of its current
   financial situation, CARDI is unable to plant extra FS without assurances of
   selling all that is produced. Production of additional seed would allow for more
   available seed for sale in good years. The current lack of capital creates a problem
   in poor years: surplus seed with high production costs has to be sold as milling
   rice because germination rates reduce quickly after six months. This causes
   CARDI to be conservative in its projection estimates for production.


55.      CARDI not only develops varieties and produces quality seeds, but also
introduces new seeds to farmers through On-farm Trial (OFAT) and provides
for farmers’ education on seed purification as part of its seed service activities.
These objectives of these activities have been done with the following objectives: i) to
introduce and extend new quality seeds to farmers and other stakeholders, ii) to build
farmers’ knowledge and skills on purified seed, and iii) to promote the use of quality
seeds to increase production and to add value. Experiences from these activities have
shown that OFAT farmers who demonstrated good performance and achieved good
results attracted other farmers and dealers from neighboring villages, communes,
districts, and even other provinces. In this way, quality seed is produced and spread
throughout the country. However, because of a limited budget for conducting OFAT
activities, the number of OFATs has been reduced from 700 per year during CIAP
period to only 50 OFATs per year at the time of this writing. A reactivation of this
activity would increase community-based access to quality seed.


The AQIP Seed Company


56.    AQIP began as a project to produce seed in 2001. In 2007, it became an
independent company when the project ended. Owners include the MAFF, the Seed
Growers Association of Cambodia, company employees, and some trustees.


57.    AQIP acquires its parent seed from CARDI, and Foundation seed is
priced at $3.50/kg. This seed is sold to contract farmers at 3000 KHR/kg (about
$0.80/kg) because farmers have a difficult time realizing the value of this seed at
$3.50/kg and the cost of the seed can be prohibitive. The value of paddy rice is about
1,000 KHR/kg: the seed is priced to the farmers at about triple the grain value.
Farmers are also sold RS for Commercial seed production at 3000 KHR/kg. The CS
sold at AQIP ranges from 2400 KHR /kg to 2,800 KHR/kg depending on
early/medium fragrant or non-fragrant varieties.


58.    Production began in four provinces with stations in each; although one
province was determined unsuitable for seed production and has been
eliminated. AQIP uses over 1000 farmers to produce its seed; the average farmer
grows seed on 0.5 to 1 ha fields; although some fields are nearly 3 ha and some are
much larger (40 ha in Baray, Donkeo District, Takeo province). Registered seed is
produced on the larger fields—usually 1ha or larger. In order to break the capital
constraints of the seed-growing farmers, AQIP organizes farmers into seed producers
groups and contract farming to ensure high quality and quantity seed production.


                                          16
AQIP provides seed purchase on credit, in addition to its own agricultural extension
services and its own market information services. To achieve this, AQIP has hired
qualified and experienced agronomy and engineering experts to train farmers and to
ensure agricultural quality improvement.


59.     Each of the three production stations has two seed production supervisors
who provide oversight to the field operations. For RS production, farmers are
required to plant a nursery with vigorous seedlings, which are then transplanted at the
rate of one tiller per hill. This is done because of the high value of the seed, purity
control, and the desire to use it efficiently. Farmers have the option of using
transplants in the growth of the Commercial class of seed. Farmers are required to
keep fields free of off-type plants and undesirable weeds during the growing season.
There is no requirement for fertilizer or pesticide application although most
understand the value of trying to optimize yields using these products. Additional
management and costs above the cost of grain production to the seed-growing farmer
are for field management activities, especially the removal of off-type plants.
Farmers receive a premium of up to 200 KHR/kg of seed delivered based on a
contract with a priced tied to the market price at harvest.


60.     Seed is harvested using traditional methods. Farmers are expected to supply
seed to AQIP that is relatively clean, which might mean that some traditional
winnowing is necessary at the farm level before transport to AQIP. Seed is scheduled
for shipment to the AQIP seed facility so that it can be processed in a one to two day
period after delivery. Once at AQIP, the seed is tested for moisture content and
usually dried down to 12-13 percent moisture. Seed dryers are bins with screen
bottoms where warm air is blown through. In most cases, the dryers are fueled by
burning rice hulls, so drying costs are low. During the drying and other parts of the
processing cycle, methods are used to continually identify the seed lot so that loss of
product identity is not compromised.


61.     AQIP has a means of testing the seed for germination and purity. Their
lab and their procedures may not be accredited or well trained, but they do have the
ability to perform an adequate test that should give acceptable results. All seed is
labeled to a minimum of accepted levels. Germination is labeled at 80 percent,
physical purity at 98 percent, and levels up to 3 percent of off type plants are
tolerated. All of their standards are similar to normally accepted levels.


62.     After drying, the seed goes directly to the air/screen grader for cleaning
and the seed is bagged in clean bags at the back of the cleaner. After cleaning,
each seed lot is sampled for seed analysis. Each seed bag is printed with the variety
name, seed class, individual lot number, seed analysis information, a 30-day warranty,
and telephone contact information. Seed is stored on pallets in a warehouse and
plastic sheets are used to protect bags and minimize bird and rodent losses. The
warehouse is enclosed and ventilated so that extreme conditions are moderated, but
the seed is still exposed to the warm and humid conditions that can have a negative
effect on seed viability.



                                          17
63.     AQIP has a dealer network with 800 active dealerships in 15 provinces.
Seed is shipped to them just before planting time; the timing of the shipments helps
AQIP to maintain control of the seed in its own warehouse where the quality of
storage is known. Seed is priced at a rate that is approximately 2 to 2.3 times the cost
of rice in the market. As part of the sales agreement, the farmer is told to perform a
basic germination test on the seed in the days before planting. The 30-day warranty
therefore allows farmers to return seed with reduced viability before planting.
Although the warranty is listed at 30 days, claims against seed performance are
investigated and compensation can be awarded if the seed is at fault. Most often, loss
of viability is the only claim and any field problems are usually attributed to
mismanagement by the farmer. AQIP trains its dealers in handling its seed and how to
deal with seed customers. Beyond rice seed, AQIP personnel have little knowledge of
other products sold by their dealers or how the dealers relate to their customers.


64.     In the past several years, sales of rice seed have ranged from around
40Mt in 2001 to over 2,000Mt in 2009 in the targeted area. The main AQIP
customers include rice farmers/dealers, NGOs/Institutions, and rice millers. The sales
goal for 2010 is around 4,500Mt, which was one third sales of the objective
equivalent to one third of the high quality seed market (AQIP, 2007). AQIP could
achieve this goal if it is awarded contracts acquired by FAO and the ADB that could
add 2,400Mt of sales to the 2,000Mt sales in 2009.




65.     AQIP uses varieties produced and distributed by CARDI. The varieties
available have some good characteristics, but are often older varieties, and are
available to all farmers from CARDI, meaning that this product line does not give
AQIP a competitive advantage. AQIP would like to see the development of new
varieties with advanced yield and resistance traits; although, at this time, CARDI is at
best just upgrading old varieties via backcrossing. It is AQIP’s goal to have its own
variety development program so that it can offer seeds with traits needed by its
customers. Before a development program can be established, AQIP will need an
increase of seed sales and will also need to acquire some financial backing—both of
which are not forthcoming at this point. AQIP’s longer-term goal for 2014 is
4,000Mt of seed sales. There are no immediate plans to acquire any rice varieties
from sources beyond CARDI, and there are no thoughts of expanding seed production
and sales beyond rice.


66.   In terms of coordination and contract arrangements for the long term,
AQIP faces some real challenges to reach the goal of twice its current seed sales
(4,000Mt per year). In order to achieve this goal—while facing constraints and


                                          18
challenges such as shortage of working capital, old machines, competition with
Vietnamese market and others—AQIP has indicated some approaches to deal with
these problems. For example, AQIP wishes increase arrangements with larger scale
(land) farmers to ease quality control management, to reduce time, and to increase
seed uniformity. This would be a direct result of dealing a reduced number of farmer
seed growers. At the same time, they will change their pricing strategy with farmers
from a fixed price at the onset of contract to a more variable price pegged to the
market price at harvesting time (always with 200-300 KHR/kg higher than market).
This situation may not be favorable for the farmers, particularly the smallholder
farmers. However, it should be recognized that as a private company, AQIP also
needs to strive for efficiency and profit. AQIP also needs to upscale the seed
processing facilities and storage capacity, and ensure quality standards.

67.     The Seed Growers Association of Cambodia (SGAC) was formed in
conjunction with the AQIP project; when AQIP became a seed company, SGAC
was named a co-owner. Currently, SGAC plays a limited role in the oversight of
AQIP. Four board members oversee the association; one is on the AQIP board of
directors. SGAC membership is static with original founding seed growers still listed
as members even though they may not be producing seed. Also, newer AQIP seed
growers are not being solicited into membership. It is believed that there are no
currently functioning programs within the association that would benefit members.


68.     AQIP seems to have adequate tools to function as a rice seed company
although their processing facilities are aging and losing efficiency. Their largest
problem is that they are selling open pollinated varieties of rice that are also available
to farmers from CARDI and other sources. Essentially, they are selling based on the
fact that they have a bagged, ready-made product of purportedly good quality seed.
Their segment of the market seems to be mostly farmers with 1 hectare or larger of
rice production (larger farmers). They also sell to smaller farmers; however, this is
usually in smaller amounts and to those farmers who will use that seed to maintain
that variety over a period of several years without purchasing additional seed.

69.     For AQIP to survive, it must expand its product line to those varieties
currently not available to the public. Its desire to have its own variety development
program is unfeasible in the near future, but it might be possible to acquire exclusive
rights to its own variety. Still, they would be selling a product that farmers would
most likely use to grow their own seed for several generations. A better way to
function would be to sell a more full line of seed products, vegetable, and hybrid
maize seed. For instance, they could become a dealer for other seed companies.

70.      AQIP serves a significant purpose for the seed industry in Cambodia.
First, it supplies good quality seed to its segment of the market. Second, it supplies
local community farmers groups with parent seed when they don’t have a connection
directly to CARDI. Third, and maybe most important; it is essential for a nation’s
seed industry to develop smaller, private sector seed companies. AQIP is the only
example of a private sector seed company at this time; it can serve as an example to
the seed industry. If AQIP is allowed to fail, it will undoubtedly send a message that
small seed companies are not viable in Cambodia. It could be a long time before



                                           19
another would start. This information was conveyed to AusAID; they did see that
importance. It is hoped that they will continue some support to AQIP.

The Tuol Samrong Seed Farm


71.     This is a 200+ha farm in Battambang Province devoted to rice seed
production. About 50ha of land is devoted to seed production with and average total
production of about 70Mt. seed per year. The rest of the farm produces rice for
milling or other crops. Foundation seed of selected varieties is acquired yearly from
CARDI based on demand from local farmers. This seed is planted for Registered
Seed production and then the next season, Commercial Seed is produced.
Commercial seed orders of over 1 Mt must be made a year in advance, but smaller
orders are handled on a spot basis.


72.     The farm uses normal field seed production techniques in order to
produce the best and purest quality seed. Foundation seed is transplanted to make
the best use of expensive seed. Seed is hand harvested, laid out to dry, and is
normally hand cleaned. Seed is bagged and stored, and simple germination tests are
performed monthly through the sales season. Germination levels tend to rise for
about the first five months after harvest (normally due to a breaking of seed
dormancy), and then it begins decreasing. The minimum germination level for seed
to be sold is 80 percent and no seed is stored longer than one year.


73.     Farmers come to the farm to purchase seed, usually in amounts to plant
up to 3 ha. The goal in seed sales is to provide seed for local farmers; therefore it is
sold at just 1.2 times the price of the rice market. The RS is sold at KHR 2,500/kg and
the GS at KHR 1,600/kg. The service can be, for at least one individual who serves as
a dealer, buying seed from them and selling it to farmers in his area. Some sales have
been made to NGO’s, but local farmers are serviced first and any orders over a ton
must be made before the previous planting season to assure that ample seed is
available to regular customers. In recent years, they have had some orders of up to
10Mt sold to NGO’s for distribution based on in-kind payment with grain at harvest.
Because of reduced price and quality, more farmers buy seed yearly. The sale record
indicates that the farm has a 10 percent increase of seed customers per year. The rice
millers in the area were impressed with the seed farm’s effort, as well as with the
superior quality rice sold by the farmers to them.




          Tuol Samrong Seed Farm                   -   Farmers
                                                   -   NGOs-trained Farmers




74.    The Toul Samrong Rice Seed Farm was part of a previous World Bank
project that supplied tractors, a seed grader, a length grader, a seed treater, and


                                          20
a dryer. Much of this equipment is going unused because it does not meet the farm’s
needs or there are not adequate funds for operation. Therefore, most of the seed
related activities are performed manually using more traditional methods.
(Management of these seed farms were not involved in the selection of equipment and
it is obvious that individual needs of the various farms were not considered. Any
potential help for the seed farms will be based on their own needs as seen by an
external consultant and the perceived ability of the management and staff to use what
is supplied). Improving equipment and facilities will enable the seed farm to
efficiently upscale quality seed production; therefore, more quality seed of a cheaper
price will be available for the farmers who use larger amounts of seed for direct
seeding method.


75.     Presently, the farm does very little to promote seed use; it mainly focuses
on production. CARDI plants some farmer test plots in the area to assess new
varieties, but the farm has not been involved with these plots. Favorable new
varieties are recommended by CARDI to be grown and farmers purchase those
varieties because they saw them in CARDI’s tests or in the seed farm’s fields. Since
farmers tend to come to the seed farm to buy seed, it would be an excellent place to
perform variety testing, field trials, and demonstration plots. It would seem that the
opportunities for seed sales in this area are greater than at current levels. Production
is mired in the same methods that have worked for years. Farm management may not
have the tools or understanding of how to expand its seed sales or of how to increase
its service and extension activities to farmers; however, there is an interest at the farm
to learn this and to do a better job. The Toul Samrong Rice Seed Farm along with
other MAFF seed units are operated directly with most decision authority and
financial aspects handled by MAFF. The logistics are complicated and time
consuming. Facility budgets have little to do with farm income; therefore, incentive
for staff to produce more efficiently, to perform extension activities that would benefit
seed buyers, or to increase seed production and sales volume is low. A management
system that would be more autonomous would allow more incentive and flexibility to
provide quality seed and extension services to farmer customers.


Farmers Cooperators of the CARDI-OFAT


76.    On-farm trials (OFAT) are conducted through collaboration between
CARDI, PDA, and farmers. The activity consists of growing 1kg each of three
improved varieties released by CARDI on a 100m² rice plot in contrast with another
plot grown to the farmer’s variety for comparison. CARDI provides all technical
support for rice production and lets the farmers manage the trial by combining new
ideas with local knowledge. Regular visits were made from the onset of the trials until
harvesting time when a ‘field day’ is established to demonstrate the results of
improved varieties to the neighboring farmers.


77. When the specified amount of seed is produced, the farmers continue
producing and keeping that seed for their own use. They also share the seed with
other farmers in their communities or others who have an interest in the newly
released seeds. The farmers normally practice this seed production sharing system


                                           21
when they obtain a good, new variety. It is a suitable management system within the
capacity of small to medium scale farmers of the village, commune, and district
levels.


                    OFAT              Farmers



78.     The extent to which this chain of quality seed supply can reach depends
on the following factors: i) the adaptation and performance of this new variety to the
farm condition; the number of farmer cooperators CARDI can support in the area; the
extension skill; and particularly, the rice trade dynamic in such an area. The
successful case of OFAT at Sre Ampil rice growing area in Kien Svay District,
Kandal Province is a good example. A favorable environment for rice business
development is created by the key players, the key farmer (or growers’ leader), the
farmers themselves, the rice traders, and the CARDI staff. Generally, at harvesting
time, most farmers in this area do not need to transport paddy rice to store at home;
the traders purchase the rice from them and take it straight from the farm. OFAT
farmer cooperators were ordered to keep rice seeds by other farmers at a very early
time before the growing season. Afterwards, farmers from other districts of the same
province and from Svay Rieng and Prey Veng Provinces booked orders as well.
Today, many key farmers in this area are being contracted by AQIP to grow quality
seed, including RS and CS for the company.


79.      This type of rice and seed production supply system through OFAT can
be promoted in all parts of rural Cambodia as one way of building awareness
about newly improved varieties and to promote them to wider communities. As
has been discussed earlier, at present, this activity is less active and reduced to a
restricted number because of a limited budget. The project’s support of this program
could generate two useful outcomes: First, it will improve community-based seed
service and productivity increase. Second, it can create a sustainable rice research and
extension program, which will be on-going and spread through the rural community.


Rice export companies


80.     Akphiwad Bandanh Kasekor (ABK) is in the early stages of setting up a
system of high value rice growers that plant the famous CARDI Phka Roumduol
variety for market and exportation. The farmers are formed into associations and
are contracted under ABK. All services—ranging from seed and other farm inputs
(credit in kinds), farming techniques (CARDI) and capacity building—are provided.
ABK purchases Foundation seed from CARDI and produces quality seed for their
own premium rice production. Damnok Teuk Rice Export Company is doing
something similar for rice exportation.




                                          22
NGOs/Projects


81.     Some NGOs are promoting food security and/or agricultural enterprises.
They form the farmers into Farmer Associations and assist them in seed and rice
production of quality seed from CARDI (RS). Through these Farmer Associations,
sub-contracted extension workers supervise and inspect their rice crop as well as
provide training to the farmer members. Field days are organized by the project to
promote seed business to the surrounding farmers. According to some farmers,
producing seed for sale would be profitable, but they do not have enough good land
for this purpose. Generally, this seed production system is small in scale, for organic
or non-organic rice. Under this seed production program, the farmers could sell their
seed to the farmers within their village or nearby villages; at the same time, they
produce high quality rice for subsistence and for market.




3.1.2. The Community Based Rice Seed Production Supply System

82.      A major portion of rice seed production in Cambodia is done on a more
informal basis with various types of local farmer groups providing improved
seed to the local community. There are a large number of these production groups
which have received some training through CARDI and NGO’s. Some examples are
CEDAC, local agricultural departments, extension groups, or from other sources. The
training stressed selection and maintenance of high quality seed during field
production, seed storage, and other seed production activities. Since there are many of
these groups using various structures, a general description highlighting the variations
illustrated below (CARDI has played a lead in helping to develop these local groups).


             Figure 3: Less formal rice seed production supply system




                                          23
Community Based Seed Production of Popular Local Varieties

83.     This is done with the objective of assisting those farmers who want to
maintain their local varieties and those who could not afford to purchase quality
seed. With the popularity of local varieties, CARDI has started a training of
community-based organizations to maintain, grow, and purify local varieties. They
begin with initial training of a small number of progressive farmers in seed
purification and production. These farmers grow a small plot of their local variety,
and with their training, they select individual panicles that best display the qualities of
the local variety. All other plants in this small seed purification plot are removed. At
harvest, the selected plants are threshed, dried, and maintained. In the subsequent
season, they are planted in a seed production block. Again, all off-type plants are
removed from the seed field during the growing season. At harvest time, there should
be enough seed produced for planting a field with a surplus for distribution of smaller
amounts to other member farmers. During the first two growing years, the other
trained farmers monitor the field to provide assurance that the seed produced will be
true-to-type to the original variety. In addition, the locally trained farmers allow all
the village farmers to see the seed field and provide some training to those farmers in
how to maintain their own seed production plot.


84.     In this system, one or two local farmers serve as purifiers of the variety,
growing what would be considered breeder seed. A small group of farmers use
that seed and their training to produce foundation seed and distribute that to the bulk
of the farmers in the group who grow and maintain their own commercial seed and
then grow rice for milling. Almost universally, farmers who sold or distributed seed
to others would test the seed for germination levels before planting. All have been
trained either by CARDI, often through the local PDA’s, or by those trained farmers
themselves. Other trained farmers in the group always monitor parent seed growth.


Community Based Seed Production of CARDI Released varieties


85.     In a program similar to the one described above, CARDI would train
individual farmers to grow seed of its released varieties. They would supply 1Kg
of Foundation seed (USD$3.5/Kg) to a trained farmer who would grow and carefully
maintain the variety over the growing season. The sponsoring group trained these
farmers in the techniques of intensive seed production, namely field roguing, panicle
selection, isolation to prevent out-crossing, clean harvest techniques, seed cleaning,
and storage. Near harvest, the farmer in conjunction with the local PDA and/or
CARDI would hold a field day for community farmers. Here farmers would learn
about the qualities and benefits of this new variety.


86.    In the next production season, the farmer would use this seed to produce
a larger amount of seed for distribution to community farmers. In some cases, a
few other farmers would take a small amount of the first generation produced seed
and grow a production block as well. As described in the first production system,
trained farmers would have monitored all seed produced in the field and each


                                            24
community farmer would get some training to produce their own seed plot. In
subsequent production years, the initial farmers could continue producing starting
with the 1Kg of seed, or they could skip that generation and buy enough FS from
CARDI to produce a field worth of seed. Most often starting with the 1Kg of seed was
preferable because the purchase of seed in larger amounts was prohibitive at $3.50/kg.


87.     These two seed production systems instituted by CARDI and employed at
the community level may not have been true seed certification programs, but they
seemed to be excellent programs to produce and distribute seed throughout the local
area. The initial, progressive seed growing farmers were well trained and proud of
the quality of the seed product they grew. Additional local farmers were trained to
inspect the seed field as a means of quality control. Additionally, local farmers who
were potential seed buyers looked at the field during the crop growth stages and
decided at that time if the seed crop being grown was worthy of being planted in their
own production fields. Those farmers who purchased commercial seed had some
training in producing their own seed and could maintain their seed over some
generations without much cost.


88.     A real advantage of this system over larger and more formal programs is
that seed is produced in very small areas, from a few square meters for higher
classes of seed to a field of a hectare or less for commercial production. This means
that planting, field maintenance, harvest, and seed cleaning would be performed
manually. At this level, seed can be scrutinized very closely and impurities down to
the plant or individual kernel level can be removed resulting in a very pure, consistent
seed product. These initial seed growers would often supply seed to the others in the
local association at a minimal cost—maybe as an even trade for grain or for a minimal
fee of 1.2 to 1.5 times the cost of rice grain.


89.     Local farmers in the association would also have the opportunity to see
the seed production field, either informally by seeing it with the farmer/grower,
or more formally during a field day. Almost universally, farmers said that they
purchased seed and acquired new varieties because of seeing it grow in other farmers’
fields or in demonstration plots. It is important to mention here that there was not one
farmer or seed grower that was interviewed during this consultancy that did not
realize the value of using good quality seed and how that seed would have a positive
effect on crop performance. Some farmers may have had a lower understanding of
what seed quality was and others may have had other reasons not to use improved
seed, but all recognized its value.

Other Community Bases Seed Production System

90.     In addition to the above community-based production groups trained by
CARDI, there are other community-based production supply systems for the local
interest. Angkor Kasekam Roongroeung is a large scale private enterprise and is an
exception. Most used seed purification or production systems with techniques similar
to those instituted by CARDI. Below is brief description of those techniques
encountered.



                                          25
•   CEDAC promotes community seed production by training progressive
    farmers in Organic Rice Farmer Associations (from 9 to around 50 farmers) to
    purify and maintain local varieties and produce parent seed for all association
    members. There are two seed producers per village. The method of
    purification is thus: with local varieties selected (Red Malis and White Malis),
    the farmer selects the 10 best quality grains, peals their husk to make sure that
    grain is in good shape and without damage and grows them in a small box at
    home to ease watering and care. After 10 days of growth, the seedlings are
    pulled and transplanted in the field with the following conditions: transplant is
    in a row, one tiller per hill, 20 cm between hills, and no chemical fertilizers or
    pesticides are applied. This is done in June when wet season rice is due.
    Within 125 days, the crop is harvested and he obtains 2 kg of high quality seed
    (pure, healthy, and high yield). In next season, he uses half the amount of seed
    for his own seed production and the other half is shared with his members. To
    produce seed, small plots with well prepared land are recommended to ease
    crop management. Each seed producer has to produce key seed every year as a
    reserve. The seed obtained from this process is used for production at a rate of
    10kg/ha. The yield obtained from this quality seed doubles to yield of normal
    seed (up to 6Mt/ha). The seed growers meet regularly to report on seeds
    produced for sale coordination. Because it is organic rice seed and aromatic,
    the price is much higher. The key seed is sold at KHR 6,000/kg while the next
    generation seed is KHR 4,000/kg. This is in comparison to the normal seed at
    only KHR 1,500/kg. This method has been practiced for four years, and there
    is still limited production for sale.

•   Champei Agricultural Development Community (CADC) is located in
    Baty District in Takeo Province: It is organized with the purpose to produce
    high quality rice for market. The CADC was founded in 2005 by a group of
    farmers (now 96 members) who joined together an amount of cash forming
    cooperative capital for an agricultural enterprise (at present mainly rice). The
    benefits the members gained include input services (such as low cost seed,
    fertilizers, machinery, etc.), capacity building, extension services, a market for
    their products (CAVAC Assistance), and a reasonable value added. The
    enterprise activities are coordinated by a Chairman who is assisted by a Board
    Committee (five members). The Chairman and some members undertook the
    famous IPM Farmer Field School Program funded by DANIDA in
    cooperation with MAFF during early 2000. They are therefore knowledgeable
    of the whole cycle of IPM-based rice production, including seed production,
    and are very open to agro-enterprise initiatives. The CADC purchases seed
    from AQIP, produces quality seed, and after keeping it for two years, renews
    the seed again. A good record was obtained in 2009 from 10 kg of RS bought
    from AQIP; they were able to produce 1Mt of quality seed for their members.
    Their rice products are well packed and sold to Lucky Super Market, and the
    quality seed is sold to the farmers within their communities and those outside
    their province (farmers from Koh Thom and S’aang Districts in Kandal
    province) at KHR 2,500/kg. The added value they receive is that all members
    share and obtain valuable information, and the cooperative keeps upgrading
    and growing. There are around five or six cooperatives like CADC operating
    in different districts of Takeo province (See Annex 3). This is a good example


                                       26
       of farmer-owned value added coordination. This structure and mechanism of
       community based agro-enterprise is recommended for agriculture
       development programs in rural Cambodia.

   •   Angkor Kasekam Roongroeung (AKRR): The purpose of seed production
       for AKRR is to produce premium price rice (Aromatic organic rice) for
       market and exportation. The rice seed “Phka Malis” is particularly important
       to the company. The arrangement of production is based on contracted-
       farming with farmers’ groups. There are 1,000 seed growers who grow enough
       quality seed to supply 37,000 farmers producing this specific aromatic rice for
       planting on 46,000 hectares of rice land. The company coordinates all services
       for the farmers’ seed growers, as well as the rice producers, inputs on credit
       (paid back during harvest), and farming techniques. The farmers are requested
       to strictly follow quality instruction techniques during the cropping period
       until harvest to ensure seed and rice purity and to meet international quality
       standards. This is done under supervision of the company agencies. At
       harvesting time, the company directly transports the seed and rice produced
       from the farm to be processed with mechanized facilities. The seed farmers
       grow and maintain their own registered seed using individual panicle
       selection. Most of the rice produced is destined for markets in Europe, China,
       and Japan. This will expand to Middle Eastern countries in the future.

3.1.3. The emergence of private seed production supply system


91.     A private seed production supply system has emerged in Cambodia over
last 3-5 years in response to the demand for a quality seed for local varieties and
imported varieties (mainly from Vietnam and Thailand). The private seed production
system can be differentiated into tree main groups: i) the formal private seed
producers; ii) the informal private seed producers; and iii) the informal seed producer
groups.


Formal private seed producers


92.     This group of private seed producers emerged from the need to have good
quality seeds for rice exports. The producers generally have good agricultural
training, significant work experience, and are knowledgeable in business
management. Their seed production practices are operated through contract farming
arrangements with the farmer producers who cultivate some 0.5 to 5ha of land. Seed
production steps follow the same formal technical procedures as practiced by AQIP.
Coordination for value added rice production is applied, including cropping, inputs,
credit, training and extension, market, transport services, and seed processing. The
companies have registered with the Ministry of Commerce for a 10 year period. Their
supply capacity is still small (100-200 MT/year), but it is expected to expand rapidly.




                                          27
93.     The number of producers in this group is still small, and they are
currently operating mainly in Takeo and Kampong Thom Provinces. This group
emerged from private rice producers who produce large quantities of rice paddy for
local market and/or exportation. It consists of individual producers, who own large
cultivated land, and produce up to 100 Mt of seed. They operate seed production on
their land using spot labor. Seed production practices follow either the same technical
steps as AQIP, or traditional practices (namely, selection of vigorous panicles with
uniform grains). Almost all production activities from land preparation to threshing
are mechanized, but seed processing is done manually. Access to services, irrigation,
labor, and knowledge in production and marketing exist for such farms. Access to
finance is the main constraint for this group, particularly for upgrading their
businesses and transforming the groups into more formal seed companies. The
produced seed is sold at more competitive prices than offered by AQIP attributable to
lower production and overhead costs. These groups of seed producers believe that
they can successfully compete with AQIP, especially after they have upgraded their
processing equipment to achieve similar quality standards.


The informal seed producer groups


94.      This group of seed producers can be found in Kandal, Kampong Cham,
Kampong Thom, and Battambang Provinces. These are farmers who have had
former work experience in seed production supply with either PRSAC or with AQIP
through contract farming arrangements. Farmers normally cultivate 0.5-2 ha of land
and seed production using an approach that follows technical procedures that are
similar to AQIP. The sole difference is that the seed processing activities are done
manually. These groups tend to start with small working capital to produce less than
100 Mt of seed in the first year, and they then expand up to around 300 Mt at present.
A few technical staff are employed to assist farmers in seed production, quality work
monitoring, and collecting harvested products. The final products are sold with a price
equal or lower than that of AQIP’s price. Most of these producers plan to expand
cultivated land and invest in seed processing equipment and seed storage; this is
expected to increase the quality of seed. Their main constraint is a lack of working
capital.


Options and constraints of private seed production
supply systems


95.     Seed production has proven to be profitable
business in Cambodia. The emergence of these private
seed producers indicates that there is sufficient interest
from both the private sector and the farmers. The case of
Cambo Seeds is an example of a success story of a
formal private seed producer. The future of the private
sector in seed production supply depends on their ability
to maintain profitability of their businesses while facing
increased competition. Since the demand for seeds is


                                          28
driven by profitability of general rice production systems—either for local markets or
for export—the private seed producers need to respond to wider range of demands.
These demands include local premium rice, which tends to be wet season varieties, as
well as for low quality rice, which tends to be short duration and non-photoperiod
sensitive dry season (e.g IRRI) varieties. AQIP will remain one of the largest
producers of seed for some time to come. Moreover, AQIP is confident of its
competitive position in this increasingly crowding business.


96.     The main constraint for private seed producers is a lack of access to
finance. Other constraints faced by private seed producers—particularly those who
are involved in contract farming arrangements—include the following:
   •   Uncertainties associated with seed markets;
   •   Difficulties in preparing good business plans;
   •   Lack of equipment for seed processing, which affects the quality of seed;
   •   Side selling by some contract farmers;
   •   Uncertainties of seed prices for next farming seasons; and
   •   The lack information about seed quality standards attributable to the lack of
       knowledge and information for identifying different seed varieties and
       maintaining its purity; and
   •   Lack of awareness among smallholders of the importance and benefits of good
       quality seeds, which restricts their demand.



3.2. Seed processing
3.2.1. Seed conditioning


98.     Seed conditioning is a general term used to include all the processes
applied to seed that makes it ready for planting. Seed conditioning for rice often
begins with seed drying, which can be accomplished with automated dryer units.
More often it is done by spreading it out for air-drying. Primary seed conditioning for
rice often uses a machine referred to as an ‘air/screen cleaner’ or a ‘grader’ that uses a
blast of high speed air to blow out light material, and a series of reciprocating,
perforated screens that remove impurities both larger and smaller than the seed. A
machine with rotating cylinders is used to remove particles both longer and shorter
than the desired seed. Additionally, chemical seed treaters, bag fillers, and scales can
be a part of the seed conditioning system.


99.     In Cambodia, the only seed conditioning equipment used on a regular
basis is located either at CARDI or at AQIP Seed’s three locations. Several of the
MAFF Seed farms also had seed conditioning equipment, but the ones that were seen
were barely used. The vast majority of rice seed produced in Cambodia is conditioned
manually: It is done by using a woven screening basket that drops out small particles
from the seed mass, and then a winnowing process whereby wind blows fine particles


                                           29
as the seed is poured from one basket to another. Chemical seed treatment was not
observed—except for some use with vegetable seeds.


3.2.2. Seed storage


100. Most commonly, rice for seed is replanted within 5-7 months after it has
been harvested. Seed can be appropriately stored for this period as long as harvest,
seed drying, and cleaning procedures are used. The high temperature and humidity in
Cambodia can reduce seed storage times; studies by CARDI have shown that seed
storage times beyond 6 months will usually reduce viability below the 85 percent
standard for saleable seed. It is therefore a common practice to dispose of seed for
milling after the subsequent planting season. Although this may seem to be a
workable system, it does not allow for the maintenance of a seed reserve—resulting in
some surplus higher value seed that has to be sold at a lower market grain price.


101. Farmer seed is stored in bags usually made of woven polypropylene and
covered with a tarp or plastic sheet in a building under a roof—protected from
rain. Some farmers indicated that jute bags for storage would allow for better air
movement thereby helping to maintain seed viability levels longer, but these bags are
more expensive. Although it would seem that insects and rats would cause damage to
seed stored this way, most farmer seed growers didn’t see these as major problems.


102. Farm seed storage seems rather primitive; although, seed usually does
remain viable until the next planting season. All farmers who were interviewed
said that they performed a basic seed germination test before seed was sold or planted.
Better storage methods would allow for more options in seed use—but in reality—any
better storage methods would have to maintain that seed for another 12 months (the
next planting season). However, at present, it seems unlikely that such advances can
be made while continuing to store seed at the farm level in this country.


3.3. Cost of seed production

103. Production of quality seed follows technical practices of seed purification
to ensure quality. Planting rice for seed follows the same steps as normal rice
production: it requires quality work from field operation to seed processing and
storage; the use of quality resources (including rice land, soil type, seeds/breeding
materials, fertilizers, etc.), and high attention in purification techniques and control.
Practically, quality seed production should be based on technical knowledge and
modern facilities and according to seed regulations and scientific rules. CARDI is the
only source of breeding materials, and has provided research, selection, production,
and education in seed service. After going through variety the development process
(Figure 1), successive class of Foundation seed, Register seed, and Graded seed for
the supply system are produced. The discussion of seed production here focuses on
the formal system only. It is important to note the following two points. First, the cost


                                           30
of FS was provided by CARDI detailing all activities, labors, and inputs incurred
from the field to the end product in storage. In contrast, the costs of RS and GS were
computed based on information provided by the respondents. Second, the costs
computed in this study only cover field production or raw products.


3.3.1. Cost of Foundation seed production


104. Based on the scientific rules, the breeder must produce the FS by using
BS; it needs to be planted in rows with a rate of 1 tiller/hill. All plants that present
identical characteristics of the BS plants are harvested for the next class of seed
production.


105. Although mechanized field work such as land preparation, harvesting,
and threshing can be used, FS production still requires a lot of hand labor. This
is attributable to the need to implement purification activities, which include
transplanting 1 tiller/hill and in a row, rouging, weeding, bird watching, and cleaning.
It costs CARDI a total of USD$ 7,352.9 to produce a hectare of FS. Hand labor cost is
the highest component cost at $3,402 covering nearly one half (46 percent) of the total
cost per ha; two-thirds of which ($2,250) covers the breeder cost. CARDI suggested
that this breeder cost must be accounted for because of the need to address staff
movement. The transplanting, harvesting, and threshing work ($541.9/ha or 47
percent) accounts for about half of the other labor cost ($1,152). If transplanting is
mechanized with the assumption of a 50 percent cost reduction per ha ($180); and
harvesting and threshing can be done using a combined costs of $90/ha; it is possible
to reduce the cost by $270 per hectare of FS produced. This equates to $0.12 per each
kg of FS produced. Although this reduction may not be as significant as expected and
175 casual laborers would lose jobs, the importance of mechanization’s efficiency and
effectiveness in service returns—including time saving, fast field operation, and
quality assurance—outweigh its negatives.


106. Since CARDI makes no benefit from its FS production, it is useful to
analyze the profit contributed by funding the FS. There are significant
contributions that can be appreciated from funding. If one kilogram of FS can produce
6Mt of CS in the second step of seed production, the seed growers could make a
minimum of $560 in profit per growing season. (Assuming CS is sold at $0.25/kg.)
Thus, each kg of FS funded to CARDI will allow the seed grower to generate around
$100/month from seed production. From this analysis, it was observed that small
holder producers can increase profits by intensifying their production per unit area.


3.3.2. Cost of Registered seed production


107. RS must be produced by using FS and planted in row with the rate of 1
tiller per hill. The seed rate used is 20kg/ha. Overall, this stage of seed production is
similar to FS production; the difference being that it covers a larger scale area. The FS
is required to be renewed every 2-3 years for ensuring purity and high quality seed.


                                            31
108. AQIP, Tuol Samrong Seed Farm, NGOs, and rice exporters use FS from
CARDI to produce RS first before producing the CS. By so doing, the investment
in seed inputs is cheaper while the cost of GS or CS production is even cheaper. To
produce one hectare of RS (during 2009-2010 crop season), the required investment
was from about $600 to $700/ha for field production including inputs, mechanized
field operation, and hand labor. The cost of inputs tends to be higher than the cost of
mechanized works and hand labor (Table 1). For all AQIP contracted farmers,
inputs—in terms of seed—is paid for via in kind credit. Chemicals are paid for via
cash credit. Mechanizing the harvesting, threshing, and bagging work can reduce the
cost of hand labor. Although the difference is not very significant ( $10 difference),
mechanized work increases operational efficiency and ensures quality. The cost of
seed conditioning and storage covered by AQIP was around $50/Mt. If compared with
the cost of RS production for IR66 and Phka Roumduol varieties (Table 1 below), it
was observed that seed production cost is about a $100 difference attributable to a
higher quality fertilizer used in the IR66 rice crop. The yield of IR66 is generally
higher (5Mt/ha) than the Phka Roumduol Variety (2Mt/ha). Profit from IR66 by the
contracted farmers is worth approximately $800/ha; the Tuol Samrong Seed Farm
with the Phka Roumduol variety is worth approximately $700/ha.


3.3.3. Cost of Commercial seed production

109. Commercial seed or GS is produced from the RS, and a pure high quality
source is always encouraged. Overall, this seed production follows the same practice
as normal rice production by planting more than 1 tiller/hill (2-3 tillers/hill).
However, it still requires following principles of other pure seed production including
rouging, seed storage, and so forth. This class of seed production is only practiced in
Cambodia because of the need to reduce production costs to attract farmers to use
quality seed.

110. To produce a hectare of CS, it costs the farmer seed producer to invest
approximately $450 to $600 per ha—excluding labor. Overall, there is not a
significant difference in cost for RS and CS production for field production in the
same location. This is illustrated in the comparison of RS and CS production of the
Phka Roumduol variety at Tuol Samrong Seed Farm with the RS and CS production
of IR66 at the Sre Ampil Farming Area (See Table 1 below). However, when
compared to the “large scale” farming (40 ha cultivated land) in Baray and Takeo
Provinces with the smaller scale farmers in Sre Ampil farming area, the CS
production of the larger scale farming cost is around $100-150/ha cheaper. This is
because of the larger scale farmer’s access to inputs, their access to their own
fertilizer, and their access to their own machinery. Their costs are also lower because
they have fewer permanent laborers.

111. The direct seeding method is one way to reduce the cost of CS production
because it reduces hand labor costs in transplanting. In addition, high yield variety
also reduces the cost of seed per kilogram. For these reasons, the cost of a kilogram of
CS produced at a lower yield was nearly $0.30; the cost of a kilogram of higher yield
was $0.07. Compared with the farmers’ community in Thailand, the seed production


                                            32
cost is similar (Thitima et.al, 2007). The famrer’s sales price at the farm gate to AQIP
is KHR 1,300/kg for local medium duration variety and KHR 1,200/kg for short
duration variety. CS produced by CARDI is sold at $0.60/kg; CS from AQIP is
$0.60/kg for short duration variety and $0.65/kg for medium duration variety and
$0.70/kg for medium aromatic variety. Compared to the cost of the Vietnamese seed
that is currently entering the market at $1/kg, the Cambodian CS sale price is not
expensive—with the IR66 being even cheaper. Contracted farmers can make profits
from around $800 to $1,400/ha from CS production. These contracted farmers make
more profit with CS production than RS production; although, the Tuol Samrong
Seed Farm makes more profit from the RS production than the CS production (See
Table 1).

3.4. Reasons for low demand for improved seed by small holder
producers

112. The majority of the rice agro-ecosystem in Cambodia is rainfed, low land
rice (RLR). Although it is only one rice agro-ecosystem, based on the landscape,
topography, soil and land conditions, and rain distribution, diverse rice seeds are
being used by the farmers in different regions and locations of the country. This is the
issue of seed in Cambodia. The farmers (small holder producers) know well which
varieties best suit their rice field conditions and meet their family and community
objectives. They like new ideas, particularly ideas related to quality seed, because all
acknowledge that seed is a very important factor for production increase. To select
varieties for growing, the farmers consider three main criteria: i) suitability of seed to
their field conditions, ii) high yield and volume expansion when cooked, and iii) taste
and nutritional preference. Unfortunately, CARDI concentrates on high quality rice
for market when developing varieties and producing quality seeds. Therefore, not all
of the newly released varieties are suitable to the different rice agro-ecological
conditions in the country.




                                             33
113. The reasons for the low demand of quality seed can be explained in two
farming purposes: the first is family subsistence; the second is a market purpose.

   •   For the small holder producers who mainly produce for subsistence purpose,
       the reasons for low demand of quality seed are that some CARDI seeds cannot
       meet criteria 2 and 3. The reason for this is that with small the rice farm they
       have, criteria 2 is important for having enough rice to feed large families;
       criteria 3 is important for nutrition because they cannot afford other protein
       sources. Also, the good taste of rice fulfills their meals. To meet the farmers’
       seed preference, CARDI provides training on seed purification to farmers.
   •   For those small holder farmers who have more rice plots and can produce for
       market, the reason for low demand is an unwillingness to take risks. , In such
       cases, it is possible that they are not aware of quality seed. If they are aware,
       the problems may stem from a lack of trust in the new seed. Alternatively, the
       problem could also stem from the cost of the quality seed. Some farmers fear
       such an investment when they are not sure about market security for their rice.
       For these reasons, it is not a surprise that many agricultural projects and
       farming contracts provide seed input to the farmers in the form of credit.
       However, interviewed farmers said that they would invest in quality seed if
       they were completely sure that they would make higher profits.

4. Expansion Scenario of Future Seed
Production Supply
4.1.   Analysis of demand projections for certified/good seed


114. The demand for improved rice seed in Cambodia is not known. The
demand for improved rice seed is determined by following factors: (i) farmers’
capacity to adopt proper agronomic practices; and (ii) farmers’ capacity to access
markets and finance. The demand is also affected by specific agro-ecological
conditions, which determine the type of varieties grown and soil types. These factors
could have a significant role in farmers’ demand for improved varieties over using
traditional varieties, which have lower yields, but may be better adapted to local
conditions. In order for farmers to adopt improved seed, it is required that improved
cultivars outperform local varieties under local agro-ecological and climatic
conditions or in conditions that allow farmers to overcome agro-ecological and
climatic constraints, such as irrigation. It is thus assumed that the demand for
improved rice seed is higher in areas of favorable agro-ecological conditions and in
areas with higher agriculture potential in general. For example, based on the MAFF’s
statistics on rice production in 2009 and MOWRAM’s statistics on irrigated areas in
2009 approximately only 0.6 million ha is under irrigation of the current 2.6 million
ha cultivated ha of rice crop (Table 2). With the assumption that improved seed will
be cultivated only in an area with access to irrigation, a total amount of approximately
30,000 Mt of seed would be needed when using a seeding rate of 50 kg/ha.


115. From a socio-economic viewpoint, the adoption of improved seed will
depend on farmers’ endowment of human capital and productive assets, such as
land. On the human capital side, improved seeds respond better to good farming
practices and input use. Thus farmers with higher levels of human capital are more
likely to demand improved seeds. Access to land is also important. The average rural
family needs about 1 ha of rice field to sustain itself. It is thus assumed that rural
households with more than 1 ha of rice field are likely to demand more improved
seeds than those with smaller land holdings. It is further assumed that some 18,000
Mt of improved seeds are needed for an area of 357,883 ha with a seeding rate of 50
kg/ha.

116. These two scenarios for calculation of seed demand have resulted rather
different outcomes. However, they demonstrate that the demand for improved rice
seed in Cambodia could be in the range of 17,894 – 29,512 Mt. As shown in Table 2,
based on prevailing agro-ecological conditions, it is anticipated that the demand for
improved rice seeds are likely to come from the 590,247 ha of rice cultivated areas
that are irrigated. Similarly, as shown in Table 3, only about 357,883 ha of rice field
are likely to demand improved seeds based on the assumptions of access to land.

117. The five year scenario for improved seed demand can be estimated in the
context of the government’s rice export policy, which calls for exports of 1
million Mt of white rice by 2015. Estimation of the five year scenario for seed
demand therefore starts with the amount of paddy rice to be produced over this period
(See box below).


     Box 1: Estimation of five-year scenario for seed demand in Cambodia

    Parameters                                         Implications

 One million Mt of white      An equivalent to 1,548,462 Mt of paddy rice exported (with
 rice                         the assumption that 100 kg of paddy can yield 65 kg of white
                              rice)
 To produce 1,548,462 Mt      Requires 769,231 ha of rice fields (with the assumption that
 of paddy rice                the average yield is 2 Mt/ha)
 To have 769,231 ha of rice   Requires 38,462 Mt of seeds
 fields planted
 Is this plan achievable?     Yes, but under two conditions: (i) the capacity to produce
                              improved seeds by 2015 has well exceeded 38,500 Mt
                              annually, and (ii) at least about 770,000 ha will be brought
                              under full irrigation by 2015. To have these required
                              conditions under control, a concerted effort between MAFF
                              and MOWRAM is needed. So far, the MOWRAM strategy is
                              to increase 20,000 ha of irrigated rice area per year
                              (MOWRAM, 2010). If MOWRAM could double this effort to
                              40,000 ha per year, the plan could be achieved.



118. The seed demand scenario for 2020 could be estimated based on the
following conditions:


   1) There will be significant interest to grow rice for market in response to
      increased exports of milled rice.
   2) There will be a possibility for expanding more area cultivated to early wet
      season rice and/or dry season rice because access to irrigation will be
      increased significantly. If MOWRAM could expand irrigated areas at the rate
      of 40,000 ha per year, by 2020, about 1 million ha of rice cultivated area will
      have access to irrigation and could thus become the source for the demand for
      improved seed for up to 50,000 Mt per year. The three scenarios for seed
      demand are as presented in Figure 2 below.




                                            38
4.2. Analysis of expansion potential for market supply


119. CARDI, AQIP Seed Company and its contracted seed growers, the
private seed producers, and to some extent, the Tuol Samrong Seed Farm are the
key players of seed production that targets the potential seed market using CARDI
released varieties. The estimate of the expansion potential for market supply would
thus provide a potential on the gap, which needs to be addressed from supply side.


120. AQIP Seed Company, as a Cambodia’s leading supplier of high quality
seed, suggested that no more than 2,000 Mt of quality seed was used in 2005. In
2009, AQIP sold nearly 2,300 Mt of high quality seed. The company planned to sell
an amount of 4,500 Mt of high quality seed in 2010 (AQIP Corporate Plan 2007);
their future goal is to reach 4,000 Mt sales potential in 2014 (Recent Communication,
2010). Thus, the potential expansion of seed supply in the short term future (2010-
2014) for AQIP will be between 4,000 Mt to 4,500 Mt. A smaller proportion—less
than 100 Mt/year of quality seed—is sold by Tuol Samrong Seed Farm in Battambang
Province. Without promotion, there is no hope for significantly increasing demand. In
addition to AQIP and Toul Samrong Seed Farm, it is estimated that about 1,000
Mt/year of CARDI “quality seed” (short duration varieties from Vietnam produced in
Takeo and Kampong Thom Provinces are not included) could be sold by a few private
seed producers.


121. All key players of the seed production supply chain have face
considerable constraints. These are mainly capital deficits, limited irrigation,
lack of equipment and facilities, and risky rice growing conditions attributable to
uncertain rainfall, flood, and drought. These constraints are determining factors for
farmers’ adoption of new ideas and technologies in the RLR farming system (Mak,
1998). For this reason, research and extension efforts to promote high quality seed use
have not been achieved. This is despite the 2.3 Mt (enough for 28 percent of country’s
rice growing area) of the total 5 Mt of FS produced by CARDI that is spread
throughout the production supply chain and the various research programs throughout
the country. Except for some proportions of wet season RLR and dry season rice



                                          39
farming areas that have better irrigation access, the remainder of the country has
lower and un-secure opportunities for increasing productivity. Therefore,
opportunities for quality seed use need to be created in parallel with the promotion
process.

122. Expansion potential for market supply that can be materialized is
assessed by looking at possibilities for meeting this goal. For this purpose, a
scenario composed of three key elements: trends, challenges, and interventions are
presented. “Trends” is the tendency of market expansion that likely takes place within
a certain period of time based on sale records, the rice trade situation, socio-economic
and environmental factors, and interventions. While “Challenges” projects the
situations and risks to be faced during that period. “Interventions” describes the
possible actions that are going to take place through planned projects/programs, as
well as likely emerging actions that will be proposed according to given
circumstances. Within this framework, three main scenarios of supply expansions are
proposed that depart from the baseline scenario (expansion capacity from 2001-2009):
Scenario One is the short term low expansion scenario of seed production supply for
the next five years (2010-2014), Scenario Two is also a short term but medium
expansion scenario, and Scenario Three is a high expansion scenario.

4.2.1. Baseline scenario of seed production supply

123. The sale record from 2001 to 2009 collected from AQIP and Tuol
Samrong Seed Farm provides baseline information on seed production supply.
Based on the sale record, it is observed that since efforts have been made, the market
of high quality seed is being increased although there were some falls in 2007 and
2008 (290 Mt/year). This increase is subject to the fact that there are farmers who
have decided to purchase the quality seed every crop after their first experience with
it. The real cases gathered during the study are evident:

   •   Through a few years experience of high yield gained from using quality seed,
       a few interviewed farmers in Koktrop Village near AQIP Center in Kandal
       Province said that they prefer to purchase quality seed from AQIP rather than
       keeping their own seed because the quality differences are outstanding; and

   •   The farmer seed producer in Chong Samnay Village, Battambang Province
       who uses the RS from Tuol Samrong Seed Farm to produce CS said that he
       wanted to use the RS immediately for his rice production because it performed
       very well.

In addition to AQIP and Toul Samrong supplies, about 1,000 Mt of “quality seeds”
were estimated to be sold by the private seed producers. In total, the potential supply
in 2009 was 3,359 Mt (Table 4) and this can be adopted as a baseline scenario of the
potential seed supply (Figure 3).

Risks/challenges


124. Rainfall irregularity and limited access to irrigation (despite slight
improvement) remain to be important constraints for both the seed producers
and the rice farmers. A lack of working capital is the most challenging factor for the
key players of the seed production supply system, ranging from CARDI, AQIP, Tuol
Samrong Seed Farm, contracted farmers, and rice exporting companies. Rice seed
production through contracted farming requires large capital mobilization during
planting time and even higher capital mobilization at harvesting time. This constraint
needs to be resolved soon to support the expansion of the production supply that will
take place within the next five years.




                                            41
Interventions


125. Seed production supply has progressed up to present. This is attributable
to the financial support from AusAID in implementing the RGC’s policy.
Increasing the seed market was due to an increase in the rice market, both locally and
internationally. This only includes local wet or dry season rice that was sold to
Vietnam and Thailand, or exported to other countries in Asia. (This does not include
fragrant rice). Demand for purer products with uniform grains from the rice dealers
and millers induce the rice producers to use quality seed. Other interventions include
CARDI seed purification training and OFAT Programs; the IPM Farmers’ Field
School, the ECOSORN project, and other agricultural projects that have provided
capacity building and extension services and promoted rice enterprises. Moreover,
there was good coordination between AQIP and farmer seed growers, as well as
among rice exporting companies and contracted farmers.

4.2.2. Scenario One: Low expansion scenario of seed production supply


Trends


126. In the next five years (2010-2014), the demand for both medium and high
quality rice (wet season and dry season varieties) for both the international and
the local market will continue to increase. The AQIP Sale Officer opined an
increasing demand for quality seed in the next short term period. Rice exportation to
Vietnam is expected to keep growing—both formally and informally. For example,
recently a registered organization worth $8 million in the form of Cambodian Rice
Joint Ventures has been made with Vietnam Southern Foods (33 percent), VINA
Food II (37 percent), the Green Trade Company (30 percent); and CAVI Foods for
rice (for 99 years). The agreement was signed in October 2009. During this time, a
number of agriculture and food security programs such as the on-going CAVAC,
those WB/IFAD, ADB, and USAID funded programs, etc. will be implemented. With
this development event, it is assumed that the potential market for seed production
supply will rise up to at least 6,750Mt (50 percent) as shown in Figure 4.

This amount of expansion is subject to the following assumptions:
   •   AQIP can reach only 3,800Mt;
   •   Tuol Samrong Seed Farm can sell 160 Mt;
   •   The rice seed program implementation will be able to promote farmers’
       decisions to purchase quality seed up to 40 Mt;
   •   HARVEST Project can promote the use of high quality seed up to 250Mt;
   •   Private producers can sell 1,500 Mt; and
   •   The government seed production supply can contribute about 1,000 Mt.




                                         42
Risks/challenges


127. In the next five years, the RLR farming system—where the majority of
rice seed and rice grain are produced—will likely face more serious droughts
because of climate change. Predictions by scientist state that there will be a shorter
duration and a limited amount of rainfall. Seed production can be affected if there is
no supplementary irrigation. Despite interventions, access to irrigation will be
limitedly improved. This will limit the application of intensification to the seed
producers and to the seed users. Limited capital will provide low opportunities for
seed market expansion.


128. At the same time, the Cambodian seed production supply system is going
to conflict with the growing potential of mobilization of Vietnamese seeds supply.
Presently, the Vietnamese seeds are wining popularity in Takeo Province. This is
because these seeds can cover up to 50 percent of the dry season seed used in this
province while covering about 70 percent of total dry season rice area. At the same
time, they are being spread to other provinces such as Kandal, Kampong Cham,
Kampong Thom, and Prey Veng because of the characteristics of these varieties
including short duration, non-photoperiod sensitive, aromatic, and high yield. Also,
the Vietnamese rice dealers provide further services and incentives including seed
purchase on credit and markets for all rice produced at high prices—without any strict
conditions. The invasion of Vietnamese seed will create two challenging situations for
the Cambodian seed production supply system: the first will be protecting local seed
and market potential; the second will be the ability to ensure that the optimal
expansion of seed production supply will materialize. Capital is particularly important
for the main players of the seed production supply system such as AQIP and CARDI.
This issue must be resolved at this stage in order to tackle the two aforementioned
situations.


Interventions


129. The RGC’s policy on rice exportation and the MAFF’s goal to double the
production to 15 Mt through intensification by 2015, despite difficulties, could


                                          43
motivate the participation of some projects and activities. It is hoped that
WB/IFAD and AusAID funded CAVAC projects and the USAID funded HARVEST
and other rice related projects will help the key players to overcome constraints and
risks; moreover, it is hoped that this will create opportunities for meeting the market
expansion objective. It is expected that agricultural services and some small-scale
irrigation will be improved while more extension and business development services
will reach the small holder producers. It is also expected that the RGC’s Action Plan
to reach the CMDG target in 2015 will benefit the smallholder producers—
particularly access to water for irrigation.

130. In order to meet the expansion objective while ensuring local seed
security for future rice trade development; all interventions should consider
improving coordination of another step of rice enterprise: the rice market. The
rationale being that improving coordination will ensure that the rice produced will be
sold at reasonable prices. This will encourage and attract farmers to use quality seed.
While good coordination between seed growers and seed dealers has been taking
place for a quality seed production supply system, another step is needed. Thus far,
coordination between the quality seed users (rice farmers) and rice traders has not
been functioning well. For this reason, the market for rice produced is not ensured.
Successful experience from the Vietnamese rice dealers—who are mobilizing their
seeds sales in Cambodia—shows that buying all of the rice produced from the farmers
who use their seeds promotes their seed market.

4.2.3. Scenario Two: Medium expansion scenario of seed production supply

131. The seed production supply will go through the same trends, risks, and
interventions. However, if there are more successful results from interventions and
projects, good opportunities for quality seed market expansion and farmers’ use will
be created. Therefore, it will enable the expansion to reach 7,600Mt (56 percent) as
shown in Figure 5, subject to the following assumptions:

     •   AQIP can reach its objective to sell 4,000Mt as planned;
     •   Tuol Samrong Seed Farm can sell 160 Mt;
     •   The rice seed program implementation will influence farmers’ decisions to
         purchase up to 90 Mt of quality seed;
     •   HARVEST Project can promote the use of high quality seed up to 250Mt;
     •   The private seed producers will be able to sell 1,800 Mt; and
     •   The government will be able to produce 1,300 Mt.




                                          44
4.2.4. Scenario Three: High expansion scenario of seed production supply


132. Similar to the situations of low and medium scenarios of expansion, the 53
percent expansion of production supply could be materialized within the five
year period. This is condition upon all of the interventions discussed above.
Moreover, this is condition upon CARDI developing and releasing more varieties that
would attract both farmers and rice dealers according to the CARDI-GDA-IRRI-
CAVAC rice germplasm project. Lastly, some inroads must be made to curtail the
Vietnamese seed market expansion. If these aforementioned assumptions are realized,
the expansion will reach up to 8,500 Mt (60 percent) as shown in Figure 6, subject to
the following assumptions:

    •   AQIP can reach its objective to sell 4,000Mt as planned;
    •   Tuol Samrong Seed Farm can sell up to 240 kg;
    •   The rice seed program implementation will influence farmers’ decisions to
        purchase up to 260 Mt of quality seed, thereby making inroads into the
        Vietnamese seed sales in the targeted areas;
    •   HARVEST will be very successful in improving opportunities for the market
        and the use of high quality seed, thereby enabling expansion up to 500Mt;
    •   The private seed producers will be able to double their efforts to 2,000 Mt;
    •   The government will be committed to produce 1,500 Mt .




                                         45
133. When compared to the expansion of potential of seed production, the gap
between supply and demand could approach 30,000-32,000 Mt in 2015. The gap
could be between 6,750 Mt to 8,500 Mt in 2014, with estimated demand in 2015 of
some 38,500 Mt. This gap could be reduced with the entry of more private producers
in seed production supply.


4.3. Rice seed program
4.3.1. Investment activities for improving community seed access


134. As discussed earlier, not all CARDI released varieties or all quality seeds
are well suited to all field conditions, nor are they preferable to the farmers. On
the other hand, not all farmers buy seed for every crop. For these reasons, farmers’
access to quality seed is still low. According to CARDI, presently about40 percent of
the rice growing area in Cambodia is cultivated with quality seed.


135. In order to enable long-term farmers’ seed accessibility, the following
investment activities are suggested:

       i)      Optimal expansion and diversification of Foundation seeds production
               supply;
       ii)     Building awareness and distributing quality seed to those farmers who
               cannot afford to buy while ensuring awareness about availability and
               use through OFAT;
       iii)    Provide training and capacity building to those farmers who cannot
               afford to buy or who want to maintain their suitable varieties; and
       iv)     Community based seed production extension program




                                          46
Optimal expansion and diversification of Foundation seeds production supply


136. CARDI plays important roles in breeding and varieties improvement and
development. Based on the scenario presented above, CARDI needs to expand its
research capacity toward improved varieties that are suitable to different needs beside
premium rice. The varieties that are well suited for subsistence purposes and that are
adaptable to varied climate and field conditions are in high demand (79,000 Mt).
CARDI can produce 10 Mt of FS in five years, starting with 1ha in the first year, 2 ha
in the second and third year, 3 ha in the fourth year, and 2 ha in the fifth year. The
allocation of the amount of production is based on the need to use FS for OFAT, the
Seed Purification Training Program, and the Extension Program. The total amount of
funds needed for this activity is $73,530. The returns from this investment would be
an increase in improved varieties released for the country. The returns would also
create seed capital and training for around 5,000 OFAT farmer participants in the 300
targeted villages of the Seed Production Extension Program in the five targeted
provinces.


Equipment and facilities


137. Improvement of CARDI facilities and equipment will help increase seed
access to poor farmers who are in need through contribution to the expansion of the
potential seed market. Investment to improve facilities and equipment requires around
$120,000. About $113,000 is needed for the establishment of a seed lab (Table 5),
which would begin in year 3 of the project.


On-farm Adaptive Trial


138. Enhancing and expanding this investment could increase farmers’
interest and demand for improved seed through farmer-to-farmer extension.
Generally, OFAT is conducted in collaboration among CARDI, PDA, and farmers.
This activity should be integrated into the Farmer Community after the project. If
OFAT receives this investment, each OFAT will cost around $540 (Table 5) and will
enable at least 20 neighboring farmers to learn about different varieties. It is expected
that after five years of OFAT, in each location where an OFAT is conducted,
awareness about improved seeds will be created and will spill over into neighboring
communities. At the same time, at least 20 percent of the farmers in the community
will adopt improved seed; 5-20 farmers will decide to purchase the quality seed. If
five provinces are targeted, it is suggested that 20 OFATs are conducted in each
province, starting with five OFATs per district in the first year. The fifth year should
be left for integrating OFAT activities into the Community Program. The integration
should take place proactively from the third year of the project, so that any support
needed can be provided during the first two years.

CARDI Training Program on Seed Purification and Quality Improvement


139. This training program can enhance farmers’ capacity in producing
quality seed for their own use. Details are also discussed in Section 3.1.1. The
training program will be implemented through CARDI and PDA cooperation. In each
province, 20 training courses will be conducted; 20 farmer participants will be invited
to each training course. The training will consist of technical explanations and field
practices for the whole cycle of the seed production. Field practices will be conducted
on selected farmer’s field (0.2 ha) for skill demonstration and practice. After the
training, if the participants want to have seed, it will be given to them.. After
completing the training course, it is expected that 2,000 farmers will be able to grow
pure seeds and spread information to other farmers in their communities. It is
expected that at least three framers will want to buy FS. Detailed costs of this
investment are proposed in Table 6.

Extension Program on Seed Production Technique


141. The program will be implemented in collaboration between Extension
Officers at the provincial level, CARDI, and PDA. The extension program will be
integrated with the rice market coordination process. It is hoped that through Farmer
Associations, services will be improved, particularly business development for rice.
The investment on this program is estimated at about $230,000 for Year One (Table
8). Annex 4 provides a more detailed cost breakdown for Year One implementation.
The cost from the second year to fifth year is for covering 30 percent expansion of the
target area per year, and it will be reduced by 20 percent of the Year One cost. The
total cost of this investment program within five years will be $876,402. It is expected
that at the end of five year projects, five farmers associations will be formed in each
village, and they will be moving toward an on-going seed production supply
association and their benefits will materialize. It is also expected that 20-50 farmers
per village will purchase the quality seed.

4.3.2. Options for establishing local (village) groups of certified CS Program


142. Cambodia has gone through long years and various experiences with
cooperatives, interest groups, community organizations, or resource
management committees, as well as other organizations. Lessons learned show
that none of these organization or projects have worked. If the members do not
understand the objectives of the organization, benefits will not materialize. These are
two requirements for deciding on options to establish local groups for seed production
supply, and the group should build them up constructively.


143. The key players of the association are very important; they need to be
analyzed and their respective roles identified. The key players—including
CARDI, which is the main source supplier of BS and FS; extension workers; and the
seed farmers’ associations—need to be in place. These are stakeholders within the
seed production circle who are involved directly in seed production. In addition to
these key players, there is a need to establish relationships and to arrange services
coordination with other stakeholders who are indirectly involved in seed and rice
production. This would include providers of inputs supply services (such as fertilizer,
pesticides and equipments supplies), financial services, and business development
services.


144. At present, farmers associations or cooperatives, which are led and
managed by the farmers themselves, have emerged in the rural community for a
value added approach. The real example that can be cited is Champei Agricultural
Development Community and another eight similar to ADC in Samrong, Prey Kabas,
Tramkok and Kirivong Districts in Takeo province (Annex 3). Detailed discussions
on Champei ADC can be found in Section 3.1.2. Farmer associations like Champei
ADC are a suitable local group with a simple approach that could work well for the
community based seed program.


4.3.3. Options how to improve linkages between research and extension services


145. Generally, researchers and extension workers work separately in
Cambodia. CARDI, for example needs to provide research findings from their
research programs to the Department of Extension in order to transfer technical
knowledge to the farmers. If the extension approach works well, it is still questionable
whether the extension workers could fully understand about technologies to be
transferred by simply reading or studying documents provided by the researchers.
Experiences have shown that it is more successful for extension programs if the
researcher is working at the same time as the extension worker. To provide reliable
and updated information on CARDI’s productivity enhancing technologies, as well as
the skills needed to more effectively demonstrate the benefits of these technologies,
CARDI’s researchers and extension workers of the Department of Extension must
develop linkages. They could achieve this by building into each other’s integrated



                                           51
research and extension activities. Some appropriate outreach activities to make these
linkages work in practice could be as follows:

   •   Develop a roadmap for research and extension integration. The roadmap
       should provide concept and framework of integration between their respective
       roles and commitments, as well as the working approach. This roadmap
       should be improved and modified as necessary based on real practical
       experience and consensus between the two bodies.
   •   There should be one or two extension officers assigned to join the CARDI-
       OFAT activities, and CARDI’ researchers should be assigned to join the
       extension activities. In this way, the extension workers will learn and practice
       technical aspects from the research, thereby finding ways to help farmers
       apply research results, who can then extend their knowledge and skills to other
       farmers successfully. At the same time, the researchers can look at how the
       results or research findings can be applied by the farmers in their real farm
       conditions. This activity should be done for all research and extension
       programs, and they should be integrated in their action plan.
   •   In designing a research proposal, CARDI needs to have one component on
       extension of research results to research on how results should be applied in
       real farm conditions. The extension worker can join this component from the
       onset of research—not after the results are generated.
   •   In the seed program, there is opportunity for a joint research-extension project
       on Community Based Seed Production Techniques operated through
       collaboration among CARDI, PDA and the Provincial Extension Officers.
       Through the process of promoting community based seed production supply,
       the researchers and extension workers can explore possibilities to develop
       linkages between research and extension services.

5. Vegetable and Other Seed Production
Supply System

146. In Cambodia, there is only one vegetable research station: the Kbal Koh
Vegetable Research Station located in Kbal Koh Commune, Kien Svay District,
Kandal Province. There is one seed farm dedicated mainly to soybean and mung bean
seed production supply: the Chamkar Leu Seed Farm located in Chamkar Leu
District, Kampong Cham Province.

5.1. Kbal Koh Vegetable Research Station


147. The tasks of the Kbal Koh Vegetable Research Station include the
following: i) to conduct research on imported seeds; ii) to compare and select the best
seeds/varieties that are suited to the growing conditions and that have market
potential; and iii) to purify and expand selected seeds. The station work on string
bean, mustard, tomato, local cucumber, chilly, long and round egg plants, and some
cereals such as mung bean, soy bean, glutinous corn/sweet corn. According to the
station director, the market demand and potential is more important than the seed
price. For this reason and due to domination of imported seeds from Vietnam and
Thailand, the station will make selections from those lines that will produce
vegetables with characteristics more acceptable to local demands.


148. In seed purification and production, the station receives parent seeds
mainly from Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam, and Thailand. After initial testing, selection
and seed multiplication, a foundation seed production block is grown. Seed from this
could be distributed directly to farmer customers, or more commonly used to grow
subsequent generations of Registered and Commercial seed. The vegetable seeds are
produced in this station and a larger quantity of GS is produced by contract growers
because of limited land capacity. The cereal seeds, after research and selection, are
produced at Chamkar Leu Seed Farm. All seed that is produced is returned to the
Kbal Koh station for processing and distribution. It costs the contracted grower about
$3,439/ha to produce one hectare of string bean GS, and the profit is worth $2,600.


149. The Kbal Koh Station works with open pollinated vegetables seeds only.
The disadvantage of this versus hybrids is that hybrids usually have higher yield
potential than the open pollinated varieties. Since hybrids come from other countries,
their characteristics may not meet local demand. For instance, local demand for
eggplant is for long, deep purple fruits; the Thai hybrids do not exhibit these traits. In
many cases, the demand for the ideal type is the primary reason for acceptance rather
than price or yield potential. In addition to desirable types, the selection of these
varites would also have to be made for these varieties to perform better in local field
conditions.


                                           53
150. Additionally, the Kbal Koh Station had an extension mandate to make the
more distant farmers aware of the use of good quality seed. To this end, they
distributed about 40 percent of their yearly seed production to the farmers in different
provinces without cost. However, there is a high demand for vegetable diversities
from the market and many of those quality vegetable seeds cannot be produced in
Cambodia, nor can they be produced at the Kbal Koh Station. For this reason,
imported vegetable seeds have been allowed; there have been an increasing number of
active importation and distribution networks—even down to local areas by the private
sector. Vietnam and Thailand seed companies have the most potential in Cambodia
because many of these seed companies are run by former students who undertook
their Agriculture Degrees in these countries—particularly Vietnam. They are able to
provide all the necessary technical extension and capacity building activities needed
to the vegetable growers and farmers.


151. Farmers using hybrid seed from Vietnam or Thailand were extremely
satisfied with these products. The shops also sold pesticides, fertilizer, and other
supplies for crop production and were able to supply some information to the farmers
about crop production techniques. Farmers gained most of their new information
from other farmers in the area or from more progressive farmers in other regions.
Purchases could be made in cash at the time of sale or by credit with payment at
harvest. As might be expected, crop failures or low prices would make credit pay-
offs more difficult, but payment would be expected after the payment of subsequent
crops.


152. Internationally, seed for vegetable production is dominated by hybrid
seeds supplied by large multinational seed companies. In Cambodia, most of the
seed comes from companies in Vietnam and Thailand with some production coming
from as far as northern Europe. Kbal Koh serves some purpose to the farmers where it
supplies seed, but it is very limited. Their present reliance on hybrid vegetable seed
from international seed companies is strong; this will be the basis for a vegetable seed
program in the future. Therefore, support for this station on seed production at this
stage is not recommended because of the following reasons:
   •   First, there are very limited seeds diversities that the station or the country can
       produce attributable to the unfavorable climatic conditions (namely, the heat
       and moisture)). Many vegetable plants cannot produce seeds, or they are able
       to produce seeds, but with poor quality. Thus, on the one hand, the station
       cannot respond to the high and diverse vegetable seed demands in the country
       despite the fact that it functions well. On the other hand, the few local varieties
       of vegetable cover only small proportion of the seeds used in the country; with
       minimal support, the station is able to maintain them.
   •   The marketing and seed distribution systems of the international seed
       production companies are superior to the program of the station and can meet
       both the increasing present and future demands.
   •   The consistent seed quality and yield capabilities of international hybrid seed
       are superior to the open pollinated vegetables produced at the station




                                           54
   •   Farmers have confidence in the hybrid seed they are now using and believe
       that the cost of that seed is worth the price.


5.2. Chamkar Leu Seed Farm


153. This is an MAFF owned facility that mainly produces soybean and mung
bean seeds. They are two of the four main subsidiary and industrial crops in
Cambodia. Parent varieties of soybean are mainly B3039, brought from Hungary, and
DT84, brought from Taiwan. As discussed earlier, seeds of mung bean and soybean
are selected and developed at Kbal Koh research station and bulk seeds are produced
from those parent lines. Becasue the B3039 variety presents unfavorable
characteristics: long duration, sensitive to disease, small grain and low production, it
was replaced by Phka Sar variety (bigger grain and high yield) brought back from
farmers nearby the farm.


154. Mung bean: 10 ha of the farmland is devoted to seed production. The farm
produces about 1Mt of mung bean seed in a year. It is possible to produce more, but
farmers tend to reuse their seed from year to year—rather than buying new seed. This
is especially true since mung bean seed is relatively easy to produce.


155. Soybean: 20 ha of the farmland is devoted to seed production. It is
possible to grow two soybean crops per year: early June and late July. It is difficult to
produce soybean seed during the wet season because rain and humidity make it
difficult to produce a product with acceptable viability. Since seed moisture is a
problem, most soybeans for seed must be dried in the most common manner: air-
drying. Airdrying of soybean seed can be a problem because the seed is produced in
the rainy season. Exposing the seed for drying at this time can expose it to humid air,
which can make the seed wet, moldy, and subject to viability problems. For this
reason, the farm cannot meet the increasing soybean seed demand, particularly when
there are increasing soybean growers in the northeastern provinces (Ratanakiri and
Mondulkiri Provinces) who desire the farm seed.


156. There is greater demand for soybean seed, but because of a low-tech seed
production approach and weather constraints, recent production has been about 2-3Mt
per year. In better years, the farm has been able to produce up to 10 Mt/year. Seed is
normally sold at KHR 6,000/kg, but in 2009, because of high demand, seed was sold
at KHR 10,000/kg. With an amount of $450/ha cost of production and recent sale
price for 1Mt/ha seed produced, soybean seed production is highly profitable (nearly
$2000/ha). Demand for seed can be up to the 30 Mt/year (in difficult seed production
years), but these are also the same conditions that limit soybean seed production on
the seed farm. Seed from the local market, usually supplied from Thailand, fills the
rest of the seed demand in the area. Although the seed from Thailand is KHR 2,000
cheaper (KHR 4,000/kg), the growers prefer the seed from the Seed Farm because
they trust the quality and good characteristics of the variety: shorter duration, higher
yield, bigger grain, and lighter color.


                                           55
157. Besides rain, the major constraints that make the seed farm unable to
function effectively and efficiently have been capital shortages linking with
complicated logistics procedure, a lack of equipment for completing field
operations on time and as planned, a lack of operational facilities, and a lack of
capacity to address these constraints. These problems have led to late crop
production, a decrease in the area planted, and harvest time falling during unfavorable
conditions (heavier rainy season).


158. The farm does possess some field machineries and seed processing
facilities, but they are not useful. Under a separate WB project, the seed farm was
given a number of pieces of equipment to help in the mechanized seed production
process. The two Massey Ferguson tractors on the farm were currently not useable
because spare parts are not available; some tillage equipment was also there. When
asked about the tillage equipment, the farm stated that they were not workable. This
was doubtful after inspection of the equipment revealed that it had never been used
(e.g. the paint was still pristine and the equipment unworn). The seed processing
plant had a drier that would have been able to process soybean seed in ample time, but
they did not have money to fuel it. Furthermore, it cannot work for seed drying
because the temperatures cannot be set low enough to dry seed without overheating
the seed and thereby hampering germination. The air/screen cleaner (seed grader) was
supplied with only one set of screens; these appeared to be screens to clean rice,
which are ineffective for soy or mungbeans. Therefore, soybeans and mung beans are
not being cleaned efficiently. The facility also had a length grader that was designed
to be attached to the seed grader. This machine had never been attached or used.
Moreover, a length grader is a totally inappropriate piece of equipment to be used in
the processing of the round/oval soybeans and mung beans. The facility also included
a seed treater that was installed, but that had never been used. Soybean and mung
bean seeds are not chemically treated here.


159. Most of the work—from field operation to seed processing—is done
manually. The farm manager wishes to improve the functionality of the mechanized
equipment and facilities in order to increase soybean seed production to meet the
increasing demand for improved seed. The manager also wishes to have better budget
flow management in order to get inputs and crop production operated on time. The
farm seed alone could not do this improvement; it requires a commitment from all
institutions involved, including PDA/MAFF and the Ministry of Economic and
Finance (MEF). The small amount of seed produced here would seem to be easily
replaced by imported seed.


5.3. Vegetable seed supply through seed importation


160. Fresh vegetable production by local farmers is a profitable and important
crop in Cambodia. Vegetable farming uses more intensive practices and more inputs
than rice, but it can also lead to larger returns. Farmers can often grow several crops a


                                           56
year on the same field, and they can be timed to meet market demand. Marketing of
the vegetable products can be done locally or more often through traders who buy
from individual farmers or community farmers groups and sell to urban markets.
Because of the value of the final vegetable product, farmers have learned the
importance of planting good seed to grow their crops.


161. In Cambodia, as in many parts of the world, vegetable seed production
companies primarily supply vegetable seed: much of this seed is hybrid. Most of
the companies that supply vegetable seeds in Cambodia are from either Vietnam or
Thailand. In either case, the seed may have been grown in one of those countries, or
it may have been grown and imported from as far away as northern Europe.


162. Local distributors import seed to Cambodia by local distributors and sell
it in local shops at the village level. This seed is often packaged in containers
printed in Vietnamese or Thai—often not understood by the farmer customers. The
purchasers must rely on the pictures on the containers and the word of the seed seller
for specific product information. Seed is most often packed in sealed containers,
either in cans or packets that are labeled to maintain the stated germination (usually
80-85 percent) for two years. Most seed containers viewed at distributors’ locations or
at local stores had expiration dates of at least 2011, so they were basically current.
The larger cans of seed are usually opened at the store and seed is sold in amounts
according to the farmers’ needs. Once these cans are open, they are exposed to the
ambient climatic conditions of high temperatures and high humidity that can reduce
seed viability. In most cases seed store operators said that open cans of seed were sold
within a few months of the cans being opened—decreasing the chance for major
germination damage.


163. Presently, the more advanced vegetable seed dealers increasingly provide
demonstration and capacity building as an extension method to induce the
vegetable growers to use quality seeds and other farming inputs. In addition, they
also provide technical assistance when required. This manner of services attracts the
growers’ interest. Beside vegetable seed, the vegetable growers also purchase seed
treatment materials, fertilizer, pesticides, water, straw mulch, composted manure,
services for cultivation—both mechanical power and animal—and hand labor. Some
cropping information was received from the dealers, but most of it came from other
growers within the area and from farther distances. These seed dealers are also
working closely with the vegetable association, for example, Sre Meas Seed Company
(makes direct deals with Tang Nong Company in Vietnam) joined the Vegetable
Association in Svay Rieng Province, with various NGOs and PDA in Svay Rieng
Province.


164. The ease and economics of producing seed on a farm—or even small seed
company/research station can vary with the type of vegetable. Vegetables can
roughly be grouped into one of three categories when dealing with seed production.
First are those where the actual food product is the seed itself: for example, corn or
mung beans. The production methods of seed here is almost identical to the
production method of the food product; therefore, extra seed production costs and


                                          57
expertise are not necessary. Farmers will often produce their own seed from these
crops. The second group would be those vegetables where the food product is
actually the fruit of the plant where the seed must be extracted from the fruit. Some
examples are tomatoes, cucumbers, or eggplant.
165. Once again the actual field production is similar for seed and food
purposes, but the retrieval of the seed from the fruit requires extra steps, more
ripening time, and expertise. Some farmers would grow their own seed of these
crops; however, those that understand the added value of good purchased seed are
unlikely to do so. The third category is plants where vegetative material (often leaves)
is the food product. Leafy vegetables like cabbage, kale, and mustard are some
examples. Broccoli and cauliflower could also be considered in this category. The
food parts from these crops are removed well before the reproductive stage of growth
is reached. Therefore, any seed production would take an additional 4-6 weeks of
field production time that might be more profitably used for the growth of the next
vegetable crop. This is the group of crops where farmers are least likely to produce
their own seed.

166. The potential for a farmer’s own seed production to fill his seed needs is
not great. Many farmers will purchase seed every year because they believe it is
better quality. In addition, the trade-off of not selling vegetables to the market at
favorable prices versus retaining them for seed is often not economically sound.
Additionally, farmers also may not have the skills and equipment needed to produce
and harvest the seed, and maintaining the seed in the warm, humid Cambodian
environment is difficult with viability losses. This can be explained based on
experience from interviewed vegetable growers in Koh Thom District:

   •   When vegetable farmers tried to grow seed from their own production, they
       did not get good quality seed and yields were not as good. For farmers who
       are used to growing vegetables for food, seed production of these crops takes
       additional time after the vegetables would have been harvested. This is in
       addition to management skills that farmers do not possess. Vegetable seed
       cannot be easily produced in the wet season because of seed sprouting on the
       plant and mold damaging the seed.
   •   Farmers are not likely to produce vegetable seeds for local distribution beyond
       their own farm. They know that the seed they produce may have the
       possibility to be of a lower or at least a more variable quality than purchased
       seed. In addition, the production of seed takes land and product away from
       their primary vegetable production scheme. The cost of seed is normally not a
       prohibitive factor: a mustard grower said that seed costs for his 0.22 ha field
       were about $5 or about 1.5 percent of the value of the crop. He found this to
       be a reasonable figure because he knew the quality and potential of the seed he
       was planting and could expect a reasonable return on that investment. Tomato
       seed would ranges from $30 to $100 for 100gm (enough to plant an average
       field) for open-pollinated vs. hybrid seed; however, in both cases, this was
       offset by seed quality and high yield potential.




                                          58
167. Vegetable seed production is normally handled by seed companies using
their own varieties, and employing their own marketing networks. Vegetable seed
production requires special expertise and equipment that are not available in
Cambodia. Vegetable seed is required in smaller amounts; therefore, transportation
logistics are not difficult and not very costly. Therefore, the startup of production for
good vegetable seed does not seem very practical, nor is there much demand.


168. There could be some production of tomatoes, beans, or melons this is
because the actual edible part is also the portion of the plant that contains the
seed. But even here, there is little knowledge in production and the learning curve
might be extensive. In addition, the best varieties may not be available and the
marketing network is not existent. It seems logical that farmers would not use this
seed over the product that they already use—furthermore, the cost of production is
nearly the same as buying the seed. Moreover, it is important to note that the
vegetable growers are less likely to practice risk avoidance compared with the rice
farmers. They are more likely to be open to new ideas.




                                           59
6. Conclusions and Recommendations

6.1. Conclusions


169. The seed industry in Cambodia is characterized by some lack of overall
structure, but it is populated by individuals who understand the need for quality
seed. Farmer seed growers and seed buyers have begun to understand the advantages
of good quality seed and have been learning the techniques to produce it.


170. Based on agro-ecological conditions and socio-economical conditions of
the rice production systems in Cambodia, it is estimated that the quality seed
demand in 2009-2010 was about 23,000 Mt. The scenario of seed demand in 2015 is
estimated to be about 38,500 Mt and 50,000 Mt in 2020. Because the potential
expansion of the supply in the next five years could reach about only 8,500 Mt, there
is a gap of some 30,000 -32,000 Mt between supply and demand.


171. At the grassroots or community levels, farmers are not only producing
seed for other farmers but also are teaching other community farmers how to
grow, store, and maintain their own planting stock. In some cases, these
community groups have worked with rice traders—creating projects to produce a
value added product directly to the final consumer. However, there are also those who
are still unaware of the quality seed on sale, as well as those who have no access to it.


172. Private seed producers have emerged as a response to increased demand
for quality seed. They can be grouped into three main categories: i) the formal seed
producers, which are registered with the MoC and have adopted a production system
similar to AQIP, but at smaller scale (100-200 Mt/year); ii) informal seed producers,
who have well coordinated (and managed) small production systems (up to 100
Mt/year); and iii) informal seed producer groups, which are not registered, operate in
a smaller scale (100-300 Mt/ year) and are also adopting a production system similar
to AQIP. Some of these producers could be expected to upgrade and expand their
seed production systems in near future.


173. The main constraints of seed production supply in Cambodia are capital
deficit, diversification, and the lack of mechanized equipment and facilities for
effective and efficient production. Capital deficit is the most serious constraint,
particularly for mobilizing the seed purchase at harvesting time. At the same time, the
major constraints faced by the demand side are also very important because the farm
conditions where the quality seeds are planted, the irrigation access, the purpose of
using quality seeds, and the rice markets are determinant factors for farmers’



                                           60
decisions to purchase seed. These constraints are also important factors in
determining potential expansion for the production supply to materialize.


174. A major problem in the vegetable seed supply system in Cambodia is the
flow of seed and other inputs, extension information, and customer services from
suppliers to the farmers and feedback from the farmers to those suppliers. Not
only is there a lack of value chain awareness, but also there is often a fear to purchase
inputs because of low quality inputs or a lack of concern by suppliers of products and
services.


6.2. Recommendations


175. CARDI’s mandate in the development of new varieties and Foundation
seed production is being hampered by limited capital and outdated equipment.
These constraints create increasingly expensive hand labor that must be used for
precise fieldwork and thereby reduces options in seed production. Currently, CARDI
can only afford to grow seed that it is assured it can sell. In years where demand is
greater, orders go unfilled because of production restrictions. Support of CARDI’s
seed production would mean that greater amounts of seed would be available to rice
farmers and significant returns could be generated in CS production (Each kg of FS
planted could generate around $700 profit). The following actions are needed:

       •   Provide support to the CARDI seed production and seed research
           programs according to scheduled activities: 1 ha in the first year, 2 ha in
           the second and third year, 3ha in the fourth year, and 2 ha in the fifth year
           (Table 5).
       •   Plot equipment is needed in the first year of the project that would
           decrease hand labor and make fieldwork more efficient. A tractor, plot
           planter, rice seedling transplanter, and plot combine should be supplied to
           CARDI. This investment amounts to $120,000.


176. A strong and functional seed testing laboratory is essential to
understanding the quality of the seed being traded in a country. Basic seed
laboratories test seed for germination, physical purity, and seed moisture and work in
conjunction with seed certification and seed regulatory programs. Labs can also add
further services that look at viability and storage potential of seed and can aid in other
seed research as well. A seed laboratory should be established and placed at CARDI.
CAVAC in considering the funding of the completion of an existing rice quality
laboratory at CARDI; the addition of a seed testing facility would be a good
compliment to this lab. The following actions are needed:

       •   As soon as the project and work plan are officially approved, a seed
           consultant should be contracted to assist CARDI in making the lab
           functional. The consultant should make his initial visit as the project
           implementation starts.


                                           61
       •   During this initial visit, the consultant should prepare his action plan for
           the complete seed lab establishment, assess the industry needs and the
           CARDI location, and compile a list of equipment and training needs. The
           consultant should also look at how the lab will function and solicit
           business. At this point, the laboratory director and staff should already be
           selected and have begun working with the consultant. Their training needs
           should also be assessed at this time.
       •   Staff will have to be trained; this is often accomplished by sending the
           technicians to a functioning lab (possibly Thailand) for a number of weeks
           of training. They should be scheduled to return back before the second
           visit of the consultant.
       •   Arrangements will have to be with MAFF or other agencies to fund the on-
           going operation of the seed laboratory over time.
       •   Order seed laboratory equipment and arrange for the laboratory building or
           rooms to be built or remodeled for lab use.
       •   After the equipment arrives, an on-site set-up and start-up of the seed lab
           should be done in the second visit by the seed consultant. He should plan
           to work with the lab staff for a few days in order to provide the necessary
           technical orientation and support needed.


177. Community based rice seed production groups have been established in
many areas. Usually a few progressive farmers are selected to grow and maintain
popular local varieties. They are also trained in field seed production practices
including single panicle selection, field rouging, hand harvest, seed processing, and
seed storage. Other farmers are trained to grow CARDI seed varieties for distribution
at the community level. In either case, these farmers use their fields as variety
demonstrations and provide on-going training to other village farmers who will be
maintaining their own seed stock. This kind of program is especially effective
because it is village based with potential seed users having close access to the seed
grower and his seed fields. Additional funding should be made available to expand
this type of program to additional communities. The following actions are needed:

       •   Assist and expand CARDI’s current training and development programs to
           assist farmers at the community level in the following: i) Purifying,
           growing, and maintaining local varieties; and ii) growing, maintaining, and
           distributing CARDI seed released varieties through OFAT.
       •   Other programs in Cambodia such as CEDAC are aimed at community
           seed production to add a value added approach for organic rice. Support
           could be given to these programs. Alternatively, a community seed
           production/value added program could be instituted that would market
           local rice products more directly to consumers giving farmers a greater
           return for their product.


178. Linkages between research and extension need to be upgraded, as each
tends to work separately. This results in researchers generating technologies or new
varieties for the extension workers who may not understand or be able to apply these
technologies in the real farm conditions. The following actions are needed:



                                          62
   •   Develop a roadmap for research and extension integration, which provides
       concept and framework of integration,, their respective roles and
       commitments, and the working approach.
   •   Some extension officers should be assigned to join the CARDI-OFAT
       research activities and CARDI’s researchers should be assigned to join the
       extension activities as well. This participation should be done for all research
       and extension programs, and they should be integrated in their action plan. In
       this way, any issue related to information and technologies as well as research-
       extension process that arise can be addressed in a timely and effective manner.
   •   In designing a research proposal, CARDI needs to have one component on
       extension of research results to research on how its research results should be
       applied in real farm conditions. The extension worker can participate or join
       this component from the onset of research; they should not wait until the
       results are generated because it will be too late to develop an extension
       approach.
   •   In the seed program, there is opportunity for a Joint Research Extension
       Project on Community Based Seed Production Technique operated by
       collaboration among CARDI, PDA, and Extension Officers at the provincial
       level. Through the process of promoting community based seed production
       supply, the researchers and extension workers can explore possibilities to
       develop linkages between research and extension services.


179. Connections within the public sector and public/private ties are very
weak in the Cambodia seed industry. We found a seed farm and a private buyer of
soybeans who did not know each other while advocating different varieties with
differing traits for the same market; a seed farm manager who grew CARDI rice
varieties who never saw CARDI test plots grown in his area; and seed producing
farms that had no contact with farmer customers—except at the point of sale. Work
must be done to identify the key players, and to introduce them to each other, and to
coordinate their efforts. This also would include on-farm rice seed tests,
demonstrations, and field days—not only for the farmer, but also to unify the key rice
players. The following actions are needed:

       •   CAVAC is a project that is working within extension and value chain
           enhancement, and there is a possibility to do extension coordination and
           training with CAVAC—others may exist as well. This program should
           work with MAFF, CARDI, and the Department of Extension to work
           together to coordinate extension activities within the value chain.
       •   Procure a consultant who has extension experience in crops testing, on-
           farm demonstrations, farmer meetings, and field days to work with MAFF,
           CARDI, Extension, seed farms, and PDA’s to uncover pertinent
           information that can be presented to farmers about their seed and input
           choices.
       •   Fund CARDI in expanding its test plots and farmer demonstration plots in
           rice growing areas of the country.




                                         63
180. Rice and vegetable farmers who purchase seed and/or other inputs are
receiving products of variable quality. These farmers often fail to receive sound
agronomic advice and many get poor post-sale service from local shops. In many
cases, farmers will plant low quality seed without fertilizers or pesticides because of
low product quality or lack of product performance. Shops that sold the products will
not stand behind their sale, which means that farmers become disillusioned and
reluctant to buy products that will give better field performance. The following
actions are needed:

       •   Establish a network of private sector agri-input dealers who have been
           trained in the use of seed, fertilizers, pesticides, and mechanics. Use these
           dealers as an additional private sector extension service that will
           demonstrate their products to potential customers. These dealers will
           perform after sales service to help and to retain customers. Help these
           dealers to combine into an association so that they can use group power to
           help farmers and influence policy. In Cambodia, IDE has established a
           network of Farm Business Enterprises (FBE) for vegetable growers.
           Internationally, IFDC and CNFA are two NGO’s who have used this
           model in other countries.


181. MAFF has several seed production farms that provide rice, vegetable,
and other cereal seed to area farmers and to other provinces. Much of the current
control of theses farms now comes directly from MAFF; it is believed that increased
local control would contribute to increased operational efficiency and greater
productivity. More local control of these facilities may help the seed farms to better
service farmer seed buyers with increasing amounts of high quality seed and better
information. A study to evaluate the possibilities is the main focus of this
recommendation. The following actions are needed:

       •   Write a business plan for the farm that would provide increasing service
           and products to local farmers and give the farm a financial basis. This
           plan would look at all aspects of farm operation and identify the aspects
           that are profitable so that the farm can be more successful. This would
           most likely include reasonable overhead payments to MAFF. Local
           consultants should be available to assist in this process.


182. The National Seed Law has been written and the legislation passed. This
means that the raw structure for the national seed program has been established,
but without its accompanying Rules and Regulations, the operational interpretation
does not yet exist. The following actions are needed:


       •   An appropriate English translation of the law does not exist. The law will
           require a proper English translation before it can be assessed appropriately.
       •   An expert consultant on seed law and policy will have to be hired to
           research the law; interpret its meaning for the Cambodian seed industry;
           consult with MAFF, CARDI, and seed industry officials; and write the
           Rules and Regulations to accompany the Seed Law.                  Since the


                                          64
    recommendations here are to incorporate a system similar to Thailand’s
    (therefore the United States seed system) it is strongly recommended that
    the consultant be familiar with the seed programs in those countries.
•   Seed certification is the normal program for seed production quality
    control in a country. Because of the current small-scale agricultural seed
    production, a seed certification program is not warranted at this time and
    would possibly add unneeded bureaucracy to the system. It is only
    recommended that the structure of a voluntary certification be added to the
    rules and regulations so that it can be added as needed.
