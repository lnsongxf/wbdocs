1. SUMMARY
The Incubator for Agribusiness and Agroindustry at Bogor Agricultural University, Indonesia (IAA-IPB)
assists during three stages in the incubation process:early incubation (mentoring creative ideas,
assisting in evaluation of market prospects, defining and outsourcing technology needs);incubation
(helping production begin); and post-graduation (consulting on business plan revision and facilitating
access to financial resources and a market network for new products and new technology
implementation).

The utmost attention must be paid to incubatees during both the selection process and the
incubation period, in order to ensure that they grow and are successful. Their success is the success of
the incubator itself. One-to-one interaction with the incubatees is necessary to understand their
problems and special needs and to help them find solutions.

In addition, incubators are advised to maintain relations with successful graduates. They will continue
to need assistance, they will be able to assist the incubator by being role models to new incubatees,
and they represent a potential source of income for the incubator through profit sharing or equity
investment.



2. BACKGROUND
Bogor1 Agricultural University (IPB) has been involvedsince 1963 in programs to increase farmers'
income and to develop farmer cooperatives and small and medium enterprises (SMEs).The programs
cover training, technology transfer, and management consulting in cooperation with government
ministries and agencies,2the private sector, and international institutions.

Although IPB trained SMEs and individual entrepreneurs, its success in growing self- sufficient SMEs
was very limited until 1994, when the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) introduced
the concept of incubating startup SMEs. IBP joined four other institutions in Indonesia in a pilot
program to establish business and technology incubators. Its incubator later became one of the
centers at IPB’s Institute for Research and Development.

IPB later expandedthe Incubator for Agribusiness and Agroindustry (IAA) beyond agribusiness,
including SMEs involved in handicraft, leather, and information technology (IT), and promoted the
additional idea of developing SMEs using innovations in “green energy” technology.

The Ministry of Cooperative and Small Medium Enterprises Development (MCSME) funded about 15
incubators with seed money from 1994 to 1996. The Ministry of National Education (MNE) later
launched a program to start incubators in the universities all over Indonesia. IPB was nominated
reviewer coordinator, and was assisted by two other incubators to evaluate proposals from new
incubators and monitor program implementation.

The incubator facility at Darmaga campus near Bogor in 2011 inaugurated a new building with a pilot
plant and space for 14 resident incubatees.New equipment was procured with funding from the
government. Facilities include sharing of other IPB facilities such as a food processing plant,
workshops, and laboratories.



3. STRATEGIC VISION, MISSION, AND TARGETS
Vision:to create strong, independent, and growing SMEs.

Mission:to provide incubation services to help startup agribusiness and agroindustry enterprises
become strong, independent, and prepared to scale up to medium size.

The incubator changed its focus to include handicraft, leather, and IT SMEs in response to a request
from Bogor’s government, which indicated that SMEs in other sectors also needed incubating services,
and that these services were not provided by any other organization in the area.

The strategic mission of the incubator in the next five years is to have a strong management team, to
use new facilities (building and equipment) effectively, to improve IT facilities to support incubatees,
to better remunerateIAA-IPB staff, and to help implement a forthcoming regulation on incubator
development.

The vision for the next ten years is for IAA-IPBto measure up to other international incubators.



4. INCUBATOR’S DISTINCTIVE FEATURES
The four distinguishing features of IAA-IPB are:

                             (i) Its focus on agribusiness and agroindustry.3

                             (ii) Good networking with the central government, including theactive involvement of its staff
                                  and management in formulating national policies related to incubator development.

                             (iii) Its investment in successful graduates in order to obtain profit-sharing income.

                             (iv) Its development of a post-graduate program for successful graduates.

The incubator’s four primary strengths include:

                             (i) Self-sufficiency and a minimal operating budget.

                             (ii) Access to the pilot plant, labs, and workshops of the university to support technology services
                                  for incubatees.

                             (iii) Its ability to serve as a role model for other emerging incubators.

                             (iv) A dedicated management team.

Its primary weaknesses include:

                             (i) Limited space for incubatees.4

                             (ii) A manager who is part-time, since he is also a member of the faculty.

                             (iii) Limited support from regional government.

                             (iv) Limited financial resources for incubator operations.



5. APPROACH TO SERVICE
Among the core services provided by IAA-IPB to incubatees are:

                                                           (i)                                                        Office space and utilities for resident incubatees at moderate rental cost.(ii)Other office
                                                                                                                      facilities, such as meeting and training rooms, at no charge.

                                                           (iii)                                                      Free consultation for technology development, management improvement, and
                                                                                                                      marketing plan.

                                                           (iv)                                                       Free training, business meetings, and workshops.

                                                           (v)                                                        Access to a processing plant and labs for amoderate fee5.

                                                           (vi)                                                       Free consultation on business plans (required in credit application).

                                                           (vii)                                                      Facilitation of the credit application. In particular, the incubator helps incubatees find
                                                                                                                      low-interest credit offered by government programs. The amount of this credit varies
                                                                                                                      according to the type of business, but most incubatees have been able to get loans of
                                                                                                                      at least Rp 100 million (about $11,000).

In addition to the core services, IAA-IPB provides other services such as facilitation of international
internships and attendance at exhibitions. Such services are provided according to each incubatee’s
needs.

The incubator’s approach to providing services was inspired by the principlethat service charges
should be applied cautiously, particularly in the initial stages of a high-risk sector such as agribusiness.
Management agrees that standard feesshould be chargedfor space and utilities, but believes that
consulting services should either be very low-cost or free. Equipment and lab analysis charges should
be made on a service basis. Events such as training and business meeting can appropriately be
charged on a service basis. Regular services should be charged as part of a standard package.

       This was a constraint until recently. The new facilities inaugurated in 2011 will alleviate this constraint.
5
       The service fees go to the plant and labs, not to the incubator.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    4	     	  
	  
6. BUSINESS MODEL
The business model of the incubator is based on three stages in the incubation process:

       (i) Early incubation: mentoring creative ideas, assisting in evaluation of market prospect,
           developing an early business plan, defining and outsourcing technology need.

       (ii) Incubation: helping production begin, consultation on business plan revision, facilitating
            access to financial resources and a market network.

       (iii) Post-graduation: consultation on business plan revision; facilitating access to financial
             resources and a market network for new products and new technology implementation.

In addition to funding from government and development partners, the incubator supports its
operation through such programs as designingagribusiness terminals, preparing manuals for a
packaging house, writing SME and other lending models for banks, investing in successful graduates;
and renting space. Space rental providedRp. 500,000/50m2 per month in 2011. Small charges have
been applied for consulting, trainingand workshops.

The IAA-IPB has been self-sufficient since 2000. Primary sources of funding in the last three years
include:

          (i)     Competitive projects related to SMEs: fluctuations in this income are dependent on s
                  successful proposals and implementation of project.

          (ii)    Grants for the incubation program: these declined from Rp. 330 millions in 2009, to Rp.
                  150 millions in 2010, and Rp. 100 millions in 2011 ($1 = Rp. 9000). Note there were no
                  grants from 2000–2008.

The proportion of earned income and subsidies is not fixed. In 2008, the incubator received no grants;
in 2009, the project/grant ratio was 1/6 and in 2010, the project/grant ratio was 5/3.The break-even
level for operating expenses is Rp 100 million/year (about $10,000).

Primary expenses in last three years include: (i) Salary for two permanent staff; (ii) Remuneration for
part time staff involved in the projects; (iii) Travel for permanent staff; (iv) Building and facility
maintenance.

The IAA-IPBowns the following assets used in the delivery of services to incubatees:

          (i)     Offices and spaces for resident incubatees.

          (ii)    Food-processing equipment (since 2011) and access to food processing equipment in
                  the pilot plant of the university (since inception).

          (iii)   Wooden toy workshop and access to workshops for manufacturing machinery in the
                  university.

          (iv)    Access to laboratories for analysis in the university.



                                                       5	                                                  	  
	  
The land where the incubator is located belongs to the university. From 1995 to 2011, the incubator
was located in an old IPB building and had access to IPB’s pilot plants and labs. The cost of new food-
processing equipment purchased in 2010 was to Rp. 5.5 billion (about $611,000) and the new building
costRp. 2 billion (about $222,000). Office equipment, accumulated over 1995-2005, cost Rp. 30 million.
The incubator lobbied for 15 years to raise the capital for investment in fixed assets and equipment. In
the future, the incubator will need vehicles to visit non-resident incubatees. It has been using private
cars belonging to the manager and management team.

The major lesson for the incubator is that even with the difficulty of raising capital for investment in
fixed assets (new building) and equipment, operations continued, albeit at a modest level. Networking
with institutions that could share their assets with the incubator was essential.

Costs per incubatee per year fluctuate between Rp. 0.75 and 1.5 million ($83 and $163). The cost
coverabout 50 percent of training expenses, 30 percentof the cost of consulting with outside experts
and/or travel expenses (in case of non-resident incubatees), and 20 percent of the cost of facilitating
access to financial resources.

Cost fluctuations depend on the amount of funding the incubator can access in a given fiscal year.
Whenever access to more funding is secured, more activities and costs are funded.

Other incubators in Indonesia may handle agribusiness and agroindustry, but it is not their major
focus. A couple of agri-incubators emerged ten years ago at the University of Jember, East Java, and
the University of Mataram, West Nusa Tenggara. Theseare no longer operating, possibly due to weak
management.



7. MANAGEMENT AND STAFFING
Management describes itscore team’s style as collegial, flexible, and independent.The core team
discusses tasks and problems among themselves and with the incubatees. Each person has a job
description, and programs are implemented in an integrated manner. Management staff acts on its
own initiative in the field, discussing decision later with other team members.

The primary competenciesin the management team include: (i) agricultural processing; (ii) economics
and (iii) entrepreneurship development. The competencies are the outcome of both formal education
and practical experience.

Some on the management team have worked together for more than 10 years. The rest of the team
has joined in the past three years. The former incubator manager (Hadi K. Purwadaria, Ph.D., a
professor at IPB) recruited and trained an assistant manager. The current manager was appointed by
the university in 2008, based on his track record of helping SMEs. The other assistant manager was a
former collaborating partner of the incubator program.

The core management staff has only local (Indonesian) marketing experience. The staff-to-client ratio
is one-to-five.

Strong leadership has been critical to the incubator’s success in four areas: i) making critical decisions
such as budget allocationand broadening the incubation focus to embrace IT, handicraft, and leather

SMEs;ii) providing direction to the management team;iii) lobbying university policy makers; andiv)
providing a leader on whom incubatees can rely.

The IPB incubator has been fortunate to have had a single leader for most of its history (1995-2008). In
2008, a new manager was selected, and momentum is building around him. The previous manager
serves as senior advisor.

The current management team describes leadership as: leading and directing a management team;
listening to the team; caring for staff welfare within budget limits; facilitating staff access to training
and education; lightening the team’s frustration while hiding one’s own; and occasionally evaluating
team members’ performance in an open forum.

The incubator has followed a few methods to develop leadership among incubatees:

       (i) Invite stakeholders beneficial to incubatees to meetings.

       (ii) Deliver on promises and services.

       (ii) Solve incubatees’ problems.

       (iv)Manage internal conflicts among resident incubatees and between incubatees and their
       workers.

       (v) Indicate that the incubator is improving in knowledge and resources.

Two key leadership lessons learnedby the incubator’s management team:

       (i) Don’t promiseservices you cannot offer.

       (ii) Clearly define your overall incubation program. Start simply based on resourcesand make
       efforts to improve as quick as possible.



8. OUTCOMES AND CONCLUSIONS
IAA-IPB measures the result of its own work with one simple metric: The increase in incubatees’ sales
volume.Job creation is not considered a reliable parameter by incubator management, since this
indicator varies with the type of business. For example, handicraft and shoe-making jobs increase
with sales volume; jobs in essential oil and fresh vegetables might not increase substantially with
increased sales.

The incubator has helped start 77 new businesses, of which 27 are still in incubation, 38 have
graduated, and 12 have withdrawn from the program.The following table indicates the number of
resident and non-resident incubatees, graduates, and those that have withdrawn.

The effect on famers’ income can be measured in some cases. One hypothesis is that asincubatees’
sales volume increases, farmers’ income also increases. For example, vetiver farmers’ income increased
from Rp 2500/kg to Rp 3000/kg over the past 3 years. Vegetable farmers have learned to do their own
packaging, so not all the work is done in the cooperative packaging house and the farmers thus gain
higher income. In the case of handicrafts, using a fiber called mendongenablesfarmers to realize an
income several times higher than the alternative paddy production.




9. CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
Four key success factors can be drawn from the experience of the past 15 years of IAA-IPB’s
experience. First, the utmost attention must be paid to the incubatees during both the selection
process and during the incubation period, in order to ensure that they grow and are successful. Their
success is the success of the incubator itself. One-to-one interaction with the incubatees is necessary
to understand their problems and special needs and help them find solutions.

Second, the incubator must have the resources necessary to carry out activities and support its
management and staff over the long term. Over-investment in activities and staff, particularly at the
beginning of the incubator program, is not likely to be sustainable. The incubator has to prove itself
with the limited resources it can musterover the mediumterm (at least three years).

Third, if additional resources are needed, strategic partnerships and networking need to be
established. In the case of IAA-IPB, access to infrastructure, facilities, and technical services was
obtained through linkages with the university; access to credit for the incubatees was made possible
through participation in nationwide programs to support the growth of SMEs; exposure to
international experiences through training and participation in conferences was sponsored by
development partners and international networks; support from local government was obtained
through collaborative linkages and networking with the municipality government; and support from
the private sector was received through linkages with Chamber of Commerce and financial
institutions.




                                                         9	                                               	  
	  
Fourth, maintain relations with successful graduates. They will continue to need assistance, they will
be able to assist the incubator by being role models to new incubatees, and they represent a potential
source of income for the incubator through profit-sharing or equity investment.



10. LESSONS LEARNED AND IMPLICATIONS FOR AGRIBUSINESS
   INCUBATORS
The major lesson from IAA-IPB’s experience is to put the incubatees’ success at center stage. All the
efforts of the management and staff of the incubator are warranted if the startup enterprises become
sustainable businesses that can mature from micro/small size to medium and even large size.

Even though there will be failures among the startups and some graduates will not be able to move
much beyond small size, it will be enough for the incubator to have a small number of highly
successful startup become medium-sized enterprises.

In the case of agribusiness sector, the IAA-IPB has filled a gap in government and academia: the
incubator is helping startup enterprises to grow in a relatively protected environment by reducing a
number of risks (market, finance, climatic, biological).

The final lesson is that the incubator should not stop supporting incubatees immediately after
graduation. Post-graduation activities are also important. A process of selection of successful
graduates should be established and post-graduation incubation could also continue. This will benefit
not only for graduates but also the incubator in terms of visibility and profitability.

Additional takeaways from the way the incubator has built up its strengths or compensated for its
weaknesses that might have value to other emerging incubators include:

       (i) An incubator must have a dedicated, full-time, and capable management team.

       (ii) An incubator should develop good networking with stakeholders such as policy makers,
       financial institutions, and markets.

       (iii) Management must be confident of its ability to deliver successful incubatees.



11. FUTURE GOALS
Post-Graduate Affiliation

Graduates continue to be associated with the incubator even after graduation. They are expanding
and need the incubator’s services for new products, new technology, and new marketing systems. The
relationship is also reciprocal. The incubator needs graduates for investment and to show examples to
startup incubatees.Graduates have not yet formed any informal or formal business association to help
themselves and fellow graduates. Incubator management is interested in actively promoting the idea
of an association of graduates.


                                                     10	                                               	  
	  
In some cases, graduates have attempted to associate with each other through clusters, mergers,
shared distribution channels or supply chains. The two vetiver incubatees have established a vetiver
farmer’s association;one has the position of chairman and the other the position of vice-chairman. The
association includes 5,000 farmers cultivating vetiver in Garut over 1,700 ha.

Expansion of Focus

Even though the main focus of the incubator will remain agribusiness, IAA-IPB also incubates
startupsin IT, textiles, leather, and handicrafts. Whether this expanded focus will dilute the
comparative advantage of the incubator or will strengthen it through the acquisition of new skills and
synergies remains to be seen.

Management Issues

As of 2011, the incubator was well positioned. It had a 15-year history,with its reputation and visibility
high in Indonesia and increasing abroad. It had acquired a new building capable of hosting 14 tenants,
and hadnew food-processing equipment and plant. With adequate human resources, it could
capitalize on past achievements and experience and rapidly growthe number of incubatees it
supports. One critical factor seems to be the availability of full-time human resources such as a CEO
who is capable, committed, and motivated. Such a CEO would be employed full time and respond to
the board of the incubator. Apart from his basic salary, his incentives could come from participation in
the success of the incubatees through various mechanisms such as profitsharing (which the incubator
already relies on) and equity sharing.
