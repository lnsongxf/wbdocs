EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the rationale, design and implementation of the South Sudan Youth Startup
Business Grant Program. The first of its kind in the conflict-torn South Sudan, the program aims to create
opportunities for the South Sudanese youth, especially young women. It is a response to growing and
undeniable issues among the youth. Throughout the report, these issues are identified, leading to the
rationale to address them through a grant program that is designed and implemented based on what have
been learned in existing literature and to fit in the context of a conflict-affected country.

South Sudan is in dire need of initiatives to provide opportunities for the youth. Conflicts, violence and
instability have left the South Sudanese youth in a vulnerable state. Making up nearly 35 percent of the
total population, the youth (ages 15 to 35) find themselves in declining livelihoods and desperate
situations. Almost 30 percent consider themselves inactive with the number even higher for young women
living in rural areas. Nonetheless, this vulnerable, desperate population of South Sudan is sometimes
overlooked. It is unfortunate but not surprising since immediate issues, such as stability and food security,
are generally considered more urgent. While these are indeed pressing issues, long-term prosperity cannot
be achieved without the involvement and preparedness of the youth. This is particularly true in the case of
South Sudan, as desperate and hopeless young populations are prone to violence. Therefore, addressing
the wellbeing of the youth by creating economic opportunities is an important component in reaching
peace and stability.

In response, the Youth Startup Business Grant Program offers opportunities for selected youth
beneficiaries. The program offers a grant in local currency equivalent to USD 1,000 to about 1,200 youth,
60 percent of whom are women, through a business startup competition. The design is intended to achieve
a balance between reaching out to the most vulnerable population and awarding those who have the
required characteristics to succeed in starting up a business or acquiring productive skills and absorbing
the benefits of the program. Beneficiaries participate in a one-week long training for life- and business-
skills before they obtain access to the grant in a commercial bank account. The grant is unconditional and
– while aimed towards (self-) employment and skill upgrading – can be used for any expenditures at the
discretion of the beneficiary.

The Youth Startup Business Grant Program is designed based on existing literature and lessons learned
from past programs. As commonly discussed in the literature of business startups in developing countries,
credit constraint is assumed to be a cause to the lack of business activities. By offering grants, this program
is designed to provide access to capital in the hope that it will increase investment and business
performance among the beneficiaries. This has been supported by various studies in the past. Additionally,
the literature suggests that, when accompanied by trainings, a cash grant is more likely to have an impact.
Therefore, this program adopts “practical” skills trainings in consideration to the growing evidence for the
effectiveness of such trainings. What is also found effective in various fields is the employment of text
message reminders, which will be used in the program in an attempt to boost performance.

The program is accompanied by an impact evaluation to inform the design and expansion of such
programs in fragile countries. Since there is limited literature on such programs in conflict-affected
countries, the impact evaluation will fill in the gap and provide further evidence for future programs in
similar situations. The full-fledged impact evaluation is designed as a randomized control trial utilizing
over-subscription to the program. An additional component of the study is designed to measure the
effectiveness of the text message reminders. The impact evaluation aims to inform decision makers and
other stakeholders whether cash grants can be a successful intervention in a country like South Sudan.

First results from the baseline survey reflect the design features of the program; but a decisive
conclusion requires follow-up data planned for 2016. The baseline survey shows that participants of the
program are more and better educated than the population in general. This is no surprise as the program
was designed to attract literate youth. In spite of their current struggle, the potential beneficiaries of the
business startup program project positive outlook for their future and express their ambitions for a better
life. This is encouraging for the success of the program in which case an expansion of such a program in
South Sudan could potentially have great effects on youth employment and the future livelihoods of the
population. While many issues such as violence and insecurity may likely persist, it is hoped that the
business startup grant program is a beginning step in the right direction.

1 PART I: Rationale for Cash Grants in South Sudan
1.        A Youth Business Startup Program offers new opportunities for selected youth beneficiaries in
South Sudan accompanied by an impact evaluation. The program offers a local currency equivalent grant
of USD 1,000 to about 1,200 youth (60 percent women). Beneficiaries participate in a 1-week long training
for life- and business-skills before they obtain access to the grant in a commercial bank account. The grant
is unconditional and – while aimed towards (self-) employment and skill upgrading – can be used for any
expenditures at the discretion of the beneficiary. The program is evaluated by an impact evaluation
utilizing an over-subscription design where beneficiaries and control group are randomly selected among
eligible applicants.

2.       This report derives the rationale for the intervention, narrates the implementation and
describes results from the baseline survey. The program is specifically designed to create desperately
needed opportunities for the youth in the fragile context of South Sudan. The call for applications was
made in autumn 2014 attracting more than 6,000 applications. After eligible applicants were determined,
beneficiaries and the control group were randomly selected in late 2014. In spring 2015, all beneficiaries
and the control group were visited by enumerators to conduct interviews – before respondents knew
whether they will receive the grant. The training for beneficiaries was conducted in April and May 2015
while the grants will be disbursed in June and July 2015. The first follow-up survey is due in early 2016,
which will allow to assess the immediate impact of the intervention. Additional surveys are planned in
yearly intervals.

3.      The first part of the report motivates the program of a business startup grant in South Sudan.
South Sudan is an extremely fragile country with active conflict in parts of the country. The first section
describes the fragility of South Sudan in detail with a focus on its negative impact on ability of the private
sector to provide jobs for the youth in South Sudan. The second section takes a closer look at the youth
in South Sudan utilizing the latest data from the High Frequency Survey in South Sudan (2015). The fragility
and the desperate situation of the youth in South Sudan demand a social protection approach to create
‘good’ work for the youth. The third section argues that a business startup grant for the youth can provide
such opportunities at large scale. After the second part of the report reviews evidence for this claim, the
third part presents details of the program implementation and provides a profile of the applicants and –
in more detail – of the beneficiaries. A second volume of this report is envisioned for 2016 to present the
results of the impact evaluation aiming to provide evidence of the success of such programs in fragile
countries like South Sudan.

1.1     Fragility in South Sudan

1.1.1    Background

4.       As a new nation, South Sudan has the dual challenge of dealing with the legacy of over 50 years
of conflict and continued instability, as well as huge development deficits. The country has some of the
lowest human development indicators in the world, continuing violence and instability, and minimal levels
of infrastructure development. Formal institutions are being built from a very low base and the capacity



                                                      8
                                                                        South Sudan: Youth Startup Business Grant Program – Volume I



of government to formulate policy and implement programs is limited, but growing. South Sudan also has
oil resources, which if used effectively, could support progress in development.

5.      Nonetheless, the December 2013 conflict and the protracted humanitarian crisis have eroded
development gains from independence. Over ten thousand people have died, nearly 2 million people
have been displaced. Some 120,000 civilians are still sheltered in over-burdened UN peacekeeping bases.
The cost of conflict falls disproportionately on women and children.1 Humanitarian agencies warn that
around 2.5 million people currently face ‘crisis’ or ‘emergency’ levels of food insecurity. An additional 3.5
million people are in ‘stress’ status, making South Sudan one of the most food insecure countries in the
world.2

6.       Continued efforts at negotiating a peace treaty by the Intergovernmental Authority on
Development (IGAD) in Ethiopia, have been largely unsuccessful. For example, agreements on cessation
of violence have been routinely violated by both the government and the rebels within days of signing.
Some progress has been achieved in resolving internal differences within the Sudan People’s Liberation
Movement (SPLM)3: one of the main causes of the conflict. However, little progress has been achieved in
terms of agreeing on a peace deal as dialogue has stalled on power sharing arrangements within a
transitional government of unity.4 In an effort to move forward the peace negotiations, IGAD has put in
place an expanded mediation mechanism5 and has prepared a draft proposal for a final peace agreement.
As of the date of this report, the new mechanism has yet to demonstrate tangible results.

7.      The current crisis in South Sudan represents a failure in both nation and state building. It is being
driven by the following five issues: a) failure to share power and extend the political space; b) absence of
security sector reform and citizen security; c) failure of rule of law and national reconciliation efforts; d)
pervasive governance and development deficits; and e) economic mismanagement and deteriorating
population welfare.

8.       The most immediate cause of the conflict was a political dispute that spiraled out of control.
However, at its heart, the conflict is driven primarily by a failure to share power and extend the elite pact
to an “inclusive enough”6 coalition. Specifically, the SPLM was incapable of managing the brewing power
struggles between President Salva Kiir and the former Vice President Riek Machar in a democratic and

3 A parallel process was undertaken in Arusha Arusha to resolve internal differences within the SPLM resulted in a unification
plan agreed by all major stakeholders in January 2015.
4 The opposition has steadfastly refused to sign the Protocol on Agreed Principles on Transitional Arrangements, arguing that the

formation of a transitional government should be negotiated by the warring parties and not dictated by regional powers.
5 This would include, in addition to the IGAD countries, the African Union, UN, EU, Troika and China, and possibly South Africa

and Tanzania.
6 Coalitions are “inclusive enough” when they involve the parties necessary to restore confidence and transform institutions and

help create continued momentum for positive change; and when there is local legitimacy for excluding some groups—for example
because of electoral gains, or because groups or individuals have been involved in abuses. See World Bank 2011.

peaceful manner. One of the reasons being that it had not yet transformed into a sufficiently developed
political party with established and respected rules and procedures.

9.       After independence, the leadership largely prioritized consolidating support within the SPLM
and the government. As such, the leadership failed to accommodate diverse demands for inclusion
emerging from peripheral groups and areas outside of Juba. Similarly, the Transitional Constitution fails
to accommodate these demands, as it tends to concentrate power in the central government and the
executive. Traditional authorities, while formally recognized, have been increasingly marginalized both in
terms of power and respect. The development and promulgation of the permanent constitution, in which
the public has had very little or no contribution, has also stalled. Past elections for the presidency,
legislative assembly, governorships, and state assemblies which could have served as a mechanism for
expanding the political space, also failed to do so by perpetuating the dominance of the SPLM.7

10.     Furthermore, once a power struggle began within the SPLM, it spilled over onto the army, which
could not withstand the political pressure. Lack of security sector reforms (SSR) and incomplete
disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) efforts in South Sudan have meant that the Sudan
People’s Liberation Army (SPLA) remained a collection of localized militias led by an ethnic coterie of
generals,8 and lacked discipline, an esprit de corps, and a centralized command structure. Instead, loyalty
is dependent on personal ties to commanders and payouts. As such, once the political crisis spilled over
onto the military, it was unable to withstand the pressures of political power struggles, and broke up along
the ethnic lines upon which it was constituted.

11.     A lack of DDR efforts and a proliferation of small arms continues to militarize the population.
Since independence, budget constraints and disagreement between the government and donors over the
objectives and modalities of DDR in South Sudan have brought DDR planning to a halt.9 Meanwhile, the
SPLA has grown in size at a rate that has outpaced its very modest DDR caseloads. As of early 2012, about
327,000 small arms were in circulation among known state and non-state actors.10 New shipments of
millions of dollars of arms to both the government and the rebels, as well as the use of child soldiers, will
make DDR even more difficult in the future. This has had particular implications for the pastoralist
communities, which are routinely involved in cattle raiding.11

12.    A cycle of violence has become the norm for addressing grievances in the absence of meaningful
national reconciliation and effective rule of law. Although the recent conflict has been characterized by

7 During the candidate selection process, many accused the SPLM of handpicking parliamentary and gubernatorial candidates. As such, formal
political pluralism remains limited, as SPLM holds between 77 and 100 percent of seats in the national and state assemblies. Women’s
participation similarly remains restricted – in 2011, women held only 23 of 132 state minister posts, 1 of 10 Governor positions, and 1 of 82
Country Commissioner posts. See Republic of South Sudan 2012.

11 While cattle raiding in South Sudan have been a source of communal violence for decades, the recent crisis is concealing, and at times

promoting, smaller, localized conflicts over cows. Since the conflict, cattle herders in peaceful areas are buying easily accessible guns due to fears
that violence will spread to their homes. Others are exploiting the insecurity to settle old scores and steal millions of dollars worth of cows.

many as an ethnic conflict, there is in fact nothing inevitable about the recent inter-ethnic violence. In
reality, different ethnic groups have long history of co-existing peacefully and prosperously. Moreover,
the sources of discontent within the SPLM were not ethnically based. However, the absence of meaningful
reconciliation at the national level, and effective rule of law at the community and individual levels have
allowed traditional grievances between individuals and communities to fester, resulting in a lack of trust
and social cohesion. Against this backdrop, spoilers of war have found it easy to deliberately manipulate
ethnic identities for political gains. The situation has been exacerbated by a Government crackdown on
civil society and media since the conflict, which has shrunk the public space for open discourse, thereby
further weakening social cohesion and peaceful conflict resolution mechanisms.

13.      Lack of access to basic social services, coupled with gross mismanagement of public, has
resulted in widespread frustration among the population. Declining effectiveness in service delivery is
directly linked to low levels of government expenditure in the social sector. The shutdown in oil
production and border closure with Sudan in 2012 led to sharp decline in government income, as oil
revenues constituted 82 percent of South Sudan’s GDP and 98 percent of the public income. While fiscal
reforms following the oil shutdown led to improvements in non-oil revenue collection,12 it still remained
insufficient to cover requisite government expenses. During this period, priority was given to the security
sector over service delivery, such that only 10 percent of the oil revenue went to infrastructure and 7
percent to education, while 38 percent was spent on military and security services.13 And although
transfers to states and local governments improved slightly from 26 percent in 2012 to 28 percent in 2013,
76 percent of the transfer were for recurrent costs and wages, leaving a meager 24 percent of transfers
to fund development programs.14

14.      Limited institutional and human capacity of the civil service has also hampered effective
delivery of services across the country, which is roughly the size of France. While there were some
improvements in the years following the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, basic infrastructure remains
highly inadequate as South Sudan has only 300 km (186 miles) of paved roads and most of the country is
linked by dirt tracks, which are impassable during the summer rain season. Furthermore, limited delivery
capacity has meant that the population at large, 83 percent of which lives in rural areas, remains cut off
from access to social services.15 Sentiments of marginalization have been further exacerbated by the
incomplete decentralization, which is perceived to benefit specific groups over others,16 as well as
widespread corruption and a lack of accountability of the ruling elite.

15.     In addition to the on-going conflict, a looming macroeconomic crisis threatens to further
destabilize the country. It is estimated that the recent conflict cost the country at least 15 percent of its
potential GDP in FY14 due to lower oil production, displacement of people, loss of assets and livelihoods

opportunities, especially in agriculture, and destruction of market infrastructure. Moreover, due to the
declining global oil prices, real GDP is expected to drop by 8 percent in FY 2014-15. This, coupled with a
lack of expenditure control, could potentially result in a fiscal deficit of 4.5 billion South Sudanese Pounds
(SSP), equivalent to USD 1.5 billion or 10 percent of GDP.17 With no significant fiscal reserves, and limited
ability to access international borrowing, a high fiscal deficit will be hard to finance.

16.      Declining oil prices, and commensurate reduced government revenue, is deteriorating overall
wellbeing of the population. It is putting pressure on government capacity to deliver services and finance
recurrent expenditures such as salary payments. Of particular concern is the inability or delayed salary
payments of the security sector, whose wage bill constitutes nearly 70 percent of the total wage bill. Lower
oil prices also create a large deficit in the external accounts, putting food security at risk, as the country is
dependent on imports to meet its food security needs. To date, the Government has opted to finance the
deficit by borrowing from the Central Bank leading to a surge in inflation.18

17.      High levels of poverty, income inequality, and lack of employment opportunities, particularly
for the youth, continue to hamper growth and shared prosperity. Lack of viable employment
opportunities in productive sectors due to poor absorptive capacity of the economy, including in an
underdeveloped agricultural sector, make it difficult for many to improve their economic wellbeing.
Moreover, it is estimated that the on-going conflict have resulted in some 700,000 additional poor people
living in considerably deeper poverty conditions.19 Additionally, the current drop in oil prices could push
over 300,000 more people into poverty. The impact will be disproportionately larger on urban poverty
given that the urban population is more directly connected to market economy and trade. In addition to
the increase in poverty, about 42 percent of the population will be subject to consumption losses of at
least 10 percent.20 Displaced people will be particularly hit hard as their wealth has been greatly reduced
due to loss of property and access to land.


1.1.2      Private Sector Employment and the Impact of Fragility

18.      High dependence on oil revenues has resulted in little diversification of the economy. The oil
sector generates most of the country’s national income but employs relatively few people. Estimates of
employment in the oil sector vary from 30,000 to 50,000, which represents approximately 1 percent of
South Sudan’s labor force, while oil revenues contribute approximately 60 percent to GDP.21 Lack of
diversification of the economy has meant that there are few opportunities and niches for private sector
growth.22 It has also resulted in great burden on the highly underdeveloped non-oil private sector to
generate the overwhelming majority of jobs, which it is ill equipped to do in the near term.

19.      Poor economic governance has also adversely affected private sector growth and created
market instabilities. Currently, there is a dual exchange rate system in South Sudan with a fixed official
rate, which is kept artificially appreciated, and a depreciated parallel market rate, which reflects more
accurately the value of the South Sudanese Pound (SSP). Preferential access to the official exchange rate
distorts competition and favors businesses with close government relationships. The uncertainty about
access to foreign exchange at the official rate and large volatility of the parallel market exchange rate –
especially in recent months – hamper investments reducing growth prospects in South Sudan.

20.     Limited infrastructure in terms of roads network and value chain linkages, as well as on-going
insecurity, continue to depress economic activities especially trade. Even before the conflict, transport
and transit costs were relatively high in South Sudan given that it is a landlocked country with very poor
road conditions. As a result of the conflict and ensuing insecurity, transport and transit costs have
worsened significantly, particularly in the conflict-affected states. In fact, continued violence is
discouraging the South Sudanese from becoming productive citizens, as economic rewards remain highly
uncertain with continued insecurity. For example, farmers are unlikely to invest in (surplus) production
given the risk of looting by armed forces, malfunctioning (or missing) markets, and insecurity and crime
affecting the main trade routes. Rather, the on-going violence perpetuates dependency on humanitarian
aid, and is further undermining local trade and economic activities.

21.      An infant financial market restricts access to credit further weakening investment. The lack of
appropriate collateral as well as corresponding institutions like land registries inhibit a functioning credit
market. Even when credit is available, it is prohibitively expensive due to the high risk associated with
doing business. In order to operate in this environment, firms must absorb both high fixed costs, such as
infrastructure and overhead, and high variable costs, such as licensing and inputs, limiting their ability to
expand and create jobs.

22.     Low investment and labor market rigidities impede job creation. South Sudan’s labor regulations
are in transition, and therefore, are subject to frequent discretionary decisions. Termination of
employment for national workers is quite difficult as it requires the prior approval by the Ministry of Labor,
Public Service and Human Resource Development. Accordingly, firms reconsider before hiring nationals;
while national workers have lower performance incentives with such a high barrier to be fired.

23.      The current generation born into war often became reliant on humanitarian aid, and has had
hardly any opportunities to invest in its future in terms of skills and work experience. Consequently,
levels of literacy are low; education limited and work experience often non-existent. Such low levels of
human capital create challenges for companies to hire adequately skilled South Sudanese, especially given
the inflexible labor regulations, as detailed above.


1.2     Youth in South Sudan

1.2.1    Demographic Characteristics


24.     A profile of the youth in South Sudan is extracted from the High Frequency Survey (2015) in
South Sudan. Most demographics and socio-economic indicators for South Sudan are based on the
National Budget Household Survey 2009. With South Sudan being exposed to multiple shocks since then,
demographics and socio-economic characteristics have changed much. This section utilizes the latest data
available for South Sudan collected in 2015 by the High Frequency Survey – a World Bank led project
implemented by South Sudan’s National Bureau of Statistics (Box 1).23
Box 1: South Sudan’s High Frequency Survey

 In fragile and conflict-affected states (FCS), “stresses” originating from social, economic, political and
 security dynamics can quickly compromise stability, throw countries back into conflict and reverse
 development progress (World Bank, 2011). Growing dissatisfaction with economic welfare at the
 household level as well as other socio-economic indicators can indicate destabilizing pressures in a

 country. In such contexts, it is vital to monitor and detect potential “stresses” by closely tracking key
 indicators reflecting economic, social, and security conditions.
 The High Frequency Survey in South Sudan is an effort to monitor demographics, socio-economic
 indicators and perception data of the population in South Sudan to provide evidence for policy
 decisions, inform development project design and alert stakeholders in the case of emerging new
 stresses. The design of the High Frequency Survey is informed by a two-year pilot in South Sudan.24 The
 survey uses tablets to collect data in face-to-face interviews.25 Given the fragile environment, advanced
 techniques are used for designing, monitoring and analyzing the data.26 The sample includes urban and
 rural areas and is representative at the state level for the six states, which are least affected by violence:
 Eastern Equatoria, Central Equatoria, Western Equatoria, Northern Bahr El Ghazal, Western Bahr El
 Ghazal and Lakes. The questionnaire includes a rapid consumption module27 to allow estimating
 poverty numbers, which will be available in the second half of 2015.


25.      Almost 35 percent of South Sudan’s population is between 15 – 35 years of age, which is defined
as youth. South Sudan’s population is young. More than half of the nation’s population is below 15 years
of age, almost 35 percent are between 15 and 35 and only 15 percent are above 35 (Graph 1).

26.      South Sudan’s young population is mainly rural. In addition, South Sudan’s youth has a slightly
skewed gender ratio towards a larger number of women (Figure 2). Among the youth, more than two-
thirds are between 15 and 25 years of age.

27.     The gender distribution is further uniform among different categories of youth. Across
categories such as area and age groups within the young population, there is a fairly even balance among
the male and female population (Graph 2).

1.2.2   Education

28.     Literacy levels among the youth are higher than the population as a whole. The literacy rate for
youth in South Sudan is 59 percent, compared to overall literacy rate of 48 percent. Although this is much
lower than the world’s average literacy rate, there is a positive trend of higher reading or writing
proficiency among the young population in South Sudan; indicating that past improvements in education
are working to a certain extent.

29.    Young women and youth in rural areas have comparably lower literacy rates. The majority of
young men is literate (69 percent) while only a minority of women can read or write (39 percent). Similarly,
more than half of the rural youth is illiterate, while approximately three-quarters of urban youth can at

least read or write. Among the young population, those between the ages of 15 – 20 years are more likely
to have either reading or writing proficiency than those older than 20 years (Graph 3).

30.      Current education enrollment does not close the gender gap in education for young women.
Across primary, intermediate, secondary and university levels of education, women have a low current
enrollment ratio of 20 percentage compared to young men with almost 40 percent. Past education
enrollment shows a similar gender gap with only 40 percent of young women having ever attended
education relative to almost 70 percent of young men. Thus, the alarmingly high gender gap in education
from the past is not closed with current education attendance and policies. Similarly, youth living in rural
areas is disadvantaged in access to education where only 25 percent compared to 40 percent of urban
youth is currently enrolled in education (Graph 4).

31.    Also the level of education shows a significant gender gap; generally university education is
extremely low. More than half of young women do not finish any formal education in contrast to less

than 25 percent of young men. Even if young women finish a formal education degree, it is most likely to
be only primary or intermediate education. Exactly the same pattern can be observed for education in
rural and urban areas. In general, less than 5 percent of the youth have obtained a university degree, and
the numbers are very low even in the higher age groups of 26 – 30 years and 31 – 35 years (Graph 5).

1.2.3   Employment

32.      Almost 30 percent of the youth identified themselves as currently inactive. The levels of
inactivity are consistent across all categories of youth (Graph 6), irrespective of their gender, area of
residence, or level of education. More alarmingly, the level of inactivity is uniform among the university
population, as well as among the urban population, which are categories with better access to
opportunities. We define inactive as those who were not engaged in any economic activity over the past
12 months, are currently not enrolled in any educational activity, and are not looking for a job either.

33.     Higher proportion of women, residents of rural areas, and those with no education identified
themselves as currently inactive. While women often face social restrictions from actively seeking
employment opportunities, the seasonal nature of agriculture and dependence on business cycles are
prime reasons for labor inactivity in the rural areas. Among those currently pursuing education, most of
them take some form of employment activity in parallel. This trend is consistent across all categories,
irrespective of gender, area of residence or level of education (Graph 7). Although comparatively healthy
employment levels were reported for women as well of those in rural areas, there might be difference in
the types of employment. Similarly, rural areas reported better levels of exclusively employment only, but
the nature of employment between urban and rural areas is different.

34.     Among those who reported themselves as employed, activities such as farming, hunting and
fishing were major modes of employment. More than 50 percent of the employed youth work as farmers,
hunters and fishermen. About further 21 percent operate some form of non-farm business. Salaried labor
forms a mere 11 percent of the overall employed labor force. Proportion of salaried people is higher
among those with secondary or university education. Most of the urban youth operate some kind of non-
farm business.

35.      The labor force of South Sudan is primarily ill equipped for most formal sector employment
activities. Only 3 percent of the overall youth workforce identifies themselves as employed in professional
or managerial services, or can work as technicians. A further 5 percent comprises of those working in
support services such as clerical jobs. Among women and those living in rural areas, more than half of the
young population has no form of main occupation.

 36.   The youth lives in over-crowded dwellings. The majority lives in dwellings with 2 to 4
 household members per room. Less than one third of households have less than 2 household
 members per room. Over-crowding is slightly more enhanced in rural areas (Graph 10).

 37.     Most households with youth access drinking water from open sources such as wells,
 ponds, and rivers. Only a minority of households purchases drinking water (Graph 11). Almost no
 households at all use filtered water. Apparently, open water is abundant in South Sudan; the time
 spent in procuring drinking water is less than 30 minutes for about 80 percent of the young
 population (Graph 12). Thus, only a limited amount of time is spent on accessing water; but the
 quality of the water is likely to be low.

 38.     Only 6 percent of the youth have access to electricity, whether public or private. In rural areas,
 most households use firewood or grass for lighting purposes, while torches are more often used in urban
 areas (Graph 13). Cooking is predominantly done by firewood in rural and charcoal in urban areas (Graph

39.     Accessibility to markets, hospitals and schools is comparatively better in urban areas. Schools
can be accessed within 30 minutes for about 80 percent and 55 percent of the urban respectively rural
youth. Access to markets is better in urban areas where 65 percent of the youth needs less than 30
minutes to reach a market compared to 40 percent of rural youth. Hospitals can be accessed under 30
minutes by 50 percent and 45 percent of the urban respectively rural youth. Thus, a large urban / rural
gap exists for market and school access while hospitals are usually further away with – surprisingly – a
smaller urban / rural gap (Graph 15).

1.3      Rationale for Focusing on Youth Employment

1.3.1      Status of Social Safety Nets in South Sudan

40.     Given the repeated shocks that affected South Sudan and the chronic vulnerability of the
population, social safety nets (SSNs) programs can play a key role in improving resilience. Non-
contributory social safety nets programs provide a bridge between short-term humanitarian activities and


                                                              22
                                                             South Sudan: Youth Startup Business Grant Program – Volume I



more sustainable, longer-term development efforts, while also addressing fragility and stability concerns.
Well targeted SSNs in South Sudan has the potential to provide short-term alternative employment to
frustrated, unemployed youth and help to smooth their consumption gaps. Such programs could also help
to gradually redress the balance for historically marginalized segments of the population.

41.      The Government’s vision on social protection is detailed in the National Social Protection Policy
Framework. The overall goal of the Framework is to ‘respond to and address the multiple vulnerabilities
faced by South Sudanese citizens, with a particular focus on the poorest and most excluded sectors’ (GoSS
2015). The framework identifies the following six objectives: (i) inclusive social protection: ensuring access
to basic social services for all; (ii) protective environments for children; (iii) strengthened linkages among
social protection, economic development and sustainable livelihoods; (iv) improved livelihoods for
women; (v) a systems approach to social protection; and (vi) progressive realization of coverage.

42.      Unfortunately, government capacity remains limited for delivering on its social protection
objectives. This is particularly true in terms of providing temporary jobs and support for income
generating opportunities by enabling private sector growth. Specifically, there is a lack of infrastructure
and resources for government agencies responsible for advancing SSNs administrative capacity at the
central and local levels. Programs are dispersed across categories and states, and do not exist at a
significant scale or as longer term interventions. There is no viable strategic planning in place, no robust
mechanisms ensuring adequacy of benefits, and no clear budgeting procedures. Capacity constraints also
limit the depth of program evaluation.

43.     Consequently, social safety nets spending in South Sudan has been traditionally financed by
donors, with heavy focus on emergency food aid. For example, food transfers, including emergency
distribution, school feeding, and food-for-work programs led primarily by World Food Programme,
accounted for approximately 98 percent of total SSNs expenditures and 70 percent of SSN beneficiaries,
a proportion that has increased since the outbreak of hostilities in December 2013. School feeding
represents an additional 14 percent of beneficiaries. Cash for work and food for work interventions
provide assistance to 15 percent of beneficiaries. In contrast, unconditional cash transfers constituted
merely 0.3 percent of total beneficiaries (Borgarello and Figazzolo 2013, Figure 4).

                                Figure 3: Spending on Social Safety Nets in South Sudan




44.      However, the coverage of existing SSNs across the country remains unbalanced and benefits
largely rural areas. Prior to the conflict, the average population covered in each of the 10 states was 57.2
percent with significant disparity across states. Northern and Western Bahr El Ghazal were the most
covered states, while Central Equatoria had the lowest coverage. Some states, such as Jonglei and Upper
Nile, with a high share of moderately or severely food insecure population were also comparatively less
reached by programs (Borgarello and Figazzolo 2013).28 In addition, almost all SSN interventions in South
Sudan focus on rural areas, even though there exist very vulnerable groups in urban areas as well (e.g.,
underemployed, unskilled young adults).

45.     Given these challenges, and particularly the lack of focus on vulnerable youth and unconditional
cash transfers, the World Bank implements a youth startup business grant program. The program offers
youth a business startup grants in the value of USD 1,000 per beneficiary to promote entrepreneurship
and income generating activities among young South Sudanese (Box 2).

Box 2: Youth Startup Business Grant Program

 The program disburses 1,000 USD (in local currency) preceded by a business and life skill training to
 eligible beneficiaries. The program and its implementation is described in more detail in part 3 of this
 report.

 The evaluation is based on an over-subscription design where eligible applicants are randomly chosen
 to receive the grant and the training. Non-selected applicants are chosen for the control group. All of
 the beneficiaries and the control group were subject to a baseline survey to measure their incomes,
 expenditures, education, employment as well as other indicators including health, conflict, and shocks.
 Preliminary results from the baseline survey are reported in part 3 of this report. After the baseline

 survey, beneficiaries received notification whether they are among the beneficiaries and – if so – were
 invited for trainings across the six states as a precondition to receive the grant. The grant will be
 disbursed into their personal bank accounts – an innovative approach to support beneficiaries to build
 relationships with financial institutions. The aim includes making the beneficiaries more bankable in
 the future, and thereby increasing their access to finances. After one year (expected early 2016),
 beneficiaries and the control group will be revisited with a follow-up survey to measure differences in
 the change of income, expenditures and other indicators. This will allow attributing changes in these
 indicators to the intervention of the training and the grant. In addition, the long-term effect of the
 training will be measured as well. More details about the evaluation are included in part 3.


1.3.2    Need for Viable and Productive Youth Employment

46.      In the current context of deepened economic and social vulnerabilities, viable and productive
employment, particularly for the youth, becomes critical in mitigating the various shocks. The on-going
internal conflict, as well as the drop in oil price, presents a significant constraint to sustainable livelihood
recovery. For one, loss of assets resulting from conflict related displacement and destruction have
deepened economic and social vulnerabilities, particularly in the conflict-affected states.29 Displaced
households have tried to alleviate the negative impact by employing various coping strategies, along with
depending on humanitarian aid.30 Similarly, the drop in oil price will translate to consumption losses of at
least 10 percent for almost half the population (42 percent),31 having pronounced effects on the
livelihoods of the population of South Sudan. The youth, as a large share of the population, are of
particular concern, especially given that they are the future of the country.

47.      Job creation by the private sector is limited and unlikely to be able to offer opportunities to
many youth. As discussed previously, investment by the private sector is severely limited in the general
context of South Sudan – due to macroeconomic volatility and governance failure – and especially
pessimistic in the current context of an active conflict in the country. Thus, the private sector will not be
able to create new jobs and offer income, learning and experience to the many youth in South Sudan.

48.      The youth also merit special attention in the absence of meaningful access to economic
opportunities, as they are feared to become a constant destabilizing force. In particular, the presence of
a large number of idle and frustrated young males is perceived to be more vulnerable to being recruited
by fighting forces, as they represent an abundant supply of rebel labor, and can anticipate greater
potential gain as well as lower opportunity cost of engaging in violence in the context of few economic
opportunities (Collier 2000, Urdal 2004). They are also more likely to turn to criminal activities out of
desperation in order to survive. However, focus on young males should not eclipse specifically targeting


29 The impact is strongly concentrated on states with military clashes with an average expenditure loss of 58% compared to 13%
in the remaining states. See World Bank Food Security Note.
30 Coping strategies depend on the type of displacement settlement but always include daily labor, small business activities as

well as selling livestock and fishing.

young women given the high levels of socioeconomic barriers (especially access to education) for
employment faced by young women in South Sudan (Box 3).

Box 3: Barriers to Women’s Employment in South Sudan

 Barriers to women’s participation in income generating activities are significant and include both
 development disadvantages and social and cultural norms. Heavy domestic burden with insufficient
 options for childcare and support, illiteracy and a lack of formal education, and insufficient
 opportunities for technical training and business skills development all impede women from becoming
 competitive in the labor force. Similarly, social and cultural norms hinder women’s access to finance,
 land, and inputs such as seeds and tools necessary for sustainable and productive livelihood. For
 example, while the Land Act explicitly articulates women’s rights to own and inherit land, issues related
 to inheritance, acquisition and ownership of land are most commonly referred to customary courts,
 which often uphold entrenched patriarchal norms that ultimately disfavor women. Lack of access to
 land can also impact access to financial services since land often serves as collateral for micro-lending.

49.      In improving access to employment by the youth, it is also important to focus on the type of
jobs rather than only the lack of jobs. Research finds that it is often the experience of work,32 interacting
with various dynamics such as structural exclusions and lack of social integration, among other factors,
which leads to frustration and disillusionment, and in extreme cases, engagement in violence. For
example, in Ecuador and Colombia, young members of gangs and the rebel armed group stated that by
joining their respective groups, they found economic opportunities, as well as status, respect, excitement,
support, trust, and cohesion – all of which the local economy and their families did not provide.33 In South
Sudan, the experience of work can be especially pernicious as many of the South Sudanese youth lack the
means, skills, knowledge, or connection to be engaged in productive employment. Instead, they are more
likely to get stuck in low quality jobs, often in the informal sector.

50.     Therefore, it will be important in the long term to go beyond solely providing consistent work
and income opportunities to the youth, to also providing ‘good’ work, which can offer a fundamental
source of self-respect and social identity. The empirical results related to unemployment, trust, and civic
engagement imply that losing work means more than losing income. It can undermine feelings of self-
worth and strain family and social relationships, as well as break down economic and social ties, breed
mistrust, and damage people’s sense of community and hope for the future.34 As such, work can connect
people with others through networks, and can be a place to encounter new ideas and information, and
interact with people of different backgrounds and ethnicities.


32 Employment characterized by demeaning and monotonous tasks, with little prospect of promotion or skills development, in
conditions that are often openly exploitative and coercive, and for piteously little remuneration.
33 Similarly, in the United States, gangs provided the youth with income, respect, and social ties that they were unable to find in

jobs in cities such as Chicago and New York that had lost stable, unionized manufacturing jobs.
34 A 2001 study of multiethnic cities in India posits that economic networks and interdependence, including through jobs, can

reduce the incentives for violence between communities. Cities with more interlinked economic relations were less likely to
witness communal and ethnic violence, while riots were more frequent in cities with fewer economic ties. See World
Development Report 2013.

51.      A Business StartUp grant aims to provide the initial trigger to allow youth engaging in ‘good’
work. Access to credit but also the absence of a starting point to give youth the ability to shape their own
youth is aimed to be mitigated by the business startup grant program. A meaningful use of the grant can
lead to ‘good’ work that is inclusive and empowering with the ability to build agency, provide access to
voice, and offer social status, respect and cohesion. Ideally, this will also contribute to creating economic
and social ties and building incentives to work across boundaries and resolve conflict. Such jobs can create
economic and social ties and have the potential to build incentives to work across boundaries and resolve
conflict. The next part reviews current evidence for cash grant programs and proposes nudges to increase
the likelihood of success.


2 PART II: Cash Grants
52.      The second part of the report reviews evidence for cash grant programs. The first part of the
report concluded the need for a social protection program in South Sudan specifically for the youth. In
this part, the first section will provide evidence that a cash grant program can indeed offer the needed
work opportunities for the youth. However, no cash grant program has ever been implemented in an
extremely fragile country were parts of the country are subject to active conflict. The impact evaluation
of the youth startup business grant program in South Sudan aims to close this gap. The second section of
this part reviews the literature how the intervention of a cash grant can be rendered more successfully by
nudges. The nudges under investigation are text message reminders to increase commitment of
beneficiaries to put the cash grant at productive use.

2.1     Evidence for Cash Grant Programs

2.1.1    History and experiences of giving microenterprise grants in developing countries

53.      The first motivation behind providing microenterprise grants in developing countries is that
potential recipients would like to access credit but are credit constrained. Specifically, the recipients do
not have access to credit at a borrowing rate that is lower than their expected rate of return to capital,
limiting their ability to invest. Responding to this constraint, grants allow the recipients to obtain credit at
zero cost. While opening up investment opportunities, however, the effectiveness of grants requires that
the recipients intend to use them to make investments rather than consumption or debt repayments.
Furthermore, these investments should have net positive economic rates of return. That is, the recipients
use the grants to make investments that provide a greater rate of return than the cost of providing these
grants to them. Otherwise, the resources used to finance these grants may be better used elsewhere.

54.     The second important reason for providing grants is the insurance that comes with grants rather
than loans. Assuming that potential recipients have a demand for credit and some degree of risk adversity,
grants, because of their zero-cost nature, will encourage higher risk but higher return investments than
loans would. This is important from a welfare perspective as such higher return investments will have
greater income effects and thus greater potential for reducing poverty. However, by eliminating the
financial repayment risk faced by the recipients, grants introduce the possibility of moral hazard. For


                                                      27
                                                            South Sudan: Youth Startup Business Grant Program – Volume I



example, the recipients may take on investments that are too risky relative to their potential return, since
the risk of not being able to cover repayment is not internalized by the recipients.

55.      Evidence of the effectiveness of in-kind transfers and microenterprise grants has been found in
several developing countries. Notable examples include programs in Ghana, Sri Lanka and Mexico when
transfers were made to established business owners and farmers. In Sri Lanka, De Mel, McKenzie and
Woodruff find that cash transfers of about $100-200 to micro-entrepreneurs in retail and manufacturing
led to an over 60% annual return through increased business profits (De Mel, 2012). These results were
maintained for two years for women and up to five years for men, with no clear differences between
whether transfers were made in-cash or in-kind. In Ghana, Fafchamps, McKenzie, Quinn and Woodruff
(2014) find that in-kind transfers have a strong impact on the profits of urban entrepreneurs, but that this
impact is much weaker when transfers are made in cash. A one-time grant of 150 Ghanaian cedis (about
$120) led to a monthly increase in profits of about 37-39 cedis (about $30), if the transfer was given in-
kind, while only an increase of about 10-14 cedis (about $10), if the transfer was given in-cash. Given that
the in-kind transfers were selected by the program recipients, who went with the research assistants to
pick out the specific items for their transfer, the weaker impact of cash cannot be due to a lack of
knowledge or understanding on the returns to different investments. Instead, the authors suggest that it
is due to a lack of self-control, as empirically they find that the cash grants tended to be spent on
household consumption or transferred out of the household. This outcome was particularly significant
among women running subsistence business, where the cash grants had no measurable impact on profits.
In Mexico, male urban micro-entrepreneurs running small retail firms, with less than $1,000 in capital
stock, were also offered cash and in-kind grants of about $140, in another study by McKenzie and
Woodruff (2008). Here they estimate the rate of return to capital to be around 28-46% per month over 3-
12 months and do not find a significant difference when grants were given in-kind or in cash. Together
these studies show that while there may be variability in returns dependent on whether the transfers are
made in-kind or as cash, the opportunities for high return investments is good, particularly among men.

56.     While these studies show that high returns to capital exist among existing business owners and
men, they do not shed light on the impact of transfers on to the poorest members of the population
such as the unemployed or youth. Nor do they provide evidence on whether cash transfers are able to
create employment opportunities, rather than increase the earnings of already economically active
individuals. That is, they do not address whether transfers lead to growth at the extensive margin of
employment, as well as at the intensive margin of employment.

57.      Evidence from programs to the poorest is ambiguous. In part this is due to the small number of
studies that focus on giving grants targeted to these individuals for employment creation. While there is
a large literature studying the impact of conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs on the human capital
acquisition of children with the hope that these cash transfers will simultaneously stimulate new
enterprise (Fizbein et al., 2009; Karlan & Morduch, 2009), few studies have evaluated the impacts on
enterprise growth.

58.      Two experiments in Nicaragua that examine the impacts of CCTs on enterprise growth find that
cash transfers alone did not increase earnings or non-farm production (Macours, Premand, & Vakis,
2012; Maluccio, 2010). Maluccio studies the Red de Protección Social (RPS) transfers made to the poorest
rural households in Nicaragua and estimates the marginal propensity to consume out of the transfers to
be nearly one, indicating that these cash transfers cannot be expected to lead to long-term increases in
income and consumption. Macours et al. (2012) similarly find that a CCT alone does not lead to increased
earnings or non-farm production among rural households, but does when the CCT is complemented with
an investment grant of $200 aimed at encouraging the households to start a small non-farm agricultural
activity. This intervention was targeted primarily to women and the investment grant was conditional on
submission of a business plan by the recipients, who received technical assistance to develop their
business plan and business skills training.

59.      Whether access to credit is a binding constraint to new enterprise or employment creation can
be found from looking at the impact of microfinance on the activities of the poor and unemployed.
Several experiments show that while microfinance can raise farm investment it has little effect on new
enterprise or earnings (Angelucci, Karlan, & Zinman, 2013; Attanasio, Ausberg, Haas, Fitzsimons, &
Harmgart, 2011; Augsburg, Haas, Harmgart, & Meghir, 2012; Banerjee, Duflo, Glennerster, & Kinna, 2013;
Crépon, Devoto, Duflo, & Pariente, 2011). Of specific interest to the program in South Sudan, Ausburg et
al. (2012) study the impact access to microfinance on Bosnians who would normally be denied access to
credit—due to lack of collateral. They find that while there was no change to profits or household income
and a decrease in school attendance, business activities and self-employment increased. This suggests
that, the lack or low level of business activities is due to limited or lack of access to credit. In other words,
while the effectiveness of microfinance in improving employment and earnings is questionable, it is
evidenced through its effect on business activities that the poor are constrained by lack of access to credit.

60.      Most related to the youth startup business grant study in South Sudan is a youth opportunities
program in northern Uganda that finds high returns to capital among groups of 16-35 year old
entrepreneurs. In that program grants of on average $382 were given out to 16-35 years olds in response
to a call for business plan applications for independent traders (Blattman, Fiala, & Martinez, 2013). The
annual return to capital was 30-39%, but it is important to recognize that this intervention had an in-built
group component, as the youth needed to apply in groups for the business plan. It is possible that this
may have created commitment devices, or screened out applicants uninterested in becoming artisanal
entrepreneurs, and contributed to the high returns to capital that the program obtained.

61.     Another recent study evaluates unconditional cash transfer in Kenya and finds positive impacts
on investments but no impacts on earnings. Haushofer and Shapiro (2013) finds that transfers of up to
$1000 to rural households led to increases in non-land assets, such as roofs, on average by $279, but no
detectable changes in profits, despite positive increases to both revenues and expenditures. Potential
beneficiary households to include in this program were identified through a series of proxy means criteria,
one of which examined the condition and materials of the roof of the households’ dwelling. These results
suggest that expectations about what cash is being given for may have an important impact on how it is
used and ultimately the returns to capital that will be observed.

62.     Evidence for impacts of business grants on enterprise growth between very poor men and
women is mixed. Blattman et al. find in northern Uganda that the capital stocks of male grant-recipients
increased at a faster rate than female recipients by about 50% in the first two years. However, over a 4-
year time horizon these differences evened out with both men and women obtaining about a 50%
increase in capital stocks relative to the control groups (Blattman & Figazzolo, 2013). Similarly, earnings
for women in the treatment group did not increase until the end-line survey four years after the
intervention, when they achieved a 73% increase over the control group. Interestingly, the program had
a much stronger relative impact on women than men, as both the capital stocks and earnings of women
in the control group stagnated following the baseline, while those of men caught up by around 50%. In
the study in Kenya, Haushofer and Shapiro find no difference in the impacts of their $1,000 unconditional
cash transfer on consumption, production or investment decisions between men and women, which they
admit is surprising given the large literature suggesting the household decision-making is not unitary
(Udry, 1996; Duflo & Udry, 2004).35

63.     Blattman, Jamison, Green and Annan (2014) study the impacts of a microenterprise support
program targeted to “ultra-poor” women in rural villages of post-war northern Uganda. The program
was randomized at the village level, but within each village a nonprofit organization selected the 15
poorest people to be potential recipients, resulting in a sample of 86% women. The program
experimented with complementing a grant of $150 (equal to nearly 18 months cash earnings) with five
days of business skills training and ongoing “follow-up visits” to advise grant-recipients, as well as provide
supervision to implement the business plan. The midline results show that after 16 months nonfarm
business activities increased from around 40% to 80%, new enterprises increased by 47%, monthly
earnings by 95%, household consumption by a third, and employment from 15 to 24 hours per week. The
findings are generally comparable between males and female grant-recipients, although men were more
successful at starting new enterprises and increasing employment but saved less. The marginal impacts
of supervision and advice were modest,36 even though implementing this component was the most
expensive part of the program. It led to a small impact on business survival but no impact on incomes.
Encouraging beneficiaries to form groups resulted in increased earnings, tentatively suggesting that social
interactions and support may have helped increase informal finance, idea exchange and cooperative
farming.

64.      Another set of experiments study the effects of giving “ultra-poor” rural dwellers livestock,
skills training, and short-term income support. A four-year study of a BRAC program for Bangladeshi
women finds large increases in self-employment and earnings (Bandiera et al., 2013). However, two- to
three-year studies of similar BRAC programs in Pakistan, Honduras and Ethiopia show little change in


35 This literature shows that household purchases vary dependent on whether males or females make the decision on how
household income should be spend. This demonstrates a fundamental inefficiency in the optimization of the overall
household’s welfare. That the study in Kenya did not find this to be case, is at odds with a significant amount of earlier
evidence, indicating that this recent result should be interpreted with caution.
36 All recipients received both the grant and the basic business skills training and framing, while some also obtained follow-up

visits and advice.

business activities or agricultural production (Goldberg & Salomon, 2013). These programs increase assets
and food security, but effects on production and earnings are mixed. Furthermore, other studies from
South Asia (for example, India and Sri Lanka) have shown limited impacts of cash and business training on
unemployed women (Field, Jayachandran, & Pande, 2010; De Mel et al., 2012). Thus, there is variation in
what these programs can impact (assets and food security to earnings and employment) and the extent
to which these outcomes can be improved, even within the same region. This suggest that the outcomes
of programs can be very sensitive to slight variations in design and the local context, which may be related
to how they are framed to participants.

65.     To summarize these findings, there is evidence for high returns to capital from in-kind transfers
and microenterprise grants to established business owners and farmers. Among non-established
business owners, or the “ultra-poor”, business or investment grants have most success in increasing
earnings, new business activities and employment when they are integrated into programs with basic
business skills training, group components for peer monitoring and/or social learning, and a clear framing
towards using the grants for business development and economic empowerment. There are gender
differences in the effectiveness of some these programs, with women either taking longer to realize
positive impacts or showing no improvements, or having impacts that fade away after two years. The
manner that grants are given also seems to matter more for women than men, with in-kind transfers
being more effective than cash in specific regions. Reasons given are that women may be less able to
control expenditures within the household in specific regions; thus in-kind transfer avoid grants being
spent on non-productive or consumption goods. No study has yet looked at the impact of giving lump sum
transfers for business development of more than $350 per individual, and few studies implement a cash
transfer program in isolation. However, the cost-benefit analysis of existing studies, that highlights the
high costs associated with implementing training and follow-up components, suggests that cash may be
the most cost-effective channel for improving economic outcomes for potential micro-entrepreneurs. This
may be particularly the case in environments when on the ground supervision is very expensive. There is
no evidence for the impact of cash grant programs in extremely fragile countries with active conflict.

2.1.2   Vocational training programs to support micro-entrepreneurs

66.     Few rigorous impact evaluations of technical and vocational education and training programs
have been conducted in Africa, despite the acuteness of youth unemployment and poverty in the
region. In fact only three studies provide counter factual evidence. This is a concern given the costs
associated with these interventions, which can cost up to several thousand dollars per beneficiary. While
there appears to be growing adoption of vocational training in Sub-Saharan Africa, most programs use
only single group pre- and post-outcome measurements if any type of evaluation is carried out at all. Such
single group methods do not causally identify the impacts of the program, since it is not possible to
distinguish between effects of the program and changes in outcomes that would have occurred in the
absence of the program (Duflo, 2004). Thus, this section also includes evidence from low and middle-
income countries in other regions.

67.     Within Sub-Saharan Africa, studies have been carried out in Kenya, Malawi and Uganda. In
Kenya, a large vocational training program is currently being evaluated37, where program recipients obtain
vouchers worth on average $460 to use for either publicly or privately provided vocational training
programs. Thus far limited evidence, using a sub-sample of the full sample, indicates that the program
increased earnings by increasing the wages of wage-earners but not total employment (Hicks, Kremer,
Mbiti, & Miguel, 2013). The study also measures knowledge about the returns to training at baseline and
finds that in general individuals overvalued training, expecting a 60% return while the estimated
Mincerian return is 37%. Women and men were mistaken about the highest earning trades as well. For
example, women (men) expected tailoring (mechanics) to be most lucrative, but the study data showed
hairdressing (tailoring) was more profitable. In Malawi a study on a vocational and entrepreneurial
training program, where unemployed youth were teamed up with trainers for a trade-based
apprenticeship, finds small impacts on men and none on women (Cho, Kalomba, Mobarak, & Orozco,
2013). Through the tracking of dropouts, it finds that young women participation was more expensive due
to family obligation, resulting in relatively worse training experiences and outcomes. In Uganda, a
vocational training program to run small-scale enterprises targeted to girls between the ages of 14-20,
was successful in raising self-employment but not earnings (Bandiera et al., 2012).

68.     Evaluations of vocational training and internship programs in other developing countries report
positive results, but seldom for men. In Colombia there was no effect on men while women’s work and
wages rose following an intensive spell of training with 3 months in the classroom and 3 months on the
job (Attanasio, Kugler, & Meghir, 2011). Both men and women were more likely to hold a formal contract
following the program. In the Dominican Republic, a study on a similar nation-wide program targeting low
income youths (ages 18–29), who had not completed secondary education, with both basic skills and
vocational internships finds that there was no effect on employment and only a modest (10%) impact on
wages (Card, Ibarraran, Regalia, Rosas, & Soares, 2007). In India, there were modest impacts on women’s
work and earnings (Maitran & Mani, 2014).

69.     Group training programs and incentives to encourage adolescents to stay in school can affect
the preferences and skills that drive risky behavior through socialization. Young people often lack
adequate information about what jobs are available and may not understand what behaviors are expected
in a workplace. Programs that offer life-skills training, mentorship and integration into new social
networks, as well as the opportunity to develop a track record of employability, may help strengthen the
labor market outcomes for youth. While, empirical evidence of how interventions can be most effective
towards these goals is sparse in developing countries (Bertrand & Crépon, 2013), some recent work in
Liberia and Sierra Leone, have shown some positive initial results through modified psycho-social
interventions, although the sustainability of these impacts has yet to be demonstrated (Blattman &
Annan, 2015; Betancourt et al., 2010).

70.     Additional to vocational and life-skills training programs, it is useful to look at the effectiveness
of financial literacy and business skills training. Much of the initial literature on the determinants of

37   The full results for this study are expected later in September 2014.


                                                                  32

entrepreneurship and microenterprise development focused on access to credit (see for example the
studies referenced in the preceding section). However, it is plausible that access to credit is not enough
alone, and that one must also be able to discern “good” investments from “bad” ones, as well as
understand how to manage financial flows. Thus, a recent number of papers have argued that business
skills or “managerial capital” are another important driver of productivity and income generation (Bruhn,
Karlan, & Schoar, 2010).

71.     Early research on financial literacy and business skills has found that it has helped with financial
inclusion, but has modest results on actual business outcomes. An initial study incorporated into a
Peruvian lending group for female micro-entrepreneurs experimented with offering thirty to sixty minutes
entrepreneurship training sessions alongside the women’s weekly and monthly banking meetings for a
period of one to two years. While no impact on revenues, profits or employment was found, the study
finds that business knowledge improved and women were more likely to continue borrowing from the
microfinance institution (Karlan & Valdivia, 2011). In El Salvador, a study on a seven-day business-training
workshop focused on developing technical skills and “core entrepreneurial” behaviors for potential
business plan competition applicants, finds an increase in the number of business start-ups or expansions.
The best business plans following the workshop then received between $6,000 – $9,000 and this further
boosted the probability when new businesses were launched (Klinger & Schündeln, 2011). This study,
however, does not report other business outcomes, such as revenues and profits.

72.      Two studies have focused on business skill development for youth. One study is among
undergraduate students in Tunisia (Premand et al., 2012) and the other in Bosnia and Herzegovina with
young microloan borrowers (Bruhn & Zia, 2013). In Tunisia, the entrepreneurship track integrated into
the students’ university education and was effective in increasing self-employment among applicants, but
the effects were small in absolute terms. In addition, the employment rate among participants remained
unchanged, pointing to a partial substitution from wage employment to self-employment. In Bosnia and
Herzegovina, two half days of business skills and financial literacy training did not influence business
survival, although it significantly improved business practices, investments, and access to better loan
terms for surviving businesses. There is heterogeneity in the results, however, with entrepreneurs with
higher ex-ante financial literacy exhibiting some improvements in business performance and sales.

73.     There have been three studies in Africa, although none of them focuses on youth or finds strong
results for females. Berge, Bjorvatn, Junitwaty, and Tungodden (2012) study the impacts of weekly
business training and one-time business grants in Tanzania. The grants were worth about $60-100 or 50%
of average annual investments for business owners and were awarded to a random sample of trained and
non-trained recipients. Their results suggest that the training was more effective than grants at increasing
business profits through expanding sales but only for men. For women, neither the training nor the
business grants had a positive impact. Recent work in Uganda also randomly selected business owners,
most of whom had already accessed microcredit, to receive loans, cash grants, business skills training, or
a combination of these programs (Fiala, 2014). Again the results from this intervention were only positive
for men, with no impact for women on any of the interventions. Men with access to loans and training
reported significantly higher profits. The loan-only intervention had some initial impact, but this did not

last and no impacts were found from the grant intervention. The third study implemented a three-day
theory based program aimed to promote personal initiative among small business owners in Kampala,
Uganda (Glaub, Frese, Fischer, & Hoppe, 2014). They find a positive effect on sales one year later, although
they do not survey the non-compliers (individuals selected for training who do not attend), which is
problematic if there is selective participation.

74.      Given the recent conflict-affected history of South Sudan it is useful to discuss programs that
have targeted to youth who may have been involved in conflict. However, few impact evaluation studies
have been done on reintegration programs for violent youth. Quasi-experimental and observational
studies of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) program find little impact on
reintegration and employment (Gilligan, Samii, & Mvukiyehe, 2011; Humphreys & Weinstein, 2007;
Levely, 2013). However, most are poorly executed (Kingma & Muggah, 2009). A recent contrasting
experimental study in Liberia finds significant increases in legal labor supply from an intensive
reintegration program that involved a four-month residential agricultural training program, life skills
classes, relocation assistance and $125 of in kind farm inputs (Blattman & Annan, 2014).

75.      To summarize this thread of literature, while there is evidence that vocational training
programs can help improve employment outcomes for youth, through developing their job-specific
skills as well as enabling them to develop employability credentials, they are an expensive type of
intervention to implement. The effects tend to be strongest for women, apart from in environments
where women may be more constrained than men in their ability to participate in programs. When taking
into consideration the cost of these programs, which can be up to several thousand dollars per individual,
alongside their mixed results, it is not clear that they are best use of resources to strengthen economic
opportunities for youth.

76.     Cognitive behavioral therapy and life-skills training that aim to improve the employment
“readiness” of youth have recently been shown to have promising results in high-crime areas in the US.
However, due to a limited number of studies in sub-Saharan Africa, it is not clear that these outcomes are
transferable to fragile and conflict-affected situations in developing countries. In the context of such
program components, it is important to look for innovative, practical and cost-effective approaches to
implement such psycho-social support.

77.     Financial literacy and basic business skills training programs have shown mixed results. In some
cases they can help business creation, business survival and business growth, often when partnered with
a source of credit. However, the results are much weaker for the impact on female training course
attendees and there is recent evidence demonstrating the importance of designing the curriculum
appropriately for the training to be effective.

2.1.3   Rationale for Cash Grants in South Sudan

78.   Theoretical rationale behind microenterprise grants is based on the assumption that there is a
demand for capital to invest, start or expand businesses among grant beneficiaries who are credit



                                                    34
                                                                  South Sudan: Youth Startup Business Grant Program – Volume I



constrained. This section of the report reviews such a theoretical assumption within South Sudan context
and finds that South Sudanese beneficiaries of the program, despite their ambitions in starting and
growing a business, are in fact constrained by a market failure to provide access to credit.

79.      Lack or limited access to credit is a common issue in developing countries, and South Sudan is
no exception. According to the World Bank’s Doing Business, obtaining credit in the country is among the
most difficult in the world, ranking 171st in 2015 down from 169th in 2014.38 The lack of development of
borrowers’ credit information creates barriers between borrowers and lenders, resulting in financial
institutions unable to offer loans according to demands and having to turn to more strict lending criteria
to determine credit terms. With only one percent of households having a bank account, South Sudanese
businesses face constraint to access formal credit. Additionally, high interest rates ranging from 18 to 23
percent and limited financial services outside urban areas39 mount to undeniable cases of credit
constraint.

80.     Evidently, lack or limited access to credit is a binding constraint to the potential beneficiaries of
the business startup grant. According to the baseline survey, the potential beneficiaries have taken out
loans, with some resorted to informal sources. Those who have obtained loans pay high interest rates.
These high cost in borrowing make investment less desirable and business startups or expansion
unattainable for some.

81.      As discussed in the previous section, grants present new opportunities for beneficiaries
compared to traditional and microfinance loans, which usually accompanied by high interest rates
and/or collateral criteria. A business startup grant program allows youth to obtain capital needed for a
business startup and investment to improve their employability. Investments and business activities that
otherwise would not have taken place under a loan regime may be made possible under a grant program.
Microfinance has for many years been employed to solve the challenges faced by those who are credit
constrained in developing countries. Nonetheless, it has been reported that microfinance institutions in
South Sudan are limited to mostly urban clients.40 Without collateral-based criteria that many lending
institutions require, business startup grants present more equal opportunities for the eligible population
of any economic status.41 Furthermore, given the fluctuations in prices in South Sudan, potential profit


38
   The World Bank’s Doing Business ranks South Sudan 186th out of 189 in 2015 for ease doing business. Its ranking
for Getting credit has been downgraded in the same year.
39
   According to the African Economic Outlook, the financial sector in South Sudan is mostly underdeveloped with
23 commercial banks as of 2013.
40
   While there has been improvement, a lack of access to financial capital has been reported as one of the biggest
constraints in urban areas; therefore, microfinance has been introduced, but the requirements to apply for the
loans tend to result in a bias towards more urban clients. For example, land ownership requirement. Additionally,
the lack security and infrastructure also limits the ability of microfinance to expand to rural areas (Maxwell et. Al
2012).
41
   An eligibility criteria to submit a written business ideas discriminates beneficiaries against the most poor and
vulnerable population. The business startup grant program does restrict eligibility by this mechanism based on the
rationale to assess impact of cash grants for the literate population before discussing an expansion to the most
vulnerable parts of the population.


                                                         35
                                                             South Sudan: Youth Startup Business Grant Program – Volume I



margins may be difficult to estimate, creating larger uncertainty in expected return of borrowing and
hence resulting in restricted business investment and activities with the presence of risk averse. This
suggests that business startup grants can enable beneficiaries to take up investments and business
activities that they would have otherwise been reluctant to do.

82.     Cash grants will make give larger ownership to beneficiaries than in-kind transfers. While
studies have shown the benefits of in-kind grants, this type of grants also comes with supervising costs
and restrictions on the ability of the beneficiaries to freely make investment as they see fit. Although cash
grants may present the risk of off-target spending and lack of self-control among the beneficiaries, which
in-kind grants likely prevent, beneficiaries of cash grants are given greater opportunities and freedom to
make their own investment choice. It is important to note that local beneficiaries possess the information
on their environment, business and needs that designers of grant programs may not have. Given the
uncertainty, conflicts and variations across South Sudan, it is likely that beneficiaries from different
regions have different needs and types of suitable investments may vary depending on how much they
are affected by the conflicts. With effective means of beneficiary selections, cash grants present greater
opportunities for the beneficiaries to make investment that best serve their needs. Equally important is
that a cash grant program has a built-in component that allows opportunities for future borrowing. For
example, after the beneficiaries fulfill the grant conditions, they are offered the opportunity to borrow
from given financial institutions. This is a form of credit history that allows beneficiaries to build their
credit and trust between the beneficiaries and the financial institutions for future business.

83.     Despites the benefits, cash grants also face possible challenges and risks. Misuse of grants is a
potential problem, as a number studies discussed in the previous section have reported that sometimes
beneficiaries may lack self-control or use the grant money for purposes other than investment or business
related. Particularly in South Sudan case, there is a risk of arm purchase given the on-going conflicts and
violence. The baseline survey reveals that gun ownership, along with violence and harassment, was
underreported. This makes it challenging to estimate the possibility of grants being spent on
violence/conflict-related purchases.

84.     International migration is another challenge for cash grant programs. If the beneficiaries see
greater opportunities outside of South Sudan and now with the means provided by cash grants, migration
may become a rational option. Studies on this topic are ambiguous and not necessarily applicable to the
case of South Sudan. For example, one study finds that a cash transfer program in Mexico resulted in the
beneficiaries using the cash to fund migration (Angelucci et al., 2013). However, it is important to assess
the cost-benefit analysis of migration from the South Sudanese beneficiaries’ point of view. With the cash
grants, there is a greater opportunity presented to them at home. Depending on their country of
destination, the opportunities outside of South Sudan may not be greater than the risk they have to take,
especially given that there is an option to start a business at home.

85.     There have been positive outcome in non-conflict countries, and a cash grant program in South
Sudan could set precedent for future programs in conflict-affected areas. Haushofer and Shapiro (2013)
find that unconditional cash transfers in West Kenya increased consumption, savings, health and


                                                     36

education expenditures. Importantly, they find no notable misuse of cash transfers. More recently,
Fafchamps and Quinn (2015), through 1,000 USD cash prizes in Africa for young entrepreneurs, found
positive effects on monthly profits. Nonetheless, both studies only look at non-conflict countries. As a
conflict-affected country, South Sudan may present challenges to such programs, but it may also present
a new learning opportunity for other conflict-affected countries. The extent of its success could help shape
future programs in such countries.

86.      Other than risks related to cash grants, there are also potential risks specific to South Sudan
that need to be taken into consideration. Since the current conflict has been reported to affect a large
number of aspects of daily life42 and peace remains fragile, there is a threat to any development programs.
Violence continues to be a major problem with an increasing cases of physical attacks reported.43
Nonetheless, with the on-going peace talks, there is hope that the conflict will ease over time and safety
will improve accordingly. And with the continued support of the international community and donors, the
risk of South Sudan falling into war may be reduced. Additionally, with the focus on six non-conflict states,
the youth startup business grant program is designed to lessen any potential risks related to the conflict.

87.     Provided the extent of challenges that South Sudanese youth are facing and the limited existing
unconditional cash transfers, there is an urgent need for a youth business startup grant despite the
potential risks. The struggles among South Sudanese youth, including returnees since the Comprehensive
Peace Agreement, have been reported by various sources. As discussed in previous sections, efforts have
mainly focused on immediate relief and food security, leaving very little attention on cash transfers. A
business startup grant will respond to the need to rebuild and invest in the generation that needs it most
and urgently. Despite the attached risks, as any investment has, cash grants are investments in the future
of South Sudan.

2.2     Nudges Attached to Cash Grants


88.     Effectiveness of cash grants may be boosted by various nudges. This section of the report
discusses text message interventions to nudge beneficiaries. After reviewing generally the evidence for
the success of text message interventions, evidence is presented for two types of text message
interventions: rules of thumbs for financial literacy and aspirations. The program in South Sudan includes
both text message interventions as well as a phrasing via text message of grant vs loan of the program.
The details about the design and the implementation are described in the third part of the report.

2.2.1    SMS Reminders

89.     Text messages can be used as reminders to individuals, serving to reduce procrastination and
direct current attention to a certain task or activity – often to the effect of bringing about the desired
behaviour change. Aklerlof (1991) notes that procrastination happens when the present benefits are less

                                                              37
                                                              South Sudan: Youth Startup Business Grant Program – Volume I



salient in comparison with future benefits. Karlan et al. (2010) propose that this lack of saliency, or limited
attention, has an important effect on intertemporal decision-making, a factor that could be partly
mitigated through the use of reminders. They test this hypothesis in three different randomised
evaluations with banks in Bolivia, Peru and the Philippines. Customers were asked to select a date-based
or achievement-based savings goal. Participants in the treatment group then received regular text
message reminders either about savings in general, or related to their specific goal. They find that
reminders increased the likelihood of achieving a savings goal by 3% and total savings increased by 6%,
while reminders about specific savings goal were twice as effective as general messages. Messages have
also proved effective in studies assessing loan repayment rates. In another study on the efficacy of
reminders to influence financial decisions, Cadena and Schoar (2011) evaluate the effect of text messages
on loan repayments compared to a financial reward for completing repayments or a 25% rate reduction
on a future loan. The authors find that text messages were as effective as a 25% rate reduction in terms
of improving repayments, with particular effects for younger customers.

90.      The positive impact of SMS reminders to drive behavioural change is also found in the fields of
education and healthcare. Castleman (2013) assesses the efficacy of text messages to mitigate attention
deficits through the use of reminders aimed at increasing college enrolment among low-income students
in the United States. The study, which involved a randomized evaluation, finds that enrolment rates
increased in the treatment group by almost 5% compared to the control group. Further findings in the
public health arena support the notion that reminders can lead to behaviour change. Hasvold (2011), in a
systematic review of telephone and SMS reminders for hospital appointments, finds a significant
improvement in attendance rates. In the realm of public health, Fjeldsoe et al. (2009) reviews a number
of studies focusing on health behavioural change interventions through SMS messaging, finding that
messages lead to short-term positive benefits.

2.2.2   Financial Literacy Training

91.     Existing literature demonstrates the potential for improved financial literacy and business
training to improve small business performance, however the evidence so far has been somewhat
mixed. One of the trends that has emerged from the literature is the success simple financial rules can
have over standard accounting programs.

92.      One study that strives to address this issue is Drexler et al. (2014), which used a randomized
evaluation to directly test simple rules relative to standard accounting based training within the same
participant group. The training programs were evaluated among clients who had received loans from a
savings and credit bank in the Dominican Republic. One program, termed rule-of-thumb training, involved
teaching participants simple heuristics designed to instill routines for financial decision making without
the more technical accounting training included in traditional programs. The content focused on teaching
simple rules for financial decision-making, including account separation, profit estimation and account
reconciliation. The second program was a more traditional accounting based program. The training was
delivered over a five to six week period, depending on the training program, through classroom
instruction. The authors find a relationship between improved financial literacy and business performance

when using a rule-of-thumb based syllabus but no impact when it came to more traditional fundamentals-
based accounting training. Participants in the rule-of-thumb training were found to adopt a number of
better financial practices, including account separation and record keeping, whilst those who undertook
the standard accounting training only showed significant improvements in setting aside funds for
expenses. Further those given the rule-of-thumb training demonstrated significantly improved sales levels
in bad weeks where as the standard accounting program had no effects on revenues.

93.      Karlan and Valdivia (2011) echo these positive findings by showing a strong link between
improved business practices and basic finance training for micro-entrepreneurs in Peru. Participants
were selected from a group lending program for female micro-entrepreneurs to take part in an
entrepreneurship training program focusing on business skills and strategy over the course of one to two
years. Participants who took part in the training program demonstrated improved business knowledge
and business practices in a follow up survey, including an increased likelihood to maintain records and
reinvest profits. As also found in Drexler et al. (2014) the difference in effects on sales between the
training group and the control group were largest for bad months. The authors propose that the training
enabled clients to implement strategies that reduced sales fluctuations. There were, however, no effects
on profit levels.

94.      The success of the rule-of-thumb syllabus adds to a growing body of research that highlights the
increased efficacy of simple information in driving desired policy and learning outcomes. Beshears et al.
(2013) show how simplification of retirement savings options can increase enrolment rates among
employees in two US based firms. Further, Bettinger et al. (2009) demonstrate how simplification, this
time in terms of financial aid applications for higher education, can increase take-up. These findings have
been mirrored in a variety of settings in health and education policy initiatives (Maddox et al., 2008; Maes
and Eling, 2007; Mata et al., 2010).

95.      The results from studies assessing traditional financial literacy programs have been less
conclusive. Berge, Bjorvatn and Tungodden (2010) assess the effect of business grants and a business
training program for microfinance clients in Tanzania. Participants were split into three treatment groups.
One received business training, another received the business grant, and another received both the grant
and training. The study finds significant results for the combined grant and training treatment group on
business outcomes for male clients, though limited effects for female clients. The combined treatment
led to increased sales and profits only for male entrepreneurs. Furthermore, although the training alone
resulted in significantly increased levels of reported happiness for male entrepreneurs, there were no
significant effects on female entrepreneurs, and no effects on business metrics, including sales and profits,
for either gender.

96.    Evidence of mixed results is also seen in Bruhn and Zia (2011), which evaluates a training
program for young entrepreneurs in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their findings demonstrate significantly
improved business practices for surviving businesses, though no effect on business survival rates.
Continuing business owners who undertook the training were more likely to invest in their businesses and
separate accounts. There was also evidence of improved financial knowledge from the program though

this was also only seen for individuals with higher skill levels at the start of the program. Further, Field et
al. (2010) evaluate a two-day training program for microfinance clients in India, finding that significant
results in terms of increased borrowing and reported income pertained only for the higher social group
involved in the study.

97.      In a non-business setting, Bernheim and Garrett (2003) provide survey evidence that
attendance of financial counselling programs included as part of the high-school curriculum can lead to
better financial decisions, with attendees demonstrating higher rates of savings. Cole, Sampson and Zia
(2009), however, find only modest effects from a financial literacy training program designed to promote
savings behaviour among unbanked households in Indonesia. Effects were only seen for households with
low levels of financial literacy.

2.2.3   Aspirations

98.      Aspirations or goals can work as mental models, which serve to focus attention on a chosen
future path or aim and make that path or goal more likely to become a reality. They have been shown
to be effective in influencing decision making in a variety of settings from household spending choices to
educational success. Locke and Latham (2002) propose that goals affect behaviour in four ways: through
focusing an individual’s attention, increasing effort, increasing persistence and also enabling individuals
to recall task specific knowledge.

99.      Improved task performance through goal setting has been demonstrated in a variety of
situations. Locke and Bryan (1969) show how participants in a study who were asked to complete a driving
task were more likely to respond to feedback and consequently perform better on aspects of the task for
which they had goals. Rothkopf and Billington (1979) echoing these findings in a learning situation,
evaluate how goals affected students’ performance in learning prose passages. They find that students
learnt passages that were relevant to their given goal better than passages that were not relevant to their
goal. Studies have also shown how setting goals can lead to greater effort being applied to tasks. In a lab
setting Bryan and Locke (1967) selected a high motivation and a low motivation group to complete an
additional task. The low motivation group were given specific goals whereas the high motivation group
were simply told to do their best. After the second round the group given specific tasks had matched the
levels of the other group despite starting with lower levels of motivation. Goal setting has been found to
have positive impacts in business environments as well. With this regard, Terpstra and Rozell (1994) find
a significant positive correlation between goal setting and profitability in a survey of US companies.

100. A further consideration related to goal setting is how mental models used in setting individual
goals or aspirations affect decision-making. In a randomized evaluation in Ethiopia, Bernard et al. (2014)
show that participants who watched a documentary on individuals with successful small businesses had
higher aspirations 6 months later. They also find that participants in the treatment group who had
watched the documentary demonstrated higher levels of education spending and savings. Social settings
can also have a role. Beaman et al (2012) show how increased aspirations among adolescent girls, driven
by an increased ratio of female village leaders, improved educational outcomes in a randomized



                                                      40
                                                              South Sudan: Youth Startup Business Grant Program – Volume I



evaluation of Indian villages. Other experimental studies have also provided support to the role
aspirations have in educational achievement (Page et al., 2007).

101. Strict deadlines have also been shown to drive increased effort. Latham and Locke (1975), in a
study evaluating output of logging crews, find a significantly higher level of output when mill deliveries
were limited to certain days of the week. Ariely (2002) supports these findings by showing that enforced
deadlines, which were stricter than self-selected deadlines, led to increased performance on proof-
reading tasks with a study involving students at an American university.

102. These various branches of literature support our expectation that the additional nudge
treatments will augment the impact of the training and grants. The evidence shows that simple rule of
thumb financial heuristics can improve business performance, and we expect these rules will do so in our
context, when included to reinforce the messages provided in an in-depth training session. Similarly, the
proven ability of aspirations and goals to increase the likeliness that individuals achieve their stated goals
leads us to believe that priming individuals to reflect on their goals, and illustrating the potential of their
businesses to help them achieve these goals will enhance the effort they exert in their business activities
and the success of their business. Finally, the literature on SMS reminders causes us to prefer this delivery
channel for nudges, not only because of its low cost, but because of the ability to send recurring messages
and increase the salience of simple financial rules and aspirational goals.


3    PART III: Youth Startup Program in South Sudan

103. The South Sudan Business Startup Grant and Impact Evaluation Program is a collaborative
initiative between the Government of South Sudan (GoSS) and the World Bank. The Private Sector
Development Project (PSDP) provided the anchor and main source of financing for the Business Startup
Grant. The project development objective is to improve access to finance for private sector development
and increase employment opportunities in South Sudan. The un-conditionality of a grant ensures a low
implementation complexity. The program was implemented in the six least conflict-affected states:
Eastern Equatoria, Central Equatoria, Western Equatoria, Lakes State, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, and
Western Bahr el Ghazal.
104. The focus of this report is the impact evaluation of the Business Startup Grant. The impact
evaluation utilizes a randomized control trial (RCT) design to assess the impact of a US$1,000 startup
business grant and skills training on employment, livelihoods, and social behavior outcomes. Grants
enable youth to make investments in tools and capital goods needed to become self-employable or to
invest in skills training improving their employment prospects and in turn increase income, as seen in the
evidence presented above. The program was implemented in the least conflict-affected regions in South
Sudan and included life-skill and business training as well as text-message based nudges. The results will
show whether a grant is sufficient to allow the youth to invest productively while supported by additional
training in life-skills and business development. The study will also reveal whether transfers increase
employment and improve livelihoods, as well as whether grants or their impacts improve social behavior

and reduce conflict. Given the gap in evidence for cash grants in fragile countries with active conflict, this
study can help the authorities and other stakeholders understand whether unconditional grants are a
viable policy option for employment generation in South Sudan.

3.1     Implementation
105. Implementation of the impact evaluation consists of several stages over 3 years. The impact
evaluation started with discussions with the implementing agency of the business startup grant to create
ownership and agree on a framework for responsibilities. Next, the impact evaluation was designed
including the sample and the questionnaire. A pilot and focus group interviews refined the questionnaire.
The field work was initiated with drawing a random sample of beneficiaries and a control group before
conducting face-to-face interviews. After the disbursement of the grant and implementation of life-skill
and business training for beneficiaries, the nudges using text messages are implemented. At the beginning
of 2016 and 2017, the follow-up surveys will be implemented to measure the impact of cash grants and
trainings on beneficiaries (Table 1).

3.1.1    Target Population
106. The program design targeted youth entrepreneurs aged 18 to 35, who were interested in funding
for small-scale start-up business ventures. At inception, grants equivalent to US$1,000 were to be
provided to 1,200 eligible individuals. Sixty-percent of the grants were reserved for women for two
reasons. First, women in South Sudan are strongly disadvantages in terms of education. Second, existing

                                                               South Sudan: Youth Startup Business Grant Program – Volume I



literature as discussed suggests that providing access to credit for women compared to men creates larger
gains in poverty alleviation44.
107. Cash grant programs are faced by a trade-off between target the most vulnerable and likelihood
of success. While the cash grant program intends to help the youth populations, the secondary goal of
generating start-up businesses necessitates that certain selection criteria exclude individuals with low
success changes. Selection criteria included age and state verification, social impact assessments, and the
ability to fill out the application in full, in English. While there was no stated requirement that the
application had to be filled out by the beneficiary, it can be assumed that completely illiterate youth was
deterred by the application form. Hence, the design of the program attempts to achieve a balance
between youth that could be successful entrepreneurs and youth who need the most assistance.

3.1.2   Call for Proposals
108. In order to attract the appropriate target population, applications to the BSC were collected
through a comprehensive communications campaign. A myriad of promotion channels helped to
publicize the program, among them were banners, fliers, posters, t-shirts, radio and print advertisements,
and other promotional materials to stimulate interest in the program. The application acceptance period
ran between October and November 2014. Over 9,000 applications were given out and 8,240 were
received back from all counties in the 6 participating states.
109. Message framing allowed for control of pre-conceived notions related to the program. Careful
attention was given to the phrasing of the program itself. The words “grant” and “loan” were specifically
avoided, to allow for nudging towards different behaviors later in the program. Instead, all materials
referred to the funding as “financing” and did not specify whether the program required repayment of
the funds.
110. Applicant requirements helped target the appropriate population by creating small barriers to
entry. Each application contained a unique serial number in which applicants could be identified, and
which allowed researchers to track the path of applications. To increase the chances of being able to
contact itinerant applicants, a referee and contact information was required, as well as a detailed
description of where their home was located. Each applicant was required to submit a paper application
in one of the six participating states. To fulfill the age requirement, all applicants had to attach a National
ID, birth certificate, or assessment of age provided by a hospital. Applicants had to briefly describe their
proposed idea, to ensure funding would not be used for the purchasing of alcohol, weapons, land, or other
specific items and clearly unfeasible ideas (e.g. creating an airline). Additionally, applications were only
available in English to help sort those that could read/write, and therefore be better equipped to absorb
the provided training; however, an Arabic version was kept in each county office for translation purposes.

3.1.3   Selection and Self-Selection



44
  Blattman et. al (2013) found that business grants given in Northern Uganda had a much stronger relative impact
on women than men, as both the capital stocks and earnings of women in the control group stagnated following
the baseline, while those of men caught up by around 50%.


                                                       43
                                                                     South Sudan: Youth Startup Business Grant Program – Volume I



111. The targeted messages and program design creates a self-selection bias into the impact
evaluation. The program selects its beneficiaries among those who submitted a written application. Thus,
the pool of applicants is not representative of the youth population but is self-selected.

112. The impact evaluation randomly selected applicants into treatment and control groups,
stratified by gender and state. In each participating state, 120 women and 80 men were selected as
beneficiaries. Beneficiaries, who could not be reached, were randomly replaced.

113. A transparent and reproducible selection method based on systematic random sampling was
used to select beneficiaries. First, all eligible applicants were divided into lists by gender and state. In
each list, applicants were ordered by the first phone number given.45 A random number (called seed)
between 0 and 1 was provided by the Ministry of Trade.46 For each list, beneficiaries were selected by the
following procedure:

              a. A start value was calculated by taking the seed value and multiplying it with the number
                 of beneficiaries per state (132 for females and 88 for males including replacements).
              b. A selection probability (to receive the grant) was calculated as the number of beneficiaries
                 per state, as detailed above, divided by the number of applicants per state by gender.
              c. The first applicant obtained a selection number, which was calculated by the start value (a)
                 plus the selection probability (b).
              d. Each subsequent applicant obtained a selection number by calculating the selection number
                 of the previous applicant plus the selection probability (b).
              e. An applicant was selected if the integer portion (the digits in front of the decimal point) of
                 his/her selection number changed from the integer portion of the selection number of the
                 previous applicant.
              f. The first 120 (80) women (men) were selected as beneficiaries. Replacements were chosen
                 sequentially starting with the 121st (81st) selected woman (man).

3.1.4    Characteristics of Applicants
114. The call for applications attracted 8,240 applicants across all 6 participating states and all
counties within each state. The applications were digitalized into a spreadsheet. Eligibility was evaluated
automatically with the exception of feasibility of idea, which was screened manually. Fifty-nine percent
of the applicants were men, with only Eastern Equatoria receiving more applications from women and
men (Graph 16).




45This was done in the order of primary phone number, secondary phone number, referee phone 1, referee phone 2.
46The Ministry chose to use the hotline phone number (0955554323) established to answer queries related to the competition.
Hence, the seed value selected was 0.955554323.

115. About half of the applications were eligible for consideration in the impact evaluation. Of those
deemed ineligible, the desired purchase of land was the main reason. Other explanations included blank
or unrealistic business ideas, age listed outside target range (18-35 years), no identification attached, or

age brackets (Table 2).

116. Applicants were relatively well-educated. Over half of the applicants completed some secondary
or post-secondary education, while only 15 percent never attended any formal education (Figure 4).
Among the youth in South Sudan, the number of people without formal education is considerably higher.
Thus, the implicit literacy requirement as part of the program design successfully selected applicants
better educated than the average youth.

117. Trade and Retail were the most common sectors aimed for by applicants. Sixty-seven percent of
all applicants wanted to start a retail business with the majority opting for small retail shops. Seventeen
percent were interested in businesses in the service industry, and 12 percent in agriculture. Only 3 percent
wanted to go into the manufacturing sector and 1 percent into construction.

3.1.5   Training
118. Business and life-skills trainings supplemented the financing and provided additional support
to achieve success. Five-day trainings occurred in each state for those selected as beneficiaries. Modules
covered topics such as creating a viable business idea, market research, budgeting and financial tracking,
goal setting, customer relations, and self-confidence.
119. In all states except Central Equatoria, 85 to 90 percent of those selected actually attended the
training program (Graph 17). Known reasons for non-attendance at the training included insufficient time
to arrange transportation or other logistics, distance to the training facility, and inability to contact the
recipient (usually due to disconnected phone numbers).

3.1.6     Disbursement
120. The program followed an innovative financing structure offering beneficiaries a grant, which
can be used as a loan. The following steps describe the financing procedure for the BSC cash-transfer: The
Government of South Sudan guarantees all the loans by depositing $1,200,000 into a USD denominated
account at a pre-determined commercial bank.48 Interest and processing fees are taken off the top of the
loan (4 percent), so that winners receive the South Sudanese Pound (SSP) equivalent of $960, while the
collateral guarantee is $1000. All winners had to open an account at the bank.49 Once the loan is cleared,
winners can withdraw their money (in SSP) at any time to finance their business. Thus, the grant is an
actual loan from the bank guaranteed by the Government. A pre-determined grace period for loan
repayment will be given to all winners. Once re-payments are scheduled to begin, an account is considered
in default after three months of consecutive non-payments. Repayment of the loan is calculated on a
weekly-basis. Banks will be able to claim the collateral after 3 months of non-payments. Since the loan
was guaranteed, default has no consequence for the winners.
121. Successful repayment of the loan by winners results in either (i) winners being able to take out
a new loan of the same amount at the same interest rate for life; or (ii) 12 months after first loan is

  Note that some states had a lower number of selected beneficiaries if despite multiple replacements
beneficiaries could not be reached.
48 The bank was required to meet the following criteria: be financially sound; be audited regularly, and receive satisfactory audit
reports; be able to execute a large number of transactions promptly; be able to perform a wide range of banking services
satisfactorily including opening and managing Government backed Letters of Credit; be able to provide a detailed statement of
the account periodically and on call; be part of a satisfactory correspondent banking; and charge reasonable fees for its services.
49 A National ID card is required to open an account. Applicants to the BSC without National IDs were required to submit

their birth certificates (or age assessment), which is the only requirement to obtaining a National ID.

granted, winners can collect the $1000 collateral on the initial loan to use for business or personal
reasons. Since the winners are certain to be accepted for the loan and all loans are guaranteed by the
GoSS, the ‘loan’ is in fact a grant.
122. Disbursement is set to be completed by June 2015. Financing will be disbursed through the
selected commercial bank in South Sudan. Tripartite agreements between the commercial bank, each
recipient, and the Ministry of Trade, Investment, and Innovation are being negotiated and signed, prior
to disbursement of funds. Winners will be notified via telephone and text message when they can visit
the commercial bank to access their funding.

3.2     Profile of Participants
123. For the baseline survey, selected applicants were visited for face-to-face interviews at their
home. Field work was implemented by an independent agency unaware which individuals were
beneficiaries or in the control group. Respondents, who could not be reached, were disqualified from the
program and replaced up to three times. Replacements were conducted within the strata (state + gender).
In total, 2,275 interviews were conducted (Table 3Error! Reference source not found.).

3.2.1    Demographic Characteristics of Participants
124. All states and both treatment and control groups remained close to or exceeded the target ratio
of 60% women (Table 3). Most demographic indicators are similar between men and women, with the
exception of the percentage of respondents with children and the percentage that identify as head of
household.
125. The treatment and control groups show consistent demographic profiles, meaning they are
suitable comparison groups for the impact evaluation (Table 3). The only indicator that showed
noteworthy differences are the percentage of new entrepreneurs.

3.2.2   Educational Profile
126. More men have attended formal education than women. Compared to educational attainment
among the youth in South Sudan, is not surprising that more men attended some form of formal education
than women. However, the gap in educational attainment between men and women among the
applicants is considerably lower than for the youth in general. Thus, the targeted communications
messages were effective especially in recruiting women with at least a minimum level of education. Of
those that attended formal education, attainment was relatively equal across gender and group. Men
were slightly more likely to complete secondary and university grade levels, though the differences are
small (Graph 18).

enumerators in both English and Arabic, with a cascading set of questions to identify the correct reading
abilities of the respondents. English was primarily assessed, with Arabic only being evaluated if the
respondent had no English abilities. The categorizations “good”, “ok” and “poor” demote levels of ability:
“poor” refers to the ability to identify letters and individual words, “ok” refers to the ability to read
paragraphs and stories, while “good” is to the ability to not only read paragraphs but also comprehend
follow-up questions. Graph 19 shows the breakdown of each category by gender (Graph 19).

128. Fifty-eight percent of respondents were proficient in math, meaning they could correctly
evaluate division problems. Similar to the literacy assessments, numeracy was evaluated through a series
of progressive mathematics problems, from counting groups of items and number recognition to
performing basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division equations. There is a large disparity
between men and women, with only 48 percent of women proficient compared to 73 percent of men.
Twenty percent of women had no numeracy skills, meaning they could not correctly count groups of
items, compared to only 9 percent of men. Numeracy is an important indicator of entrepreneurial success,
as many business practices, such as budgeting, stock taking, and goal setting, depend on accurate
numerical calculations.

3.2.3   Current Employment Situation
129. Sixty-one percent of respondents considered themselves employed, however large
discrepancies exist across states. For example, only 42 percent of those in Lakes State considered
themselves employed, compared to 84 percent of respondents in Northern Bahr el Ghazal. Such
differences are mirrored when assessing the number of hours worked per week. Respondents in Northern
Bahr el Ghazal worked a median of 35 hours per week, while those in Western Equatoria worked only 12
hours, and in Lakes more than half of respondents did not work any hour per week. Northern Bahr el

Ghazal is one of the least affected states in the conflict and is close to the border with Sudan; potentially
explaining the higher levels of employment.

130. Sixty-five percent of respondents currently own a business of some type, twenty percent have
owned a business in the past, and fifteen percent will be first-time business-owners. Such figures are
unsurprising, as waged employment is rare in most areas of South Sudan. In-line with the employment
status referenced above, 88 percent of those in Northern Bahr el Ghazal currently own a business.
131. Respondents report working 1.2 different jobs, on average. This number does not vary across
gender, treatment / control groups, or state. The service industries dominate the types of work individuals
are engaged in, with owning a shop, being a street food vendor, baking bread, brewing alcohol, and
running a restaurant rounding out the top areas of employment (Graph 21).

3.2.4   Ambitions and Plans for Cash Grant
132. Ninety percent of the businesses that respondents hoped to start with the grant can be
categorized into ten industries, split between retail trade and services. One-fourth of respondents
hoped to open a shop, defined as a permanent place to sell goods that has a door. Food-industry
businesses were more popular among women; but generally among the top ranking sectors, comprising
the next one-fourth of the respondents (Graph 22).

133. Respondents have a very positive outlook towards the future. All respondents were given a
picture of a ladder and asked to identify where they felt they were on the “ladder of life” at the moment,
in two years, and in five years. One was the worst possible life they could imagine while 10 was the best
possible life they could imagine. The majority of respondents felt to be between 4 and 6 on the ladder.
Seven percent of respondents identified themselves on the lowest rung of the ladder currently, and only
2 percent believed they had the best possible life they could imagine. Over time, respondents believe to
move up on the ladder with the majority moving between 5 and 7 in two years and 7 to 10 in five years.
Only one percent believed they would remain on the bottom-most rung, while those believing they would
have the best life increases to 6%. Most interestingly, when asked to project 5 years into the future, 26%
of respondents believed they would be living the best possible life they could imagine (Graph 23).

134. Respondents are slightly more risk-averse than expected. Entrepreneurs are generally assumed
to be less risk-averse than the general population.50 The respondents in this study are classified as
“entrepreneurs” since the application materials clearly stated that the financing was to be used for new
business development. A risk-index was formed from eight questions ranked 1-4. Those with higher scores
(max 32) in the index are considered more risk-loving, while those with lower scores (min 8) are
considered more risk-averse. The average risk-index score is 16.5, slightly below the midpoint of 20 (Graph
24). While this is lower than the expectation for entrepreneurs, South Sudan is an unstable market and
highly risky to invest in. These results may indicate that the respondents are cautious and more likely to
use the financing in a responsible manner, rather than balloon their risk. Graph 23 shows the risk-index
results stratified by gender.

3.2.5       Challenging Measures
135. Respondents were unwilling to respond to many sensitive topics. Only 4% of respondents
admitted to having a gun in the household, despite the estimated rate of gun ownership being 28.2
firearms per 100 people51. Other questions, specifically relating to violence, harassment, and cattle raiding
were also underreported. Despite efforts to build trust and alleviate suspicion on the part of the
enumerators, many reported that respondents became uncomfortable and refused to answer such
questions. The lack of accurate baseline data on this will make it difficult to assess potentially negative
impacts of the cash grant, such as gun purchases, increased violence against vulnerable populations, and
changes in negative social behaviors.

3.3       Nudges

136. Along with the business startup program, a component of the impact evaluation has been
designed to test the efficacy of various nudges in driving business performance among entrepreneurs
in South Sudan. In particular, the impact of aspirational and rules-of-thumb business management
messages will be tested. This evaluation will contribute to the literature surrounding the role of
aspirational thinking and goal-setting in business performance, as well as exploring whether the impacts
of continuous reminding of rules-of-thumb for financial literacy can improve success of the beneficiaries.

137. After completion of the training, participants in the business grant treatment group will be
randomly assigned to three different nudge treatment arms and one control arm. Two of the three

treatment arms will test the impact of aspirations and rule-of-thumb messaging. For the aspirations
treatment group, participants will be exposed to aspiration primes through text messages. The rule-of-
thumb treatment group will involve participants receiving messages on practical business management
information, designed to be easily understood and applied. The messages will reinforce the training
course and are designed to test whether increasing salience of the training program can lead to improved
business performance. The third treatment arm will phrase the financing as a loan to encourage
repayment. Beneficiaries selected into the control arm will not receive any text messages.


4 Conclusion

138. The business startup grant program is an initiative that responds to an urgent need for
opportunities among the youth in South Sudan. Given the fragility and active conflict that the country
has endured, South Sudan has a long way ahead to reach stability and prosperity for its population.
Despite many efforts and support from the international community, the path has been proven
challenging and uncertain with many obstacles in many different aspects. Among those, a generation of
vulnerability and declining livelihood, limited opportunities and insecurity for the future is sometimes
overlooked and placed behind factors that are considered more urgent, such as immediate stability and
food security. While those factors indeed require urgent attention and efforts, the desperate situations
that the young generation of South Sudan is living in is a cry for as much and as urgent responses. For
rebuilding a country entails a solid foundation of the young generation that is enabled and empowered.

139. The South Sudanese youth are a population living in poor conditions but not without potentials.
As discussed throughout this report, the youth in South Sudan are presented with many challenges and
obstacles. From lack of access to basic social services to violence and insecurity, their daily life has become
a struggle. Many are living in hunger and with limited access to clean water. School attendance, which
was already low and difficult, has been further made challenging by the on-going violence. Lack of
infrastructure development and an environment driven by poor security, an ineffective regulatory regime
and economic shocks has added to the gloomy picture of employment opportunities for the youth.
Suffering additionally from credit constraint, young entrepreneurs who are a driving force of economic
development are restricted from fully embracing their potential. Nonetheless, being the largest
composition of the population, the South Sudanese youth have great potential to be the force of change
for a better life and a better South Sudan if given the proper and necessary assistance. In spite of their
current struggle, the potential beneficiaries of the business startup program project positive outlook for
their future and express their ambitions for a better life. With properly designed assistance tailored to
address their challenges, the South Sudanese youth may become a change agent for a more stabilized and
prosperous South Sudan.

140. Especially young women are disadvantaged and lack even basic opportunities. Women in South
Sudan are still often constrained to the household with limited access to education and work outside the
household. This restricts women’s possible contributions to the economy and the households’ livelihoods;

but also discriminates against women to pursue a life with an equal freedom of choice as young men.
Hence, the business startup grant program ensured that at least 60 percent of beneficiaries are women.

141. With thorough reviews of the existing literature, the business startup grant program is set up
to assist the youth of South Sudan to overcome one of their greatest challenges: lack of employment
opportunities. The program offers the beneficiaries the financial opportunities to start up or expand a
business. The design is intended to achieve a balance between reaching out to the most vulnerable
population and awarding those who have the required characteristics to succeed in starting up a business
and absorbing the benefits of the program. As previously discussed, upon complete repayment the
beneficiaries are guaranteed for either a new loan of the same amount at the same interest rate or a
collection of the $1000 collateral to use for business or personal reasons. Additionally, it features a
number of components designed based on a broad literature as well as the context specific to South
Sudan. Among these components are the nudges, including business rules of thumb, aspirational
messages and a loan vs grant phrasing sent via text messages. With these additional features in place, the
program hopes to enhance business opportunities as well as employability of the beneficiaries who are
young adults.

142. The business startup grant program is built with consideration of the successes and challenges
of previous programs. Taking into consideration of the risks specific to cash grants as well as the
environment of South Sudan, specific design features of the program are intended to embrace what has
been proven successful and address the challenges previously experienced in other similar programs. The
nudges are selected based on the growing literature supporting more practical and simple skills trainings
compared to the traditional skills trainings, as well as the employment of new technology that enables
getting message across more effectively and affordably. Furthermore, the provided options for either a
new loan or collateral collection after complete repayment are incentives for the beneficiaries to make
the most out of the cash grants, as well as to remain in the country as there are further financial
opportunities. If the former option is chosen, the beneficiaries are presented with a life-long opportunity
for access to credit. And with the choice of the latter option, the cash collection may enable further
investment or ease their personal financial difficulties; in either case, the wellbeing of the beneficiaries
may be improved.

143. Nonetheless, a more decisive conclusion of the program will be drawn through additional
follow-ups and an evaluation of the impact. Since there is limited literature on such programs in conflict-
affected countries, an impact evaluation will fill in the gap and provide further evidence for future
programs in similar situations. The full-fledged impact evaluation is designed as a randomized control trial
utilizing over-subscription to the program. An additional component of the study is designed to measure
the effectiveness of the nudges. The study aims to inform decision makes and other stakeholders whether
cash grants can be a successful intervention in a country like South Sudan. If found to be successful, an
expansion of such a program in South Sudan could potentially have great effects on youth employment
and the future livelihoods of the population. While many issues such as violence and insecurity may likely
persist, it is hoped that the business startup grant program is a beginning step in the right direction.
