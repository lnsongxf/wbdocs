Background Note1
This note on domestic syndications is part of a series of background notes produced under the World Bank Group
Government Bond Markets Advisory Services Program as a by-product of its strategy to support the development of liquid
local currency bond markets.
Topics selected have been a key focus in Advisory Services’ work area because of their catalytic impact on debt market
development. Six notes have been produced so far: Domestic Syndications, Bond Buybacks and Exchanges, Securities
Lending and Related Standing Facilities, Primary Dealer Systems, Electronic Trading Platforms, and Repo Markets.
Domestic syndications can be a powerful tool in development of government bond markets by providing access to
immediate liquidity for new benchmark bonds and diversifying an investor base. Additionally, domestic syndications
serve well to bring and launch innovative instruments in the domestic securities markets. The objective of this background
note is to illustrate the various aspects of syndications to be considered by a debt manager in deciding whether a domestic
syndication is an appropriate placement mechanism in certain cases. The note reviews goals, prerequisites, limitations, and
drawbacks of syndications and provides real-life examples in the case studies.
Production of this background note was led by Olga Akcadag. Baudouin Richard was the primary author, working in
collaboration with Anderson Caputo Silva, Olga Akcadag, and Indhu Raghavan, all of the World Bank Group Government
Bond Markets Advisory Services Program Team.
The authors wish to thank Anne Leclercq, Director of the Front Office at the Belgian Debt Agency, and Mike Williams,
Senior Consultant, World Bank Group, for reviewing the paper, as well as Juan Manuel Govea Soria, Director of Institutional
Investors Relations at the Mexican Treasury, for his contribution to the Mexico case study. A special thank you to David
Anderson, who edited this background note, and Aichin Lim Jones, who provided the design and layout.

         1. Introduction



This background note is intended to assist debt management offices (DMOs) in assessing
whether a bond placement scheme combining auctions and syndications is an appropriate
strategy in their markets and, if so, to assist them in designing the corresponding procedures.
Syndications are currently best known in connection with the placement of external debt
abroad. By contrast, a “domestic syndication” has three specific features: (1) a bond is
placed in the domestic market denominated in a local currency,2 (2) a bond is generally
placed with both domestic and foreign investors, and (3) the outstanding amount of a
bond is intended to be subsequently increased through a calendar of auctions. In practice,
domestic syndications are invariably linked to the launch of a benchmark bond.3
Domestic syndications were first used in the European Monetary Union (EMU) in
1999. Their usage is now expanding in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) countries. At first glance, this seems to be an evolution backwards.
The end of bank financing extended under the form of “club deals,”4 and their replacement
by competitive auctions in the domestic government securities market has been a standing
feature of the reforms initiated across the globe over the last 50 years to increase the
efficiency of public debt management.
Domestic syndications have three justifications. First, they can score better than auctions
on four points: (1) they provide immediate liquidity, (2) they diversify the investor base by
attracting new investors, (3) they are an efficient tool to ensure firm prices in the secondary
market, and (4) they offer timing flexibility: by contrast with auctions, syndications do
not need to be subject to an issuance calendar. Second, the issuer can play an active role in
structuring the transaction and in overseeing its implementation. This was not the case for
the “club deals” done in the past. Third, domestic syndications are also an efficient tool to

  That is, placing the first issuance of a security. Domestic syndications are normally not intended to
tap an existing bond.

  In this context, a “Club deal,” alternatively called a “bank consortium,” means a financing extended
jointly by a group of banks that effectively dictate their terms and conditions to the borrower.

        2. Syndications



2.1. Standard Features of Syndications
Syndication is the process of putting together a group of banks that jointly underwrite and
distribute a new security offering. The members of a syndicate commit to buy a certain
amount of securities at a certain price. They are expected to place the securities with their
customer base. In the event of a lack of demand by customers, however, the banks will keep
the securities on their balance sheets. The members of a syndicate earn two commissions:
an underwriting commission for committing to provide funding and a selling commission
for placing the securities.
Syndication is akin to a private placement where the issuer is ensured of having a certain
amount of funding at a predetermined price. The specificity of a private placement is
that the issuer negotiates with a smaller number of banks (typically from one to three
institutions). The size of the funding is also smaller than in syndication. In general, the
banks know beforehand where they will place the securities. The main advantage of a
private placement is that it can be completed fast and with no publicity. See appendix 1 for
further comparison.
Banks consider syndications to be very attractive business. This applies particularly when
a bank is mandated to be the arranger of the transaction (“lead or joint lead manager”).
In addition to the commission earned, a lead or joint lead mandate raises the ranking
of a bank in the league tables published to show the most active syndication managers.
This enhances the business reputation of the bank, thereby attracting other mandates.
The banks participating in a syndication are also given an opportunity to strengthen their
relationship with their customers by being first to offer them new securities. As a result,
syndication is a very competitive business.
Syndicated transactions receive considerable coverage in the financial press. Syndications
are a highly specialized business. The major players are a small number of large international
banks. Most transactions are reviewed in great detail. The competitors of the appointed
joint leads do not miss the opportunity to highlight any shortcoming in the “market
comments” section of press reviews, expecting to increase their own chances of becoming
lead managers next time.

    Syndications                                                             In an external syndication, the issued security is an

    2.2.1. Specific Objectives Pursued                                       The funding need being met is usually not recurrent. The

    Domestic syndications pursue three objectives: (1) to                    funding cost. The higher liquidity of the security and

    base, and (3) to enhance the good functioning of the                     for the size issued. A domestic syndication also provides
    secondary market by creating the right mix between                       additional benefits that jointly further decrease the net

    The widening of the investor base generally includes an
    expectation to attract foreign investors to the domestic
    market. Syndication is a tool that is more efficient than
    an auction because it minimizes the investor’s risk (section
    4.1.2). Successful domestic syndications attract a significant
    amount of foreign buying. Yet the latter is not necessarily
    a prerequisite for a domestic syndication to be justified.7

      This assumes that an arbitrage possibility exists between the two markets (“swap window”) and that investors can take advantage of it.

      As an illustration, Mexico has not mentioned foreign investors as a specific objective nor has it set any target market share for placement
    abroad.

        3. External Syndications



This section reviews the rationale for external syndications, followed by a description of the
procedures usually implemented.

3.1. Rationale for External Syndications
The reason for using syndications to place external debt is clear. The investor base is little
known to the issuer and requires a special marketing effort to be tapped. Nonresident
investors lack sufficient familiarity with the issuer to submit large and/or aggressive bids.
Auctions are seldom used—if at all—for nondomestic issuance by sovereigns. In most cases
they would not produce the best prices outside domestic markets.

3.2. External Syndication Procedures
Syndications are usually preceded by a marketing campaign. The issuer updates investors
on the country credit and government securities market, and the rationale and the main
features of the transaction are described. This is typically done in the framework of
conference calls and/or road shows organized abroad.
Thereafter, the syndication of a bond issuance usually covers six steps:
1.	Appointment of a syndicate group
2.	Pricing guidance
3.	Official announcement of the transaction/book building
4.	Closing of the books
5.	Allocation of orders
6.	Management of the market postsyndication

4.1. Rationale for Domestic Syndications
At first glance, domestic syndications are a paradox. Auctions are the standard issuance
procedure in modern government securities markets. Auctions are a competitive and
generally commission-free process.19 They represent an improvement on the noncompetitive
placement systems that used to prevail in most government securities markets. In principle,
auctions should yield the lowest financing cost.
The rationale for domestic syndications is that they can produce better results than actions
in some specific circumstances. Yet domestic syndications have limitations and their own
drawbacks.

4.1.1. The Drawbacks of Auctions
Auctions do not always produce the best results in four respects: timing, size, price, and
investor base.
1. Timing: Auctions are subject to timing constraints. Auctions are held in the framework
of a calendar. This is sound market practice. In the long run, predictability reduces the
financing cost. In the short run, however, the corresponding lack of flexibility can raise risk
(issuance in unfavorable market conditions) or represent a missed opportunity.
2. Size: Auctions allow only relatively small amounts to be raised. Auctions are subscribed
primarily by dealers who carry the securities until such time as they can on-sell them to
customers. End investors generally participate little in auctions for three reasons: (a) the
auctions may not take place at the right time (because of the calendar), (b) the investor
is not certain to acquire the amount of securities wanted (its bid may not be successful),
and (c) if the bid is successful and if the auction is multiple price, the price may be too
high (“winner’s curse”). By contrast, in a liquid secondary market, an investor can buy the
amount it wants at a price it knows and at the moment that suits it. Many end investors
therefore tend to bid at auctions only when the secondary market is illiquid and/or the
amount to buy in the secondary market is so large that it could move the market. As a result,

     syndication is well managed,20 investors have a reasonable
     expectation of getting a small capital gain. Last, issuers can
     turn a syndication into a marketing event more easily than
     for an auction.




     20
        Well-advised issuers usually tend to deliberately set their cutoff price a little below the intrinsic value of the bond, thereby offering investors
     on the primary market the likelihood of a small capital gain. The cost to the issuer is usually insignificant because a larger number of
     investors bid more aggressively as a result.
     21
        This does not mean that syndication will always be successful irrespective of market conditions (e.g., highly volatile market).

is a reward particularly appreciated by banks. As mentioned
earlier, it offers them three benefits: a commission, a closer
relationship with customers, and a higher ranking in the
syndications league tables.31


28
   That is, assuming equal degree of expertise in arranging a successful syndication. The degree of expertise can differ as a function of
the business specialization of the bank, its type of customer base, the geographical coverage of its placement, etc. Where a number of
competent banks are part of a PD group, the lead might be deliberately rotated to maintain motivation. In case expertise in syndication and
quality performance as a PD receive contradictory evaluations, expertise in syndication is the criterion that should prevail.
29
   Poland reports that the announcement the DMO may consider syndications as a possible placement mechanism in itself led to improved
competition among PDs.
30
   For example, transactions in the currency or derivatives markets.
31
   The latter is a particularly valued reward to the banks because of its snowball effect. Issuers (both public and corporate) tend to appoint
as lead managers the banks with high rankings in the league tables, on the assumption that they are the most experienced ones in the field.
32
   This process went too far in some EU countries during the mid-2000 as PDs started buying market share to be on the issuer’s short list
of joint lead candidates. As a result, some securities started being auctioned at prices above the level of the prices in the secondary market,
thereby forcing issuers to penalize excessively aggressive bids to avoid market distortions.

     Four types of legal documentation are usually found:
                                                                               The syndication process is marked by four “landmarks”:
     1. Information memorandum: The Information                                (1) start of the process (initial meeting with the joint leads),
     memorandum is meant to inform investors about the                         (2) start of book building, (3) pricing of the bond, and
     terms of the syndicated bond. It provides background                      (4) settlement of the transaction. The DMO and the joint
     information on the domestic government securities                         leads monitor the whole process through daily conference
     market, the clearing and settlement procedures, the                       calls.



     34
         One side benefit of this close involvement by a debt manager is to avoid potentially awkward situations such as meeting investors
     sometime before a syndication (e.g., in the framework of a non-deal-roadshow) to entice them to buy bonds and thereafter allocating only
     a very small percentage of the submitted order.
     35
        In practice, DMOs typically inform joint leads that their compliance with the obligation to make bid and offer prices to support liquidity of
     the government securities market will be monitored particularly closely in the framework of syndication. DMOs typically further inform joint
     leads that the sanction for their noncompliance with this obligation will be to significantly decrease their chance of being appointed a joint
     lead again in the future. Both policies are best kept pragmatic, however, and not mentioned in a specific agreement.

        A quality account is usually defined as a stable real money investor who will hold on to the bond for some time and who has the potential
     to buy more bonds later if it is pleased with the investment. Central banks typically belong to this category. A real money investor, who has
     the reputation of taking its profit or its loss fast, without being a market maker and doing nothing to enhance the liquidity of the secondary
     market, is not a quality account.

        5. Conclusion



Historically, syndications have been used only in issuances of foreign currency–denominated
bonds in external markets. This has changed since 1999. Many DMOs view domestic
syndications as an efficient tool for both small and large issuers whenever the target investor
base includes entities located beyond the national borders of the relevant issuer. Small
issuers have been attracted by the possibility of issuing larger amounts. Larger issuers
have been attracted by a better quality of price discovery. In both cases, syndicated bond
issues are more liquid. Prices in the secondary market are usually firmer for syndicated
issues. Syndications can enhance the motivation of PDs to deliver a good performance
in the execution of their duties. In view of the aforementioned benefits, any reasonable
syndication commission is a worthwhile investment.
Domestic syndication has prerequisites, limitations, and drawbacks. In particular, the DMO
has to be clear on the objectives to be achieved. These objectives should be communicated
to the market. Domestic syndications are a complement to, not a substitute for, auctions.
They are a time-consuming procedure, and they are not as straightforward a competitive
process as an auction.
On balance, however, domestic syndication is an efficient securities placement procedure,
the use of which is expected to spread further across government securities markets. 52

Appendix 4: Allocation of Duties between Joint Leads at the BDA                                              35




         Appendix 4: Allocation
         of Duties between Joint
         Leads at the BDA


The usual duties assigned by the BDA are the following:
Communication manager: Responsible for delivering all the information intended for
a syndicate group. The objective is that all members of the syndicate are informed at the
same time.
Press manager: Responsible for organizing contacts in the BDA with the press.
Execution manager: The execution manager is in charge of the book-building process.
It provides the BDA with a written summary of the strategy suggested by joint leads. It
collects and summarizes the information provided by joint leads regarding their target
investor list and their qualitative feedback during the book-building process. It updates
the outstanding order book submitted to the BDA twice a day. After order allocation has
been discussed jointly by the BDA and all joint leads, the execution manager submits to
the BDA’s approval the final allocations, and it is responsible for dispatching the approved
allocations to the members of the syndicate.
Duration manager: The duration manager is a joint lead designated by the BDA to be a
counterparty of the other members of the syndicate for the execution of their customers’
switch orders.53




53
   Customers can submit their orders to the syndicate group either for cash or on a switch basis, in which
case, as in a bond exchange auction, they state their willingness to exchange a certain old bond at a
yield of “x” bp over the yield of the syndicated benchmark.
Appendix 5: Input to Assist in Drafting of a By-law on the Recommended Bond Placement Scheme                                                 37




                                        Appendix 5: Input to Assist in
                                        Drafting of a By-law
                                        on the Recommended Bond
                                        Placement Scheme

                               The objective of the government is to reduce or eliminate the liquidity premium currently
                               paid on the bonds issued in the domestic market until they reach benchmark size.
                               To meet this objective, the MoF has to create a competitive security issuance procedure
                               based on a market mechanism that increases the number of participants to allow for a
                               wider distribution of holdings, decreases the amount of time needed for a bond to reach
                               benchmark size, and increases the liquidity of the secondary market.
                               The syndicated issuance of new benchmark bonds allows for issuing larger amounts than
                               in the framework of auctions by attracting a wider number of end investors to the primary
                               market, including nonresident investors. As a result, this issuance method also fosters the
                               development of the secondary market.
                               The subsequent tapping of bonds in the framework of an auction calendar facilitates further
                               increasing the outstanding amount issued while firmly anchoring benchmark bonds to the
                               domestic market.
                               This issuance procedure is widely implemented by public debt managers abroad.
                               Therefore,
                               1.	The MoF is empowered to syndicate the issuance of new benchmark bonds in the local
                                  market.54
                               2.	The target issuance amount and composition of the syndicate group proposed by the
                                  DMO must be approved by the MoF.
                               3.	The syndicated benchmark can be subsequently tapped in the framework of the auction
                                  calendar published by the MoF.
                               4.	The bond auction scheduled to take place on the month during which the syndication is
                                  carried out can be canceled.55
                               54
                                  Only as an example, the Belgian legislation does not refer specifically to the issuance of new benchmark
                               bonds by syndications. Instead, it refers in general terms to “the first tranche(s) of a bond issue” and to
                               “any form of underwriting conforming to market practices.” This allows for more flexibility in adapting to
                               new market developments, if any.
                               55
                                  The use of “can be” instead of “is” reflects only the writers’ personal view that the best regulations
                               are the ones that leave the maximum flexibility to a public debt manager to do what he or she believes
                               to be the best in the circumstances without needlessly being constrained by too precise instructions,
                               sometimes written a long time before! Who knows what the market could be like tomorrow?
