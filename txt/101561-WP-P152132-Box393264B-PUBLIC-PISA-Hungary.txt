Facing the prospects of rapid aging and demographic decline over the coming decades, Hungary needs a highly skilled        nomic background
workforce to help generate the produc vity growth that it needs to con nue fueling a convergence of its living standards
with those of its West European neighbors.

Skilling up Hungary’s workforce should start by equipping youth with the right cogni ve and social-emo onal
founda on skills. Interna onal research has iden ﬁed three dimensions of skills that ma er for good employment
outcomes and economic growth: cogni ve skills, such as literacy, numeracy, crea ve and cri cal thinking, and
problem-solving; social-emo onal skills and behavioral traits, such as conscien ousness, grit, and openness to
experience; and job- or occupa on-speciﬁc technical skills, such as the ability to work as an engineer. Cogni ve and
social-emo onal skills forma on starts early in a person’s life. Good cogni ve and social-emo onal skills provide a
necessary founda on for the subsequent acquisi on of technical skills. Put diﬀerently, poor literacy and numeracy
skills severely undermine a person’s ability to beneﬁt from further training and lifelong learning.

Hungary can do signiﬁcantly be er in preparing its next genera on with the right cogni ve founda on skills.
This report focuses on cogni ve skills and examines results for Hungary from the Program for Interna onal Student          Source: World Bank Staﬀ es mates using PISA 2012 data. Notes: The 2012 PISA sample for Hungary contained 204 Schools. For the purposes

Hungary’s educa on system is one of the most inequitable in the European Union (EU). Three ﬁndings stand out:              This signiﬁcant variance in performance is linked with three contribu ng causes:

long-term economic growth prospects are put at risk by demographic change: the country is projected to see a decline
(by more than 10 percent between 2010 and 2050) and signiﬁcant aging of its popula on (Figure 3). With fewer work-
ers and more old-age dependents, labor produc vity improvements are key for con nued sustained economic growth.

future GDP.

Ensuring basic cogni ve skills for all also helps to make growth inclusive. Beyond aggregate economic growth,
educa on improves the living standards of individuals, since the more educated are able to acquire more and higher-
order skills, making them more produc ve and employable and extending their labor market par cipa on over their
life me, which in turn leads to higher earnings and be er quality of life.3 Educa on is an engine of social mobility:
Human capital is a key asset in income genera on and hence cri cal to reducing poverty and increasing shared
prosperity (Bussolo and Lopez-Calva, 2014).

 “Skills” can be diﬀeren ated into separate, mutually reinforcing dimensions: cogni ve, social-emo onal, and
technical. Figure 4 presents the diﬀeren a on across the diﬀerent dimensions. CogniƟve skills include literacy and         Source: Bodewig and Badiani-Magnusson (2014)

PISA’s scoring system is standardized so that the mean score for each discipline among OECD countries in year 2000 is
500 points, with a standard devia on of 100 points. According to OECD, a 40 point gain in PISA is equivalent to what
students learn in one year of schooling.5

This report is part of a series of World Bank reports that examine PISA data in depth to analyze educa on systems
and provide policy makers with op ons for evidence-based reforms. Due to its focus on policy, the series aims
to address key challenges in several countries, with a focus on improving educa on quality and equity. This report
provides a snapshot of the performance of Hungarian 15-year-olds in PISA both over me and compared with their
peers in other countries. In analyzing Hungary’s performance in PISA, it analyzes the roles of (i) socioeconomic and
family background characteris cs; (ii) school types and school segrega on; and (iii) learning strategies and teaching
prac ces. It also oﬀers policy recommenda ons on how Hungary can make its educa on system more equitable and
be er prepare the next genera on for produc ve employment.


Hungary’s education system

Hungary’s educa on system is aligned with the skills forma on process, by emphasizing early childhood educa on
and by focusing on cogni ve skills-oriented learning content in the beginning of the educa on system. The
compulsory educa on system starts with kindergarten (ISCED 0). Hungary has a wide network of kindergartens, low
associated costs (there are no tui on fees, and children pay only for meals and extracurricular ac vi es; meals are
free for disadvantaged children), and condi onal cash transfers for families with mul ple disadvantages who enroll
their children in preschool before the age of four and maintain stable a endance during the school year.6, 7 Since
2008, local governments have been required to oﬀer free kindergarten placements to children from families with
mul ple disadvantages from the age of three. Preschool a endance has been compulsory for children by age ﬁve,                                             Source: ONISEP
and since 2014 preschool educa on is compulsory from the age of three (this rule enters into force in the 2015–16

what would be expected given its current level of public expenditure per student, although it is similar to that of
neighboring economies. Nonetheless, there are countries with similar levels of investment, like Poland and Latvia,
that do have much higher cogni ve outcomes (Figure 6).

Snapshot of Hungary’s aggregate performance in PISA

At ﬁrst glance, Hungary’s 15-year-olds performed rela vely well in mathema cs, reading, and science in 2012.
Hungary’s PISA 2012 scores were roughly on par with the OECD average and the average of countries in Central
Europe and the Bal cs (see Figure 7). At the same me, Hungary could be doing be er: its 15-year-olds scored worse
in PISA 2012 than several of their neighbors in the Visegrad9 group of countries and in the Bal c countries.

Hungary’s PISA performance in mathema cs and science has weakened of late. Hungary has seen a signiﬁcant
decrease in aggregate mathema cs and science scores, and a slight (but not sta s cally signiﬁcant) decrease in the
reading score in 2012 compared to 2009 (Figure 8, panel A.). The decline in performance was par cularly pronounced                   Source: World Bank staﬀ es mates using PISA data.

In 2012, the OECD introduced a new element of assessment: a problem solving category that measures students’
capacity to respond to non-rou ne analy cal problems in a digital environment in order to achieve their poten al
as construc ve and reﬂec ve ci zens by making use of the new technological tools. Although Hungary performed

kind of outcome an emerging economy with an aging and declining popula on should avoid.                                  Figure 19. Age of ﬁrst selec on between general and voca onal tracks, Hungary and select OECD countries

Hungary needs to adopt policies that promote quality and address socioeconomic disadvantage at the same me.
It is important to note that most students are in their ﬁrst year of secondary educa on when they take the PISA test,
conducted at age 15, so not all of their varying performance can be a ributed to the type of secondary school they
are a ending. However, the analysis points toward the fact that, for reasons not captured by the PISA data, students
in Hungary get selected into diﬀerent tracks in such a way that enrolment and performance across secondary school
types is stra ﬁed along socioeconomic background. This suggests that factors related to school segrega on based on
socioeconomic condi ons, even during basic educa on, do play a role in aggregate performance and the inequity in
outcomes.

Given these performance diﬀerences, improvements in socioeconomic status should improve student performance
in Hungary. However, the strong rela onship between socioeconomic disadvantage and student performance also
means Hungary needs to enhance quality equally across the en re educa on system – and not just among schools
of one type – so that all students can acquire the cogni ve founda on skills needed for good employment outcomes.
The examples of other countries in the EU such as Poland, Estonia, and Finland show that access to high quality
educa on does not need to be limited to only a few students. Poland, Estonia and Finland combine high aggregate          Source: OECD (2010a).

Interna onal experience, including Poland’s, shows that delaying the age of selec on between voca onal and
general tracks can promote quality and equity. It is a reform that is highly relevant for Hungary. Early tracking in
Hungary is resul ng in a high degree of stra ﬁca on of students into diﬀerent types of schools along socioeconomic
lines. It channels a sizeable propor on of Hungarian students into voca onal and voca onal secondary schools, where
quality is signiﬁcantly lower on average than in general secondary schools. In the case of the voca onal school, it also
represents an irreversible choice into a schooling track that is closed in the sense of specializing students early in a
certain trade and not allowing students the possibility of proceeding toward higher educa on.

Interna onal evidence suggests that delaying the selec on of students into voca onal and general tracks, for example
un l a er the end of compulsory educa on, may be a ﬁrst step toward achieving excellence and greater equity. The
example of Poland is instruc ve: In 2000, Poland delayed the selec on into voca onal and general tracks by one year,
un l the age of 15, thereby extending the exposure to general curriculum content as part of a comprehensive reform
of secondary educa on, and it has seen signiﬁcant improvements in aggregate PISA scores and in equity indicators
since then (Jakubowski et al., 2010).


Raising the quality of education in vocational and vocational secondary schools
The performance of students in voca onal and voca onal secondary schools is below the performance of students
in the general academic secondary schools. While some diﬀerence between the three groups may be expected, the
gap in performance is very large and results in signiﬁcant shares of young Hungarians remaining with poor and insuf-
ﬁcient cogni ve founda on skills. It raises the ques on whether the curriculum in voca onal schools and voca onal
secondary schools devotes suﬃcient a en on to general cogni ve content and whether teachers are equipped with
the tools to impart those skills eﬀec vely to the students that need par cular support. This suggests the need to in-
crease the quality of educa on in these two types of schools, even if, as recommended in this report, the age of selec-
  on between voca onal and general secondary schools is raised.


Tackling socioeconomic disadvantage and its impact on learning
Socioeconomic disadvantage has an impact on educa on performance in Hungary, all else equal. Consequently,
raising the skills of the next genera on will involve eﬀorts to improve the socioeconomic condi ons of children and
youth. This will mean, ﬁrst, household-targeted interven ons with an eﬀec ve mix of social and employment services
and beneﬁts and tax incen ves to promote the employability of parents and address mul ple drivers of poverty and
depriva on aﬀec ng families with children. Second, it will mean measures targeted to schools with large shares of
students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds to reduce the eﬀect of socioeconomic disadvantage on
student performance, for example through addi onal teacher and educa onal resources. Extracurricular ac vi es can
provide compensatory learning s mula on for disadvantaged children.

Hungary has a network of schools that follow a model developed in Hejőkeresztúr. This model is based on the
Complex Instruc on Program (CIP) instruc on method from the United States, and oﬀers higher quality educa onal
services to children from disadvantaged backgrounds (See Box 3 for more details.). Addi onally, special incen ves
could be oﬀered to a ract the most talented teachers to work in hard-to-staﬀ schools and preschools, for example
based on the Teach for America/Teach for Bulgaria programs.
