ROMANIA
Led by its strong exports, Romania achieved the fastest GDP growth among EU in the fourth quarter (5.2%,
yoy) and 2013 as a whole (3.5%, yoy). However, domestic performance was still subdued; 1) slowdown in
industrial production in the fourth quarter, 2) no net job creation throughout the year 2013, 3) negative credit
growth. To stimulate its economy, the National Bank of Romania (NBR) lowered both monetary policy rate
and minimum reserve requirements in January-February 2014.

       Real GDP increased by 5.2% in the fourth quarter of 2013 relative to the same period of 2012 (flash
        estimate, not seasonally adjusted) (Fig.1). Public expenditure and strong exports helped exceed the
        median of market forecasts, which were 2.2%.
       Goods exports grew throughout the year 2013 driven by the exports to the Eurozone and non-European
        regions. As for products, machinery & transport equipment and agricultural products led the growth.
        Service exports also grew by 38% as of the third quarter. (Fig.3 and 4).
       Current account deficit narrowed to -1.1% of GDP at the end of 2013 from -4.4% in 2012 (Fig.5).
        Improvement in goods balance (from -5.6% of GDP in 2012 to -2.4% in 2013) and service balance (from
        0.9% of GDP in 2012 to 1.8% in 2013) contributed most.
       Industrial production (IP) was still highest level (the IP index was 122 in December; base 100 = year
        2010), but the pace of its growth slowed down since November 2013 (Fig.6).
       Employment grew only by 0.4% in 2013, and it was just 90% of the 2008 level (Fig.7). Job creation in
        manufacturing, and information & communication (+13,300, and +6,200 workers) was encouraging,
        while energy, financial, construction sector shed jobs (-7,700, -5,800, and -4,000 workers respectively).
       Labor productivity was improving, but not very high (it is same as that in 2011) (Fig.8). Besides, without
        contribution from agricultural sectors (record-high crops in 2013), the productivity growth was flat.
       CPI inflation remained low; 1.6% (year-on-year) at the end of 2013 and further down to 1.1% in January
        2014 (Fig.9 and 10), but there is little concern for deflation due to the steady CORE inflation, which has
        increased four months in a row to 1.7% this January. The NBR set its 2014 inflation forecast as 3.5%,
        citing upside pressure from higher excise duties and a newly announced tax on fuels.
       Credit growth (total, corporations, and households) was still negative in December 2013 (Fig.13).
        Coupled with the subdued demand, deleveraging by foreign-owned banks and high non-performing
        loans ratio (21.9% at the end of 2013) could be the constraints on future growth. (Fig.14 and 15).
       The NBR took additional monetary easing measures to promote lending; 1) lowered policy rate in
        January (from 4.0% to 3.75%) and February (from 3.75% to 3.5%), 2) lowered minimum reserve
        requirements since January 24th, 2014 (Lei-denominated liabilities: from 15% to 12%, the foreign
        currency-denominated liabilities: from 20% to 18%) (Fig.11).

Fiscal consolidation is on track as Romania successfully met its 2013 budget deficit target (2.5% of GDP).
Romania plans to reduce the deficit to 2.2% in 2014, while supporting its economic growth. Its sovereign
borrowing situation is still favorable, even though it experienced a slight increase during the emerging market

volatility in the end of January. Bonds yields are low and, as part of the country’s strategy to lengthen debt
maturity, it issued 30-year bonds for the first time.

          The government achieved the target of 2013 budget deficit, which was 2.5% of GDP (Fig.16). It plans to
           move further to 2.2% in 2014, balancing expenditure for growth projects co-financed with EU-fund and
           tax collection such as one on fuels.
          Public debt (central government) was 35.9% of GDP as of the third quarter 2013 and the authority
           succeeded in lengthening the maturity (short-term debt fell from 5.8% of GDP to 2.6% in 2013) (Fig.17).
           External debt decreased mainly due to the reduction in short-term debt and IMF borrowings (Fig.18).
          The NBR’s official reserves were €32.9 billion in January 2014 (Fig.19). The level was 167% of short-term
           external debt and 6.6 months of import at the end of 2013.
          Bond yields keep the low level (e.g. the 10-year government bond yield was 5.5% on average in 2013,
           and 5.6% as of February 20th 2014), even though the country experienced a short rise in shorter-
           maturity debt (e.g. the 3-year government bond increased by 100 bps from 3.2% on January 18th to 4.2%
           February 20th) (Fig.20 and 21) It issued 30-year bonds (6.5% yields) for the first time on January 14th.
          Exchange rate is stable, while some emerging countries such as Turkey, South Africa, Russia, and
           Hungary experienced a sharp depreciation in January 2014 (Fig. 22 and 23).
          CDS spreads and Euro EMBI Global spreads are also stable; CDS was 184 bps (Fig.24), and Euro EMBI was
           233 bps on February 19th 2014 (Fig. 25).
          The stock market index, even it is shallow in Romania, maintained the record-high level after several
           IPOs of SOEs (Romgaz, and Nuclearelectrica) (Fig.26).


     Romania needs to strengthen its growth by securing fiscal consolidation (growth-enhancing expenditure +
     steady tax collection), financial sector soundness, and pro-business environment (e.g. SOEs reform).
