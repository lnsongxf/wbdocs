                         BOX 1: OPEN INNOVATION AND THE SMART CITY APPROACH


   Open innovation is a methodology to design and implement solutions or services collaboratively by integrating all stakeholders
   in a city (including public institutions, companies, academia, entrepreneurs, and citizens) in the service design process and
   its implementation. The result of these methodologies is a more targeted service solution (since the beneficiaries participate
   in the design process) and more active participations from citizens and other city stakeholders in service delivery and
   implementation (for example, citizens may become active service providers as opposed as passive receivers of city services).
   Introducing and implementing open innovation for city services combined with technology solutions is part of the bottom-up,
   smart city approach (as opposed to a top-down approach where technology solutions and service design and planning are
   imposed by the city government with little or no involvement of citizens).

                        CHALLENGES AND REAL-TIME DEMONSTRATION
                          AS CATALYZERS FOR BEHAVIORAL CHANGE




  The following example shows the power for behavioral change of the identification of real challenges and
                   provision of rapid solutions that can be tested by the challenge providers.

  The public officials of the traffic control center of Gran Concepción faced the constant challenge of having
  to react to traffic incidents and flows of traffic in the city with limited information for their decision-making.
  The city has a network of sensors and CCTVs. However, it is insufficient to cover the Gran Concepción
  area. CCTVs were particularly limited for an urban area of the size and population of Gran Concepción and
  did not cover much of the traffic infrastructure. Sensors were even more limited. As a result, the public
  officials from the traffic control center could not realize oft traffic congestions or incidences through their
  monitoring systems. Instead, and as reported by these officials, citizens suffering the traffic incidence
  would call the local radio broadcaster news service (Radio BioBio) to complain, which would, in turn, call
  the local politician responsible for traffic management in the area and demand responsibilities through
  live broadcasting. Understandably, this caused tension through the command chain, with an urgent call
  for fixing the incidence. This was reported to be a very stressful situation by the traffic control officials,
  who had to physically displace to where the incidence was happening to understand how to respond
                                        while pressed for urgent solutions.

  The concept of technology solution developed to address this challenge was a Citizen Reporting App
  (mobile application) whereby citizens could report directly traffic incidences through their phones with
  automatic geolocation. This reporting would feed the traffic control center’s dashboard in real time. This
  concept was co-developed by the traffic officials and the Bank and MTT team. In order to demonstrate
  how this app would work and what kind of information the dashboard would show in practice, the team
  developed a rapid prototyping using an Android phone and open software for geolocation and reporting.
  The prototype was then demonstrated in real-time to these officials, which could use it and see how
  it would work in practice to address their problem. After this demonstration, the public officials that
  participated in this workshop from the traffic control team became champions of the activity throughout
               the process and beyond (through the Ministry of Transport strategy – see above).

       DESPIERTA: HOW AN OPEN INNOVATION PROCESS CAN SOLVE PUBLIC
             SERVICES CHALLENGES WITH UNEXPECTED INGENUITY


  Despierta is one of the two concepts of technology solutions that won the MueveTT competition. It
  was developed by a team of students from the local universities with the aim of improving the travel
                           experience in Gran Concepción public transportation.

  In Gran Concepción, the main mean of public transportation is the micro-bus, a fleet small busses that
  follow routes around the conurbation. This micro-buses are managed by private companies, which have a
  concession for a specific routes. Although the micro-buses follow a route, there are no formal stops, and
  the bus can be hail in any point through its route. To request the bus to stop, passengers request verbally
                                       the driver to stop where needed.

  The initial concept of Despierta, as conceived by the team at the ideation part of the competition, was
  a mobile app whereby the user could set the geolocation of the destination through a user-friendly map
  interface (e.g., google maps) for the mobile phone to alert the user via an alarm 200 meters before arriving
  destination. The thought behind it related to the personal experience of the team’s members using Gran
  Concepción micro-buses. As a university town, students are one of the main users of the micro-buses
  in the conurbation. When going to classes in the morning, it is often the case that students get slept on
  route, missing their stop and needing to wait for the micro-bus to finish the route and come back to arrive
                          to the missed destination. The app aimed to solve this issue.

  The Bank team, together with the local and municipal government officials serving as mentors in the
  competition, worked closely with the competition teams to help them in developing their concepts and
  maximize social impact to support the public goals behind the competition challenges (see Box 2). This
  support has the form of suggestions and ideas within the ideation and brainstorming process of the
  competition teams. Within this process, the Bank team suggested to the Despierta team to consider
  the disabled blind population as a target for this mobile app concept. The team responded positively,
  and expanded their initial concept for the mobile app to include specific features for the disabled blind
  population. The final concept of the app that was presented to the final and that won the competition was
  designed for the disabled blind population. The mobile app would allow a blind person to ask the phone
  via verbal instructions to alert her when the micro-bus is arriving to hail it, and then program the phone to
  alert via a sound alarm of the proximity (200 meters) of the destination to request the micro-bus to stop.

  With this design, Despierta become an ingenious solution to address a public service gap in the public
  transportation infrastructure in Gran Concepción, which could not be access by the disabled blind
  population. Instead of the traditional solutions applied to make the public infrastructure applied to
  disabled blind population (e.g., braille signaling, physical signaling in pavement and bus stops, etc.) a
  team of students-entrepreneurs provided a quick solution that can be scaled up rapidly through the
  whole public transportation infrastructure of the conurbation with no cost to the local and municipal
  government. Furthermore, as a startup, this solution would also create entrepreneurship and be a source
                                                of employment.

  Although there is no common definition of an innovation hub, this concept can be applied to define the evolution of
  collaboration spaces into community managers that coordinate or integrate many of the other functions of collaboration
  spaces such as coworking spaces, maker spaces, fablabs, accelerators, living labs, and urban labs (see source below for
  description of these spaces). Innovation hubs’ main function is to coordinate all actors of the ecosystem and help manage the
  community of tech-innovators and entrepreneurs to grow sustainably. Many of these innovation hubs enjoy the participation
  of the most relevant actors of the technology innovation ecosystem, including entrepreneurs, universities, private sector,
  collaboration spaces, accelerators, incubators, other providers of seed capital, community managers, and government —
  particularly city government. Some of these innovation hubs have collaboration spaces in their facilities, such as co-working
  and maker spaces, while others coordinate their functions with those spaces. Typically, these hubs will phase out their
  other functions when there are enough offerings for the community provided by third parties. Examples vary from Ruta N,
  Medellin (which is part of the city government), to NUMA in Paris (which is a grass-root hub built with the community of local
  entrepreneurs), with Forum Virium, Helsinki, as a middle point (a PPP model owned 50 percent by the city and 50 percent
  by the ecosystem’s stakeholders). Citilab, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Waag Society, Amsterdam, and Urban Lab, Barcelona, are
  other examples of innovation hubs. The World Bank designed and implemented the innovation hub model in the Lebanon:
  Mobile Internet Ecosystem Project (MIEP). This is the model applied to this activity. (For more details of such model see the
  Project Document).

  MTT approved the Smart City Strategy embracing the smart city bottom-up approach implemented in
        Smart City Gran Concepción and calling for its implementing this model at national level.

  Following the strategy, the Smart City Unit has been implementing open innovation competitions in six
  regions (Temuco, Puerto Montt, Concepción, Antofagasta, Coquimbo and Valparaiso) under the MueveTT
          brand and open innovation methodology developed under Smart City Gran Concepción.

  CORFO developed the Regional Strategic Smart City program with the Metropolitan Region of Santiago
  de Chile to implement the bottom-up smart city model to Santiago de Chile. This program follows the
  MoU MTT-Regional Metropolitan Government to support the development of the bottom-up smart city
        model in Santiago that was signed in the Results Workshop of Smart City Gran Concepción.

  The Regional Metropolitan Government of Santiago created the Innovation Fund for Competitiveness
  together with the MTT to develop open innovation methodologies with the universities of Santiago to
                develop regional technological platforms and support the Smart City model.

  CONYCIT developed an initiative to link university research and private sector companies to develop
  technology solutions to support the smart city model following open innovation and collaboration models
                             in part inspired by Smart City Concepción activity.

  Chile’s GovLab, in collaboration with the Smart City Unit of MTT, is working on three government
  challenges in the area of transport (out of a total of 10 government challenges) following open innovation
   and co-creation methodologies. These challenges are related to Smart City Gran Concepción activity.

  As a results of the skills and knowledge gained through the Smart City Gran Concepción activity (see
  below) the Smart City Unit of MTT work program include: i) catalyzing PPPs and government funds to
  develop open innovation processes for public goals, and ii) catalyze the entrepreneurship ecosystem
  through universities, promoting the development of open innovation competition and supporting their
                                             implementation.

  Finally, the work accomplished for the MTT through the Smart City Unit has been highlighted as a
                  reference case by other public organizations in Chile and Latin America.
