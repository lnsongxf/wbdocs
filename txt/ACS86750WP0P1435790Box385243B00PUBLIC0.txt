     Burundi: Building Skills for Coffee and Other Priority Sectors
                                       I.    INTRODUCTION

    1. With limited land, capital and a fast growing population, Burundi’s main asset is
       its youthful population. Its main challenge is also to create good quality jobs for its
       youth. About two-thirds of the population is under the age of 25 years, and about half
       under the age of 17 years. The population growth rate (2.4 percent) is high, while the
       population density is one of the highest in Africa (310 inhabitants per sq km).1
    2. With low levels of educational attainment and poor health status, the quality of
       this young population is poor. The agriculture sector has absorbed a large
       proportion of the growth in the population, leading to a decline in average
       productivity. Migration to urban areas has increased, with most low-skilled or
       illiterate young people being absorbed in low productivity employment in the
       informal service sector. Open unemployment among urban youth is also high, at
       about 15 percent.
    3. After more than 13 years of conflict ending in 2000, and a period of modest
       recovery, Burundi has the opportunity to stimulate growth. The World Bank’s
       Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) recommends that growth policy should
       focus on (i) closing the infrastructure gap; (ii) gaining from regional integration; (iii)
       improving the business environment; (iv) promoting new growth sources; and (v)
       strengthening the country’s fiscal position.2 The Government of Burundi’s second
       Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II, 2012-2015) has identified potential
       growth sectors such as agriculture (i.e., key staple foods, milk and meat, and
       diversifying exports beyond coffee and tea), mining and tourism. Similarly, the joint
       World Bank (WB)-International Finance Corporation (IFC) Business Plan for the
       country emphasizes the need for sector-specific approaches, in addition to economy-
       wide ones, such as in agribusiness (coffee/ tea/ sugar), telecom and energy.
    4. Burundi is making strides in creating one of the “fundamentals” of job creation
       – investment climate. Improving the business environment has become a
       government priority since 2011, when Burundi ranked third-last in the World Bank’s
       Doing Business report. Having made it easier to establish businesses, deal with
       construction permits and register property, and having reinforced investor protection,
       Burundi has jumped 17 places from last year to 140th out of 185 countries in the 2014
       Doing Business ranking.3 Regional integration within the East African Community
       (EAC) is seen as an important channel for growth and competitiveness thanks to
       connective infrastructures and sustained business environment improvements. There

         is however, less progress in addressing issues such as land ownership, which in
         Burundi have been the source of conflict, and without its resolution, will undermine
         the conditions for broad based growth.
    5.   Investing in the skills of the population is critical for the success of this growth
         strategy and for creating productive employment opportunities for Burundi’s
         youth. Identifying growth sectors and aligning skills for future requirements will
         enhance productivity, increase saving and investments in growth, and in the longer
         term will serve to enhance employment opportunities for a larger number of
         Burundians. At the same time strengthening foundational skills will serve to improve
         the entrepreneurial capacity of those who will continue to be absorbed in the informal
         sector4 in the foreseeable future.
    6.   The Government of Burundi is introducing a major reform in the education
         sector which is going to significantly impact skills in Burundi. Reform of the
         schooling system will lead to universalization of 9 years of basic education, replacing
         the current primary cycle that consists of 6 years, followed by two years of lower
         secondary education. 5 This reform, if coupled with investments and policies to
         improve quality, has the potential of increasing the availability of entry level workers
         with basic literacy and numeracy skills. In parallel, the government has also launched
         reforms of the technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and higher
         education system (HE).
    7.   This analytical report will contribute to defining a skills development strategy
         for Burundi to complement the growth strategy. It looks at the potential impact of
         the basic education reform on the quantity and education attainment of the working
         age population. Further it looks at the skills demands that are likely to emerge if
         Burundi upgrades along the value chain in selected sectors to ensure strong alignment
         of occupation competencies in growth sectors. As part of the consultation for this
         analytical work, the Government of Burundi identified three sectors for this study:
         coffee; agri-business and energy, more specifically electrical energy 6.
    8.   The chosen sectors, particularly coffee and agriculture have the potential for
         high growth, while energy is critical for any growth strategy. One third of
         agricultural producers have some involvement in the coffee sector. It is also the
         principal export and source of foreign exchange for Burundi. Agribusiness also has
         large potential for growth and with the agricultural sector employing almost ninety
         percent of the population, has strong backward linkages on employment. Electricity
4
  Private sector refers to the formal private sector in Burundi and not to the non-formalized private
entrepreneurs in the informal sector. For the latter, the term informal sector is employed.
5
  Until 2021 cohorts from old system (primary (6 years) plus lower secondary (2 years)) and newly reformed
system (9 years of basic education) will be leaving school simultaneously. After 2021, all those exiting the
system with completed basic education will do so with 9 years of schooling.
6
  Given Burundi’s potential to develop electrical energy a choice was made to focus on this specific sub -sector
within the overall energy sector. Burundi has several large rivers along its borders and throughout the country
that provide opportunities for domestic and regional hydroelectricity generation operations, while clear skies
provide good opportunities for the effective use of solar energy. Furthermore, regional energy partnerships
present opportunities for Burundi to enhance its own energy security through coordination of policies and
projects with other East African countries (Bamber, P., Guinn A., and Gereffi, G. 2014b).

        indirectly has a major impact on the economy as whole, even though the direct
        employment generation may be small.
    9. The report is structured around the following key questions:
       What are the anticipated results of the new basic education reform, and its pace of
          implementation, for the education levels of potential new workers, and of the
          population, over the next 10-15 years? (Section II)
       What are the potential upgrading strategies for moving up the value chain in the
          selected sectors, what new jobs are likely to emerge and what are the implications
          for skills demands in the selected sectors? What is the current supply and how can
          these skills gaps be met? Which sub-systems along the skills continuum should be
          targeted for each sector? (The informal training providers/ apprenticeships; the
          formal TVET; universities or post-secondary education, etc.). What should public
          intervention focus on? (Section III)
       What is the current framework for strategic direction, demand-led approach and
          coordination of the TVET system? (Section IV)
    10. The analysis uses a combination of methods to answer the research questions: (i)
        a quantitative simulation model to assess the impacts of the implementation of the
        basic education reform on the educational attainment of the potential working age
        population; (ii) uses the Global Value Chain (GVC) framework to identify the
        upgrading strategies in the selected sectors and workforce development needs; the
        approach is based on secondary analysis of relevant country and industry materials,
        expert interviews with key firms and other stakeholders involved in these industries
        and benchmarking against other countries at similar levels of the value chain; 7 (iii)
        the World Bank Human Development Network Education (HDNED) SABER8
        Workforce Development (WfD) Tool to assess the institutional and policy framework
        for the supply of skills. Based on the analysis a summary of priority interventions for
        workforce development is proposed. A detailed analysis of the education sub-cycles
        and costing estimates of the proposed recommendations were not included in the
        scope of the analysis.

  The Systems Approach for Better Education Results – SABER collects and analyses policy data on education
systems making use of evidence-based frameworks to highlight the policies and institutions that matter most to
promote learning for all children and youth. One of SABER instruments focuses on workforce development and
this is the one used to inform the report. http://saber.worldbank.org/index.cfm.

    II.     IMPACT OF THE BASIC EDUCATION REFORM ON EDUCATIONAL
                        ATTAINMENT OF THE POPULATION

    12. Out of a total labor force of about 4.3 million, 3.8 million (87.8 percent) were
        employed in agriculture and 132,000 (3.1 percent) in trade.9 These were the two
        largest sectors in 2010. The next largest employer was the public sector with 112,000
        employees (2.6 percent). Together, manufacturing, mining, construction and transport
        employed just 62,000 people (1.5 percent), and 131,000 people were involved in
        other sectors (3 to 4 percent). Open unemployment was about 1.8 percent. The
        decline in open unemployment from about 7 percent in 2006 reflects the absorption of
        labor in agriculture which increased its share from 81.5 percent, resulting in a decline
        in rural unemployment. For the 15-24 age group, urban unemployment remains
        around 15 percent.
    13. The educational level of the labor force of Burundi is low, based on data from
        2010 (Figure 1). Almost half of the 15-64 age population had attended primary school
        as their highest level of educational attainment, and 43 percent had no formal
        education whatsoever. Only 11 percent had attended secondary school, while 2
        percent had some post-secondary education. The proportion of the labor force with
        more than primary education was thus very low in comparison to other countries,
        even when compared to other post-conflict countries such as Sierra Leone.

     14. With the abolition of school fees, gross primary school enrolment rate increased
         to 132 percent in 2010, up from 82 percent in 2005. The ratio of girls-to-boys in
         primary schools is almost 100 percent. However, Burundi remains off-track regarding
         the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of 100 percent completion of the primary
         cycle. Its completion rate stands at just 56 percent, up from 34 percent in 2005, due to
         high rates of drop-out. Repetition rates remain high. School hours fall short of
         international norms and teacher distribution across the country is skewed, and overall
         learning levels are low.
     15. Despite fast growth since 2000, enrollments in post-basic levels of education are
         fairly low. Between 2000 and 2010, the Gross Enrolment Rate (GER) grew from 12
         to 31 percent for lower secondary, and from 3 to 7 percent for upper secondary
         schooling. In absolute numbers in 2009-2010, upper secondary schools enrolled about
         35,000 students (Table 1). Technical Education was attended by about 15,000
         students, Vocational Education by 5,000 students, and Higher Education by 29,000.
         Thus, the post-basic levels of education enrolled a total of about 85,000 students. In
         Technical, Vocational and Higher Education, a considerable portion of students
         attended private institutions, particularly in higher education where 58 percent of
         enrollments were in private universities. Girls were at a considerable disadvantage in
         terms of access to post-basic levels of education.

     16. The Government launched the basic education reform in September 2012, which
         if implemented consistently will have a significant impact on the education levels
         of young people. Instead of two cycles of primary and lower secondary, separated by
         a selection examination, young people can get nine years of universal basic education

11
   Centre d’Enseignement des Métiers (CEM) are low level technical institutions which provide technical
training to students that completed primary education. Students completing a minimum of eight years of
schooling can access professional training delivered in a variety of institutions.

         that could potentially equip them with the foundational skills for work or for
         continuation into secondary education. Other policy measures include: (i) reduction
         of repetition rate; (ii) increase in actual teaching hours; (iii) revision of school
         program and curricula; (iv) strengthening the system of initial and continuing training
         of teachers; and (v) improvement of management and control. Beyond basic
         education, the numbers of vocational and professional education institutions will be
         increased in order to provide opportunities for young people to acquire practical and
         trade related skills with the objective that at least 20 percent of graduates of the
         traditional educational system can become self-employed.
     17. The basic education reform, if implemented successfully, has the potential of
         rapidly upgrading the educational attainment of potential new workers. The
         impact of this reform is studied using a simulation model (see Box1 for details of the
         methodology; Table A1 in Annex A provides the specific promotion, repetition and
         transition rates used in each of the scenarios of the simulation). The projections
         depend on the current and expected demographic trends of the population in Burundi,
         and the current school enrollment, transition, promotion and repetition rates in each
         cycle of the education system.
     18. In 2010, approximately, 211,000 young Burundians left the education system
         (See Table A2 in Annex 1). Approximately 67 percent of them had not completed
         primary education12; another 28 percent had completed primary but had not
         completed lower secondary education13; and 3 percent had completed lower
         secondary but not upper secondary, while 1 percent had finished upper secondary and
         1 percent had completed higher education. In absolute numbers, approximately 3,500
         youth left the system with a lower secondary qualification, 2,700 with an upper
         secondary qualification, and 2,800 with higher education.
     19. The implementation of the education reform affects the numbers of those
         entering the labor force, as more young people continue their education (Figure
         2). If the baseline trend in parameters continues (Scenario 1), the number of school-
         leavers increases from about 211,000 to 458,000 by 2025. However, a rapid
         implementation of the basic education reform (Scenarios 2 and 3), leads to a
         significant drop in the numbers who would be available to work by 2018, as more
         young people choose to stay on at school. Thereafter these numbers increase, as the
         graduates from basic education leave the system.
     20. If recent trends were to persist (Scenario 1), with respect to key education
         parameters such as access, repetition, and promotion, the education profile of
         potential new workers will change by 2025, but not dramatically as in other
         scenarios. By that year the numbers of school-leavers will have doubled to 458,000.
         The share of those that do not complete primary declines to 50 percent, while those

12
   Not completed primary means those who had no schooling or some primary education.
13
   Basic education reform covers 1-9 years of schooling but in the text the analysis is broken down to discussion
of primary (1-6 years) and lower secondary (7-9) to highlight that until 2012 the two systems will be in parallel,
i.e. 6 years of primary plus 2 years of lower secondary, and 9 (6+3) years of basic. After 2021, everyone will
exit with 9 years of basic education.
                                                        6
                                who have completed primary but not lower secondary will rise to 37 percent. Seven
                                percent will have completed lower secondary but not upper secondary, while 5
                                percent and 1 percent, respectively, will have completed secondary and higher
                                education. In absolute numbers, approximately 29,000 will leave with lower
                                secondary qualifications; 22,000 will leave with an upper secondary qualification;
                                and 5,000 individuals will have higher education qualifications.

    21. With the rapid implementation of the basic education reform (Scenario 2), the
        education attainment of potential new entrants will improve dramatically once
        the graduates of basic education reform leave the system. By 2025, the total
        number of school-leavers ready to enter the workforce will fall with respect to
        Scenario 1 (310,000 compared to 458,000), as the absolute numbers of those
        continuing onto lower secondary education increases. Of this, only 16 percent will not
        have completed primary schooling. Those with primary but less than lower secondary
        will equal 22 percent, while those who complete lower secondary but not upper
        secondary will jump up significantly to 41 percent. Even those completing upper
        secondary and higher education will rise to 18 percent and 3 percent, respectively. In
        absolute numbers, by 2025, 117,000 school-leavers will have a lower secondary
        qualification, 56,000 will have an upper secondary qualification, and slightly more
        than 9,000 people will have completed higher education in that year.
    22. An even more aggressive push to expand the upper secondary education system
        (Scenario 3) will further reduce the number of potential new entrants, but
        similarly also improve the education profile. The number of people who could
        potentially enter the labor force in 2025 is approximately 266,000, of which 19

                                                                                  7
         percent will have not completed primary schooling, while those with complete
         primary but less than lower secondary equals 26 percent14. Those exiting with
         complete lower secondary but less than upper secondary falls to 20 percent as more
         young people are staying on to undertake secondary education. The percentage of
         school-leavers with upper secondary jumps significantly to 31 percent, while those
         with higher education will rise to 4 percent. In terms of numbers, 83,000 school-
         leavers will have completed upper secondary, and 11,000 will have completed higher
         education.
     23. These simulations show the powerful impact of education policy reform in
         improving the education profile of future workers in Burundi. However, given
         resource and capacity constraints, Burundi will find it difficult to rapidly implement
         the basic education reform, much less expand secondary education with quality. A
         more gradual approach to the reform (Scenario 4) projects that 313,000 young people
         will leave the education system by 2025. Of these young people, 26 percent will not
         have completed primary education, 49 percent will have completed primary but not
         lower secondary, while 11 percent will have completed lower secondary but not
         upper secondary education. Twelve percent will have completed upper secondary,
         while 2 percent will complete higher education. Compared to Scenario 3, the numbers
         exiting with a lower secondary qualification will fall from 40,000 to 27,500; with
         upper secondary will fall from 83,000 to 39,000; and with higher education, will fall
         from 11,000 to 7,500. Nevertheless, the gains in educational attainment of new
         entrants are significantly better from Scenario 1.
     24. These scenarios also improve the educational attainment of the working–age
         population (15-64 years), although only gradually as the pool of more qualified
         students leave the education system. The educational attainment of this age group –
         a stock variable - is an indicator of the quality of the human capital available to the
         economy and is important in improving its overall productivity. Figure 3 illustrates
         education attainment under all four scenarios. Compared to 2010, all scenarios
         produce an improvement in educational attainment by 2025. Even under Scenario 1—
         where baseline trends of the past 5 years continue and there is no basic education
         reform—there is an improvement, particularly in the number of people with no
         schooling or incomplete primary schooling falling.
     25. Basic education reform and the accelerated reform strategy outlined in Scenario
         2 and Scenario 3 have the desired effect in improving education attainment
         beyond lower secondary of the working age population. The percentage of the
         working age population with completed lower secondary but less than upper
         secondary doubles between Scenarios 1 and 2 from 6 to 12.5 percent. Similarly the
         number completing upper secondary rises by 1 percent between Scenario 1 and
         Scenario 3. Although the percentage with no or incomplete primary schooling rises in
14
   Under Scenario 2 and Scenario 3 the absolute number of school-leavers who do not complete primary, and
who complete primary but have less than lower secondary is the same, but as a proportion of the total school-
leavers in Scenario 3 it is higher, as the absolute number of school-leavers under Scenario 3 is fewer than
Scenario 2 (266,000 vs. 310,000).
                                                     8
    Scenario 3 compared to Scenario 2, this reflects the smaller flow of school-leavers in
    Scenario 3, and as a proportion of the total stock, the percent share of those with no or
    incomplete primary schooling rises.
26. The basic education reform is likely to have a more significant impact on the
    working age population 20, 30 and 40 years down the road. Figure 3 reflects
    projected attainment for only a 15 year period. The first complete cohort with a total 9
    years of schooling will only come out in 2021. Overall educational attainment of the
    stock of labor will improve gradually, beyond 2025, when new entrants with higher
    educational attainment will begin to replace the existing stock of the working age
    population.

  The Simulation Model for Projecting Educational Attainment of Potential Workers
                 (School Leavers) and the Working Age Population
Using 2010 baseline data, the simulation model produces two sets of results for the period 2011 to 2025: (A) the
numbers of those who leave the formal education system at different points in time. These constitute potential
new entrants into the labor force (flow) and the model shows their educational attainment; and (B) the stock of
the working age population (15-64 years) with different levels of education.

Structure of the model
        The formal education system in this simulation includes primary, lower secondary (or basic education
        after the reform), upper secondary (divided between general and technical), and tertiary. The model
        uses baseline enrolment figures for 2010 and projects enrolments until 2025, using the estimated
        population growth rate and assumed targets for parameters for access, repetition, completion, transition
        and promotion rates, which are to be achieved by 2018. The parameters used in the simulation are
        influenced by both supply and demand. On the supply side are factors such as policy (which can
        influence, for instance, the repetition and promotion rates), physical proximity of schools (which can
        influence the access rate), and class size and teacher quality (which can influence drop out, repetition
        and promotion). On the demand side, parents’ propensity to invest in their children’s education
        changes as the demographic structures evolve, as parents’ garner more information on the benefits of
        education and when, as a positive externality of economic growth, parents become less reliant on their
        children working. However, for the purposes of these projections, we treat these parameters as
        exogenous.

    A. Educational Attainment of School-Leavers (Potential Workers)

        Students leave the education system at various points in time, because they do not enroll in primary
        education, drop out of the education system before they complete a cycle, or do not continue to the
        next cycle. School-leavers are potential new entrants into the workforce. Not all of these school-leavers
        end up working. Some may choose to remain at home, care for children or the elderly. However,
        without detailed information on labor force participation rates for these specific age groups, which is
        not available, it is difficult to estimate the actual entrants into the labor force. The model provides the
        educational profile of these potential new workers.

    B. Educational Attainment of the Working Age Population (15-64 year age group)

        The educational attainment of the existing working age population is calculated from the 2010 DHS.
        This figure is combined with the age specific mortality rates to calculate the numbers of individuals
        who remain in the population over the projection period, with specific levels of educational attainment.
        To this number, we add the young people who leave the education system with different levels of
        education, under each of the 4 scenarios, which gives the projected educational attainment of the
        working age population for each scenario.

Scenario 1 – Baseline Trend represents what will happen if the Government of Burundi continues with the
implementation of universal primary education, without implementing the basic education reform. It assumes
that promotion rates within primary and lower secondary improve gradually and repetition rates also decline
gradually based on recent trends.
Scenario 2 – Basic Education Reform examines the impact of rapid implementation of the 2012 basic
education reform by 2021. This is achieved by lowering repetition rates in all classes and significantly
improving promotion rates between Grades 1-9. It does not however, improve the transition rate to secondary
education, although enrolments expand due to the expansion of basic education.
Scenario 3 – Promoting Secondary is a more ambitious trajectory in which the Government implements the
basic education reform in Scenario 2, while also increasing entry into general or technical post-basic education
by 2021.
Scenario 4 – Gradual Basic Education Reform reflects a scenario which targets improvement in all sub-
cycles of education system as in Scenario 3, but more gradually then under Scenario 3. Given resource and
capacity constraints, this may provide a more realistic assessment of what can be achieved.

                                                       10
     27. The dynamics of output and the employment-growth elasticities by sector are the
         key determinants of the number and location of new jobs. For economy as a
         whole, for the period 2006-2010, the employment-output elasticity was 1.0 percent.
         However, this reflects wide variations across sectors. In the agriculture sector, the
         employment elasticity was negative (-3.1 percent): even though employment
         expanded by 24 percent, average productivity fell by 8 percent. Hence, the jobs
         created in agriculture were low quality jobs, with the sector acting as residual
         employer. In most other sectors, employment elasticities were less than 1 percent.
         Only in manufacturing was the elasticity high, at 13 percent, but this was achieved
         through a substantial drop in employment (-46 percent) accompanied by a modest fall
         in value added (3 percent)15.
     28. If it continues on its recent growth trajectory, Burundi will not be able to absorb
         the hundreds of thousands of young people exiting the education system each
         year in better quality jobs. Productivity and output must increase in agriculture, as
         well as in sectors such as construction, trade, transport and manufacturing, which
         should absorb a greater share of the new entrants into the labor force.
     29. Recent employment projections undertaken for low income Sub-Saharan
         African (SSA) countries give an indication of where new jobs are likely to be
         created if the economy grows more rapidly. 16 Based on the assumption that growth
         rates will replicate the past decade of growth (averaging 4.5 to 6 percent per annum)
         and there will not be a major external shock, the predictions for low income countries
         including Burundi are as follows:
          Agriculture will remain the dominant sector, accounting for 60 percent of
              employment even in 2020;
          Even with industrial sector growth averaging 7 percent, the share of industrial
              employment will remain around 3 percent;
          Employment in household enterprises is likely to grow the fastest, with the share
              of employment increasing by 4 percent to 22 percent. Wage services will account
              for about 12 percent share of total employment.
     30. The implementation of the basic education reform and other education reforms
         represents both an opportunity and a challenge. It is an opportunity because it
         raises the foundational skills of young people in Burundi, the majority of whom will
         have nine years of education. The entry of these better equipped people into
         employment can improve productivity (and hence earnings) across the board,
         including in agriculture. The projections of the educational attainment of school
         leavers show that the numbers are more than adequate to sustain growth in every
         sector. The basic education reform also imposes the imperative of creating better
         quality jobs, as better educated young people seek improved economic opportunities.

                                                   11
31. Implementation of the basic education reform also requires paying attention to
    targeted expansion of secondary education and higher education, without
    compromising quality. As the projections show, there will be greater numbers of
    young people seeking to enter higher levels of education, as they complete basic
    education. Experience of neighboring countries, such as Tanzania and Uganda, show
    that the uncontrolled expansion of secondary education leads to rapid deterioration in
    quality, which is difficult to access. At the same time, not providing for gradual
    expansion of secondary education and tertiary education will exclude the poor and
    also may inhibit the growth of a more skilled labor force. Hence, immediate attention
    needs to be paid to reforming the content of programs and teaching methods at post-
    basic levels, while introducing new methods of expanding provision, including
    through the private sector and/or distance education.
32. Nevertheless, the majority of those who will leave the education system will
    continue to be employed in the agriculture or the informal sector. The basic
    education reform will strengthen foundational skills which will enhance their capacity
    to be productive in self-employment. Additionally complementary interventions,
    besides enhancing human capital, will be required to equip these young people with
    the necessary means to translate their skills into economic surplus such as access to
    financing, land and mentoring and support.

              III.     SKILLS DEVELOPMENT FOR PRIORITY SECTORS

     33. This section summarizes the key findings from three background papers which
         analyzed three important sectors in Burundi using the Global Value Chain
         methodology. 17 The GVC framework is a sector-specific approach that evaluates a
         full range of activities that need to be carried out to bring a product from conception
         to its end use. 18 Specifically, it looks at the shifting organization of global industries
         by examining the characteristics and dynamics of different actors, including lead
         firms at the global level, whose requirements establish the performance, price,
         quality, terms of delivery and product and process standards for local suppliers. The
         analysis proceeds through the following steps: (i) mapping all the segments of the
         value chain and corresponding production activities; (ii) locating the country’s
         position in the value chain by examining the activities that it performs; (iii) identify
         possible trajectories for upgrading along the value chain so that the actors in the
         country can capture more of the value; (iv) analyze the human capital and job profiles
         involved in each segment of the value chain and identify the type of skills required in
         each sector; and (v) provide guidance for formulating workforce development (WfD)
         strategies that need to accompany selected upgrading strategies.19
     34. One of the strengths of the sector-specific studies and the primary focus of this
         summary is the human capital needs of upgrading strategies, which are often
         overlooked. The GVC upgrading strategy is often adopted without fully unpacking
         the skills acquisition needs or the feasibility of enhancing knowledge transfer through
         the chain. This “black box” approach implicitly assumes that the supply of education
         and training will automatically adjust, ignoring market failures which prevent this
         adjustment from automatically happening. As a result, complementary policies on
         education and training to support upgrading along the value chain are often ignored.
         The examples of Costa Rica, Chile, Rwanda, and Ethiopia show that countries have
         been most successful when they have included specific WfD interventions in their

research approach involves secondary analysis of relevant country and industry materials, expert interviews
with key firms and other stakeholders (including producer associations, NGOs, donors, government, education
and training institutions) involved in these industries and benchmarking against other countries at similar levels
of the value chain.”

   This summary report only selective presents the main messages of the sector specific GVC studies. A more
detailed analysis of the GVC strategies for these priority sectors is given in the main reports. Details of specific
segments and markets where there are opportunities in these three sectors are outlined there.

    upgrading strategies. For instance, Rwanda’s strategy to position itself as producer of
    specialty coffee included skills development on risk management in the financial
    sector, plantation management, implementation of traceability and personnel
    management at washing stations, which in fact, were all transferable skills to the
    agribusiness sector.
35. The sector specific analysis focuses on the types of skills that arise with different
    upgrading strategies but does not provide specific projections of the number of
    jobs requiring those skills. The GVC methodology developed by Center on
    Globalization Governance and Competitiveness at Duke University builds on
    conventional GVC analysis to look at skills by expanding on the type of jobs that
    arise with different upgrading strategies. The approach used is not the best suited to
    providing projections of employment generation, as these numbers are dependent on
    the particular path a country ultimately takes and this in turn determines the number
    of jobs created. This can vary widely depending on many factors, including the local
    institutional context.
36. As shown in the previous section, Burundi’s basic education reform, if
    implemented successfully, will enable hundreds of thousands of young people to
    enter the labor market with better knowledge and skills over the next decade.
    This provides a pool of labor which will serve as a strong foundation for any
    upgrading strategy, as the majority of jobs will continue to require relatively low
    education and skills levels, but will require workers to be adaptable and be able to
    learn new technologies, standards and processes. However, in addition, upgrading
    along the value chain will also create additional new jobs especially at the middle
    technician and highly skilled level, although few in numbers as compared to the
    numbers of potential entrants; if not met, these skill gaps can act as an impediment to
    upgrading. If the skill gaps are met by foreign workers as a long term strategy, the
    diffusion of technology and business practices, and the growth of local suppliers is
    inhibited.
37. The three sectors selected for this study – coffee, agribusiness and electricity –
    reflect the Government of Burundi’s priorities. The coffee sector is the country’s
    main source of revenue, contributing for 69 percent of export income in 2011. An
    estimated 590,000 to 800,000 households (approximately one in two) and between 1
    million and 1.6 million people are involved in its cultivation. The sector faces huge
    competitive pressures from new producing countries such as Vietnam. However,
    Burundi also enjoys specific competitive advantage in Arabica coffee, its main
    product, including its exceptional climate with multiple growing seasons.
    Agribusiness product categories accounting for approximately 80 percent of the total
    gross value of crop production in Burundi include coffee, tea, fruits and vegetables,
    root and tuber crops, sugarcane and palm fruit. The majority of households are
    involved in producing multiple crops. Upgrading in both these sectors offers the
    chance of improving the livelihood of millions of people and offsetting recent trends
    of declining productivity (in the coffee sector as well as agriculture as a whole), and

                                          14
    incomes. The electricity sector, on the other hand, is not a major employer, and was
    selected for its potential economy wide impact.
38. Three types of upgrading strategies are distinguished in the GVC framework:
    product, process, and functional upgrading. In developing countries, product and
    process upgrading are easier first steps, as they may require relatively minor
    investments in skills, equipment or adjustments in the production process. Functional
    upgrading, which incorporates additional functional activities of the chain (e.g.
    moving into branding activities), is highly sought after as it enables a higher return.
    However, this is often quite difficult because of the higher skills and capital
    requirements and barriers to entry.
39. This section reviews each of three sectors covering the following points: the
    characteristics of the GVCs; Burundi’s current position in the GVCs; potential
    upgrading strategies for Burundi and their requirements; the current and new job
    profiles; the gaps in education and training vis-a-vis the skills requirements of new
    jobs; and policies and programs to address these gaps.

    marketing, which typically take place in diverse locations around the world.

    coffee GVC.

41. The production process for coffee requires several inputs, including physical inputs
    (seedlings, fertilizers and sprays), land and labor. During the production stage,
    coffee trees are raised and cultivated on large estates or on small farms and it takes
    approximately 3 to 4 years for a tree to become productive. During the processing
    stage, the coffee cherry is cured (either through dry or wet processing) and milled to
    remove the fruit from the bean. The resulting product is green coffee, 80 percent of
    which is traded internationally. Traders purchase green coffee from growers and
    growers associations and ship the beans to the end market. Roasters produce roast
    coffee beans and instant coffee. Marketing takes place through three main channels:
    retail, food service, and specialty coffee beans. The latter constitutes a growing
    market in western countries and a new access point for smallholders. Traditionally,
                                             15
        trading companies have played an important gatekeeping role in controlling market
        access in the regular market coffee, with 60 percent of the global coffee market being
        concentrated in the top ten traders. In the specialty coffee market, the roasters tend to
        engage more directly with producers in the GVC, which can open opportunities for
        improving the income of farmers.

                                                     Box 2
                                          What is Specialty Coffee?
              Specialty coffee is that which exhibits the highest levels of quality. It usually
              commands higher market prices due to the superiority of the beans, potentially
              offering producers higher returns. Most specialty coffee is of the Arabica variety,
              which is best grown at altitudes between 1,500m and 2,200m above sea level.
              Achieving 'specialty’ status involves minimizing defects and impurities in the
              production processes. This requires acute attention by farmers from beginning to
              end: sourcing premium seeds, preparing soils carefully, precisely maintaining the
              crop, and ensuring that cherries are picked at peak ripeness. Highly skilled buyers
              or testers – also known as cuppers – assess the coffee to determine ‘specialty’
              status. These cuppers have trained palates to evaluate the purity of different
              coffees, similar to that of a sommelier, and they are often certified by
              organizations such as Specialty Coffee Association of America, Specialty Coffee
              Association of Europe, and Quality Coffee Institute. Without the approval of a
              cupper, coffees are generally not considered ‘specialty’. Due to this rigorous
              quality assessment, effective coordination between key value chain actors is
              necessary to access to specialty coffee markets.

        Burundi’s position in the Coffee Global Value Chain20

     42. Burundi is positioned at the level of production in the GVC for coffee. Burundi
         produces Arabica coffee that is exported mostly to Switzerland, the United Kingdom,
         and Germany. Productivity in the coffee sector is approximately 30 percent of global
         averages, and has been declining. This is the result of outdated production techniques,
         aging trees, insufficient water, poor maintenance of plantations, and poor use of
         fertilizer. Most producers are smallholders, with some corporative organizations,
         accounting for 30 percent of all producers. Institutions such as Intercafe, ISABU, and
         CNAC21 provide support to the producers in the form of seedlings, technical
         assistance and fertilizers. Most of the coffee is still wet processed, with many of the
         185 washing stations still state-owned, although there is an on-going process of

   Given that Burundi produces mostly Arabica coffee all discussions on Burundi in the GVC for coffee refer to
the Arabica GVC.

   ISABU stands for Institut des Science Agronomiques du Burundi (Burundi Institute of Agricultural Sciences);
CNAC is the Confédération Nationale des Associations des Caféiculteurs du Burundi (National Confederation
of the Associations of Coffee Growers in Burundi). Intercafe is an interprofessional association which includes
the various stakeholders involved in the coffee sector in Burundi.

   privatization. There are only 4 mills. The roasting stage of the GVC is still
   underdeveloped and small, with four main roasters: Core Burundi SPRL (Sambi
   Coffee), Golden Tea & Coffee, African Coffee, and Express Coffee Burundi. Three
   of the top ten international traders have operations in Burundi; these are Louis
   Dreyfus, Sucafina (Bucafe S.A.) and Olan, along with small local traders such as
   Cococa and Cofico. Figure 5 shows Burundi’s position in the GVC for coffee and
   summarizes the main actors involved looking at distribution of employment in the
   chain.

43. The cultivation stage is highly labor intensive and provides livelihood to an
    estimated 10 percent of the population, but employment is seasonal and cyclical.
    Peak employment is in the 3-4 months of harvesting and processing season and
    fluctuations in global coffee prices mean that producers periodically enter and exit the
    industry. The wet processing stage provides important rural off-farm employment
    opportunities, both permanent and seasonal (between 1,500 and 2,000). Dry milling
    operations are based in urban centers and can generate employment in urban areas
    (between 800 and 1,600). The roasting segment currently provides minimal
    employment. The number of extension workers (out of a total of 2,800) servicing
    coffee is unknown.
44. The nature of employment and characteristics of the workforce also create
    challenges for training. Most producers are elderly and illiterate, limiting the
    diffusion of new technologies. The cyclical and temporary nature of employment
                                               17
    combined with side-selling makes it difficult for the private sector to invest in
    training and extension services. Trained technicians and professionals are unwilling
    to move to coffee growing areas and the lack of skilled management for washing
    stations affects the provision of credit and extension services.
45. Given its current position in the coffee GVC and the structure of employment,
    promising upgrading trajectories for Burundi include (i) product upgrading into
    specialty coffee, (ii) process upgrading to increase productivity, and (iii)
    environmental upgrading. These upgrading strategies also have the potential to
    improve livelihoods for a large number of producers while offering higher skilled job
    opportunities. Often multiple upgrading strategies can be implemented
    simultaneously, for example environmental upgrading usually accompanies the other
    two proposed strategies as they are mutually reinforcing. Figure 6 summarizes the
    expected benefits of each of the three strategies. Burundi has a number of competitive
    advantages. Its climate and geographical conditions are ideal for the production of
    specialty coffee; it has a long tradition of coffee production and large number of
    producers associated with relative cheap land and labor costs; it has a well-established
    washing station culture supporting the production of higher quality beans; it has been
    improving its business environment; and it has the potential to leverage EAC
    reputation for quality coffee (led by Kenya and Ethiopia).
46. Four key constraints were cited by the different actors and these need to be
    addressed for any upgrading strategy. These are: the limited supply of mulch and
    organic fertilizer, inadequate provision of extension services for producers, weak road
    and transportation infrastructure, and poor access to finance in general across the
    chain. Soil fertility is low due to poor soil management over decades. The lack of
    organic compost, which is an important input in the coffee chains, appears to be one
    of the most important. The limited development of transport and logistics affect the
    quality of coffee cherries and costs of delivery. Instead of being delivered and
    processed within the optimal 4-6 hours of picking, cherries sit for days undermining
    their quality. It currently takes about 30-40 days for the coffee to reach Dar Es
    Salaam and transportation costs average 7-10 percent of the product’s price. The poor
    quality of extension services limits knowledge transfers to producers. Limited access
    to finance makes it difficult for small producers to invest in fertilizers, replacement
    trees and certification schemes.
47. The three upgrading strategies have the potential for creating new employment
    opportunities as well as improving the quality of employment. Income levels of
    producers can rise through improved prices resulting from higher quality coffee, and
    mitigated negative effects of volatility of coffee prices. New job opportunities can be
    created along the various sectors of the value chain, requiring a variety of skills, as
    Figure 6 indicates. For example, quality controllers will be required at the production
    level, managers and technicians will be required at the processing level, along with
    cuppers. Financial and marketing personnel will also be required at the highest level


                                          18
    of the chain. The up-grading strategies have the potential to promote off-farm
    employment, thus attracting youth participation in both farm and off-farm activities.
48. Figure 6 summarizes the three upgrading strategies.

     49. All three upgrading strategies require a coordinated strategy for the sector as
         well as institutional strengthening. Key institutions that could be strengthened
         include Intercafe, CNAC, and ARFIC. CNAC represents all coffee producer
         associations and cooperatives in the country in all decision-making bodies and
         negotiates on their behalf with policymakers, donors and other actors within the
         chain, and can be supported to help farmers better organize in cooperatives and
         associations. ARFIC is crucial to coffee exporting due to its central role with respect
         to export permits. It could benefit from a system that streamlines export procedures
         through the introduction of a one-stop-shop for exports and a check-list. Intercafe is
         in charge of marketing and overseeing training for the coffee sector in the country,
         and could play a fundamental role in developing the delivery of training for the
         sector. A coordinated strategy for the sector should be led by the government and
         developed and implemented by various stakeholders. A task-force could be created
         within the Sector Working Group on Coffee, led by the Ministry of Agriculture,
         supported and guided by development partners and Intercafe, to play the coordinating
         role.
     50. Workforce development is an important factor in each of the upgrading
         strategies, but its success depends on being integrated with the overall upgrading
         strategy and tailored to the different job profiles. So far, there have been several
         disparate initiatives, often organized by donors or private sector, to respond to
         workforce development in the coffee sector, but they have had limited coverage.
         Government led initiatives have targeted training of extension workers and workers
         from public washing stations, along with the regular higher education courses in
         agronomy. Other initiatives led by multi-stakeholders and donors have targeted
         improvement of interpersonal skills, technical skills and administration skills. Most
         initiatives have focused on the production and wet processing levels. USAID has led
         most of the initiatives that targeted largely producers (some of them women) and
         workers in washing stations. Many included basic literacy programs.
     51. Workforce development for the coffee sector needs to differentiate between
         appropriate approaches for smallholder producers and other job profiles.
         Workforce development for coffee producers should not just include training to
         improve their production skills. This should be part of package capable of ensuring
         the use of the acquired skills in a sustainable manner so as to lead to the desired result
         of improved productivity. The package could include assets, for example, new coffee
         trees, transportation support to washing stations, access to credit.22 Training should


22
   Increasingly a number of interventions are combining skills training with a package of assets so that those
who are in self-employment can address other binding-constraints, besides just the lack of human capital, such
as the lack of land, equipment etc. For example in Uganda, under the North Uganda Social Action Fund, youth
were given vocational training with a cash transfer based on a business plan. Compared to a control group, the
program increased income by 38 percent (see Blattman, C. et al 2013). Similarly, a study of women in

                                                            21
         focus on technical skills that will enhance productivity and skills for
         entrepreneurship, self-employment and for organizational self-representation. Pre-
         employment training for job profiles along the value chain such as cuppers and
         quality controllers, and supporting industries could be provided by technical and
         vocational institutions and at the university level. The private sector should
         participate in the design of the courses, offer internships to trainees, and eventually
         subsidize or finance some courses to cover constraints preventing participation such
         as transportation costs, fees, cost of equipment etc.

                 Product and Functional Upgrading in Rwanda: Increasing Specialty Coffee Sales
          In the early 1990s, Rwanda began to experience a significant decline in coffee production.
          Inefficient and ineffective farming methods combined with aging trees and low quality beans from
          the use of drying methods significantly undermined both productivity and quality. Furthermore,
          prices were particularly low during that period (below the cost of production). The Government of
          Rwanda, together with the donor community began to define a strategy for the country’s coffee
          sector aimed to improve quality by repositioning the country as a specialty coffee producer. This
          required a wide range of initiatives:
                   Changes to the Regulatory Framework. The government liberalized the coffee sector,
          which allowed producers to establish cooperatives, directly contract with buyers, or exit the
          industry. This facilitated the development of the private sector and ensured the direct transfer of
          market premiums to producers.
                   Quality improvements through Production and Processing Stages. New seedlings were
          distributed and farmers were trained in plantation establishment and maintenance. Agronomy
          students at the University of Rwanda were also provided specific training about the coffee sector.
          The formation of cooperatives was actively encouraged and supported by a wide range of donors.
          Project Rwanda delivered over 2,000 “coffee bikes” to coffee producing areas in order to improve
          the speed with which cherries would be delivered to the mills (allowing producers to avail
          additional premiums). Over 100 washing stations were designed, financed and constructed between
          2000 and 2011, allowing Rwanda to shift from traditional dry processing towards wet-processing
          techniques. Processing experts from Burundi and Kenya provided training regarding the
          installation, operation and maintenance of equipment, cherry selection, fermentation, puling, lot
          identification, etc. In addition, technical assistance was provided to improve quality management
          and cupping techniques so that wet mill managers were better able to recognize the relative quality
          of their products. In addition, mill managers were provided with personnel and financial
          management training to improve the administration efficiency. Producers and wet-mills alike
          received training on fair trade and rainforest certifications.
                   Entry into the Marketing Stage of the Value Chain. Several key initiatives have been
          carried out. First, donors financed an inbound trade mission with leading specialty roasters which
          led to a contract with Starbucks in 2004. Second, the country was the first African country to host



Bangladesh who were given cattle with skills training see that women shift out of agricultural labor to running a
small business and that this shift persists after assistance is withdrawn (see Bandiera, O. et al 2013).

the Cup of Excellence in 2008. In has subsequently hosted the event four times, ensuring a high
level of visibility for Rwandan specialty coffee on the international market. Third, donor programs
have supported cooperatives in developing marketing materials, established an outreach center with
market information for coffee associations and provided training in negotiations with clients.
Finally, the government has placed an emphasis on celebrating successes in the sector and driving
media coverage for events.
         Supporting Institutions and Services Strengthened. Domestic actors and donors undertook
several actions to improve the quality of supporting institutions and services, including finance.
Loan officers and other bank personnel were trained in accurately assessing risk and financial
viability of different projects within the chain. Training included site visits, round table discussions
with all stakeholders on risk mitigation and the participation of a delegation of finance officers to
an international coffee fair to improve their understanding of the coffee sector.

As a whole, following this period, the following outcomes were observed:
         Increased sales of specialty coffee and share of overall production. In 2002, the first
33MT container of specialty coffee was exported. By 2005, 1,190 MT of specialty coffee were
produced and sold at US$3.10/lb. and by 2006, the country was selling specialty coffee to over 30
buyers in the US, the EU and Japan. In 2009, production reached 3,045 MT. By 2010, specialty
coffee accounted for 20 percent of the country’s coffee production. During this same period,
production of all coffee in the sector peaked at 450,000 60kg bags in 2004, declining by
approximately 50 percent by 2013.
         Increased income & revenue. Between 2001 and 2006, 50,000 rural households saw their
income double. Revenues from specialty coffee reached US$3.6 million in 2006 and US$11.6
million in 2009. Improved production techniques and upgraded coffee washing stations (CWS) also
facilitated an increase in the overall output of fully washed coffee, which fetches a higher price
even for commercial grade coffee. The country’s coffee export earnings rose from US$16 million
in 2002 to US$71 million in 2011 despite corresponding overall declines in exports, and the price
per kilogram rose steadily from US$1.84 in 2006 to US$3.59 in 2011.
         Employment gains. While assessments of employment in the sector are limited, between
2001 and 2006, the construction of the new CWSs in the sector provided temporary employment
with a final 2,000 new jobs created at the 46 CWS built during that time. Significant additional
employment was likely created as a result of further doubling the number of CWS between 2006
and 2012.
         Household Impacts. One survey showed that coffee farmers have increased their food
consumption and their overall household expenditure, leading to improved food security and to
generally improving economic conditions for coffee farmers. One cooperative, COCAMU, having
tripled its turnover between 2007 and 2009, began providing health insurance to their members and
their families in 2009.

52. The agribusiness GVC encompasses the full range of activities to bring an
    agricultural product from production to final consumption. Agribusiness
    encompasses a diverse set of agricultural product categories including bulk
    commodities, fruits & vegetables, non-food items such as tobacco, livestock and
    farmed fish, etc. Figure 7 represents Burundi’s position in the GVC for the
    agribusiness sector but the specific set of activities in the GVC varies with different
    products.

53. Research and Development (R&D) is important at various stages of the
    agribusiness GVC as it improves productivity at cultivation through better seeds and
    practices, and also extends shelf life of produce. The most important inputs are land,
    seeds, fertilizers, agrochemicals, farm equipment and water and irrigation equipment.
    Cultivation practices again vary with the product, but conditions such as geography,
    environment, social and political factors are important drivers in determining which
    products can be grown where. Post-harvest processing, also varies with specific
    products in terms of stages and technology. The skills and technology that will be
    employed will vary depending on the scale of the operation and access to capital.
    Marketing and distribution are the means through which products reach the final
    consumer and can range from supermarkets, kiosks, wholesale market as well as food
    service operations such as hotels and restaurants. Whether end-markets are local,
    regional or global determine the specifics of these channels. Production in general is
    the lowest value of the segment of the value chain, with agro-processing retail and
    R&D activities providing much higher returns and post-harvesting capabilities being
    fundamental to trade and competitiveness.

        Burundi in the Agribusiness Global Value Chain

     54. Burundi currently is at the production stage of the agribusiness GVC for most
         products; this has the lowest value addition in the agribusiness GVC. Key
         agricultural products in Burundi are fruits & vegetables, root and tuber crops,
         sugarcane and palm fruit. The sector is well positioned for growth as Burundi has
         favorable geographic and climatic conditions and domestic demand for these products
         is growing. Key challenges to the development of agribusiness chains include a
         poorly developed input sector, low and declining productivity, lack of storage and
         processing capabilities, and an absence of organized downstream markets.
         Approximately 7.9 million Burundians are involved in some part of the agribusiness
         GVC. 23 Cultivation is mainly carried out by small holders (0.05 ha) who produce a
         diverse range of products but are largely disconnected from the market with an
         estimated 20 percent of farm crop making it to market. Research and development
         and supplying of inputs are driven by public sector organizations such as ISABU and
         FACAGRO with support of IRRI. 24 There is weak farmer demand. Most processing
         activities are artisanal and are performed by individual producers or cooperatives with
         poor access to inputs and technology and at very small scale. A handful medium and
         large industrial processing firms have emerged such as FRUITO. Large processing
         companies are few and include the sugar processor plant at SOSUMO, Braudi’s
         downstream processor for sugar for beverages, and Savonor which processes oil
         products. Figure 8 represents the key stakeholders involved in the agribusiness GVC.
     55. Beside the majority of Burundians involved in the agribusiness GVC as family
         owned smallholder farms, there are a few formal sector jobs in agriculture.
         Some employment opportunities do exist on large farms but this varies due to
         seasonality and levels of labor intensity. The number of these jobs varies from 5,000-
         6,000. The majority of jobs in processing are in the informal sector. The four formal
         sector firms who undertake processing (Braudi, Savonor, FRUITO, and SOSUMO)
         employ approximately 1,600-1,700 individuals. On the R&D and support services
         there are currently an additional 3,500 jobs.

56. A number of challenges currently impede workforce development in the
    agribusiness GVC in Burundi. Existing workforce development initiatives have
    been hampered by issues of insufficient scale and fragmentation, a by-product of
    cyclical donor support. The formal TVET and tertiary education sector has played a
    limited role, and most training has focused on the production end, rather post-harvest
    skills related to handling, marketing and distribution. Insufficient attention has been
    given to post-graduate courses related to agriculture, and formal technical training
    related to the sector.
57. The proposed upgrading in the short and medium term includes (i) upgrading to
    improve productivity and sustainable use of land and water resources, (ii)
    upgrading processing capabilities for staple crops, prioritizing cassava, and (iii)
    upgrading storage, processing and packaging capabilities in high potential fruits
    and vegetables sectors. In light of Burundi’s position in the agribusiness GVC and
    the current distribution of employment, Burundi should prioritize improving
    productive capacity and competitiveness in domestic and regional markets rather than
    focusing on agribusiness exports in high-value markets in the immediate term. The
    advantage of the first two strategies is that they also target food security and are
    employment intensive, while at the same time increasing productivity and generating
    off-farm jobs. Strategies (ii) and (iii) both focus on improving post-harvest loss and
    potentially in the long run can position Burundi well for regional exports and high




                                                    26
         value markets.25 Critical to this will be Burundi’s ability to upgrade along the
         electricity GVC as minimizing post-harvest losses heavily depends on the availability
         of electricity.26 Figure 9 summarizes the expected benefits and job profiles of each of
         these strategies.
     58. Similar constraints that impede the coffee sector are also critical impediments to
         upgrading in the agribusiness GVC. These include lack of clear land tenure, access
         to finance, weak rural infrastructure and soil degradation. Poor statistics and an
         inadequate sanitary and phytosanatiary (SPS)27 regulatory structure are also
         important. Communal land tenure is common in Burundi and the lack of private
         property rights is challenging from a number of perspectives, including extending
         credit, encouraging investment, and from the perspective of ensuring adequate effort.
         Financing for agribusiness is limited as it is considered high risk given that the sector
         is dominated by smallholders. Weak infrastructure and services in transportation
         prove challenging for connecting up different segments of the GVC. Also soil
         degradation brought on by years of deforestation and expansion of cultivation on
         marginal lands is a major constraint to raising productivity.
     59. The suggested upgrading strategies not only will enhance growth in the
         agriculture, but can also potentially create additional employment and new types
         of jobs profiles. Process upgrading is an across the board strategy which emphasizes
         productivity and sustainability of production. Such an approach increases both food
         security and revenue income for households from surplus produce. The demand for
         inputs and technical assistance could develop upstream industries broadening the
         numbers in current jobs in those sectors. Improved income could also improve
         demand for non-farm products having a ripple effect in the rural economy. Selective
         functional upgrading, whether through processing or upgrading through improving
         packaging and storage will have downstream impacts, and could produce a number of
         new jobs such as warehouse/ operation managers, cold unit manager, packers,
         operator/technician, and quality control technicians.
     60. A critical component of successful upgrading will require coherence in strategy
         and active involvement of key stakeholders. To develop a coherent WfD strategy
         for agribusiness, coordination and active engagement of key stakeholders in the
         agribusiness sector is important. The Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministries of
         Education and Labor need to lead in defining a WfD strategy and developing a labor
         market information system to underlie such a strategy. Industry associations need to
         be developed and need to be engaged to work with education and training providers

Stronger links between industry and education bodies, whether through active
engagement on boards, or through on-the-job training programs are central to a
demand-driven WfD and for a sustainable and relevant skills delivery system. An
important part of the WfD will be financing and how financing can be designed to
target skills development and incentivize participation by both private firms and
private individuals.

61. As was the case for the coffee sector, a comprehensive approach to workforce
    development, looking at not just imparting skills but supplementing skills with a
    package of services particularly for smallholders, seems to be fundamental. Most
    opportunities in the agribusiness sector are likely to be some form of self-employment
    either in small-holdings or through household enterprises. Skills are only one binding
    constraint that prevent the viability of such units and affect their productivity. Besides
    skills, small-holders and household enterprises can be supported by a package of
    services, which could include a combination of asset (some critical equipment/ or
    cash transfer/animal) and support (and regular engagement with extension services/ or
    learning via social networks or farm schools). Broader coordination with other
    government programs is also required.

                    Improving Yields through Micro-fertilization in Mali
In 1998, in Mali, declining productivity and soil fertility losses were key issues of national
concern. Annual per capita income of the land-locked country was less than US$270 and the
agricultural sector represented approximately 46 percent of GDP. Deteriorating productivity
and soil fertility were mostly related to poor land fertilization, particularly for major staple
crops in the country, attributable to high fertilizer prices. On the other hand, there were
increased food needs driven by rapid population growth. The combined effect of low
fertilizer use and reduced fallow periods led to a cycle of declining soil productivity and
overexploitation of soil nutrients to meet household food needs in the country. Tackling this
productivity challenge, in 2002 the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid
Tropics (ICRISAT) initiated the implementation of a two-year pilot project aimed at
improving productivity through fertilizer micro-dosing. The project activities were carried
out through farmer field schools (FFS), training of technicians and other stakeholders, and
strengthening of farmers associations through the introduction of a warrantage or inventory
credit system.
          Technology dissemination through participatory approaches. Demonstration plots
were established using participatory approaches, involving lead farmers that the project
selected, trained and to whom regularly provided technical advisory services. Farmers
decided on the choice of crop in their respective demonstration plots. Similarly, fertilizer
choice was driven by the availability of fertilizer type in the local markets. Follow-up
extension services and exchange visits were organized to promote information and
knowledge between researchers and farmers.
         Training and capacity building. Training was the key element to successfully build
and strengthen the knowledge of relevant stakeholders at multiple levels: individual farmers,
farmer organizations, and local government and NGO project partners. The project used
various appropriate tools, such as FFS, field days, handbooks and manuals, workshops, and
exchange visits to develop and strengthen local knowledge on the effects of low-cost
fertilization technology. To ensure sustainability and access to inputs, farmer organizations
were also trained and assisted with the establishment of a warrantage system involving


                                              30
management of village funds, warehouses, and input shops. To ensure sustainability, farmers
were charged a loan fee of approximately at 3 percent of the amount.

Outcomes
         Increased productivity. Impact assessments indicated that millet and sorghum yields
under the micro-dose technology were 61-90 percent and 60-107 percent higher,
respectively, than control groups (no fertilization application). Similarly, yield under micro-
dosing exceeded those under the commonly recommended fertilization by 11-19 percent and
23-28 percent, respectively. According to the FAO, the benefits of using the micro-dose
technology can outweigh costs by 3.5 to 12 times.
         Growing adoption. This simple technological package has become a popular
technique amongst smallholders in Mali. Following the completion of the ICRISAT project,
numerous projects by NGOs have also actively promoted seed priming and micro-
fertilization. In 2009, the Alliance for Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) funded a three-
year project supporting 130,000 households in production of millet, sorghum and cowpea
through a wide scale dissemination and adoption of the micro-fertilization and warrantage
system in Mali. The project was implemented by Winrock International in close
collaboration with Institute d’Economie Rural (Institute of Rural Economy, IER) in Mali.
Field reports indicated that more than 50 percent of the adopting farmers are using the
technology on their own initiative without external assistance.
          Access to credit. Farmers benefited from the established ‘warrantage’ system in the
project areas. During 2002-04 harvest seasons, the local storage system stocked
approximately 74 T of millet, sorghum and rice. In return, it provided credit amounting to 10
million FCFA and 16 million FCFA, respectively, in the two harvest seasons during 2002-
04.

      62. The electricity GVC28 includes all the activities necessary for the production,
          distribution and consumption of electricity. There are five key components of the
          electricity value chain including, fuel procurement, electricity generation,
          transmission, distribution and service delivery to the consumer. Figure 10 illustrates
          the key segments as well as highlights Burundi’s position in the electricity GVC.

      63. In electricity production the choice of fuel is central to the type of electricity system
          that is developed. The choices are fossil fuels, nuclear and hydroelectricity.
          Generation technologies very much depend on the fuel available to a country.
          Hydroelectric, the most cost efficient for Burundi, depends on the potential strength
          of river networks which Burundi is well endowed with. A transmission network
          serves as the means through which electricity generated at generating units is
          transferred to distribution networks and this must occur at high voltage. The
          distribution network serves to connect energy from the transmission network to the
          service location. Finally, service locations are where electricity is consumed at the
          resident, industrial or commercial unit.




 28
    The GVC approach, however, has yet to be applied to the electrical energy sector and its application to this
 industry requires some conceptual clarification. In other GVCs, countries can specialize in just one or more
 segments of the chain, and participation (particularly that of developing countries) is oriented towards an export
 market. Participation in the electrical energy GVC, on the other hand, requires the development of capabilities
 through multiples segments and is domestic in orientation (see Bamber, P., Guinn, A. and Gereffi, G. 2014b).

        Burundi in the Electricity Global Value Chain

     64. Overall Burundi’s footprint in the electricity GVC is relatively limited given the
         country’s population and its potential to produce electricity. Less than 10 percent
         of Burundians are currently connected to the electricity grid, and the majority of them
         are located in the urban center. Insufficient and unreliable electricity is a serious
         constraint to Burundi’s development. Years of conflict have led to a lack of
         investment in the sector but a number of potential generating projects29 are under
         preparation for which Burundi’s current infrastructure is inadequate. There are few
         players in the electricity sector. REGIDESO30 the public utility is responsible for all
         activities within the chain except aspects of rural electrification which are under the
         remit of Burundi’s Agency for Rural Electrification (ABER). Burundi has a total of
         55.5 MW of installed capacity of generation, of which 95 percent of it is
         hydroelectricity and 5 percent is fossil fuel. Burundi also imports16.3 MW of
         electricity from Ruzizi I and Ruzizi II operated by the Economic Community of the
         Great Lakes Countries. There are also off-grid initiatives including 12 small hydro-
         plants of less than 1 MW, SOSUMO bagasse operation and a few PV solar units.
         Currently there are only 750km of 110 kV transmission lines that are concentrated in
         the north western zones of the country.
     65. Currently, REGIDESO is the largest employer in the electricity GVC and future
         employment opportunities with upgrading are limited. There are over a thousand
         jobs in the sector of which 70 percent of them are with the public utility, REGIDESO,
         while the rest of the employment is in the private sector and the public bureaucracy
         related to the electricity sector. The distribution of employees across GVC segments
         is given in Figure 11. Employees at REGIDESO include highly-skilled, semi-skilled
         and low-skilled workers.
     66. A number of challenges hinder appropriate workforce development in the
         sector. These challenges include weak human resource management practices and
         dysfunctional promotion policies within REGIDESO, and a geographical mismatch
         between demand and supply of labor. These issues are likely to prove greater
         challenges as the electricity system expands rapidly in the next decade and regional
         electricity arrangements become established.

   Projects in the pipeline include 79.4 MW in domestic generation, including Jij and Muelmwe Hydropower
Project, and 227 MW of regionally generation capacity under Ruzizi III and IV and Rusumo Falls. Also 4 HT
220 kV to connect Burundi to the regional grid is also planned.

    67. The following upgrading strategies are suggested in the short and medium term
        and include (i) reconstructing and maintenance of existing damaged electricity
        infrastructure, (ii) promoting access to electricity in and around urban areas
        through extending access, and (iii) building and operating new solar and micro-
        hydro generators to extend rural electrification. In order to increase energy supply
        and expand access to electricity, Burundi should pursue a complementary set of
        upgrading strategies covering elements of all three proposed strategies. Although the
        numbers of jobs that will be generated within the sector may not be high, expansion
        of electricity will impact all sectors and will enhance productivity and increase the
        number of jobs across the economy.
    68. Stakeholders have identified possible stumbling blocks for upgrading strategies
        in the sector. These include (i) lack of clear legal framework, (ii) capacity
        constraints at ministerial level, (iii) lack autonomy of the public utility, (iv) lack
        of finance, and (v) weak statistics. The lack of a clear legal regulatory framework is
        a hindrance for a possible market for excess electricity produced by captive plants.
        Regulatory structure and ministerial capacity is also important for Burundi as its
        involvement in regional projects widens and coordination is required with multiple
        regional countries. Extensive interference in REGIDESO by Government is also a
        challenge from multiple perspectives including the ability to manage and employ
        human resources in the sector. Also the lack of financing for both public and private
        investment in the energy sector is a constraint. Despite the recent commitments by
        international and regional banks for investments in this sector, Burundi is still seen as
        a high risk. Finally, poor information systems undermine proper electricity planning.
    69. The suggested upgrading strategies for the electricity sector and the
        accompanying job profiles that are likely to evolve are given in Figure 12. As

                                               34
         upgrading happens more complex higher level skills will be required, particularly
         dependent on the technology that is adopted. Financial and project management skills
         will be increasingly important as the system expands, as will specific skills for
         regulatory policy and its operationalizing. With the proposed expansion of the
         electricity sector, the numbers of jobs, particularly during the construction phase, will
         be significant, requiring higher levels of manual labor. Perhaps the most important
         impact of electricity on jobs is going to be on raising productivity in the informal
         sector.31
     70. The proposed expansion of the electricity sector that is currently underway will
         require significant institutional strengthening. In November 2013, the IFC has
         called for institutionalizing a multi-stakeholder strategy to coordinate private, public
         and donor strategies in the electricity sector, as part of its sector wide strategy. A
         number of key institutional reforms will be required to underpin the proposed
         upgrading strategy. Most importantly will recapitalize the public utility
         REGIDESCO, as well as increase its institutional autonomy from Government.
         REGIDESCO’s institutional capacity also needs to be enhanced. Regulatory
         structures need to be put in place for private firms like SOSUMO to sell their surplus
         electricity to the utility and to encourage other private investment in electricity
         generation in the future.

   Evidence from South Africa of the expansion of rural electrification in the post-apartheid period indicates that
a large roll-out of rural electrification can significantly raise women’s employment (by 9 to 9.5 percent) and
much of this happens by releasing women from home production and enabling their participation in household
enterprises (Dinkelman, T. 2011).

71. Re-aligning workforce development initiatives and the current skill offerings will
    be required to ready the sector for the upgrading strategies. A number of
    challenges limit achieving optimal workforce development in this sector, as
    mentioned earlier. As in other sectors, much of the staff is based in the capital and
    dislike travelling to the rural areas to undertake projects. There is often a clear
    mismatch between human and capital resources for employees to meet their
    performance targets. Besides on-site training done at the utility, many educational
    institutions offer courses for the energy sector which are not justifiable given the few
    jobs in the sector. Most current training is outdated and little of it is done on relevant
    equipment. Some attempt has been made by aid agencies to assist with upgrading
    curriculum development and training equipment but it has been mostly piecemeal.
    There has been very little engagement with the universities sector.
72. The proposed education reform—which will shift the educational attainment of
    the stock of labor--is well aligned with the jobs in the electricity sector, where
    few jobs exist which require less then primary education. Beside jobs in
    construction and laying out transmission and distribution lines which are mostly
    manual, most jobs in the sector require foundational skills at a minimum. Expansion
    of the electricity sector and increasing urban households - outside Bujumbura - access
    to electricity will create a number of jobs that relate to servicing the larger consumer
    basis. These jobs will be in metering, billing, servicing of lines, etc., for which strong
    foundational skills will be required. An improved flow of students to the labor market
    with these skills will serve the public utility well. Corruption and rent-seeking are
    common in the electricity sector, particularly where rationing is in common.
    Enhancing skills with other soft skills that emphasize accountability will be
    important. Workforce development strategies for the electricity sector will evolve
    with upgrading and the technological choices that are made.

                  Private Sector Engagement and Grid Rehabilitation in Liberia
             After the second of Liberia’s two civil wars concluded in 2003, the country’s
    electrical grid was crippled, and the country was forced to “start from zero” in regaining
    capabilities for the generation and delivery of electrical energy. With help from the World
    Bank and other donors, Liberia developed an ambitious series of programs to rehabilitate
    the electrical grid, expand generation capabilities and develop an institutional framework
    for the governance and management of the country’s energy sector. These programs are
    particularly noteworthy due their heavy emphasis on workforce development, realized
    through a coordinated strategy built upon transfers of skills and knowledge from abroad in
    addition to the formation of skilled and semi-skilled workers at home.
             The Government of Liberia took its first step to rehabilitate the country’s energy
    infrastructure in 2006 with the Emergency Power Program (EPP) which re-established the


                                              37
 Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC), the state-owned electrical utility. International
 donors provided Liberia with US$40 million in grant funding and technical assistance to
 help construct four small substations while also developing the capacity to run 9.6 MW on
 high-speed diesel generators. The government moved into the next step of the energy
 sector’s development in 2009 with the publication of the National Energy Pol icy (NEP),
 which outlined a strategy for a capacity building phase that would last through 2015. The
 goals listed in the document focus exclusively on allowing citizens to meet their most basic
 energy needs, with a target of providing electricity to 15 percent of rural residents and 30
 percent of urban residents through the program. With the continuous support of donors, the
 Liberian government launched a five-year, performance-based management contract for the
 management of LEC developed by the IFC. The contract, which also covered training, and
 capacity-building activities, was awarded to Manitoba Hydro International (MHI), a private
 Canadian energy company, after a competitive bid process and marked a major shift in
 workforce development in Liberia’s energy sector.
          In order to re-staff LEC and place the organization in a position to expand delivery,
 MHI created a strong human resources development program. It formalized job profiles,
 recruited 63 workers from local educational institutions and placed them in comprehensive,
 paid training programs which included both on-the-job and classroom training. In its
 trainings, MHI used customized training modules in seven job areas, including maintenance
 workers, middle managers, financial managers, and customer service representatives. In
 order to build up the engineering skills required to expand generation capabilities, MHI
 embedded newly graduated engineers within teams led by experienced Liberian and foreign
 engineers. This promoted rapid skill diffusion within the domestic workforce in order to
 reduce long-term dependence on foreign expertise.
          Over the course of only a few years, these training efforts helped to re-constitute
 the LEC as a professional organization with the capacity for continued skill development
 and performance enhancement. Since taking over the management of LEC in 2010, MHI
 has reduced losses on the grid from 28 percent to 15 percent, and projects to further reduce
 these to 12 percent in coming years. Additionally, MHI introduced pre-paid meters to
 LEC’s distribution arm, and as a result saw tariff collection increase from 93 percent to 97
 percent. The introduction of pre-paid meters also created an opportunity for LEC to educate
 customers about energy conservation, in order to reduce per-capita demand and free up
 resources for network expansion. Subscriptions have increased by more than 10,000
 customers, though MHI expects to dramatically increase LEC’s customer base to 87,000 by
 the end of its performance contract in 2013.

73. As Burundi upgrades in the GVCs in the priority sectors of coffee, agribusiness
    and electricity new job profiles will be coming up and existing job profiles
    numbers will expand; most of the new and existing job profiles will be at middle
    technician level and some will require higher education. Across all of the priority
    sectors (see Tables 2a, b and c) most new jobs will fall into the two central columns
    of technical training and/ or technical certification. In the coffee sector for example,
    the new middle level technical jobs will require 6 to 9 years of education, and will
    include those of quality manager technicians, coffee cuppers/ evaluators, equipment
    installers and maintenance, and quality graders. Those technical jobs requiring more
    than 9 years of education include marketing personnel, cooperative financial
    personnel and environmental regulators. For this, appropriate TVET and tertiary
    education will be required. Similar growth is also likely in the other priority sectors,
    particularly agribusiness.
74. Upgrading in the value chain in the priority sectors is going to shift the
    educational attainment requirements of the workforce for which the proposed
    education reform is well aligned. As the job profiles shift to the middle level the
    educational attainment levels that will be required for such jobs will be at a minimum
    9 years or more. The proposed basic education reform that is currently being
    implemented is well suited for these new types of job profiles, and will serve as a
    strong basis for any additional training that employers will need to give their
    employees in keeping with specific firm requirements.
75. Training needs also have to target the existing stock of labor employed as they
    will continue to lack the necessary skills required for the adopted upgrading
    trajectories. As highlighted in the Section II, despite the new entrants with stronger
    basic education ready to enter the workforce, the overall educational attainment of the
    existing stock is likely to change much more slowly. Moreover, for the foreseeable
    future before the full effect of the basic education reform is felt, potential school-
    leavers will continue to have poor foundational skills. Parallel interventions to the
    basic education reform will be needed in the interim to enhance the skills of those
    leaving the school system in the next couple of years and for those already working in
    the sector.
76. A mix of short training options can be considered in the short-term to enhance
    the skills of the existing stock in the workforce. Current WfD initiatives in the
    sector are fragmented and unsustainable and a number of different stakeholders
    partner in these initiatives. For those immediately ready to leave the school system
    remedial adult education courses targeted to improving numeracy and literacy may be
    required. Another option is to undertake an assessment of current offerings and scale
    up the most successfully ones that are well aligned with the skill requirements of the
    upgrading strategies.

    77. A strategic framework for workforce development will be required. This will be
        the object of the discussion in the next section. The WfD strategy for these priority
        sectors is incorporated within a broader workforce development strategy which
        emphasizes the critical importance of improving basic and foundational skills, and
        subsequently aligning skills development with emerging occupations arising from
        these priority sectors. At the same time, given that the possible proposed GVC
        trajectories may not materialize or may materialize in a modified form, the skills
        training offered has to be flexible enough, to allow trained individuals to utilize their
        skills in changing upgrading sectors and in changing roles.

     IV.   BUILDING DEMAND RESPONSIVE TVET AND TERTIARY EDUCATION
                                  SYSTEMS

      78. Over the next ten years (2014-2024), with the implementation of the basic
          education reform, about 3.5 million32 young Burundians will leave the education
          system and potentially enter the labor force with higher levels of education.
          Approximately 4.5 percent of them will have completed lower secondary but not
          upper secondary (9 years and more of education), 4.5 percent will have completed
          upper secondary education (13 years of education), and another 2 percent will have
          had some exposure to some post-secondary education. However, a significant
          proportion will continue to be barely functionally literate: about 40 percent of them
          will have completed primary and some lower secondary education (6-9 years of
          education) and another 49 percent will have either no schooling or just some primary
          schooling. (Table A3, Annex A)
      79. This pool of more qualified young people can contribute to raising the overall
          productivity of the economy if they find more productive and remunerative jobs
          or if they can be enabled to be productively self-employed. As shown in the
          previous section, if upgrading strategies are adopted in the three priority sectors, they
          can absorb a proportion of these young people especially in the coffee and
          agribusiness sectors. This will, however, require targeting of young workers to
          encourage them to take up employment in these sectors. Alternatively, with stronger
          foundational skills, these new potential entrants to the labor force can be self-
          employed in the agriculture and the informal sector with a potential to be more
          productive.
      80. A diversifying and growing economy also requires skilled workers, with some
          pre-employment training, as well as more highly skilled workers with tertiary
          level education. The analysis of workforce requirements in the priority sectors shows
          that new job profiles are likely to emerge as the sectors introduce product and/or
          process upgrading along the value chain, and many of these will require middle level
          technician training and/or tertiary education. Further, additional jobs will also be
          created in supporting industries that will require middle level technical skills.
          Enabling the technical/ vocational system and higher education system to respond to
          these emerging skill demands is critical.
      81. This section examines the current policy framework for the technical/ vocational
          system and the key government priorities for creating a demand-responsive
          system. It relies primarily on the findings from using the SABER tool, an analytic
          and data collection benchmarking instrument developed by the World Bank’s Human

  Figures presented here are from Gradual Basic Education Reform Scenario or Scenario 4 of the projections
outlined in Section 2. The cumulative figure is for the decade 2014-2024 and the shares of different levels of
educational attainment are given as a proportion of the cumulative figure for the whole decade.

           education system, but this has not been covered in a comprehensive way.

       82. Currently, vocational education is offered after six years of primary education,
           and professional and technical education after lower secondary (2 years) and
           secondary (4 years) education. These programs are mostly under the Ministère de
           l’Education de Base et Secondaire, de l’Ensignement des Métiers, de la Formation
           Professionnelle et de l’Alphabétisation. Vocational programs for children having
           completed 6 years of primary education are offered in 106 Centres d’enseignement
           des Metiers (CEM)33 that enrolled about 3,693 students in 2011-2012; about one
           quarter of the enrollment is in private institutions. Seven Centres de Formation
           Professionel (CFPs) who cater to students joining after lower secondary, and 20
           collèges techniques, which enroll about 1,200 students (who join after secondary
           education)34 offer professional and technical training.
       83. Enrolment in TVET institutions grew at over 12 percent per year between 2003
           and 2009, but remains low. In 2011, only around 20,000 students enrolled in all
           types of TVET courses, representing less than 5 percent of enrollment at the
           secondary level. Private provision of TVET is significant in Burundi: in 2009-2010,
           41 percent of TVET students were enrolled in some type of private training, 10
           percent were enrolled in communal led training providers, and the remaining 49
           percent were enrolled in public institutions. Most of these institutions require
           upgrading as they lack quality, and appropriateness in teaching skills demanded by
           the private sector. In fact, it estimated that only 15 to 20 percent of trainees directly
           go into jobs (BTC, 2013). Also, there are important issues of distribution of programs
           and courses. The agriculture sector, where most Burundians earn a living has just one
           professional/ vocational school offering. For the energy sector, on the other hand,
           which employs around 1,120 workers training can be found in 19 vocational and
           professional programs.
       84. Tertiary education comprises four public institutions (l’Université du Burundi,
           l’Ecole National Supérieur, l’Institute National de Santé Public and l’Institute
           National des Cadres Militaires) and twenty-three private institutions. Enrolment
           increased by 10 percent per year between 2003 and 2009 and is currently about
           30,000. The share of private enrolment is surprisingly high at just under 60 percent,
           resulting from a fast expansion of the private sector post 2005 under weak regulation.
           A National Commission on Higher Education was formed in 2012, and it is making
           progress in formulating and applying rules for the accreditation of both public and

           private universities. Most higher education institutions are based in Bujumbura and
           most of their programs are for law and management.
       85. A system of public scholarships is in place, supporting 15,000 higher education
           students, and admission to public universities is done by the Ministère de
           l’Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche Scientifique. The provision of such a
           high number of higher education scholarships produces an imbalance between
           technical and university education. Technical education is crucial for sector
           upgrading in Burundi, as technicians are critical in the middle part of the value chains
           and without their availability in those segments, upgrading becomes very difficult.
           Figure 13 provides a visual representation of the skills along a value chain. Burundi
           upgrading in the coffee, agribusiness and electricity GVCs means a transition from
           the low level of the chain to the middle level, and thus, it requires an upgrading of its
           workforce mostly from manual to technical and professional skills.

       86. In addition to the formal education system, training is provided by a variety of
           stakeholders. For example, as outlined in the discussion on the three sectors, there
           are many short duration training programs either linked with private firms or with
           donor programs. In the case of coffee, SOGESTAL35, Intercafe, and USAID have

         extension workers. Overall, these tend to be sporadic, have limited coverage and are
         not sustained. Some public sector institutions, such as REGIDESO in the electricity
         sector, provide training for their employees.36 The Ministère de la Santé Publique et
         de la Lutte Contre le SIDA organizes training for health professionals (nurses, lab
         technicians, and health technicians), and the Ministère de l’Enseignement Supérieur
         et de la Recherche Scientifique offers training for agriculture technicians. In Burundi,
         like in other countries such as Rwanda, there is also likely to be a private market of
         trainers located in the informal sector, which are service providers who train for a fee.
         These are distinguished from apprenticeships offered through informal sector firms
         for limited compensation and no structured training. Research in this area is critically
         required.

     87. The Government of Burundi has begun providing a strategic direction to
         workforce development. An indicator of the improvement of the regulatory
         environment for WfD is the publication of a new law in September 2013 that
         organizes the basic and secondary education systems.37 This law also guides TVET
         reform and it formalizes the different types of training centers including CEMs that
         used to be informal, stipulates that the CEMs training will be offered in a modular
         approach38, and proposes the establishment of a Centre de développement des
         compétences professionnelles (CDCP), which is expected to develop TVET programs
         and curricula. Further, the law also proposes the creation of a National Qualifications
         Framework, for which a commission has been created in 2012.
     88. Further, the Government’s Plan Sectoriel de Devéloppment de l’Education et de la
         Formation 2012-2020 (PSDEF)39 sets ambitious targets for vocational and
         technical training. Specifically, it proposes, increasing the number of young people
         who receive lower level vocational education to 16,000 by 2020 (almost an 8-fold
         increase) in the CEMs, with the establishment of a CEM in each of the 129
         communes of the country. It also proposes doubling enrollment in CFPs with the
         establishment of a CFP in each of the 17 provinces of Burundi. Enrollment in
         technical education will remain stable with the elimination of technical colleges and a
         slight increase in the number of technical schools. Both CEMs and CFPs are expected

38
   The use of a modular system of training is also considered in the law. With this, the two year curricular offer
will be replaced by a system in which trainees can enroll for short 3-month module, receiving a basic certificate.
Two higher level certificates can be obtained upon completion of 4 or 8 modules.
39
   Burundi prepared an education sector plan for the period of 2012-2020 (PSDEF), which was endorsed by
Global Partnership for Education (GPE) and resulted in a financing from the GPE fund for primary education.

                                                         46
         to have financial autonomy and to deliver training aligned with the needs of the
         geographical area where they are located.
     89. Nevertheless, implementation of these proposals remains a challenge and there is
         a lack of clarity on pathways through the newly reformed education system. An
         important decision that remains to be clarified, as part of the 9 year basic education
         reform, is whether programs catering to students after Grade 6 will be eliminated and
         whether entry into the CEMs will be only after Grade 9. This change is required to
         ensure that all children receive 9 years of general basic education. Early
         experimentation has shown that early vocational tracking may harm students and this
         is particularly harmful for poorly performing students. Consequently the emphasis is
         on strengthening foundational skills before tracking them in to academic and
         vocational streams. It will also imply important changes in the structure of the CEMs,
         including the type of programs they offer, their internal and external efficiency.
         Finally, implementation can only proceed if adequate resources can be mobilized40.
     90. The establishment of a demand-led system is incipient. Although various studies have
         analyzed the country’s growth prospects (such as Vision Burundi 2025 and the PRSP II),
         there is no published study on skills. The Strategic Plan for Agriculture – one of the
         priority sectors, does not present any analysis of the current skills situation in the sector
         or future needs. The PSDEF also does not detail projected demand for skills.
     91. Ensuring critical coordination among key stakeholders is another element of a
         sound policy framework and this is also at a very rudimentary stage. There is limited
         coordination between the various Ministries engaged in training, such as the ministries of
         education, and labor, and public sector institutions, and the sectoral ministries.
     92. Burundi’s rating on the overall strategic framework for workforce development is
         latent41. (Figure 14) This is not surprising, given that it is emerging after years of conflict
         in which many institutions were neglected or even destroyed. However, now is the time
         to start creating the framework for skills development.




40
   The current support from the Global Partnership for Education Fund is for 3 years and is expected to end by
2015.
41
   Ratings are described as follows: 1 – Latent: Limited engagement; 2 – Emerging: Some instances of good
practice; 3 – Established: Systemic good practice; and 4 – Advanced: Systemic good practice meeting global
standards.

     93. The main justification for government intervention in vocational and technical
         training is market failure (such as poaching and bargaining externalities,
         informational asymmetries, coordination and credit failures). Firms may
         underinvest in training as they may lose trained employees to other firms or
         employees are temporary or seasonal. They also may choose to underinvest in
         strategic areas as currently skills do not exist. Young people may underinvest because
         they do not have information on job openings or returns, or because they lack funds.
         These market failures provide a rationale for government intervention.
     94. However, training is only one element in improving overall productivity and
         improving livelihoods in the priority sectors. Even if skills are effectively provided
         other real constraints such as access to credit, land or inputs may prevent individuals
         from implementing what they have learnt. The lack of these supplementary assets is
         likely to make any type of investment in the sector less likely. For example vis-à-vis
         coffee production, initial lack of investment to upgrade to new trees or to transport
         cherries to washing stations may be the key constraint to enhancing productivity
         rather than training. In such cases, an integrated approach providing land, inputs,
         access to credit and training, is likely to be more successful. One example where such
         programs have been integrated in the coffee sector in Rwanda where skills training
         was offered as part of a comprehensive package of interventions that addressed
         binding constraints other than skills (see Box 3).
     95. Government intervention is not necessarily equivalent to government provision
         of training and being alert to government failures is critical. In many cases, non-
         government actors can provide training, provided there is an adequate regulatory

  Information for the analysis is gathered using a structured SABER-WfD Data Collection Instrument (DCI).
For each Topic, the DCI poses a set of multiple choice questions which are answered based on documentary
evidence and interviews with knowledgeable informants. The answers allow each Topic to be scored on a four-
point scale against standardized rubrics based on available knowledge on global good practices. Topic scores
are averaged to produce Policy Goal scores, which are then aggregated into Dimension scores.

                                                      48
    framework regarding standards and quality. In order to promote equity, the
    government can provide targeted financing to poor youth either through vouchers or
    through a package of services under a social protection program. Where government
    provision is considered the most appropriate (for instance, perhaps in technical
    training where private providers are unable to invest in the required capital), a big risk
    is creating training programs which are divorced from the needs of the employers.
    These costly failures can be avoided by carefully designing programs which
    encourage private actors (either firms or individuals) to show their willingness to pay
    by asking for a contribution which is matched by government or committing to a
    willingness to hire by firms.
96. The current distribution of employment in Burundi, as well as the projected new
    entrants into the labor force, suggests that informal sector training needs to be
    expanded. The large numbers of young people who will enter the workforce with 9
    years of education mean that this training can be effective as it builds on a solid
    foundation of literacy and numeracy. Additional skill bridging training may also be
    required for those with less years of education or those exiting from school before full
    implementation of the reform. This can be done by making use of the proposed
    CEMs, though not all training has to be delivered by the public sector. Use of
    informal sector associations, for example farmers’ associations like CAPAD, coffee
    producers’ associations like CNAC, is a promising avenue. Another possibility is to
    scale up existing current skills interventions or encourage NGOs with seed money,
    and to experiment with community-based skills development approaches. Also more
    needs to be understood about the micro-trainers which provide training for a fee in the
    informal sector.
97. The programs offered by the CEMs need substantial revision to meet emerging
    demands; some CFPs could be upgraded to become centers of excellence for
    skills for priority sectors. Table A4 in Annex A shows the preponderance of sewing
    programs (which enroll mostly girls) in the CEMs. The Belgian Development Agency
    is supporting a study aimed at determining labor market needs in each of the
    country’s province, evaluating the appropriateness of the offer of training programs,
    and identifying training programs that should be developed or introduced. Given that
    only one vocational/ professional institution is currently offering training for
    agriculture, including coffee, programs to be introduced could focus on this sector.
    The proposed increase of CFPs may be one opportunity to expand public training
    provision to match increasing middle level skills demand in priority sectors for job
    profiles such as regulators, quality controllers, and electricians. The CFPs could be
    operated in partnership with the private sector or incentives can be provided to private
    sector to participate and finance training provision. Further, a few selected CFPs can
    be transformed to become centers of excellence focusing on skills for the priority
    sectors.


                                             49
98. Skills training should include generic employability skills (such as
    communication, work ethics, etc.) and technical skills. A specific issue in
    Burundi is imparting functional English language training to improve
    employability. Employer surveys in countries such as Lesotho and Botswana reveal
    that they place emphasis on traits such as timeliness, discipline, self-organization, in
    addition to practical technical knowledge. Communication is an important skill that
    needs to be taught to school leavers who are getting ready to join the labor force. As
    Burundi is part of the EAC, which is predominantly English-speaking, providing
    functional language skills can greatly strengthen the chances of young people to get
    better jobs. While this may lead to greater outmigration (with possibility of the
    economy benefitting from greater remittances), this may also improve the marketing
    skills that are currently in short supply. Provided that basic education is of good
    quality, the possibility of using the CEMs and CFPs to provide English language
    training to the youth could be explored.

99. The Government has taken some critical steps on tertiary education. A new law
    regulating higher education called the Higher Education Act was passed in December
    2012. The law has defined the functioning of public and private universities, the
    system for the creation and approval of courses, accreditation of higher education
    institutions, and regulatory structure for the market for private higher education
    (Makoni, 2012). Most of this is to be done under the National Commission for Higher
    Education. The challenge is to ensure that this Commission is an active and
    functioning body with key stakeholders’ participation, particularly the private sector,
    and that this new body has the capacity to deliver on its ambitious mandate.
100. An immediate requirement is to manage enrollment expansion and quality at
     the tertiary level in order not to degrade quality further, and to allow time for
     quality assurance mechanisms to be put in place. Even under the scenario of
     gradual implementation of the basic education reform (Scenario 4), enrolment in
     post-secondary education is projected to rise by approximately 55,000 over the
     2014-2024. Higher education programs tend to be very theoretical, and curricula are
     extremely outdated. In the agribusiness sector, for example, the agronomy
     curriculum has not been updated for 20 years, while the universities that teach
     energy related courses often do not have the facilities or equipment to provide
     practical training on equipment. Lack of sufficient equipment for technical
     university programs has driven enrollment towards the humanities, the social
     sciences and law, for which there exists little unmet labor market demand.
101. While reforming the entire tertiary education system may take time, one
     pragmatic approach is to introduce competitive funds for targeting enrolment
     in specific programs. The Government, with the support of donors, could establish

                                             50
     mechanisms such as a Skills Development Fund, which can offer competitive grants
     to institutions, both private and public, supplying skills in priority sectors such as
     coffee and agribusiness. Proposals can be evaluated on a range of issues but priority
     should be given to those that show active consideration of the demand for skills,
     particularly involving the private sector.
102. The following priorities can be considered to strengthen the tertiary education
     system: (i) strengthening of the regulatory framework, quality assurance
     mechanisms and accreditation systems - priority could be given to the fields of
     agronomy, engineering and business and management; (ii) improving the quality of
     HE courses and adapting the methodology of delivery to the practical requirements
     of each field; and (iii) more appropriate targeting of scholarships focusing on the
     skills needs of growth sectors.

103. Table 3 summarizes the key issues Burundi faces in terms of WfD and
     highlights the priority interventions (policies and actions) for workforce
     development based on the analysis in this report, defined priorities in the
     PSDEF, and practices from other countries. The matrix address the three specific
     issues that hamper current workforce development in Burundi: (i) that many
     Burundians lack basic foundational skills that are the foundations for any growth
     strategy; (ii) existing training programs are fragmented, donor driven and lack
     integration and existing training does not target soft generic skills or middle level or
     specialized skills, all required for upgrading; and (iii) that the existing institutional
     framework is currently not structured for a demand led WfD strategy. The proposed
     policies and actions are organized around three main areas of intervention: (i) the
     implementation of basic education reform; (ii) improvements of skills for priority
     sectors; and (iii) a managed expansion of post-basic education and the
     implementation of a demand-led approach for WfD. The matrix is also informed
     from best practices.
