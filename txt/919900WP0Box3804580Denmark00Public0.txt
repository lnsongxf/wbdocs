The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

        Request and obtain building permit from the Municipality

        The request for a building permit must include:
        • Identification of the property
        • Drawing materials showing the development's total volume
        • Assessment of the development's overall impact on the environment
        (situation plan and sectional drawing)
        • Information about the development's appearance (facade drawing)
        • Information on use of the building, land, apartment number and
        settlement rate
        • Information on the plot size, height and distance conditions, location
        of adjacent or surrounding buildings
        • Information for the registration at the Building and Housing Register
        • Fire protection and sewage

        To process the warehouse permit application, the authorities will check
        all relevant documents. Thus, the entire process is covered by a single     21 days         DKK 209,194

        procedure that covers examining the area plan, checking plans and
        drawings, checking the lot plan, securing the Fire Department's
        permission, issuing a temporary building permit, issuing the structural
        engineer certificate, checking the rain water drainage, and checking
        building compliance with the Real Estate Registry’s regulations and
        requirements for registration and specific projects.

        On this basis, the authorities themselves will check whether the
        construction complies with area plans and relevant legislation,
        particularly legislation on fire protection. The authorities may conduct
        on-site inspections before issuing a permit, but this is not done on a
        regular basis.

        In order to ensure that specific legal requirements are fulfilled, an
        electrical contractor authorized by the Danish Safety Technology

        number, which allows him to log on to the utility’s homepage and
        submit an online installation application form.
        For installations of more than 63 A (as in the assumed case), in addition
        to the form, the electrician needs to submit drawings of the meter and
        installations board, and a test protocol for the power transformers (if
        needed).

        The utility will assign a connection point to which the client’s electrician
        will need to connect the cable. The utility has exact maps of the site
        location and thus does not carry out an inspection of the site to
        determine the connection point.
        The utility will also estimate the connection fees that the client will need
        to pay and that will include all the works carried out by DONG Energy
