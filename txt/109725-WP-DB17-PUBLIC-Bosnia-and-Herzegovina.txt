This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2016 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

time recorded among all economies in the DB2017 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

      prepared as a notary deed. The cost of the procedure of notarization of
      the sale-purchase agreement depends on the value of the real estate at
      the time of purchase. Parties provide the notary with the land registry
      excerpt (obtained in Procedure 1) and well as with a court excerpt
      (obtained in Procedure 2). The presence of both parties is necessary at
      the notary's office or verification of the signatures should be based on a
      special power of notary. The notary needs to be provided with the
      following documents:
      (1) The land registry excerpt as well as the copy of the cadastre plan
      proving the ownership over the property;
      (2) The extract from the company’s court registry certifying the person is
      authorized to act on behalf on the company and to sign the purchase
      agreement;
      (3) The approval of the founder (i.e. the General Assembly or Supervisory
      Board if applicable) for selling the property in case that the value of the
      property exceeds the amount of 1/3 of the company’s book value.

       New Notary Tariff has been passed on July 2013 (and replace previous
      one No. 71/07) and the same effected to the decresing of cost of
      notarization of sale-purchase agreement
      New Tariff of Notary Fees and Compensations has been passed on July
      24, 2013 and published in Official Gazzete of FB&H No. 57/13 and the
      same in general decresed the notary fees and compensations. Thus, the
      notary fee depends on the value of the property and will be calculated as
      follows:

      Value of property            notary fees in BAM
      above BAM            to BAM
      0                   5.000,00                    200,00 BAM

      50.000,00       100.000,00             350,00 BAM
      When the value of the subject of a legal transaction or other official
      action is over 100,000 BAM, notary is, besides the fee of 350,00 BAM,
      obliged to charge an additional fee of 50,00 BAM for every started
      100.000,00 BAM in the part in which the value of the official action
      exceeds 100.000,00 BAM, but in the amount not greater than 2.000,00

      Payment of transfer tax at the commercial bank

      The transfer tax is paid, usually by the buyer, at a commercial bank in
      favor of the municipal budget. Following an amendment to the Law on
      Transfer Tax of the Real Estates and Rights as published in the Official
      Gazette of Canton Sarajevo on March 31st, 2005, the transfer tax of 5%                     5% of property

      Parties submit the application and other documentation for the transfer
      of the ownership to the competent court land registry office. The
      registration of the transfer of ownership is handled by the authorized
      court officer. Time length of the Procedure is not prescribed by the law.
      However, the Procedure can last less than indicated above in case the
      party sends the urgency letter, especially in case of larger investments,
      explaining the grounds for such urgency, which happens often in
      practice. Computerization efforts at the Municipal Court in the past years

DB year            Reform

                   Bosnia and Herzegovina simplified its labor tax processes,
DB2011             reduced employer contribution rates for social security and
                   abolished its payroll tax.
                   Bosnia and Herzegovina eased the administrative burden of
DB2013             filing and paying social security contributions by implementing
                   electronic filing and payment systems.
                   Bosnia and Herzegovina introduced a penalty for failure to
                   employ the required minimum number of people with
DB2014
                   disabilities—though it also temporarily abolished the forestry
                   tax.
                   Bosnia and Herzegovina made paying taxes easier by abolishing
DB2017
                   the tourist community fee.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                                    Most delays in the proceeding are due to the sale of the immovable property.
                                      Steps for sale of movable property are simpler. Generally, movable property
                                    could be sold by bankruptcy administrator either directly in negotiations with
                                         the third party or at a public auction. The main steps in the foreclosure
                                         proceedings (for sale of immovable property) are: 1. assessment of the
                                     immovable property value; 2. sale of the immovable property. The sale of the
                                   property is conducted by the court. 3. payment of the price and transfer of the
                                                             immovable property to the buyer.
                                      There are 3 main reasons for delay during the sale of immovable property: •
 Time (in
                      3.3          the slowness of the courts that lead the sale procedure; • the complexity of the
years)
                                        court procedure for sale of the immovable property, which slows the sale
                                    procedure. For example, the immovable property cannot be sold below 1/2 of
                                   the assessed value at the first court hearing for the sale, respectively below 1/3
                                    of the assessed value at the second court hearing for the sale of the property.
                                    Only at the third court hearing for the sale, the immovable property might be
                                          sold without any limitations regarding the assessed value. • potential
                                       objections of the secured creditor’s claim by a third party. In this case third
                                       party initiates separate litigation proceeding where he/she proves that the
                                   creditor does not have secured claim. This litigation might take a year or more.

does not present rankings of economies on these
indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance
to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market
regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org). The data on labor
market regulation are based on a detailed questionnaire
on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
