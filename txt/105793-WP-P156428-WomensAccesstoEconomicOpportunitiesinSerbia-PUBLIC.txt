	      Executive summary


	       After more than a decade of progress in building an institutional
infrastructure for gender equality, the overall economic opportunities among
women in Serbia still lag those among men. Women, on average, earn 86 percent
of the wages of their coworkers who are men after one controls for differences in
educational and job characteristics. In the labor market, women who have the same
work profiles as men have similar chances to be employed; however, there are many
obstacles confronting women in joining the labor market in the first place. Gender
inequalities are pronounced in rural areas, where a high number of women serving
as unpaid family members are deprived of the right to social security. Furthermore,
the recently published Gender Equality Index ranks Serbia 12 percentage points
below European Union average. The Index highlights areas where particular efforts
are needed such as the domain of work, access to financial resources, and social
activities (domain of time).
	       This report focuses on better understanding the factors that influence
women’s economic opportunities in particular, an area in which significant
inequalities remain. Women’s economic opportunity is defined as a set of laws,
regulations, and practices that allow women to participate in the workforce under
conditions roughly equal to those of men, whether as wage-earning employees
or as owners of businesses. As such, the report looks into the ability ofwomen
to accumulate and build-up critical endowments - education and health – and to
participate in the labor market and have access to jobs. By reviewing the institutions
and policies relevant to gender equality in access to economic opportunities in Serbia,
the intention is also to point out necessary improvements in policies and programs
that will encourage women’s participation in the workplace and thus create a more
productive economy overall. The analysis mostly relies on exploiting a new dataset
for Serbia, the Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC), together with Labor
Force Survey (LFS) data.
	       Findings show that gender equality exists in Serbia in terms of both
participation in and attainment of education. Women in the prime age group
have better educational characteristics than men of the same age, while the opposite
holds for the older population of women. Gender educational gaps among the poor
and the bottom 40 percentof the income distribution (the bottom 40) are similar in
size relative to the corresponding gaps in the general population.
	       Nevertheless, individuals living in rural areas and the Roma population
are disadvantaged and tend to have larger gender educational gaps. According
to our findings,in rural areas, women have lower average educational attainment.
Early school leavers among women are also more likely to live in rural areas. Number
of indicators, such as,the enrolment rates in secondary education, average number
of years spent in education and percentage of population that can expect to complete
postsecondary education, have significantly lower values among Roma than non-
Roma population.

                                                                                     1
	       In the domain of knowledge, the Gender Equality Index suggest that,
in comparison to EU Member States, Serbia occupies a position among the
third of countries with the lowest scores. Within this domain gender differences
in educational attainment, segregation and lifelong learning are monitored.
Improvements are needed to increase the share of tertiary education graduates
among both women and men, but also to decrease segregation according to fields of
education. They are also needed to increase lifelong learning among both men and
women.
	       Women and men have almost equal access to medical services. Although
the data analyzed in this report does not have a heavy focus on health, it reveals
that women tend to report somewhat poorer health and must confront more
obstacles with respect to the affordability of medical services. Although the poor
and the bottom 40 face larger health concerns, the gender differences are not bigger
than those found among the general population. According to the Gender Equality
Index, gaps in health status and access to health services between Serbia and EU
are the smallest compared to other domains covered by the Index. However, Serbia
is positioned among the four countries with the lowest scores, having higher index
values only in comparison to the Baltic states.
	       In terms of access to jobs, the employment rates among women are
significantly lower than the employment rates among men mainly because
of greater economic inactivity among women. This is especially true among
women with low educational attainment and belonging to the 55–64 age-group. If
employed, women have more secure jobs given their prevalence in permanent wage
employment in industry and services. Meanwhile, women who work in agriculture
are in a difficult position given that the majority are unpaid family members and are
thus part of the informal labor market and have no social security.
	       Compared to EU member states, Serbia has lower score than all other
countries in the domain of work. According to the Gender Equality Index gaps
are pronounced in participation, segregation and quality of work. Women are less
frequently employed in full-time equivalent jobs and work less frequently with
flexible working hours. Their working life is five years shorter than men’s. Working
women are concentrated and represent a majority of the workforce in the social
sector of the economy: education, health and social protection.
	       A number of institutions are implementing and monitoring gender
equality issues; however, strengthening their capacities is a major challenge.
To ensure that policy goals are fulfilled and gender equality is increased in
practice,the provision of adequate resources and better coordination among the
gender-equalizing national machinery are needed.
	       Reconciliation measures that influence the balance between work and
family life, particularly childcare services, are in short supply. To help working
mothers, but also to expand the income-earning options among those women
currently inactive or unemployed,the number of preschool institutions must be
increased.
	

2
	       Current tax and benefit policies do not provide sufficient incentives
for engaging in formal part-time work. Part-time work is scarce among both
women and men, but, given that, in many European countries, these kinds of
working arrangements have brought many women into the labor market, policies
to expand the availability of part-time work should be considered. The abolishment
of the base-minimum social security contribution and the reduction of the rate of
withdrawal from monetary social assistance could enhance the part-time option
among women with low earnings capacity. Similar effects might be anticipated from
the introduction of an in-work benefit policy.
	       Spending on active labor market policies (ALMPs) needs to increase,
at least on measures that prove to be effective. Data show that women use the
National Employment Service (NES) more often than men in searching for jobs.
Likewise, more women participate in the full range of active labor market programs.
However, as a policy input, more research is required to identify the programs that
are more beneficial for women’s employment.
	       Tackling the disincentives and barriers that women face to work is
necessary, but boosting economic growth and overall labor demand is critical.
Addressing the constraints to jobs identified in the report needs to be complemented
with increases in overall labor demand. Serbia has one of the highest rates of
unemployment in Europe, and austerity measures that are to be implemented in
2016 will include cuts in public sector employment that may affect women more
than men. Serbia only recently exited from a spell of recession, and reconciling fiscal
consolidation and growth will be a challenge in the near future.
	       Parallel to working on reforms to improve the prospects for economic
growth and job creation, the government should take action to foster change
in the perceptions of the role of women in the family and, more generally, in
society. Although women around the world still shoulder the overwhelming burden
of household tasks, especially after they have given birth to children, in Serbia, as
in other countries, women also face discriminatory hiring practices, particularly
during their childbearing years and as young mothers.

	      Introduction

	       No meaningful progress is possible unless women have equal access to
opportunities, including in employment, quality education, healthcare, pro-
tection from violence, and participation in decision-making processes in soci-
ety. Given that the main gender gaps in the Western Balkans are found in women’s
access to economic opportunities, this report exploits a recently available dataset
–the 2013 Survey on Income and Living Conditions, benchmarked using data of the
Labor Force Survey – to better understand the gender gaps in outcomes and the
barriers that women face, with a strong focus on labor markets. The report also ex-
plores the policy arena and institutional context, also focusing on women’s access to
economic opportunities. Although not intending to cover all dimensions of gender
gaps (e.g. health, voice/agency), this assessment provides some insights into these
other dimensions, as they interact with women’s access to economic opportunities.
It includes information on education and health available in the SILC data to get the
most out of this new dataset available for Serbia, with education being particularly
important in this country precisely for labor market outcomes and paths.
	       While economic growth is necessary to give women the opportunities
they need, women’s participation in the labor market is also an important con-
tributor to the growth process. This is especially critical in rapidly aging societies
where higher female participation could offset the impact of a shrinking labor force.
Estimates of Cuberes and Teignier (2015) suggest that raising female labor force
participation rates to the levels among men in Serbia could boost aggregate income
by 9.3 percent.
	       Boosting educational attainment among girls and women contributes
to greater economic growth. However, the gains in education must trans-
late into better labor market outcomes. Analysis presented in this report is
encouraging:educational attainment among men and women is improving, especial-
ly among women. This is closing the gender gap in primary education, although it is
widening the gap in tertiary education in favor of women. Also, in the labor market,
women with the same characteristics as men have an equal chance to be employed.
However, the gaps in labor market outcomes among men and women are wider than
the gender gaps in educational attainment, and this mainly derives from the higher
rate of economic inactivity among women. Thus, fewer women are succeeding in
joining the labor market and in competing with men for jobs.
	       Among the employed, gender gaps also exist. A large gender wage gap
that increases at higher wage levels hints at the presence of a ceiling effect. In fact,
the Gender Equality index suggests that the most urgent policy action is needed in
the area of money. Access to financial resources, measured in the context of labor
markets by assessing the differences in monthly earnings between women and men
(the wage gap), reveals that with a Gender Equality Index value of 26 points, Serbia
is far below an EU average result of 58 index points. Looking at another aspect of
access to financial resources, the World Bank’s Global Findex indicators, with data
for Serbia in 2014, suggest the same percentage of men and women having an ac-
4
count at financial institutions. There is a small difference of 2 percentage points in
favour of men in terms of having savings at financial institutions and borrowing
money from them.1 Recent research shows that not many women in Serbia succeed
in reaching a decision-making position in climbing the career ladder, signaling an-
other area in which improvements are needed. International evidence suggests that
gender equality in this area, beyond representing a goal in itself, can promote eco-
nomic development.2
	       This report shows that women in Serbia tend to report poorer health
than men and are more often unable to afford medical services. This deserves
more attention among policymakers given that the available research suggests that
improvement in women’s health strengthens their economic empowerment (OECD
2011b).
	       The national machinery for the promotion of gender equality is large
but better coordination between institutions needs to be ensured in order to
provide full enforcement of gender-equalizing legislation and policies. In 2014
a new institution was created- the Coordinating Body for Gender Equality -with a
central role in managing activities aimed at increasing gender equality at the nation-
al level. Its recent policy initiatives include the adoption of the new National Strategy
for Gender Equality (2016-2020) and the accompanying Activity Plan (2016-2018).
Also, a new law on equality between women and men has been drafted. New provi-
sions of the Budget System Law make gender-responsive budgeting mandatory for
all local, provincial, and national budgeting authorities as of 2016.
	       One critical policy area identified by the report is on the disincentives
to work and to hire embedded in the tax and social protection systems. Rea-
sons for the small share of part-time employment in total formal employment and
for the roughly equal participation of men and women in formal part-time jobs, un-
like in most EU countries, could be found in the design of tax and benefit policies.
Serbia, together with the countries in the region, have the lowest statutory personal
income tax rate in Europe. However, since the social security tax rates are among the
highest, and the deductions and credits are few, the tax wedges remain quite high for
those with low wages. Arandarenko and Vukojevic (2008) show that progressivity
of the tax wedge for Serbia very mild or completely absent at 50%-100% of average
wage levels, which is empirically the most dense section of the wage distribution.
Minimum social security contributions (SSC) base, set at 35% of the average gross
wage, is not adjusted for hours actually worked, which implies that low-paid part
time workers are also subject to it. Even if employee’s monthly gross salary is below
this threshold, social security contributions are applied to the threshold. Similarly,

  There is evidence that women’s presence on boards and in senior management has a positive impact on
the performance of companies. For instance, companies with three or more women on senior management
teams score better on several organizational dimensions that are positively associated with greater profit-
ability and better financial performance (Catalyst 2004; Desvaux, Devillard-Hoellinger, and Meaney 2008).
Changing social attitudes toward women in high-level positions contributes to greater female participation
in the formal labor force and positive outcomes on children’s education, health, and nutrition, which leads
to greater economic growth for all in the long run (OECD 2011a).

                                                                                                         5
design of major social cash transfer, monetary social assistance, is such that, once
a person has formal income on record, benefit is decreased by the total amount of
earned income, or completely withdrawn. Although spending on this benefit pro-
gramme is just 0.3% of the GDP, the number of beneficiaries has increased during
last couple of years and now almost half of them are able bodied persons. Therefore,
high minimum SSC base and social assistance benefit design makepart-time jobs
economically unattractive for individuals with low earnings capacity, those having
little or no working experience and low level of education. For women, who face the
challenge of balancing family and work responsibilities, the high disincentives to
(formal) part-time work can significantly limit their economic opportunities.
	        Another key policy area focuses on investing in child care facilities
that could bring better reconciliation of family and working life for employed
mothers and expand income earnings options for those women currently in-
active or unemployed. According to Gender Equality Index, time use is the area
with low achievements and prominent gender gaps. Women are disproportionately
responsible for care activities and household work in the household and the family.
For Serbia, the index exceeds the EU index value for the sub-domain of care, while
lags behind in the sub-domain of social activities. In other words, women in Serbia,
compared to females in the EU, spend more time in care activities but use less fre-
quently time for sport, culture and leisure activities. Our report shows that almost
all of those inactive who do not look for a job due to care for children or older family
members, are women. Although the number of child care institutions has increased
every year in the last 20 years, it is still not sufficient to cover all children of pre-
school age.
	        The structure of the report is as follows. The first section focuses on gaps
in endowments – mostly education but with insights into health care – , and labor
market outcomes. The second section provides an assessment of the institutional
infrastructure for promoting gender equality and analyzes policies that support
female labor force participation. The report concludes with several recommenda-
tions for policy reforms that could enhance women’s access to economic opportuni-
ties in Serbia.

       and the labor market

 Main messages
 Education
 •	 There are no significant gender disparities in educational participation.
 •	 Women and men in Serbia, on average, show similar levels of educational attainment.
 •	 Women of prime (age 25-54) age exhibit better educational characteristics than men
    of the same age. Older women (age 54–64), in contrast, are more likely to face a gen-
    der gap in education. This is also true among inactive women and women living in
    rural areas.
 •	 The gender educational gaps among the poor and the bottom 40 percent of the in-
    come distribution (the bottom 40) are similar to the corresponding gaps in the total
    population.
 •	 There are fewer early school leavers among girls.
 Health
 •	 A larger share of women report poor health.
 •	 There are no significant gender differences in health among the poor or the bottom
    40.
 •	 On average, women enjoy longer life expectancy.
 •	 Access to medical services among women is almost equal to that among men.
 •	 Among the poor and the bottom 40, men report a somewhat higher share of unmet
    medical needs.
 •	 Women faced unmet medical needs more frequently than men because of a lack of
    affordability in medical services.


       Gender gaps in enrollment and educational attainment


	       Investing in formal education is essential to promote equality in employ-
ment opportunities and strengthen economic growth. Better education improves
productivity and provides individuals with a greater ability to further develop their
knowledge and skills throughout their lives. Increased educational attainment is also as-
sociated with better health, and more investments in the education and health of children
– especially among women (OECD, 2011).
	       Serbia spends 4,7% of its GDP for education, which is the level of govern-
ment spending comparable to other European countries, but its outcomes are con-
siderably poorer. Serbia took part in the Programme for International Student Assess-
ment (PISA) in 2003, 2006 and 2012. On all three occasions, Serbia’s 15-year-olds failed
to demonstrate an adequate level of achievement in reading, mathematical and scientific
literacy. In terms of mathematical literacy, students in Serbia in 2012 scored 45 points be-
low the OECD average, which is equivalent to one year of schooling in the OECD countries.
Results obtainedin reading and scientific literacy were 50 and 60 points below OECD av-
erage, respectively (Pavlovic-Babic i Baucal, 2013).

	       The recently released Gender Equality Index suggests that, in the domain of
knowledge, in comparison to EU Member States, Serbia occupies a position among
the bottom third of countries. Within this domain gender differences in educational
attainment, segregation and lifelong learning are monitored. In 2012, the difference be-
tween women and men in the share of tertiary education graduates was only 0.1 percent-
age points, while in 2014 it increased to 2.5 percentage points. Although this is not yet a
big difference, it should be closely monitored. The indicator on segregation reveals more
prominent gender discrepancies, with women concentrated significantly in the area of
social sciences, humanities and arts. The gap is however stable (20.4 in 2012 and 20.7
percentage points in 2014). Participation in lifelong learning is low among both – women
and men - , and the gender gap is very small (0.4 percentage points in 2014). 3
	       Primary schools in Serbia are compulsory, and children are usually enrolled at the
age of 6 or 7. Primary education lasts eight years and corresponds to levels 1 and 2 of the
International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) (EC 2014). According to SILC
data, 99.9 percentof children in the 7–14 age-group—the age at which they are supposed
to be enrolled in mandatory primary education—are enrolled in the educational system.4
	       Secondary education is provided by two types of institutions, gymnasiums and
vocational schools, corresponding to ISCED level 3. Gymnasium lasts four years and sup-
plies broad general education. However, a gymnasium diploma usually does not provide
immediate employment opportunities, but good possibilities for further (tertiary) educa-
tion. Vocational schools focus on specific disciplines and lead to more employment op-
portunities without further education. They last three or four years. The four-year voca-
tional courses of study offer broader possibilities for further education, compared with
the three-year courses.
	       Overall, the number of boys and girls enrolled in secondary education is practi-
cally equal: girls represent 49.6 percent of secondary-school students. In 2013, girls ac-
counted for the majority of gymnasium graduates (58.0 percent) and four-year vocation-
al-school graduates (52.0 percent), while boys were more numerous among three-year
vocational-school graduates (two thirds are boys) (SORS 2014a). The enrollment rates in
secondary education among the Roma population are significantly lower, only 27 percent
among boys and 23 percent among girls (World Bank 2015a).
	       Tertiary-education institutions typically enroll students at the age of 19. There
are two types of tertiary-education institutions: college (viša škola) and university. Until
recently, college lasted two years. University education usually lasts four years, leading to
a bachelor’s degree.5 Universities also offer master’s degrees, which require five years in
tertiary education, and PhDs (eight years). According to administrative data supplied by

    Conducted by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia (SORS), SILC provides nationally and
regionally representative data on sociodemographic variables (including gender, age, and educational at-
tainment), income, poverty, the labor market, and living conditions (including health). The sample includes
6,501 households stratified at two levels: enumeration districts (the primary selection unit) and households
(the secondary selection unit). The data cover the weights, provided by the SORS, used to correct the de-
scriptive statistics and the regression estimates.

   After the signing of the Bologna Declaration, some universities began to offer three-year programs,
leading to a bachelor’s degree.

 the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia (SORS), the share of women among students
 enrolled in tertiary education was 56.0 percentin 2012 (SORS 2014a).
 	       On average, women are not less educated than men. SILC data presented in
 Table 1.1 show that although women have higher share of primary education, they also
 have a higher share of tertiary educational attainment, whereas the rates for secondary-
 school diplomas are higher among men. Tertiary educational attainment among men and
 women is low in Serbia compared with the average among the current full membership
 of the European Union (the EU28), which is 26.8 percent among women and 23.7 percent
 among men. 6

 	        A more detailed analysis of educational structurereveals that more women than
 men have attained four-year secondary-school diplomas and tertiary education
 (Figure 1.2). Men outnumber women in three-year secondary-school programs, which
 is reflected in job positions, given that men account for more than 80percent of craft and
 trade workers and plant and machine operators (appendix Table A15). However, the
 share of men with three-year secondary-schoolcertificates decreases with age, suggest-
 ing that three-year schools are declining in popularity.

	      Women of prime age (aged 25-54) enjoy higher educational attain-
ment than men, but the reverse is true among older cohorts. Almost 25 percent
of women 25–54 years of age have completed tertiary education, compared with
around 18 percent of men. In the same age-group, more women have four-year sec-
ondary-school diplomas, and the share of women with three-year secondary-school
degrees is 9 percentage points lower than the corresponding share among men (Fig-
ure 1.3). Among the 55–64 age-group, the situation is the opposite: 20.0 percent of
men have attained a tertiary education,compared with 13.8 percent of women. Ad-
ditionally, among 43.1 percent of women and 27.0 percent of men in this age-group,
the highest level of education attained is primary or lower, and the share of women
who have not completed primary school is the largest in this age bracket (Figure
1.3). These various data imply that educational attainment is improving among the
population, but particularly among women.

	       Gender differences in educational attainment are more pronounced in
rural areas than in urban areas. In rural areas, women have lower average educa-
tional attainment: the highest educational attainment is completed primary school
or lower among 42.5 percent of women, compared with 35.3 percent of men. In
urban areas, average educational attainment is the same among women and men.
Women have a higher share of tertiary educational attainment, but also a higher
share of primary educational attainment (appendix Figure A1).
	       Among people who are active in the labor market, women are more well
educated, and, among the inactive, the gender gaps in education are small. On
average, both employed and unemployed women show better educational attainment
than their counterparts among men. This is because greater shares of women with ter-
tiary educational attainment are in both groups. Differences in educational attainment
among inactive men and women, however, are only slightly in favor of men because of
the lower share of primary educational attainment among men (Figure 1.4).

	      Only 30 percent of Roma individuals can expect to complete postsecondary
education. The share is somewhat lower among women. This compares with almost 70
percent among the non-Roma population. Meanwhile, one-quarter of Roma women can
expect to finish lower-secondary education as their highest level of educational attain-
ment; this compares with only 3 percent among non-Roma women.



	          Educational attainment, poverty, and shared prosperity


	       Among both men and women, the poor show significantly lower levels of
educational attainment than the nonpoor.7 However, among the poor, the gender gap
in education is negligible and follows the pattern among the general population. Asimilar
situation is found among the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution (the bottom
40) and across the structure of educational attainment considered more widely (Figure
1.5; appendix Figure A2).

    We use 30 percent of the median equivalised income poverty line to capture those people who face the
deepest risk of poverty. This poverty line gives a poverty rate of 9.1 percent. This is close to the absolute
poverty rate of 8.7 percent based on consumption data of the Household Budget Survey (Mijatović 2014).
The poverty line is equal to a disposable income of SRD 6,840 a month or $2.60 a day (based on the 2012
exchange rate).The official at-risk-of-poverty line based on SILC data is 60 percent of the median equival-
ized income, yielding a 24.6 percentat-the-risk-of-poverty rate. Because this indicator does not provide
much additional information relative to the shared prosperity indicator (40 percent poverty rate), we opted
to use a more “strict” criteria.

	      The average number of years spent in education is much lower among the
Roma: almost 6.0 years among women and 6.7 years among men, compared with
11.0 years across all non-Roma (World Bank 2015a).


	         Early school leavers


	       Education policy in Serbia encourages people to complete at least secondary
education given that lower attainment is associated with a higher risk of unemploy-
ment, labor market marginalization, poverty, and social exclusion.
	       Early school leavers include young people who have left education and train-
ing with only primary education or less and who are no longer in education.8 Eu-
rostat calculates the rate of early school leavers as a percentage of the total 18–24
age-group using LFS data. In 2013, the average rate among the EU28 stood at 11.9
percent, and young men showed a higher rate than young women, by 3.3 percent-
age points (13.5 percent vs. 10.2 percent). The rate in Serbia based on LFS data in
the first quarter of 2014 stood at 8.1 percent, and it is only slightly higher among
men than among women (8.5 percent vs. 7.7 percent).9 Lower rates were also ob-

   In Serbia, primary education corresponds to ISCED level 2. Eurostat defines early school leavers as young
men and women aged 18–24 who (a) have attained at most lower-secondary education (the highest level of
education or training they have completed is 2011 ISCED 0, 1, or 2) and (b) were not involved in education
or training during the four weeks preceding the survey. The Eurostat indicator is based onLFS data, while,
in the SORS LFS communications, this indicator is not published. SILC data provide the higher estimate
for this indicator because we are not able to exclude from the early school leavers those who are receivingor
have received training. Therefore, (b) is defined as those who are currently not in education.

served in neighboring countries: 7.0 percent in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 4.5 percent
in Croatia,and 3.7 percent in Slovenia.10
	       SILC data similarly suggest that there are fewer early school leavers
among girls and women and that the gender gap in the rate is wider among
the poor. Among the 18–24 age-group, the early school leaving rate in 2013 was
11.1 percent among men and 7.9 percent among women. The rates among both men
and women are higher among the poor,and the gender gap widens to 10.0 percent
among the poor because the rates surge to 20.9 percent among women and 30.9 per-
cent among men. Similarly, early school leaving rates are higher among the bottom
40, although the gender differences are approximately the same among the bottom
40 as among the general population (15.2 percent among women and 17.9 percent
among men).
	       Although they are only marginally reliable because of the limited sample size,
results indicate that early school leavers show substantially lower employment rates
among women than among men (17.5 percent vs. 37.9 percent), much higher respec-
tive inactivity rates (54.3 percent vs. 19.0 percent), and lower respective poverty
rates (26.8 percent vs. 33.0 percent). Early school leavers among women are also
more likely to live in rural areas (56.0 percent vs. 49.3 percent)(appendix Figure A3).


	       Gender gaps in health indicators


	       Public health spending amounts to 6.5% of the GDP, which is close to
EU average of 7%. However, health indicators lag behind those of majority of
the EU countries. The value of life expectancy at the age of 65 in Serbia is among
the lowest in Europe. In 2011, the value of this indicator was 4.3 years below the
European Union average (15.3 versus 19.6 years). Children are an especially vulner-
able group, and the infant mortality rate decreased since 2010: in 2012 there were
6.2 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. This value puts Serbia among the countries
in Europe with high infant mortality rates. The infant mortality rate in Roma settle-
ments is estimated to be more than twice as high, at 13 to 1,000 live births in 2012,
while the Roma under-5 mortality rate was 14 per 1,000 live births (Government of
Serbia, 2014). Furthermore, indicators of efficiency in the health care system show
lower values than those in EU countries, at the level of primary, secondary and ter-
tiary health care alike.11
	       Available health indicators suggest that women in Serbia experience
worse health conditions than men. First, compared with the situation in the EU28,

    The introduction of mechanisms for increasing the health care system efficiency and the health profes-
sionals’ productivity is difficult. Capitation, as a method of payment for selected physicians in primary
health care, was implemented in 2013 after a delay but rendered symbolic differences in rewarding pro-
ductivity. The implementation of a new method of financing of hospitals by diagnosis-related groups is
progressing at a very slow pace (Government of Serbia, 2014).
                                                                                                       13
women and men in Serbia report somewhat lower shares of chronic illness, other
health problems, or limitations in routine activities because of health issues, but a
higher incidence of poor or very poor health (Figure 1.6). However, women report a
higher share of chronic illness or chronic health problems than men (by 6.6 percent-
age points), and somewhat more women than men perceive their health as bad or
very bad (Figure 1.6). While, among people living below the poverty lineor among
the bottom 40, all indicators show generally worse health conditions, the gender dif-
ferences are not more pronounced (appendix Figure A4).

	       Women have longer life expectancy than men. In 2012, life expectancy
at birth was 77.5 years among women and 72.3 among men. Although rising since
2000, life expectancy at birth in Serbia is still significantly lower than the EU28 aver-
age of 83.1 years among women and 77.5 years among men.12
	       On average, the access of women to health care services in Serbia is
almost equal to that of men. The shares of women reporting an unmet need for
medical or dental care in Serbia (17.3 percentand 21.6 percent, respectively) is ap-
proximately equal to the corresponding shares among men (17.9 percent and 19.1
percent, respectively). These shares are high compared with the overall EU28 aver-
ages of about 7.0 percent and 8.0 percent for unmet needs in medical and dental
services, respectively.13
	       Among both women and men, people living below the poverty line re-
port higher shares of unmet medical and dental needs relative to the nonpoor:
a difference of almost 10 percent for both types of services (Figure 1.7). Among the
poor, a somewhat higher share of men report they have unmet needs in both service
areas. The gap in unmet needs between the bottom 40 and the rest of the population

	      Affordability is the main reported reason people do not seek the servic-
es of doctors or dentists in Serbia; the share is slightly higher among women.
Among women reporting unmet needs, 31.7 percentin medical services and 58.5
percent in dental services were accounted for by lack of affordability; among men,
the respective shares were 28.9 percent and 50.2 percent (Figure 1.8). Women also
report more frequently than men that they are on waiting lists for medical services.

	          Gender gaps in labor market outcomes

    Main messages

    •	   If they are in the labor market, women of the same characteristics as men have an
         equal chance of employment.
    •	   However, even if they have similar characteristics, women face difficulties in joining
         the labor market in the first place. Men have close to a 15 percentage points advan-
         tage over women in the current employment rate. In industry and services, women
         work more often as permanent, wage employees and therefore have more secure
         jobs than men.
    •	   In agriculture, women are in the majority among unpaid family members lacking so-
         cial security.
    •	   Among the poor and the bottom 40, the main difference between men and women is
         in the significantly higher share of inactive women. However, if they are employed,
         the poor are more often found in agriculture, and the shares in employment are high-
         er among women.
    •	   The gender wage gap, adjusted for the other relevant wage determinants, is large,
         amounting to almost 14 percent.
	

	          Gender gaps in employment, unemployment, and inactivity

	      The employment rate is substantially lower among women than among
men. According to LFS data, employment rates among the 15–64 age-group in 2013
stood at 40.1 percent among women and 54.9 percent among men. The gender gap
was thus 14.8 percentage points. The difference in the employment rates was mainly
associated with the greater inactivity rate among women, by 16.9 percentage points,
yielding a small gender unemployment gap of 2.9 percentage points (Table 1.9).

	      The 2008–09 global financial crisis affected labor markets in Serbia
through a reduction in employment rates among men and women. According
to LFS data, employment rates declined rapidly among both men and women be-
tween 2008 and 2011 (Figure 1.10). The drop in employment was more pronounced
among men (a cumulative 9.9 percentage points) than among women (7.2 percent-
age points), which led to a reduction in the gender employment gap from 17.0 to
14.1 percentage points in 2008–11. The reason for this trend was the higher number

16
of women employed in the public sector, which showed less employment contrac-
tion than the private sector (Avlijaš et al. 2013).

	      Employment rates have started to recover. Between 2012 and 2014, the
employment rate rose by 4.1 percentage points among men and 4.7 percentage
points among women (see Figure 1.10). However, employment growth seems to
have been driven mainly by the expansion in informal employment (SORS 2015a).
According to LFS data, annual employment rates among the 15–64 age-group in
2014 stood at 43.6 percent among women and 57.2 percent among men (see Fig-
ure 1.10). These rates are significantly below the EU28 average, 59.6 percent and
70.1 percent, respectively.14 Although the gender employment gap bottomed at 13.7
percentage points in 2014 because of the more favorable trends in women’s employ-
ment in recent years, it is still larger than the EU28 average (10.5 percentage points).
	      Unemployment is substantial among both men and women. According
to LFS data, the unemployment rates in 2013 stood at 21.7 percent among men and
24.6 percent among women. These rates are substantially higher than the EU28 av-
erage (10.2 percentand 10.4 percent, respectively). The gender unemployment gap,
2.9 percentage points, is higher than the EU28 average, which is close to zero (−0.1
percentage points).
	      In what follows, the gender gaps in labor market outcomes are based
on SILC data because these data allow us to link the findings with indicators
on poverty and shared prosperity. Relative to the LFS, the SILC reports higher
employment rates—46.5 percent among women and 59.6 percent among men—
because of better coverage of less permanent and less readily noticeable types of
employment, such as work at market stalls or seasonal work in agriculture. Such
jobs are mainly grouped under self-employment, unpaid family work, or temporary

stable, permanent wage jobs among the total population are approximately identi-
cal in both surveys. The gender gap in employment rate is slightly less pronounced
in the SILC data (13.1 vs. 14.8 percentage pointsin the LFS data) given thata signifi-
cant share of employment among women is in the informal agricultural sector. Addi-
tionally, compared with the LFS, the gaps in inactivity and unemployment rates are
slightly lower (15.2 and 1.9 percentage points respectively).

	        These low employment rates are the result of two interrelated factors:
•	 High youth inactivity, particularly among women (70.8 percent relative to 57.5
    percent among men), because of education (92.0 percent of inactive youth are
    still in school) and the lack of opportunities to balance work and school
•	 High youth unemployment, particularly among women (54.9 percent relative to
    48.6 percent among men), because of limited work experience and the difficult
    transition from school to work (Krstic 2009)
	        From the gender perspective, although the youth gender employment gap, at
7.6 percentage points, is lower than the gender gap among the working-age popula-
tion, at 13.1 percentage points, young women are not in a better position than other
women. The lower gender employment gap is a statistical artifact because of the
floor effect, that is, the low overall employment rates do not allow for higher levels of
inequality between men and women. The difficult position of young women is con-

18
firmed by the wide gender unemployment gap, which is most pronounced among
this age-group, at 6.4 percentage points (Figure 1.11, right), indicating that young
women face more difficulty than young men in finding jobs.
	       The gender employment rate gap is most pronounced among older
workers. Among workers in the 55–64 age-group, the gap is 18.7 percentage points
because of the higher inactivity rate among women (66.3 percent vs. 41.5 percent
among men) partly caused by earlier retirement: the legal retirement age is 60
among women and 65 among men.
	       The gender employment and inactivity rate gaps are more pronounced
among the better educated. The employment rate gap among people with prima-
ry and secondary education was about 15.0 percentage points, compared with 3.9
percentage points among people with tertiary education (Figure 1.12). The inactiv-
ity rate gaps follow the size and pattern of the employment gaps, that is, wider gaps
at the lower levels of education and narrower gaps at the tertiary level (appendix
Figure A6). The unemployment rate gap is smaller and follows a different pattern:
with attainment of primary education, unemployment rates are higher among men,
while better educated women have a slightly harder time finding jobs than the cor-
responding men.

	      The gender employment rate gap is two times wider in rural areas than
in urban areas (18.9 vs. 8.9 percentage points) because of higher employment rates
among men in rural areas, mainly in agriculture. While there are no differences in
unemployment rates among men and women in urban areas, unemployment rates
areabout 5.0 percentage points higher among women than among men in rural ar-
eas (appendix Figure A7).




                                                                                               19
	        The adjusted gender gap in economic activity and employment


	       The gender gaps in employment, unemployment, and inactivity estimated in
the previous subsection present differences between the average woman and the av-
erage man in the population. However, these average, unadjusted gender gaps may
be associated with differences in characteristics that are important for labor market
participation and employment.
	       In this subsection, gender gaps in labor market status are assessed by
holding key household and individual characteristics statistically constant,
via regression analysis. The purpose of the regression analysis is to go beyond the
descriptive indicators such as (in)activity and unemployment rate gaps and to check
whether these gaps can be explained by characteristics other than gender. When
adjusted for these characteristics, these gaps show the differences between men and
women with otherwise similar household and individual characteristics. Further-
more, the analysis focuses on two questions:
•	 What are the main factors associated with higher female and male labor market
    participation (vs. inactivity)?
•	 What are the main factors associated with higher female and male employment
    (vs. unemployment) when they enter the labor market?
•	 For both models, a probit regression is first applied on the whole sample and
    then estimated separately for women and men.


	        The labor participation model


	       In the labor participation model, we estimate the adjusted gender gap
in labor market participation (that is,the activity gap).15 Labor market partici-
pation means that an individual is either working (employed) or is actively seeking
work and is ready to take up a job (unemployed). Therefore, we regress the binary
variable, which takes the value of 1 if a person is participating in the labor market
(that is, if a person is employed or unemployed) and the value of 0 if the person is
not participating in the labor market (that is, if a person is inactive). Because the de-
pendent variable in this model is a dummy variable, we apply the probit model and
calculate the marginal effects to assess the impact of gender conditional on other
relevant characteristics.
	       On average, women show a 15.2 percentage points lower probability of
labor market activity than men. Starting with the simple model wherein gender
is the only regressor in the labor market participation equation, the marginal effect
for the model (S1) is statistically significant, and it shows that, if the individual is a

     The sample for the analysis includes 13,606 men and women in the working-age population (15–64), and
it is comparable with the sample for the analysis of the main labor market indicators presented in table 1.9.

    woman, this decreases the likelihood of labor market participation by 0.152 (Table
    1.13). Given that there are no other regressors in the model, this coefficient repre-
    sents the unadjusted gender participation gap.16

    	       Relative to men of the same age and educational attainment, women
    show an 18.8 percentage points lower probability of labor market participa-
    tion. The S2 column in the row Woman in Table 1.13 presents the labor market
    participation gap adjusted for differences in age and education, which increases to
    0.188 relative to the unadjusted gap. In models S3 and S4, we include the regional
    and residence (urban or rural) effects and the effects of household pensions and
    benefits (monetary social assistance and the child allowance), but they have no im-
    pact on the participation gap. If marital status and the number of children are in-
    cluded in the model, the participation gap reaches 0.19. This means that, relative to
    men of the same age and education, from the same area of residence and region, and
    exhibiting the same household characteristics, women show 19.0 percentage points
    less likelihood of participating in the labor market (Table 1.13, column S5).
    	       Tertiary educational attainment is a more important factor in activity
    among women. Figure 1.14 presents the results of labor participation models esti-
    mated separately for men and women. These models aim to capture differences in
    the main determinants and correlates of male and female laborforce participation.
    First, while the effects of age and secondary educational attainment on male and
    female activity are positive and approximately equal, the marginal effects of tertiary
    educational attainment are substantially larger among women. Urban residence de-
    creases the likelihood of labor market activity equally among both men and women
    (all else being the same).

	       Second, receiving pensions and benefits is associated with lower likeli-
hood of activity among both men and women, but the decline is greater among
women. While receiving pensions is associated with lower male and female activity
to the same extent, the female recipients of social benefits are twice as likely to be in-
active than their male counterparts. Therefore, receiving benefits is associated with
a stronger inactivity incentive among women than among men and accounts for part
of the gap in participation.
	       The presence of young children in the household is associated with a
significantly lower probability of labor market participation among women.
Men are more likely to participate in the labor market if they are married, while
marriage is not associated with women’s participation. Having small children (up
to the age of 2), however, is positively correlated with activity of men, negatively
withactivity among women. Yet, having children between 2 and 6 years of age is not
associated with the participation of either men or women. Therefore, gender roles in
the care of young children are likely to be associated with the labor market activity
of men and women and explain part of the gap in participation.


	             The employment model


	    In the employment model, we estimate the gender differences in the
probability of finding a job if an individual has entered the labor market.17 Thus,
we model the binary variable, which takes the value of 1 if the individual is employed

17
    The sample for the analysis includes 6,856 active men and women aged between 15 and 64.It is com-
parable with the sample for the employed and unemployed used to obtain employment and unemploy-
ment rates in table 1.9.

22
    and 0 if the individual is unemployed. This definition of the dependent variable repre-
    sents the variable that is used in the calculation of the unemployment rate, but we re-
    verse the groups here so the interpretation of the coefficients would revolve around
    higher association with employment.
    	       Overall, once women enter the labor market, the probability they will find
    a job is similar to that of men. The marginal effect for the model S1, where gender
    is the only predictor of employment, is statistically significant and amounts to −0.019
    (Table 1.15, column S1). Because we do not include any other regressors, this coef-
    ficient is equivalent to the unadjusted gender unemployment gap calculated above.
    On average, women face a 1.9 percent lower probability of being employed relative
    to men. After the employment gap is adjusted for the differences in work experience
    and educational attainment, it decreases to 0.001 and becomes statistically insignifi-
    cant because men who are active show a greater average amount of work experience
    relative to women (Table 1.15, column S2). Therefore, the gender unemployment gap
    can be explained on the basis of the longer work experience of active men. In models
    S3 and S4, region, residence, marital status, and number of children are included as
    additional variables. The unemployment gap remains unchanged and statistically in-
    significant (Table 1.15, column S4). Therefore, relative to men of the same age, work
    experience, area of residence, region, marital status, and number of children,women
    have the same probability of employment if they are in the labor market.

    	       Among both women and men, the probability of employment rises with
    work experience (at a decreasing rate) and educational attainment. Figure
    1.16 presents separate models for men and women that highlight differences in em-
    ployment determinants. While tertiary educational attainment increases the chance
    of finding work among both men and women to approximately the same extent, sec-
    ondary educational attainment raises the employment opportunities only among
    men. Therefore, women with secondary education have the same employment op-
    portunities as women with primary education if they enter the labor market. Urban
    residence decreases the likelihood of employment among both men and women(all
    else being equal), while regional differences in employment opportunities arise only
    among women. Women in Eastern Serbia and Vojvodina face more difficulty finding
    work and are thus in a relatively worse position than similar women in Belgrade.

	     The gender differences in employment determinants are most pro-
nounced in household variables. Women are more likely to be employed if they
are married, while, among men, marriage is associated with lower likelihood of
employment. The marginal effects of having small children (up to the age of 2 or
between ages 2 and 6) are positive and significant among both women and men.
However, they are almost twice as large among men relative to women (Figure 1.16).
This may derive from the fact that men with small children are often considered the
primary breadwinners and are more willing to accept any job offer they receive.

            Job-quality gap sand gender segregation by occupation and
            economic sector


	      Employed women, on average, have better jobs than men. Almost half
of employed women (44.7 percent) work in the four most highly paid occupations
(managers, professionals, technicians,and clerks), compared with fewer than one-
third of men (30.2 percent) (Figure 1.17, left).18

  	     Women are also a majority among service and sales workers and workers in basic occupations,
while men account for more than 80 percent of craft and trade workers and plant and machine operators
(appendix Table A10).

	        However, women work relatively less frequently as managers, which
shows that they have less access to decision-making positions. Analysis of the
2009 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey shows that women
constitute only 16 percent of top firm managers.19 Companies with women’s partici-
pation in ownership are substantially more likely to have women among top man-
agers than solely male-owned companies: 41 percent of woman-owned firms vs. 6
percent of man-owned firms have women as top managers.
	        Research has shown that women face obstacles in attempting to climb the ca-
reer ladder (Babović 2007). First, focus group discussions with employees at private
enterprises revealed that there is a social bias toward women in senior positions so
that, even if a company’s board of directors is prepared to promote a woman to a
management position, the decision is often met with strong resistance among male
colleagues. If a woman is eventually assigned a management role, she may face a lack
of cooperation by men in her daily work. Second, the increased professional respon-
sibilities and greater contributions to household budgets of women are not nec-
essarily accompanied by a reduction in women’s everyday household obligations.
Hence, women commonly mention the need to care for the family as an obstacle to
professional growth and career advancement.
	        Almost two-thirds of women, 64.9 percent, work in services, compared
with 49.8 percent of men. The share of women and men working in agriculture is
approximately the same and roughly corresponds to the share of skilled agricultural
workers in the structure of employment by occupations (see Figure 1.17).

	      In terms of gaps in job quality, women are wage-employed and on per-
manent working contracts more frequently than men, which suggests that wom-
en have more secure jobs (Figure 1.18). However, this is only true in the industry and
service sectors, whereas, in agriculture, where more than one-fifth of women work,
women are less well off, given that half of them work as unpaid family members,
compared with only 15.9 percent of men (appendix Figure A12).

	        Women’s entrepreneurship in rural areas is constrained by limited
ownership of farmland. According to a study of the United Nations Development
Programme (Babović 2007), if rural women buy or inherit land, tradition obliges
them to register the land in the names of their husbands or other male relatives. This
prevents women living in rural areas from starting or joining agricultural coopera-
tives. It may also limit their opportunity to engage in other types of entrepreneurial
activities because of a lack of collateral and an inability to access bank loans.


	           Formal and informal employment


	       According to SILC data, the share of the informal sector in total employ-
ment is large and larger among men than women (35.7 percent vs. 31.3 per-
cent). Because of the better coverage of informal work arrangements, the SILC data
report higher informal employment rates than the LFS data (see the box). Addition-
ally, the rates are higher among women than men (23.5 percent vs. 20.9 percent,
respectively). The informal and formal sectors are quite differentin Serbia. Formal
employment is dominated by industry and services, with a small share of agricul-
ture. Most formal workers are wage-employed and work full time, while part-time
arrangements are negligible. Women show higher shares of wage employment and
work more frequently than men in the public sector (Figure 1.19).

 The definition of informal employment in SILC data
 Informal employment is defined here relative to the definition of informal employment
 in the LFS data (International Labour Organization–type definition). The LFS definition
 covers people employed in unregistered companies, people employed in registered com-
 panies without a formal employment contract and without social and pension insurance,
 and unpaid family workers.
 However, the contract criteria are not available in the SILC. So, the definition used in this
 report is based on the two criteria: does an individual work in an unregistered firm, and
 does the individual or his employer pay social security contributions. Regardless of the
 missing criteria, the estimated informal employment rate (the share of the informally
 employed in total employment) is higher based on the SILC data than in the LFS (see ap-
 pendix 2 for clarification). Therefore, the introduction of this, the third criterion would
 only increase the number of the informally employed.

	       On the other hand, the majority of informal work is performed in agricul-
ture (60.7 percent), with large shares of self-employment and unpaid family members,
a larger number of part-time workers, and employment in unregistered businesses.
	       Part-time work in the informal sector is more frequent among women,
especially in agriculture. In industry and services, the share of part-time workers
and the difference between men and women are smaller (appendix Figure A13).
	       Informal employment is characterized by larger shares of unpaid family
members among women than among men (Figure 1.20). While men most often re-
port their professional status in agriculture as self-employed, women see themselves
more frequently as unpaid family members who provide support, but do not receive
remuneration for their work and are, by definition, informally employed. This also
means they have less access to social security, such as health insurance and pensions.
This inequality may be one of the reasons for the wide gender gap in pension cover-
age among the population over the legal retirement age. In 2011, this gap was 14.0
percentage points; 6.7 percent of men and 20.7 percent of women were not receiving
pension.20

	       The working poor are concentrated in the agricultural sector. The gap
in agricultural employment between the poor and nonpoor is wider among women
(53.2 percentage points) than among men (41.0 percentage points). Another nota-
ble difference between women and men is in the industrial sector, where poor men
are employed more frequently than poor women. The results are similar among the
bottom 40, although the differences in the sectoral shares are smaller (Figure 1.20).

	           The gender wage gap

	      The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development defines the
gender wage gap as the difference between male and female wages expressed as a
percentage of male wages. According to RAD Survey data, gender inequality in earn-
ings widened from 3.7 percent in 2007 to 11.5 percent in 2014 (Figure 1.23).21

     The RAD survey is a monthly survey of business establishments carried out by SORS. The dataset
includes general information on firms such as type of ownership and industry classification. Data are also
available on the number of employees according to skill level and gender, together with (monthly) gross
wages, employer contributions, and income taxes. The survey is designed to cover all establishments, insti-
tutions, and organizations irrespective of occupation, type of ownership, or legal status,including whether
or not they are in the process of liquidation. The survey also covers formal nonagricultural employment.

reported in the LFS to estimate the unadjusted and the adjusted wage gap in Serbia.
They show that the unadjusted gender gap in hourly wages decreased from 6.2 per-
cent in 2008 to 4.0 percent in 2011. The estimated unadjusted gap is low relative to
the 2012 EU28 average (16.4 percent). However, given that employed women have
better labor market characteristics than employed men (for example, the greater
participation of workers with tertiary education), the adjusted pay gap is wider than
the unadjusted pay gap (after we correct for the labor market differences between
men and women) and is estimated at 8.5 percent (Avlijaš et al. 2013).
	       The unadjusted wage gap shows that, on average, employed women re-
ceive 4.5 percent lower wages than employed men. Table 1.24 presents econo-
metric estimates of the unadjusted and the adjusted gender wage gap based on SILC
data. In the model, gender differences in log hourly wages are calculated conditional
on job characteristics (occupation, economic sector, area of residence, region, and
so on) and individual characteristics (age, educational attainment, work experience,
and so on). 22

	       Accounting for experience and educational attainmentraises the gen-
der wage gap. Model S1 includes work experience and education variables. The
coefficients have the expected signs: wages rise with work experience and educa-
tional attainment (appendix Table A14). The coefficient under model S1, woman
is the wage gap adjusted for the differences in work experience and education. As
earlier research shows, differences in education and experience do not fully explain
the wage gap (for example, see Avlijaš et al. 2013). In contrast, because of the better
educational characteristics of employed women (see Figure 1.4), the adjusted wage
gap increases to 10.8 percent.
	

22
   The sample for the analysis includes all wageemployees (excluding the self-employed and unpaid family
members) who do not work in agriculture or the armed forces. The sample does not include non–wage
earners.	
30
	        The wage gap rises if occupational differences are included. In model S2,
differences in occupation are added to the wage equation. Similarly to work experi-
ence and educational attainment, occupational differences cannot explain the wage
gap. The gender pay gap rises to 13.5 percent because women work more frequent-
ly in more well-paying occupations than men (see Figure 1.17, left for details). In
models S3, S4, and S5, we include regional and urban or rural residence effects, job
characteristics (sector, ownership, informality, and contract type), and household
characteristics (size, marital status, and number of children), but these exert no im-
pact on the gap. The final estimate shows that women who, relative to men, have the
same work experience and educational attainment, who are from the same area of
residence and region,who live in household swith the same characteristics, and who
are working in the same occupation and are holding jobs with similar characteristics
are paid 13.8 percent less than men.23
	        The adjusted wage gap varies across the quintiles of the wage distribu-
tion. The gap is narrowest at the bottom and widest at thetop of the distribution,
suggesting a glass ceiling effect (Avlijaš et al. 2013). This confirms the existence of
difficulties facing women in gaining access to more well paid, more senior, and man-
agerial positions.
	        Appendix Table A2.15 shows that, all else being equal, wages are higher in
Belgrade and urban areas generally, in industry relative to services, in formal wage
employment, and among individuals with permanent contracts. They are also al-
most 16 percent higher in the public sector relative to the private sector (appendix
Table A14).
	        We isolate the data by ownership type to estimate the unadjusted and ad-
justed gender wage gap in the public and private sectors. The unadjusted gender
wage gap is almost twice as wide in the private sector (9.9 percent vs. 5.2 percent
in the public sector).24 However, while women in the public sector have much better
labor market characteristics than men in educational attainment, occupation, and
so on, these differences are less pronounced in the private sector. Thus, if we control
for these characteristics, the adjusted wage gapis 12.4 percent in both sectors.25 This
is in line with previous findings showing that, because of the better labor charac-
teristics of women, the gender wage gap in the public sector is not so evident (see
Vladisavljević, Avlijaš, and Vujić 2015). Thus, to enter employment in the public sec-
tor, women, on average, need to have better labor market characteristics than men,
which indicates that they face greater obstacles at the point of entry into the public
sector.
 




23
     Previous research indicates that the adjusted gap would be lower if the one controlled wages for se-
lection effects (Avlijaš et al. 2013). However, this type of analysis is beyond the scope of this report. The
selection effects would be a useful topic for future research.

           Section 2 The institutions and policies regulating
           gender equality

    Main messages

    •	   Existing gender-equalizing legislation and policies are not being fully implemented
         or enforced.
    •	   Adequate resources and better coordination of the national machinery for the pro-
         motion of gender equality need to be ensured.
    •	   According to the Gender Equality Index areas with low achievements and prominent
         gender gaps are related to the quality of work, access to financial resources, and so-
         cial activities (domain of time).
    •	   Financial disincentives for taking up formal part-time work remain, particularly with
         respect to individuals at the bottom of the wage distribution.
    •	   The differences in employment rates among men and women with children are large.
    •	   The use of formal childcare facilities for children up to 3 years of age and for children
         3–6 years of age is far less than the Barcelona targets. Meanwhile, almost the entire
         inactive population not looking for work because of the lack of care options for chil-
         dren or older family members consists of women.
    •	   No estimates exist on the impact of formal and informal care arrangements on wom-
         en’s labor force participation.
    •	   Women are the majority among participants in active labor market programs that
         seek to improve the chances of getting a job such as jobs clubs, efficiency training,
         selection and classification measures, and vocational training. Meanwhile, employers
         rely on job subsidies to employ more men than women, and, similarly, fewer women
         receive self-employment subsidies from the National Employment Service (NES).
    •	   No gender-disaggregated evidence exists on who benefits from active labor market
         policies (ALMPs).
	
	
	          The legal and regulatory framework on gender equality


	       The Serbian Constitution establishes the legal basis for regulations on gender
equality by recognizing gender equality as a fundamental right. The state guarantees
equality between women and men and is responsible for setting policies toensure
equal opportunity.
	       The 2010–15 National Strategy for Improving the Position of Women
and Promoting Gender Equality created a consistent and comprehensive gov-
ernment policy to eliminate discrimination against women. There were several
strategic priorities, including the realization of women’s right to take part in de-
cision-making on an equal footing with men,the eradication of economic inequali-
ties between women and men, the elimination of direct and indirect discrimination
against women, the achievement of gender equality in education and the main-
streaming of gender into education policy, improvement in women’s health and the

32
mainstreaming of gender into health policy, the prevention and elimination of all
forms of violence against women, and the establishment of a comprehensive system
of protection of women victims of violence.
	      To enhance the economic position of women, the strategy emphasized em-
ployment policies that promote the successful reconciliation of work and family life
among women, such as flexible work arrangements (part-time work, work from
home) and greater accessibility to childcare and care facilities for other dependents
(see the box).

 Promoting employment policy that allows reconciliation between work and family life

 •	     According to the 2010–15 National Strategy for Improving the Position of Women
        and Promoting Gender Equality, the goal of reconciling work and family life among
        women was to be achieved by the following:
 •	     Providing day care centers for under-7-year-olds and extended day care for school-

	       The Law on Gender Equality was adopted in 2009. The law addresses gen-
der equality in employment, health care, family relations, education, culture, sports,
political and public life, and judicial protection. It establishes special measures to
eliminate gender-based discrimination and special initiatives and programs for vic-
tims of domestic violence, including the provision of shelters, social, legal, and other
assistance, and compensation for victims. Equal pay for equal work is guaranteed,
and relevant penalties are set out. The adoption of the new gender equality law was
planned for the beginning of 2016, but the law has been withdrawn from the legisla-
tive procedure.
	       New provisions of the Budget System Lawmake gender-responsive bud-
geting mandatory for all local,provincial, and national budgeting authorities
as of 2016. According to these provisions, all program budgets must include gender
goals and gender-sensitive outcome and output indicators to be used as monitor-
ing tools to measure the contribution of programs to gender equality.26 Developing

gender-sensitive budgets makes it possible to see how the budget revenues and ex-
penditures impact the socioeconomic status and opportunities of women and men
as well as the aspects of equality between women and men in the country. As a pub-
lic finance management tool, gender responsive budget analysis allows to determine
how and to what extent the state policy affects diverse groups of men and women
as service consumers, infrastructure users, and taxpayers. Several municipalities
had gone through UN WOMEN and European Progress training for the introduction
of gender responsive budgeting. As a result of this initiative, in this year’s budget
municipality Vlasotince, for instance, will expand health protection programs for
women especially in the area of cancer prevention. Vlasotince is the one of 34 mu-
nicipalities (20% of all local self governments) in Serbia that have signed European
Declaration on gender equality.
	       In 2014, the Coordination Body for Gender Equality was created and as-
signed a central role in managing national-level activities aimed at increasing
gender equality. The implementation of the 2010–15 strategy and the Law on Gen-
der Equality was originally the responsibility of the Directorate forGender Equal-
ity, which had been established in 2007 within the Ministry of Labor, Employment,
Veterans, and Social Policy as the first government administrative mechanismto
promote gender equality. The directorate was responsible for analyzing and recom-
mending measures to advance gender equality, drafting laws and regulations, and
identifying policiesto promote equal opportunity. However, the 2014 Law on Minis-
tries and Government dismantled the directorate, and a unit for gender equality was
created under the development and planning authority of the new Ministry of Labor,
Employment, Veterans, and Social Policy. Shortly thereafter, the government set up
the Coordination Body for Gender Equality, which is chaired by the deputy prime
minister and consists of two ministers and the secretary general of the government.
The entity examines all relevant issues and coordinates the work of the government
administration in gender equality.
	       Recent policy initiatives of the Coordination Body include adoption of
the new National Strategy for Gender Equality for the 2016-2020 period with
the accompanying Action plan. The Coordination Body will be in charge of the
overall monitoring of the implementation of the activities included in the strategy.
The National Action Plan, limited to 3 years from 2016 until 2018, recognises re-
sponsible institutions for each of the activity defined. In 2018 Midterm evaluation is
planned and a development of a new Action plan until 2020.

     Policies and measures of equal opportunities in new National Strategy for
                                 Gender Equality
 According to the 2016–20 National Strategy for Gender Equality, there are three main
 objectives:
 1) to promote culture of gender equality;
 2) to increase equality of women and men by applying policies and measures of equal
 opportunities;
 3) to apply systemic gender mainstreaming in decision making, implementation and
 monitoring of public policies.

 The second objective should be fulfilled by allowing:
 •	 equal participation of women and men in parenthood and care economy;
 •	 equal participation of women and men in making decisions in both public and
    private life;
 •	 increased participation of women in the labor market in order to improve their
    economic position;
 •	 equal participation of women and men in rural areas and equal contribution of
    development and equal access to the development;
 •	 increased position of multiple discriminated groups and vulnerable groups of
    women;
 •	 equal access to health servicesfor men and women.



	       The Gender Equality Council, an advisory body, was established by the
government in 2003. It consists of representatives of relevant ministries, repre-
sentatives of civil society, and gender experts, evaluates gender equality issues and
problems, and makes recommendations to the government.It is directly responsible
to the Coordination Body for Gender Equality.
	       There are numerous other institutional mechanisms for implementing
and monitoring gender equality, including the following:
•	 The Committee on Human and Minority Rights and Gender Equality within the
    National Assembly reviews draft laws and other legislation aimed at improving
    gender equality. It also reviews government policies and the implementation by
    the governmentoflaws in the area of gender equality. Following a series of highly
    publicized cases of violence against women in 2015, a separate committee was
    proposed to focus only on gender equality and to strengthen monitoring, espe-
    cially in the implementation of laws and regulations.
•	 In 2012, the deputy ombudsman for the rights of children, who was appointed in
    2008, established the Council for Gender Equalityto act as an advisory body and
    to tackle domestic violence and other gender-related issues.
•	 The commissioner for the protection of equalitywas appointed as an independent
    official in early 2010. The commissioner promotes and monitors equality policy,
    acts upon complaints of discrimination, and submits an annual report to the Na-
    tional Assembly. The commissioner cooperates with civil society especially by
    advocating for improved access to government data, which is important for or-
    ganizations such as Women’s Network Serbia.

                                                                                    35
    	       The Gender Equality Synergy Group is an informal, independent forum
    for the exchange of information and opinions on gender equality issues. It was
    established in 2006 with the aim of promoting a policy dialogue among donors, oth-
    er stakeholders, and the government to ensure that gender equality is integrated in
    the design and delivery of development programs and projectsand to harmonizethe
    approaches toissues.
    	       Serbia is a signatory of the most important international conventions
    on equal opportunities, including the United Nations Convention on the Elimina-
    tion of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the United Nations Convention
    on the Political Rights of Women, and the Convention Concerning Equal Remunera-
    tion for Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value. In December 2010, Ser-
    bia adopted a National Action Plan to advance the implementation of United Na-
    tions Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace, and security. The plan was
    launched in 2011.
    	       The process of EU accession has had a significant influence on the legis-
    lative framework for gender equality. This has also been the case in other coun-
    tries in the western Balkans that are more advanced in the integration process. Spe-
    har (2012) analyzesthe effectiveness of the EU gender strategy in Croatia and the
    former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia by exploring the benefits and limitations
    of EU policymaking on gender equality in the western Balkans. She concludes that
    the EU accession processes in Croatia and FYR Macedonia have been beneficial for
    the introduction of new gender equality legislation and institutional mechanisms to
    advance gender equality. She identifies three main areas of impact:
    •	 The introduction of new gender legislation
    •	 The introduction of institutional mechanisms to promote gender equality
    •	 The strengthening of the legitimacy and policy influence ofthe women’s movement
    	       In Table 2.1, these conclusions are adapted to the case of Serbia to highlight
    the institutional and legislative framework on gender equality.

	        Numerous research projects designed to shed more light on the position of-
women in society have been supported through EU grants.27 Likewise, through the
Civil Society Facility Program,the EU has supported activist women’s organizations.
	        Despite the robust framework for gender equality in Serbia, existing
legislation and policies have not yet been fully implemented. In the “Serbia
Progress Report,”the European Commission (EC 2014b) emphasizes that, although
entities exist in Serbia that are responsible for implementation and the associated
legislation on antidiscrimination and gender equality, effective implementation re-
mains a major challenge, as follows:
•	 Laws on the dismissal of pregnant women and women on maternity leave, sexu-
     al harassment, and inequality in promotion and pay must be systematically en-
     forced.
•	 Steps to tackle domestic violence and gender inequality in theworkplacehave
     been ineffective.
	        The European Commission finds that the strengthening of administra-
tive capacity is a major challenge. Given the number of institutions monitoring
gender equality issues andinvolved in implementation, the Commission notes that
adequate resources and more effective coordination of the national machinery to
promote gender equality should be ensured. This requires that mechanisms to co-
ordinate the collection and sharing of data among all relevant actors in the system
should be enhanced.
	        The recently published Gender Equality Index benchmarks Serbia with
EU countries and shows that areas with low achievements and prominent gen-
der gaps are related to the quality of work, access to financial resources, and
social activities (domain of time). Compared with the EU member states Serbia’s
overall score of 40.6 points out of 100 puts it at the 22nd position. More precisely,
it is lagging behind the EU average by 12 percentage points. Serbia has lower score
than all other countries in the domain of work. Gender gaps in the dimension of work
are pronounced and they are present in both sub-domains: participation and segre-
gation and quality of work. In the domain of gender equality in access to financial
resources, Serbia legs behind all EU member states except Romania. Regarding time
use, women are disproportionately responsible for care activities and household
work in the household and the family. On gender equality in decision making Serbia
shows better scores due to the quotas in parliaments and a higher share of women
in the Central bank. However further increase of political and economic power of
women is still needed as index values are still far from the target of full equality.

	      Women in the labor market	

	       Gender discrimination in employment is prohibited under the Labor
Law, the Law on Gender Equality, and the Antidiscrimination Law. The Law on
Gender Equality stresses the “right to equal pay for equal work or work of equal
value by the employee” (article 17); in the case of a violation, there is a penalty
clause (article 54). The law also stipulates that private companies with more than
50 employees are obliged to draw up plansto eliminate discrimination in hiring, pro-
motion, and pay. Such companies must pay men and women with similar positions
equally, ensure that women can return to the same job after maternity leave, and ap-
ply gender-sensitive policies. Companies must report on how they are fulfilling their
obligations under the law.
	       Policies that could boost women’s access to economic opportunities
have not been adequately implemented. Though gender-based discrimination is
prohibited by law, the analysis in section 1 indicates thatwomen with the same work
characteristics as men are paid almost 14 percent less. Women also face unequal
access to the labor market. Across EU countries, gender gaps persist in labor mar-
kets, and women are still overrepresented in lower-paying sectors and receive less
than men for equal work. Serbia is therefore not anoutlier. However, while the EU
countries have been working on specific policies to raise women’s participation in
the labor market for decades, Serbia’s experience in the promotion of gender equal-
ity in access to economic opportunity isrelatively limited. Thus, since the 1990s, EU
countries have been promoting part-time employment as a tool for increasing la-
bor market flexibility, creating balance between work and family life, and making it
easier to enter the labor market (Eurofound 2009). In Serbia, this issue has not yet
been adequately addressed.


	      Part-time working arrangements

	       The Labor Law provides for a relaxation of some regulations so as to
open access to temporary and other flexible work arrangements to more wom-
en. For instance, occasional and temporary work arrangements offered by youth
and student associations are no longer restricted by the age limit (up to 30 years of
age), meaning that older individuals are now eligible for these jobs.
	       Work from home is defined in greater detail in the new Labor Law.
Employers are now obliged to provide, install, and maintain any equipment used by
at-home workers. The regulation on work-from-homejobs has been extended with
the provision that wages cannot be calculated in an amount lower than the wages
for similar work performed at employerworksites. Workloads and deadlines cannot
be determined so as to prevent employees from exercising their right to vacation.
The relevant contracts are no longer required to be registered at local government
offices, which reduces the administrative burden on employers.
	       The new Labor Law does not institute any changes that significantly
raise the share of part-time employment in total employment. The analysis in
section 1 shows that, in the formal labor market, the share of part-time workers is
38
low among both women and men (4.8 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively). Prior
to the implementation of the law, it was argued that the procedures for hiring and
firing laid out in the labor code were rigid and that most employers met their needs
in part-time work through short-term contracts, contracts with freelancers, or infor-
mal arrangements. The procedures for firing have been relaxed in the new law. The
notice for dismissal has been reduced from 1–3 months to 8–30 days. If a worker
has been wrongfully dismissed, the compensation has been set at the amount of the
forgone wages, but no longer includes other types of compensation (travel costs,
bonuses, and so on). This means the costs of firing have been lowered for employers.
The duration of temporary work contracts has been extended from 12 to 24 months.
Employers must now ensure the same working conditions for full- and part-time
workers, and they are also obliged to consider worker requests to be transferred
from full- to part-time work and vice versa.
	       Labor taxes may be one reason for thesmall share of part-time employ-
ment in total formal employment. Several studies argue that it is not the Labor
Law, but other regulations that create disincentives for part-time work (Koettl2013;
Ranđjelović and Žarković‐Rakić 2013). The tax wedge in Serbia is average at higher
wage levels, but high at lower wage levels. In most European countries, labor taxes
increase significantly with the increase in wages. In many cases, the increase is by
more than 10 percent as wages rise from 33 to 100 percent of the average wage. In
Serbia, labor taxes increase by only 2.6 percent within the same range of the rise in
wages (Koettl 2013). The relatively high labor tax burden on employees at lower pay
has several causes, but is mainly associated with the way social security contribu-
tions arecalculated.
	       The labor tax reforms after 2001 eliminated fringe benefits. Two of the most
important benefits of this kind were cash allowances in the form of a hot meal al-
lowance (paid monthly) and the regres, an annual leave allowance. Given that fringe
benefits were untaxed and paid in equal lump sum amounts to each worker, the
elimination of these benefits contributed to the regressive character of the labor tax
system in effect until 2006. In 2007, the personal income tax rate was reduced from
14 percent to 12 percent and then, in 2013, to 10 percent, and a zero tax bracket—20
percent of the average net wage—was introduced. However, the burden on labor did
not change considerably given that social security contributions dominate in the tax
wedge (Žarković‐Rakić 2015).
	       Abolishing the mandatory minimum social security contribution could
be beneficial by expanding part-time work. For employers, part-time work is
relatively more expensive than full-time workin terms of the tax wedge. The manda-
tory minimum social security contribution, currently set at 35 percent of the average
wage, is applied regardless of the hours actually worked, meaning that part-time
workers are also responsible to pay it. This may be one of the reasons for the small
share of part-time employment in total formal employment and for the roughly
equal participation of men and women in formal part-time jobs, unlike in most EU
countries. Elimination of the mandatory minimum might create higher demand for
part-time work through lower labor costs. Ranđjelović and Žarković‐Rakić (2013)
show that,on the supply side, this policy reform would reduce average tax rates by
more than it would reduce the marginal rates, implying larger effects on the labor

                                                                                   39
    force participation than on the number of working hours. A decline in both tax rates
    is most pronounced among lower-income groups given that these groups are most
    affected by the mandatory minimum contribution.
    	       There is, however, a possibility that, once contributions become proportion-
    al to wages following the elimination of the minimum social security contribution,
    those individuals working part-time, who are more often women, could then accu-
    mulate lower pensions. While this might be the case, the high share of the wages of
    part-time workers currently accruing to social security, given the minimum contri-
    bution, could be restricting that segment of the labor market in the formal economy.
    This may be encouraging part-time workers—many of whom are women—into in-
    formality, where, of course, there are no pensions at all.
    	       The design of two major social benefits may be providing additional dis-
    incentives in the take-up of part-time jobs. The withdrawal rate from monetary
    social assistance and the child allowance may reduce net worker income and make
    formal part-time work at low wages an unattractive option. Thus, for example, for a
    single-parent family with two children, two child allowances and a social assistance
    benefit represents SRD 21,921. Let’s assume the single parent has a low earnings
    capacity—that is, low educational attainment, coupled with a lack of work experi-
    ence—and can only find a job at the minimum wage.28 If the single parent chooses
    to work part time, the net wage of this individual would be SRD 9,294. The family
    would keep both child allowances, but the amount of social assistance would be con-
    siderably less. According to the current design of the system, the social assistance
    benefit would equal the difference between the amount of the benefit to which the
    family is entitled and the income of the family (the net wage), that is, SRD 5,763 (SRD
    15,057− SRD 9,294). Thus, the total labor and nonlaborincome of this single parent
    after finding a low-paying part-time job would be equal to the income if the single
    parent relied solely on welfare (table 2.2, column 4).

              Net wage+ remaining social assistance benefit amount + child allowance=
                       SRD 9,294+SRD 5,763+SRD 6,864=SRD 21,921 (1)

in which both parents manage to find part-time jobs at the minimum wage.
The calculations in Table 2.2 do not include additional support to benefit recipients
such as utility subsidies, one-off social assistance payments, free meals, scholarships
for students, and social housing—all financed through municipal budgets—that in-
crease nonlabor income and make employment an even less attractive option. If in-
come from informal employment is included in the calculations,the incentive to take
up a part-time job in the formal sector is further diminished.
	      Reducing the withdrawal rate of the social assistance benefit could
boost the incentive for welfare recipients to seek part-time work. Publicly avail-
able statistics on welfare recipients do not include information on the number of
households that receive both the monetary social assistance benefit and the child
allowance. However, research based on administrative data shows that almost all
households with children that receive the monetary social assistance benefit are
also beneficiaries of thechild allowance (UNICEF 2012). Analysis in section 1 shows
that receiving benefits decreases the economic participation of women much more
than the participation of men. Measures to tackle the disincentive effects of welfare
payments are thus needed to expand participation of women in the labor market. A
starting point might be a reduction in the withdrawal rate of the monetary social as-
sistance benefit. This would allow benefit recipients to work and receive part of the
benefit, thereby increasing their incentives to look for formal sector jobs.
	      The Ministry of Labor, Employment, Veterans, and Social Policy has re-
cently proposed several measures to expand labor force participation among
monetary social assistance recipients given that half of them are able-bodied.29
In a majority of cases, however, the measures areidentical to provisions in the Social
Welfare Law. The changes in the law in 2004 and in 2011 required greater labor force
participation among able-bodied benefit recipients mainly through the requirement
to register at the National Employment Service (NES) and join active labor market
programs. In reality, not much has changed in the participation of beneficiaries in
the labor market given that the important feature of benefit design has remained the
same: the withdrawal rate.
	      An in-work benefit scheme would help top up the incomes of people with
low earnings capacity and provide a stimulus for their labor market engagement.
The ministry recently introduced a measure aimed at the greater participation of
welfare recipients in the National Action Employment Plan for 2015. The measure
involves a wage subsidy or in-work benefit available to able-bodied social assistance
benefit recipients who are registered with the NES. The wage subsidy, RSD 10,000,
which is equal to the minimum part-time wage, is assigned for a year, and private
sector employersare obliged to retain the worker-recipients for 12 months after the
subsidy expires.
	      A central motive for the introduction of in-work benefits in the United King-
dom in the form of a working family tax credit was the stubbornly low levels of labor
market participation among single mothers and women with low educational attain-

29
     This is so according to the decree on social inclusion measures for monetary social assistance benefi-
ciaries.

                                                                                                        41
ment at a time when participation of other women was on a rising trend (Blundell
2006). Research on Serbia shows that the introduction of in-work benefits would
reduce economic inactivity by an average of 5 percentage points (Ranđjelović et al.
2013). Because of the large gender gap in economic activity, expanding the scope
of these types of policies from social benefit recipients to the general population
should be considered if the employment effects of this new measure prove positive.


	          Reconciliation of work and family life

	       The document on the 2010–15 European strategy to foster equality between
women and men notes the following:
   	 [The] impact of parenthood on labor market participation is still very different
   for women and men in the EU today because women continue to shoulder a dis-
   proportionate part of the responsibilities involved in running a family. . . . Member
   States which have put reconciliation policies in place are seeing high numbers of
   both women and men in work and relatively sustainable birth rates (EC 2010, 4).
	       The presence of children in the household seems to be a key factor be-
hind the differences in the employment rates of men and women in Serbia.
Data of the 2013 SILC show that the differences in employment rates among men
and women with children are considerable, ranging from 37.0percentage pointsin
the 25–29 age-group to 14.0 percentage points in the 35–39 age-group (Figure
2.3).30 Women with children exhibit a 5 to 10 percentage points lower employment
rates than women without children.31

    Estimates for the 20–24 age-group are not reliable because of the small sample size.	
31
    The sample size in each age-group in Figure 1 is relatively small and therefore does not allow for fur-
ther cross-tabulation to compare the characteristics of labor market participants and nonparticipants within
age-groups. Furthermore, survey questions to explore this issue are limited.For example, the SILC does not
include a question about the reasons for nonparticipation.	
42
	        Labor force participation among women who have children is responsive to
the availability and cost of childcare (Del Boca 2002; Del Boca and Vuri 2007; Haan
and Wrohlich 2009). Public childcare services are provided by local municipalities.
The Preparatory Preschool Program, which has been mandatory since 2007, allows
children in the year prior to enrollment in primary school to acquire knowledge and
skills. Preschool education is not mandatory for children under the age of 5 years
and 6 months. Around 20 percent of parents do not pay for their children’s atten-
dance at preschool institutions; 32 percent of parents pay up to 50 percent of the
fee; 12 percent pay more than 50 percent; and 36 percent pay the full fee (Govern-
ment of Serbia 2011).
	        Several studies have assessed the availability and use of childcare services
based on separate data sources (Baucal and Ranković2010; Sekulić 2012; UNICEF
2012). UNICEF (2012) emphasizes the lack of available data and the inconsistencies
among data and makes several recommendations, as follows:
•	 SORS and the Ministry of Education should harmonize methodologies in data
    collection, processing, and presentation on preschool education. The frequency
    of data collection should be aligned in terms of the school year versus the calen-
    dar year.
•	 Statistics on preschool education should also be aligned with international prac-
    tice, particularly with the EU, to enable comparison across countries.
•	 Instruments for data collection should be revised to include parameters that en-
    able analysis of various preschool programs in terms of the number of children
    attending, gender, and rural or urban residence.
•	 The availability of data on children in vulnerable groups who are in preschool
    should be improved.
	        Most of the issues raised by UNICEF could be solved if SILC data on Serbia
were readily available. Assessments of the availability and use of childcare services
in the EU have been enhanced because of the introduction of EU-SILC data. This da-
taset contains rather detailed information on childcare services. SILC questions and
responses cover the use of formal childcare arrangements, the use of other arrange-
ments, and the number of hours per week programs are run. Formal arrangements
are classified according to type, including preschool or equivalent, compulsory edu-
cation, center-based services outside school hours, and collective crèches or other
daycare centers, including family daycare organized or managed by public or private
structures. Other arrangements include childcare by professionals at the homes of
the children or at the homesof the professionals, care by grandparents, care by oth-
er household members besides parents, other relatives, friends, or neighbors (EC
2009).
	        In 2002, at the Barcelona Summit, the European Commission concluded that
member states should remove disincentives to female labor force participation and,
taking into account the demand for childcare facilities and in line with national pat-
terns of provision, strive to provide childcare by 2010 to (1) at least 90 percent of
children between 3 years of age and the mandatory school age and (2) at least 33
percent of children under 3 years of age (Plantenga and Siegel 2004). Provision is
measured as the children cared for through formal arrangements other than by the
                                                                                   43
  family as a share of all children in the same age-group, that is, children under 3 or be-
  tween 3 and the mandatory school age. A report on the progress toward the Barce-
  lona targets finds that only eight countries have met the targets agreed by EU coun-
  tries on the availability and accessibility of childcare services (RAND Europe 2014).
  The European Commission has therefore emphasized that member states need to
  boost their efforts to improve childcare provision if the EU is to reach the employ-
  ment target of 75 percentby 2020 (EC 2013).
  	       The use of formal facilities for childcare up to school age in Serbia is
  far below Barcelona targets. The use of childcare services for under-3-year-olds
  is 17 percentage points below the Barcelona target (Table 2.4). This is similar to the
  situation in other Eastern European countries such as Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech
  Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia (EC 2014b; RAND Europe 2014).
  The share of children between the age of 3 and the mandatory school age cared for
  through formal arrangements is also quite low: 30 percentage points below the Bar-
  celona target and similar only to the case of Bulgaria, Croatia, and Poland. In all other
  countries of the EU, more than 60 percent of children in this age-group are receiving
  care in the formal system. This may be because obligatory preparatory preschool
  programs start earlier in most EU countries than in Serbia, where they start at age 5
  years and 6 months.

  	       The relatively low utilization of formal childcare services in Serbia is
  explained by the lack of sufficient services and by household decision-making
  processes influenced by restrictive social norms and negative perceptions of
  quality. Ivić, Pešikan, and Jankov (2012) find that, although the number of childcare
  institutions has risen every year in the last 20 years, it is still insufficient to cover all
  children of preschool age. In 2015, the shortage was almost 15,000 preschool places:
  4,000 children who could not be accepted, and 11,000 who had been accepted but
  who represented an excess in capacity (SORS 2015b).
  	       Ivić, Pešikan, and Jankov (2012) also show that the geographical coverage
  of preschool institutions is poor. Thus, these institutions are lacking in underdevel-
  oped, low-income, and rural areas where the need for early childhood development
  and stimulation is greatest. UNICEF (2012) has shown that there are significant re-
  gional differences in enrollment rates in preschool education among children from
  3 years to 5 years and 6 months, that is, up to the age of the obligatory Prepara-
  tory Preschool Program. The municipalities with the highest coverage in preschool

  44
education were located in Belgrade or in Vojvodina, in the north. Two-thirds of the
municipalities with enrollment rates that were well below the national average fell
into the group of devastated municipalities according to the Law on Regional Devel-
opment.32
	       Qualitative surveys reveal that the benefits of formal childcare recognized
by urban and rural residents include socialization among children of a same age-
group; enhanced early childhood social and behavioral education; the development
of a sense of independence, creative skills, and vocabulary; and behavioral and psy-
chological preparation for entry into basic education.33 However, although these
benefits are expressed less frequently in Serbia than in neighboring countries, there
are also concerns about the quality of preschool facilities, particularly because of the
overcrowding in public childcare centers (World Bank 2015b).
	       The availability of childcare services seems to be important to wom-
en’s labor market access in Serbia. The decision of women, especially women
with young children, to rely on formal childcare services often occurs simultane-
ously with the decision to participate in the labor market. Qualitative surveys con-
firm that, among many actually or potentially employed women with no access to
informal care through relatives or friends, the provision of affordable formal care
services is crucial to employment (World Bank 2015b). Particularly in Serbia, survey
responses mentioning formal care utilization for under-2-year-olds were frequent.
One rural resident answered as follows:

     There should be a kindergarten and a nursery for children from their earliest age,
     and they should be open 8 hours a day, so that we can work. Children would spend
     time with each other, and we would be able to earn money.

	       The lack of childcare facilities is perceived to impact the ability of women
to work disproportionately more compared with men, in line with quantitative LFS
data, which show that, among the inactive who are not looking for work because
of the need to care for children or older family members, 96.1 percent are women
(SORS 2015a;World Bank 2014).
	       In countries with low levels of investment in childcare services, the only way
for mothers to enter the labor market is if grandparents look after their children
(Eurofound 2009). In Serbia, almost 50 percent of children 0 to the age of mandatory
schooling are cared for through informal arrangements (see Table 3). However, the
scope of the influence of informal childcare on the labor force participation ofmoth-
ers is not uniform across countries. Thus, Aassve, Arpino, and Goisis (2012) show
that the care provided by grandparents has a significant influence on the decision
ofmothers to enter the labor market in Bulgaria, France, Germany, and Hungary, but

32
     The level of municipal development is measured using a composite indicator based on income and
municipal budgets, the rate of population growth or decline, the unemployment rate, educational attainment
among residents, and the extent of urban municipal areas.	
33
     Even women with access to informal care provided by the children’s grandmothers said they would
opt for formal services because of the benefits for children. In contrast, some men said there were no added
benefits to relying on formal care centers, and, so, they would not waste their money on these centers as
long as informal care was available within the family.	

                                                                                                         45
not in Georgia, the Netherlands, or the Russian Federation. Given that research on
other countries indicates that both formal and informal care arrangements have a
major impact on female labor force participation, estimating the size of the effect in
Serbia is important.

	
	      Recent policy changes in other aspects of reconciliation policy


	      A revision of the Labor Law that was adopted by the National Assembly in
July 2014 added flexibility to the labor market and reduced some worker rights.
Pregnant women are protected from dismissal on the grounds of nonperformance
courtesy of a last-minute amendment.


	      Flexible working hours


	       Flexible working hours are regulated by the 2005 Labor Law, amended in July
2014. However, the law does not explicitly define flexible working hours. Rather, it
covers the redistribution of working time, which mainly involves the regulation of
overtime. Employers may redistribute working hours if specific tasks so require, to
organize work more rationally, or for other reasons, but the total average working
hours of each employee over 6 months, or 10 months if the work is regulated by a
collective agreement, cannot be longer than the full average working hours.


	      Parental, maternity, and paternity leave


	       The current maternity leave regulations are generous. As stipulated by
the Labor Lawand the Law on Financial Support for Families with Children, em-
ployed women have the right to maternity leave for pregnancy, childbirth, and child-
care. Women may begin maternity leave 45 days before the envisaged childbirth at
the earliest, but the leave becomes compulsory 28 days before childbirth. Maternity
leave lasts three months from the day of delivery, after which the woman is entitled
to parental leave for the purpose of childcare for another nine months, for a total
of one year for the first and second children and two years for the third and fourth
children.
	       Fathers take advantage of parental leave in a few cases. During the first
three months after the birth of a child, only mothers can use parental leave. In spe-
cial circumstances such as serious health problems of a mother, abandonment by
the mother of the child, or death of the mother, a father may use parental leave for
the first three months. Thereafter and for up to 12 months, parents can use parental
leave in alternating sequence if this is more convenient. The salary and wage re-
placement rate is a full 100 percent during parental leave, and this benefit is paid by

46
the government. Maternity and parental leave count as pensionable service. Accord-
ing to SORS, 65,554 babies were born in 2013, but only 225 fathers took parental
leave. Of these, 128 were living in Belgrade.
	       The Labor Law was amended in April 2013 to provide greater protec-
tion for pregnant women and women on maternity leave. The amendments in-
stituted three main changes. First, women who return to work before the end of
their maternity leave may take 90-minute breaks or reduce their working hours to
breastfeed their children. The break is included among paid working hours. Sec-
ond, fixed-term contracts are automatically extended to the end of maternity leave
for pregnant women, women on maternity leave, or women who are absent from
work to care for children. Third,the employment of pregnant women, women on
maternity leave, or women who are absent from work to care for children may not
be terminated by employers who have been informed of the situation. Women who
are affected have 30 days from the receipt of the termination notice to inform their
employers and submit proof of their status.


	      Leave to care for elderly dependents

	     There are no specific regulations providing for leave to care for elderly de-
pendents. However, special services are available to help care for older individuals
at home or within eldercare establishments.


	      Active labor market programs


	      Budget expenditures on active labor market programs has declined in
Serbia since 2012. Despite the deterioration in key labor market indicators at the
beginning of 2011 because of the economic crisis and the earlier announcements
by the government that funds for active labor market policies (ALMPs) would be
increased, the relevant budgetary resources were significantly reduced in 2012
and have not been bolstered since. In 2011, the annual expenditures equaled 0.2
percent of gross domestic product (GDP), but dropped to 0.1 percentin 2012 and
were reduced additionally in subsequent years to somewhat less than 0.1 percent.
This conflicts with the 2010–20 National Employment Strategy, which provides that
ALMPfunds were to be raised to 0.4 percent of GDP by 2013 and are to be raised to
0.5 percent of GDP by 2020.
	      Women are the focus of ALMPs mainly in the efforts to raise their em-
ployability and their job skills. Unemployed women who are registered with the
NES vary substantially in their participation across three major categories of active
labor market programs: job-brokering, career guidance and counseling, and wage
subsidies. Data of NES (2013) suggest that women are active in job-brokering pro-
grams. For instance, the participation of women in job clubs reaches almost 70 per-
cent. Among career guidance and counseling programs, women participate most fre-

                                                                                  47
quently, at almost 78 percent, in efficiency training. Women account for 71 percent
of the participants in job selection and classification measures. Employers who rely
on wage subsidies employ more men than women (55 percent and 45 percent, re-
spectively). Similarly, 41 percent of the individuals who receive the self-employment
subsidy are women. Among continuing education and training programs, women
are especially active in vocational training (68 percent of participants) and training
with precertified employers (55 percent); they participate least in public works pro-
grams (38 percent).
	       The fact that women benefit more from ALMPs may reflect the fact that wom-
en have more limited access to contact networks and informal connections in seek-
ing work and therefore must rely more on the relatively less effective formal mecha-
nisms. The 2014 LFS asked respondents about the methods they use most often to
search for jobs (SORS 2015a). It confirms that women use the NES more frequently
than men (82 percentvs. 76 percent), while men rely on friends and relatives more
often (88 percent vs. 83 percent).
	       The 2015 National Action Employment Plan, the main instrument for
ALMP implementation, sets an increase in employment among women as a
priority. It envisages including women in difficult-to-employ groups in ALMP ini-
tiatives, such as lone mothers, unemployed women older than 45, women below
30 years of age who have no work experience, and social assistance beneficiaries.
The plan also promotes entrepreneurship among women by offering government-
financed training and subsidies for self-employment. The plan likewise provides in-
centives for employers to create conditions favorable to flexible work arrangements
for women (work from home, part-time work, and so on). The plan establishes new
active labor market measures for able-bodied recipients of monetary social assis-
tance, which is supplied to individuals registered at the NES in the form of a wage
subsidy (see above). Given the analysis above on the incentive effects of the tax and
benefit system on labor market participation among welfare recipients, these mea-
sures could have positive results in women’s employment.
	       Several ALMP evaluations have been carried out, but without examin-
ing the gender perspective. In a net impact assessment, Bonin and Rinne (2014)
focus on a 2006 pilot public works program in three municipalities. According to
their estimates, the positive impact of the program appears to be more substantial if
judged on the basis of subjective well-being rather than the immediate labor market
outcomes.
	       Arandarenko and Krstić (2008) have conducted a macroeconomic evaluation
of the effectiveness of ALMPs implemented in 2002–07. Thus, they analyze the im-
pact of self-employment promotion measures by comparing program costs and the
number of self-employed revealed in the LFS data. Their impact assessment sug-
gests that career guidance and counseling are by far the most cost-effective pro-
grams in terms of spending per participant and spending per employed individual.
The impact of other programs may have been short-lived and limited to the rela-
tive position of the targeted groups. For instance, continuing education programs
among trainees may have assisted young, well-educated, first-time job-seekers to
enhance their relative position in the market. Self-employment programs and re-
gional wage-subsidy programs for employers did not prevent the extent of formal

48
self-employment and wage employment from slumping. In both cases, other forces
were apparently much stronger than the ALMPs. Assessments of relatively new pub-
lic works programs show that the temporary employment surge provided by public
works does not improve the chances that beneficiaries will subsequently find jobs.
	       Petrović (2010) bases her qualitative evaluation of public works on a small
number of interviews with recipients of monetary social assistance. Although the
positive effects of engagement with work on the subjective well-being of social assis-
tance recipients appear to be substantial, only one among the 20 individuals inter-
viewed managed to find and retain a job after the end of the public works program.
	       Nojković and Vujić (2010) have carried out a net impact assessment of the
Severance to Job Program, which supported redundant workers in privatized state-
owned firms in 2007–09 by enabling them to invest their severance payments into
existing or new companies. The assessment indicates that the effect of project par-
ticipation was significant on employment and employability, but not on self-assessed
well-being and life satisfaction.
	       Andjelkovic and Golicin (2010) present a standard process evaluation of pub-
lic works programs in 2008–09.They assess the design and implementation of pub-
lic works in terms of their influence on vulnerable groups such as Roma, internally
displaced persons, and the long-term unemployed.They show that public works
have been beneficial mostly in less well developed municipalities. Participants in
the programs, after temporary employment that lasts three to six months, were usu-
ally back on the NES registry. Few found stable jobs. The authors stress that private
employers should be encouraged to take part in public works programs, given that
public sector enterprises and nongovernmental organizations are leading employ-
ers, but that, because of austerity measures, public sector firms will not be hiring.
	       Ognjenović (2007) uses the propensity score-matching method to estimate
the average treatment effects of several ALMPs, including computer literacy train-
ing, active job-seeking training, and continuing education among trainee-volunteers.
However, the data in the analysis are representative of only four municipalities. The
author finds that the estimated impacts of active labor market programs on the
probability of employment are positive and statistically significant.
	       An impact evaluation has recently been carried out on active labor market
programs targeting disadvantaged youth that were implemented by the NES un-
der the aegis of the Joint Program on Youth Employment and Migration in2010–12
(FREN and ILO 2014). The key research question was whether participation in the
joint program raised the probability that participants would find and retain gainful
employment. The research found that the effects of participation in the programs
were significant in main labor market outcomes such as probability of employment
and economic inactivity, accompanied by a significantly positive effect on subjective
well-being, that is,the current financial situation of program participants compared
with the situation before the programs and the chance of findingwork. Program-
participation raised the probability of employment by about 7.6 percent relative to
nonparticipation.
	       None of these evaluations included a gender perspective, that is, none of the
authors have estimated separate program impacts on men and women.

                                                                                   49
       Concluding remarks

	       More extensive economic opportunities among women can contribute to
stronger and more equitable growth by raising human capital and labor produc-
tivity and by mobilizing underutilized labor supply. Achieving equality between
men and women in Serbia is still a substantial challenge despite the many initia-
tives to build gender-equalizing institutional infrastructure. In a recent progress
report, the European Commission (EC 2014b) concludes that Serbia’s rich legal and
regulatory framework has not been fully implemented. Numerous institutions and
governmental entities require more resources and better coordination in their ac-
tivities. The Gender Equality Index released at the beginning of 2016 shows that
areas with low achievements and prominent gender gaps are related to the quality
of work, access to financial resources, and social activities (domain of time). Com-
pared with the EU member states Serbia’s overall score of 40.6 points out of 100
puts it at the 22nd position. More precisely, Serbia is lagging behind the EU average
by 12 percentage points.
	       Gender inequalities in education and health have narrowed. This report
shows that women and men in Serbia have equal access to health care. Serbia’s best
performance in the Gender Equality Index is in the domain of health in comparison
to other domains of the Index. Although gaps in health between Serbia and EU are
the smallest, Serbia is positioned among the four countries with the lowest scores.
In education, there are slightly more women with university degrees, but women
also outnumber men among people whose highest level of educational attainment
is primary school. However, comparison with EU member states using the Gender
Equality Index suggests that improvements are needed to increase the share of ter-
tiary education graduates among both women and men, but also to decrease seg-
regation according to fields of education. They are also needed to increase lifelong
learning among both men and women.
	       Significant gaps remain in women’s access to jobs. Compared to EU member
states, Serbia has the lowest score of the Gender Equality Index than any other
country in the domain of work. Gender gaps in this dimension are pronounced and
they are present in both sub-domains: participation and segregation and quality
of work. For women that are active in the labor force, they have an equal chance of
being employed than men with similar characteristics. However, because of much
higher female inactivity rates, fewer women are competing with men in search-
ing for work, which leads to a gender employment gap of 13 percentage points.
Furthermore, women are less frequently employed in full-time equivalent jobs
and work less frequently with flexible working hours. Their working life is 5 years
shorter than men’s. Women constitute majority in job position in the social sector
of the economy: education, health and social protection.
	       Our results indicate that women are more likely than men to be inactive be-
cause of family- and care-related activities. Women in Serbia spend more time in
care activities, and have less time for social activities compared to the females in
the EU, as also suggested by the Gender Equality Index.

50
	       The employment rate is lower among women with children than among
women without children, while the opposite is true among men. Women are more
often involved in childcare duties, especially if care services are lacking. Although
the number of childcare establishments has increased every year in the last 20
years, it is still not sufficient to cover all children of preschool age. Thus, the share
of children below mandatory school age who are attending formal childcare estab-
lishments is quite small. A rise in the number of preschool institutions is needed
to reduce the burden of unpaid work among working mothers. It could also create
jobs in childcare and elderly care and boost female labor force participation. Child-
care services provided by women therefore merit greater attention among policy
makers and should be fostered given their supporting role in the economy.
	       In addition to the bulk of unpaid work in childcare, women represent a ma-
jority among the unpaid family members in agriculture, where most informal work
is performed. This is reflected in the relatively poor standard of living among this
group, with potential for prolonged effects on poverty rates among women later in
life, especially because of the large gender gap in pension coverage and the longer
life expectancy among women. If rural women buy or inherit land, tradition obliges
them to register the land in the names of their husbands or other male relatives.
This and their lack of collateral and inability to access bank loans limit the opportu-
nities of women in rural areas to engage in entrepreneurial activities. It takes time
for social norms to evolve; so, policy makers and nongovernmental actors should
initiate campaigns to raise women’s awareness of their rights regarding inheritance
legislation and the benefits of land title registration.
	       Reforming major benefit programs such as monetary social assistance so
as to link them more closely to labor forceparticipation could increase the incen-
tives for low-paid workers, including women, to join the formal labor market. An
example of a reform of this type is the measure being undertaken through active la-
bor market programs in 2016 to provide able-bodied benefit recipients with wage
subsidies. If coupled with a reduction in the withdrawal rate of monetary social
assistance, this could provide greater incentives for the labor market participation
of welfare recipients with low earnings capacity. If this new active labor market
measure proves to have a positive impact on employment, policy makers could con-
sider extending it through an in-work benefit scheme for the general population.
Abolishing the mandatory minimum social security contribution could likewise in-
crease the number of part-time jobs among workers with low skills.
	       More policy-oriented research is needed to identify which ALMPs are more
beneficial for women’s access to more and better jobs. Then, increase in spending
on programs that show to be effective could be considered.
	       Besides the lack of knowledge about what works best for women in terms
of the active labour market programs, data gaps remain limiting the evidence avail-
able for policy. For instance, more effort should be invested to improve the statistics
on pre-school education. Statistics should be aligned with international practice,
particularly with the EU, to enable comparison across countries. Instruments for
data collection should be revised to include parameters that enable analysis of vari-
ous preschool programs in terms of the number of children attending, gender, and
                                                                                      51
rural or urban residence. The availability of data on children in vulnerable groups
who are in preschool should be improved. Regarding time use, the last survey was
conducted in 2011. It order to be able to monitor trends, it would be important to
conduct a survey on a regular basis. Finally, in order to be able to address the prob-
lem of intersecting inequalities, as envisaged in the National Strategy for Gender
Equality 2016-2020 it would be important to improve the quality of data for groups
of women under risk of multiple discrimination such as: Roma, women older than
60 years, rural women, pregnant and women with dependent children, women vic-
tims of domestic violence, women with disabilities, lone mothers, women from eth-
nic minority groups.
	       Boosting economic growth and job creation is critical, alongside policies to
remove disincentives and barriers to work for women. Once policies to support
working woman have been put in place, the opportunities for part-time work are
made more widely available, and other relevant elements of the regulatory frame-
work areadequately implemented, one should not expect that a large number of
women will immediately enter the labor market. The troubled labor market situ-
ationin Serbia – for both men and women - has been the outcome of the prolonged
transition and privatization that left many people without jobs and of the recent
economic downturns. Austerity measures that are to last until 2018 include cuts in
public sector employment, which may represent a disproportionate blow to women
workers. Nevertheless, even in a context of low labor demand, gender gaps suggest
that leveling the playing field for men and women is necessary.
	       In parallel with policy actions to improve economic growth prospects, ac-
tion should be taken on the discriminatory hiring practices against women. These
practices are a reflection of social norms on childbearing and motherhood and of
perceptions on women’s roles in the family and society. Targeted communication
strategies initiated by government entities and civil society organizations are need-
ed to reduce bias and stereotypes. Promoting leadership on gender issues from the
top in both politics and the economy could encourage others to shift their attitudes
and behavior in support of more gender equality in all spheres of life.

            Appendix 2: Differences among indicators based on
            SILC and LFS data

    	       Because the Serbian SILC data include the complete set of questions for as-
    sessing employment according to the definition of the International Labour Orga-
    nization, the SILC and LFS employment rates should be comparable. However, SILC
    data overestimate employment by approximately 200,000 employed, or 4.7 per-
    centamong men and 6.4 percentamong women. Detailed data of the LFS are not
    available by gender. We therefore present the analysis of the differences between
    SILC and LFS data on the total population.
    	       The data in Table 1 suggest that, although the employment rate is higher by
    5.5 percent according to SILC data than according to LFS data, the shares of perma-
    nent wage employment in the total working-age population in the two datasets are
    approximately equal (29.0 percent in SILC and 28.4 percent in LFS). The overestima-
    tion of employment in the SILC data therefore derives mainly from higher overesti-
    mates of the individuals engaged in more vulnerable types of jobs such as the self-
    employed and unpaid family members. (The two shares in the total population are
    higher in the SILC data than in the LFS by 2.2 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively.)
    Meanwhile, the share of individuals with fixed-term contracts is 1.4 percent higher
    in the SILC data.

    	      The reasons behind these differences are the variations in the methodolo-
    gies used in the SILC and the LFS. The 2013 LFS indicators were calculated as the
    weighted averages of the data collected in April and October 2013, while the SILC

    68
data were collected in May and June 2013, a period when there were more seasonal
workers.
	      Variations in the training of the interviewers may have resulted in two types
of errors in the collection process. First, the LFS interviewers may have been less
sensitive to less permanent types of employment, such as selling goods at markets.
Second, because of the more sensitive dataset, the SILC interviewers underwent
more detailed training and may have been oversensitive to marginal typesof em-
ployment than the LFS interviewers. The SILC interviewers may thus have listed as
employment housework such as cleaning the homes of farm families, which is not in
line with the definition of employment according to the International Labour Orga-
nization.
	      In this report, the differences between the LFS and SILC data are compared
by using a subjective measure of labor market status in 2012. The differences in the
shares of self-assessed employment stood at 6.5 percent that year.
