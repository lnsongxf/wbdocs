I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Malawi perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Malawi
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Malawi
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From April to May 2016, 500 stakeholders of the WBG in Malawi were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President, Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; Project
Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects; consultants/
contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments; bilateral/
multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/
private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 340 stakeholders participated in
the survey (68% response rate).
Some respondents received and returned the questionnaires via post or courier; others completed
the questionnaire with the presence of an independent research consultant. Respondents were
asked about: general issues facing Malawi; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG;
the WBG’s future role in Malawi; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey (COS) must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate is 71%, N=427). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean
ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are
slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY’13 COS report and the non-
weighted data presented in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix E (page 89).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister were
       combined with respondents from the office of a minister; respondents from the financial
       sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector organizations;
       respondents from NGOs/community based organizations, private foundations, faith-based
       groups, youth groups, and trade unions were combined in the “CSO” category. There
       were no respondents from the judiciary branch.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey and the FY’13 Country
        Survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean in
        FY’16 = 6.6; weighted mean in FY’13 = 6.6)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Malawi, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Malawi, and the extent to which the WBG contributes to the country’s
        development results.

IV. General Issues Facing Malawi
Headed in the Right Direction2
          Year comparison: This year’s respondents were significantly less likely to believe that
           Malawi is headed in the right direction compared to respondents in the FY’13 Country
           Survey.
          Stakeholder groups: In this year’s Country Survey, respondents from the Office of the
           President/Prime Minister/Minister were significantly more likely to indicate that Malawi
           is headed in the right direction, while respondents from CSOs were significantly less
           positive about the prospect of Malawi.

Overall Ratings for Indicator Questions by Stakeholder Groups
      Stakeholder groups: Respondents from PMUs/consultants/contractors on WBG-
       supported projects had the highest mean ratings for the aggregated responses to the
       twenty seven COS indicator questions, whereas respondents from the office of a
       parliamentarian had significantly lower mean ratings. Responses for individual indicator
       questions by stakeholder groups can be found in Appendix B (see page 58).
      Collaboration: Respondents who collaborate with the WBG had significantly higher
       mean ratings for the aggregated responses to the twenty seven COS indicator questions
       (mean rating = 6.9) compared to respondents who do not collaborate with the WBG
       (mean rating = 6.3). Responses for individual indicator questions by exposure to the
       WBG can be found in Appendix F (page 94).

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Malawi, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Malawi. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at food security;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at education; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at financial sector development.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Malawi, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The area determined to be key driver from these
       analyses was:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at communicable/non-communicable diseases;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at agricultural development;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at education; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at financial sector development.

following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Malawi? (Choose no more than TWO)

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year19
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2013
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2013 COS report.

FY 2013 Number of comparable respondents = 320  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 395

By weighting, the FY 2013 and FY 2016 samples have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank Group interacts with them
in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past aggregated annual global data. The weighted
stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

 less well-off. When thinking about the idea of “shared prosperity” in your country, which of the
 following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Malawi? (Choose no more than
 TWO)
  1    Consistent economic growth
  2    More reliable social safety net

  6    Better entrepreneurial opportunities (i.e., to start small and medium sized businesses)
  7    A growing middle class
  8    Better governance and public sector management
  9    Better opportunity for the poor who live in rural areas
  10   Better opportunity for the poor who live in urban areas
