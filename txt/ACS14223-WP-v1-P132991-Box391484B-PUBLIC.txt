EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

India’s textiles and apparel value chain is at a critical juncture. It has not reached its potential
and is slipping in competitiveness on several fronts. India largely misses out on the global
industry’s peak demand for (Northern hemisphere) winter garments. Its apparel exporters are
known for their unreliability and long lead times, making global buyers look elsewhere. In recent
surveys of global buyers, India is not even in the top four of potential replacements for sourcing
in China. Its processing industry is facing an environmental regulatory crisis, which, if
unaddressed, would further fragment the domestic textiles and apparel value chain. Across the
value chain, multiple segments are trapped in similar problems, with long lead times and low
capacity utilization constraining investment and jobs. The domestic value chain contains many
pockets of dynamism, with world-class firms, highly skilled workers, and leading-edge
technology; yet it also contains many small firms sheltering behind protective walls and coddled
by protective schemes, a state of affairs that reduces the diffusion of capabilities across the value
chain.
The poor performance of the industry is rooted in the complex interaction of common action
problems and regulatory constraints, reinforced by interrelated outcomes such as fragmentation
and low diffusion. The twin problems of fragmentation and low diffusion restrict the connections
that can form among elements of the supply chain. Customs difficulties restrict the scope of
common action by limiting the operational effectiveness of, for example, common marketing, and
by limiting the diffusion of capabilities by hindering competitive pressures. Difficulties in
sourcing synthetic fabrics and fiber, whether because of low domestic capabilities or customs
difficulties, have constrained India’s ability to respond effectively to the synthetics-heavy global
winter season, keeping capacity utilization low. The result is that, instead of a single national
industry benefiting from and competing with global supply, the value chain is characterized by
isolated pockets, with fewer connections, a smaller scale, and neither the pressure nor the
capability to upgrade and transform.
The industry’s responses are similarly constrained. Lobbying, engagement in dialogue, and even
investment itself are thus often about seeking further protection and subsidies rather than about
working towards productive common action, enhanced value addition, and the promotion of
industrial learning. The most labor-intensive segment—India’s apparel industry—is not reaping
the benefits of the country’s strength in cotton fiber, spinning and weaving. To enhance the
competitiveness of the apparel industry, well-known reforms, such as the hassle-free import of
critical inputs, are needed. Other critical reforms are the introduction of streamlined customs,
rapid resolution of disputes over tariff lines, and more flexible overtime arrangements. The
industry would be better positioned to compete in fashion exports if economy-wide reforms were
introduced to improve the reliability of domestic transport and exports (national GST, customs
risk management systems) and to reduce retention, absenteeism, and labor disputes (by
implementing alternative contract types).
These reforms alone, however, are not enough, as common action and connections will not
automatically follow. For the textiles and apparel value chain to remain intact, the crisis in
processing needs to be overcome by introducing the scale needed (by supporting the aggregation
of smaller units or attracting larger units) to make environmental investments affordable while
ending the informal exceptions to regulation often made for small-scale and informal processors.

                                                 5
Diffusion of capabilities and growth throughout the value chain can be facilitated by reorienting
schemes from subsidizing capital to capabilities, and removing size thresholds. Economy-wide
reforms and interventions to address power shortages, improve contract resolution, and reform
SME support schemes and the environmental framework would further benefit the
competitiveness of the sector.
Many of the needed reforms are well-known among industry leaders and policymakers; however,
these reforms are not without their opponents. There is deep distrust of the industry by those that
would have to participate in reforms, whether customs officers or environmental stakeholders.
Sequencing and credible commitment to policy continuity, embedded in an institutional structure
of effective policy dialogue and bargaining, will be important to avoid strong opposition to
reforms. Building that institutional structure and endowing it with credibility is in that sense
among the most important and most cross-cutting actions necessary.
With millions of jobs at stake, the need for a reform agenda is urgent. The current approach, in
which one subsidy scheme after another is rendered obsolete by a changing global industry, has
proved ineffectual; a concerted effort to implement a new agenda is a pre-requisite for
sustaining inclusive growth into the 2020s.

INTRODUCTION

India is the world’s second-largest producer of textiles and apparel. By some measures, the
textiles and apparel sector is its second-largest employer in the economy, after agriculture. The
industry’s importance in society and in the country’s place in the world stretches back centuries.
In the eighteenth century, India may have accounted for a quarter of the global textile trade, and
prior to the Industrial Revolution, its producers were out-competing Britain.1

But the industry’s performance in the last few decades has been desultory. The Government of
India (GoI) and the Governments of the States are well aware of these challenges. They have
introduced many schemes over the years to try to address them. Several of these have met with
some success. They have commissioned many reports and compiled many policy statements,
with variable records when it comes to implementation. Yet, still, the industry’s competitiveness
is at best holding steady, and by many accounts is slipping.

So a new agenda for change is needed if the industry’s potential is to be realized. Such an agenda
must begin by understanding the changing structure of the global industry; it must seek the root
causes behind the Indian industry’s tendency to lag as a whole, though it has such pockets of
promise; and it must then identify specific remedies for these causes, as well as the
developmental coalitions and sequence of action that can put these into effect.

While the current report does not claim to provide a complete response to these needs, it is hoped
that it might nevertheless represent a first step in that direction. The report prioritizes the
competitiveness of the apparel segment, as this is the most labor-intensive segment of the textiles
and apparel value chain and is critical in allowing India to meet its employment targets. As the
apparel industry is truly global, India’s ability to export garments is taken as a proxy for the
competitiveness of the apparel segment.

This report is structured as follows: Section 1 sets out the context, describing trends in global
markets and in the textiles and apparel supply chain in India; Section 2 analyzes in detail the
choke points that are hindering the growth of the latter; Section 3 sets out a reform agenda to
address them; and Section 4 concludes.

SECTION 1: CONTEXT

A.      A CHANGING GLOBAL INDUSTRY

1.      In the last two decades, the global textiles and apparel industry has been
transformed. Global trade in textiles and apparel not only more than tripled between 1990 and
2012, its structure also altered dramatically. Its geographic center shifted decisively toward
China, whose textile and clothing exports rose from barely US$17 billion in 1990 to US$255
billion in 2012 (Figure 1), representing more than a third of the global export market.2 China’s
share of investment in new machines was even higher, reaching over two-thirds of global
investment,3 as it installed well over a hundred million spindles and more than a million looms
(Table 1; Table 2). Just as the industry’s supply structure was transformed, so was its demand
structure, with the rise of “fast fashion” (e.g., Zara, H&M) on one side and big-box mass retailers
(e.g., Walmart) on the other. Fast fashion retailers in particular have exploded: Inditex (owner of
Zara) now has a market capitalization of €74 billion, having increased five times in the last
decade.4 One of its principal competitors, the Japanese company Fast Retailing (owner of
Uniqlo), is opening one new Uniqlo outlet per week and aims to quintuple its sales over the next
decade.5 Those squeezed between fast fashion and low costs, such as Gap or Sears, have had to
reinvent themselves or have gone under.

2.       This end-retail transformation has changed buying patterns, shifting orders
towards larger quantities for garment commodities and lower lead times for fashion. While
it is difficult to find hard data, industry insiders unanimously report a shift in the distribution of
apparel firms’ orders above 10,000 pieces, with the average order growing in quantity by roughly
a third in the last decade.9 This has been driven by the share of “big box” retailers in the market.
At this low-cost end, Walmart’s enormous scale and its shift toward own-brand sales have driven
scale requirements. Walmart U.S. alone sells more than US$18 billion per year in apparel,
exceeding India’s total exports in clothing.10 At the same time, the business model for fashion
garments was turned upside down by Zara with fast fashion. Between the mid-1990s and mid-
2000s, Inditex increased the number of new products it introduced each year from less than
10,000 to above 20,000, most of these being produced in season in response to customers’
buying patterns.11 Its stores multiplied from four hundred in the mid-1990s to over six thousand

  According to industry sources, fast fashion operates with test orders of 500–2000 pieces, and stock orders ranging
from 50,000–500,000. Traditional fashion players such as GAP order 20,000–200,000 pieces. Mass-market, basic
garment players such as Walmart can order 1,000,000 plus. Author’s communication with David Birnbaum.

   In 2012, apparel sales accounted for seven percent, or US$18 billion, of Walmart U.S.’s total net sales of
US$264.2 billion; in the same year, India’s clothing exports amounted to US$14 billion. US Securities and

today.12 To introduce this number of items profitably, Inditex has relentlessly cut lead times,
introducing items rapidly to capture market share and avoid clearance sales.13 As other retailers
have followed suit, or closed down, the mid-range has migrated to rapid turnaround and larger
orders. Demand in global apparel is increasingly concentrating in flexible, consumer demand-
driven orders for fashion garments at rapid speeds, or enormous orders for basic garment
commodities at very low cost—the former being more attractive in terms of value addition.

3.      This has had a knock-on effect across the textiles value chain. The shift in global
demand towards large basic orders and rapid fashion orders has been enabled by and privileged
garment firms that are capable of delivering quickly and at scale. For garment makers to meet
these requirements, the entire textiles and apparel chain must be capable of meeting them, so the
privileging of speed and scale has cascaded backwards through the supply chain (which is
depicted in Figure 2). This has resulted in sourcing companies and buyers themselves taking
charge of supply, delivering fabric from large and trusted suppliers to garment makers elsewhere,
as in Vietnam and Bangladesh, or ordering only from garment firms with local supply chains
consisting of large, fast, reliable weaving and processing companies. Garment makers unable to
secure supply from imports or capable enough domestic firms will not be competitive for the
fastest growing segment of orders.

4.      China has both enabled and profited from these transformations, through both its
cost profile and its diffusion of capabilities at scale. Chinese garment firms have set the
benchmarks for size and speed. Without such firms, the transformation in demand may not have
been possible. With them, China has at least maintained its market share for several years, even
as wages in its textile sector have risen to around double those in India, especially for skilled
labor (Table 4). In fact, as shown above, China’s exports of textiles and apparel grew by US$100
billion over the period 2006–2011 (Figure 1), despite the global financial crisis and the rapid
escalation of minimum wages.

  5.    Hence, although China is losing its cost edge in some segments (Table 3), this is
  happening more slowly than some expected. In a 2011 survey of chief purchasing officers

(CPOs) of Western apparel companies, more than half expected to decrease the share they
sourced from China in the subsequent five years, and another third expected to “strongly
decrease” that share.17 In fact, China’s market share of EU27 clothing imports has finally started
to fall, from 46 percent in 2010 to 42 percent in 2012, with a drop in the absolute value of
imports from €30.5 billion to €29.4 billion.18 These shifts are generally attributed first of all to
wages finally rising more rapidly than productivity gains as labor shortages develop, so that cost
differentials grow wide enough that scale and speed can no longer compensate for them and, in
some cases, to a shift by Chinese firms toward serving domestic demand. On the other hand, the
pace of change should not be exaggerated: Bangladesh, the fastest growing exporter of garments,
gained 0.3 percent in market share in the US in 2012, putting it on track to overtake China
sometime in the year 2568.19

6.      Bangladesh and Vietnam have emerged as the economies benefiting most from this
transition. In the same 2011 survey of CPOs, when asked to name the most likely sourcing
hotspots in the next five years, CPOs ranked Bangladesh first, followed by Vietnam, Indonesia,
and Cambodia.20 In the case of both Bangladesh and Vietnam, textiles and apparel exports more
than tripled between 2004 and 2012 (from US$6.9 and US$4.9 billion respectively in 2004 to
US$21.6 and US$18.2 billion in 2012); over the same period, India’s exports merely doubled,
from US$14.3 billion to US$29.1 billion.21

7.      However, no economy other than India’s rivals China’s capacity to host the entire
supply chain locally. In theory, India should be as competitive, if not more, than any of these
economies. Income and wage levels are comparable, as are the costs of capital, with both
Bangladesh and Vietnam having benchmark interest rates in the 7–8 percent range and
commercial loans at double digits.22 India’s location should give it an advantage in the EU
market, if not in the US. Power is more expensive in India than in these other economies, once
accounting for pervasive self-generation. However, power accounts for no more than a quarter of
costs in textiles,23 and under one percent in apparel,24 which relies more on manual than on
mechanized inputs. Most of all, though, India has the entire value chain present (as depicted in
Figure 3): it is the world’s second-largest cotton grower, the second-largest spinning industry, it
boasts a large weaving industry, and additionally has a substantial domestic retail market itself.

With the entire supply chain available domestically and competitive cost levels, the Indian
textiles and apparel industry should be ideally placed to out-compete rivals for exactly the large,
fast orders being displaced from China. This is not to say that India can rely solely on domestic
production; especially in the case of fashion garments this will need to be complemented by
critical imports, as will be discussed more in the next section. However, where rivals must rely
on yarn and fabric to be shipped long distances and clear customs at both origin and destination,
and must deal with distant suppliers, Indian garment firms should, in theory, be able to find a
large proportion of supplies locally, ship them overland, and be able to respond faster, with
higher quality, and at scale.

B.      AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE FOR INDIA

8.       As a result, some have forecast a boom for the Indian industry over the next decade.
Some industry forecasts have textiles and apparel export growth at 10 percent compounded
annual growth rate (CAGR) for the next decade.25 The Twelfth Plan is yet more optimistic,
setting a target for annual export growth during the Plan period of 15 percent.26 In such
scenarios, exports grow to exceed US$100 billion by the early 2020s, with investment growing
apace. Yet the wide variation in those forecasts should give reason for pause, as should the
volatility of growth in the last few years. The rolling five-year average growth in exports has
swung from 7 to 11 percent and back again, with single-year averages even turning negative.

9.       Even the current status of investment is uncertain, and in the last decade investment
has lagged badly. Beneath these differing forecasts and volatile growth figures are worrying
signs of slipping competitiveness. In the same CPO survey as quoted above, India was not even
mentioned as a top-four sourcing location of the future.27 In fiscal year 2012–2013, the dollar
value of exports declined by almost 6 percent. In fiscal year 2013–2014 they began to rebound,
growing 19 percent in July 2013 compared to the same month of last year,28 but this was at a
time of sustained currency depreciation, as well as in the aftermath of safety incidents in
Bangladesh that caused sourcing companies to look elsewhere (for a time). The greatest long-
term threat to the industry may be under-investment. Bangladesh tripled the number of spindles
in its spinning industry between 2005 and 2010, whereas India barely increased by a third (Table
1). This, despite the presence in India of domestic producers of spindles, which European
competitors acknowledge as being of high quality. In weaving, China installed almost 300,000
shuttleless looms between 2005 and 2010, while India installed less than 9,000. In short, India is
at risk of missing the opportunity offered by shifting global demand, while not investing

only interrelated, but are two sides of an equilibrium that has deeper causes.

10.     Neither low cost nor a full value chain will be sufficient to meet India’s targets if the
apparel industry is not able to deliver quickly on large, diverse orders. To overcome these
trends and achieve the more optimistic scenarios, the whole value chain in India (as laid out in
Figure 3) must be able to meet the shifting demands of the global industry, which involves speed

and scale. Without these, superficial cost advantages will mean little, since the production cost of
a garment is a small fraction of its sales price, and only one of a range of factors affecting
buyers. Inditex, to take one extreme example, was able to generate much higher returns than its
rivals while sourcing from high-cost Spain because its speed to market meant it sold out of items
rather than having to hold clearance sales.30 As a result, firms and locations that fail to approach
global norms for delivery will simply not be considered by buyers; or firms will not bid on these
orders, to at least preserve customer relationships. Many firms we spoke to said that either “The
buyers just don’t look at us,” or “There are many orders we just don’t bid on.”

11.     The key to achieving speed and volume will be the integration of the domestic value
chain; today it is fragmented, however, and becoming increasingly so. It is difficult to
discern on what basis India’s value chain will compete if not for its integration. Any other
strategy, such as one based on costs, will ultimately be unsustainable and depend on holding
down wages, thereby undercutting the premise of inclusiveness, and being vulnerable in the long
term to the next low-cost production area. In other words, India’s most effective strategy in
vying with Bangladesh or Vietnam for the leading position in this industry will in fact be to
compete with China—that is, with thousands of local garment makers able to deliver on orders
by securing all needed inputs in a timely fashion and at the needed scale from domestic
producers, complemented by reliable imports, where needed. To compete globally in fashion
garments, India would also need to have timely access to special fabrics produced in different
parts of the world. India would be well-equipped to supply to domestic and regional fast fashion
stores, which seem to be growing rapidly.31 Moreover, India could then also explore the
possibilities of developing local fast fashion chains.

12.     The social gains from an industry able to achieve that status would be enormous;
but the regulatory barriers standing in the way are substantial. To analyze these barriers, it
is necessary first to describe in turn each step in the supply chain, as a prelude to identifying the
root causes for underperformance in each of them and across multiple segments.

C.       THE STRUCTURE OF INDIA’S VALUE CHAIN

13.    The textiles and apparel value chain as a whole is one of India’s largest employers.
By some accounts, the entire chain—from weaving to garments—provides direct employment
for about 29 million people.32 Many of these jobs are in relatively low-productivity handlooms
and handicrafts and many serve the domestic market. The sheer size of the textile value chain, if

multiplied by indirect effects, and its bias towards semiskilled labor, with most manufacturers
reporting a mere 4–6 weeks sufficient to train shop-floor workers,33 make its competitiveness a
sine qua non for inclusive growth. For inclusion to endure and have meaning, however, incomes
must rise, which requires rising productivity, and those incomes must be sustainable, which
requires global competitiveness across the value chain. Persistent protection for a large and
uncompetitive industry is eventually liable to cause collapse, as happened to the textiles and
apparel industry in so many countries after the Multi-fibre Arrangement (MFA) expired.34

14.     The apparel industry generates the most jobs, but cannot flourish without easy
access to the rest of the value chain, as well as critical imports. Apparel accounts for roughly
a third of the jobs in the value chain, or around 11 million jobs. While variance in reported
estimates means one must treat this—and other jobs figures—with some circumspection, such a
proportion tallies with the underlying labor characteristics of the segments in the value chain.
The apparel segment is the most labor-intensive. To illustrate, consider the transformation of 30
tons of yarn per day through the production process until it becomes apparel. If modern
equipment is used at full production levels, then the spinning, weaving, and processing stages
will generate some 1,200 jobs; turning the resulting fabric into t-shirts will employ two to five
times as many people, or 2400–6000. For cotton casual pants and men’s woven cotton shirts,
numbers are even higher, as they require more standard minutes for production.35 Apparel is,
however, unlikely to have reached its maximum employment in India, whether: garments firms
are uncompetitive enough that firms abroad can incur higher transport costs to use Indian yarn or
fabric and still outbid them; or that Indian yarn or fabric is of low enough quality that it can only
be used in low-quality, low-cost products; or that lack of easy access to critical imports hinders
the apparel segment in responding effectively to fashion garment demands; or that pervasive
levels of low productivity in traditional weaving keep employment levels elevated. In fact, as
will be described below, all four factors are at work, to varying degrees. One of the most
proximate causes, though, is the weakness in processing.

15.     Processing and finishing together constitute the weak link in the chain, which is only
growing weaker. Processing refers to the treatment and dyeing of woven or knitted fabric to
make it ready to be cut and stitched into a garment. Without a strong processing industry, India’s
apparel industry will reap no benefits from the country’s strength in cotton fiber spinning and
weaving, since the grey fabric will have to be exported, processed and re-imported before
garment makers can use it. However, India’s processing industry is currently gripped by two
crises: one related to environmental regulations, the other concerning capabilities. Both will be

described in more depth below. In brief, widespread evasion of environmental regulations has
led to judicial and now regulatory action enforcing “zero liquid discharge” in several States,
resulting in hundreds of units being closed down.36 At the same time, garment makers complain
that local processing houses are simply unable to deliver large orders in time, are reactive rather
than proactive in marketing and sales, and suffer continual quality issues. Of course, processing
houses dispute this; on the other hand, the fastest growing garment exporter in the last decade is
conspicuous for doing all of its processing in-house.

16.     Weaving and knitting are cost-competitive at full capacity, but are dominated by
small, informal firms. One of the mysteries of India’s performance in woven textiles is that,
according to weaving machinery producers, it is enormously competitive. Using modern looms
operating at full capacity, India’s production cost per square meter is US$0.238-0.246, compared
to US$0.240-0.250 per square meter in China (Table 5). Since grey woven fabric is essentially a
commodity, one would have expected Indian firms to take share from and invest more than
Chinese firms, even with slim cost differentials. The opposite is the case, however, and by a
dramatic margin. China now accounts for more than a third of the global trade in fabric.37 Over
the years 2005–2010, it accounted for almost 90 percent of the worldwide net increase in
shuttleless looms, with its net increase in that period being 16 times India’s total installed stock
of such looms ( Table 2 2). China is particularly dominant in water-jet looms. Weaving with such
machines requires very little labor: some of the largest units in India require a mere 20–30
employees, so inflexible labor laws seem an unlikely candidate for the barrier to investment.38
As will be described below, the likely cause is that the cost comparisons mentioned above have
two critical assumptions: that the machines used electricity from the public grid, and that they
run at full capacity. Why these two assumptions might break down, and the effect on returns and
investments, will be discussed below.

17.     Spinning and the machinery it uses are by some distance the most competitive
segments of the value chain. India is the world’s second-largest exporter of yarn, and has been
maintaining that position since 2010.39 This competitiveness has multiple sources. First, yarn is
cheaper and easier to store than cotton bales, with a much higher ratio of value to volume, so it
gains competitiveness from domestic supply. Second, while most modern weaving machinery in
India is imported from Europe and East Asia, there is substantial domestic production of high-
quality spinning machinery. As the CEO of a major European group put it, “India is

  exceptionally strong in spinning machinery.”40 Spinning in India is also concentrated in three
  very large clusters, which seem to reap substantial Marshallian economies: 40 percent of India’s
  production lies within a 150km radius of Tirupur in Tamil Nadu, with another 23 percent split
  between Punjab and Maharashtra (concentrated in Ludhiana, and the greater Mumbai area).41
  The segment is the most organized in the value chain, with about 60 percent of firms being
  formal, versus almost no formal firms in weaving.42 Its firms are reaching scale, with industry
  sources citing the average size of a new unit at 20,000 spindles, or around 140–150 employees.
  Overall, India retains the world’s second-largest base of installed spinning machinery, with as
  much as a fifth of ring spindles.43

18.     On the other hand, the installed capacity base of the industry is ageing. Industry
sources report that a large number of spindles are older than 20 years, which is supported by the
fact that a fully modern industry would require only 56 percent of currently installed spindles to
produce current levels of output.45 India’s investment is dwarfed by China, with China installing
five times more ring spindles and six times more rotor spindles than India from 2005 to 2010
(Table 1). Moreover, the long-term employment prospects of spinning are not bright, if the
industry is to remain competitive. Capital-labor substitution is pervasive in spinning, and is
likely to occur rapidly as wages rise: industry consultants report that factories that employ 200
workers in India or China are operated with as few as 30 in Turkey. So while this segment
remains relatively strong, threats to its competitiveness are emerging and, although those must be
countered, the industry on its own is unlikely to be a source of inclusive growth.

19.      Low levels of investment mean that the textile machinery industry in India is
dwarfed by that of China. This discussion of spinning machinery naturally leads to machinery
production for the value chain more generally. The growth of a domestic base for machinery
production is a core focus of the textile strategy in the Twelfth Plan, given its importance for the
textile value chain. However, it is also the most skill-intensive, and as such the global industry is
dominated by firms producing in developed markets, particularly Switzerland, Italy, Germany,
Korea, and Japan.46 The only other significant base of production is China, where these firms
have set up production due to the enormous demand for machinery there: in this context, losses
in skills are outweighed by scale economies and the competitive need to be close to the
customer. As a Swiss producer puts it, “firms that have not relocated their production to China
have lost vertically in turnover in the last five years.”47 Cost factors have little influence on such
firms’ location choices, so supply-side measures to attract them are liable to have little impact.
As noted above, moreover, India’s investment in machinery is current only a fraction of that of
China, due to the competitiveness of the firms using the machinery.

20.     If, however, constraints to the textile industry’s competitiveness would be
addressed, unleashing widespread upgrading, then there would be demand for hundreds of
thousands of new machines. For example, were India’s weaving industry to catch up with
merely average levels of its competitors, and even more so if it were to reach China’s current let
alone future level, it could create a revenue opportunity of about US$15–20 billion over the next
decade in auto-looms alone, as 400,000–500,000 units were installed.48 So the key to developing
the textile industry must be first to tackle the underlying constraints to the competitiveness of

weaving and, to the extent they are interrelated, the competitiveness of other parts of the value
chain.

21.     Last, India is self-sufficient in cotton, but synthetic fiber is dominated by a protected
local oligopoly. India is the world’s second-largest producer of cotton. Over the last decade,
cotton production has doubled with the introduction and rapid diffusion of new seed varieties
(Figure 4). Traders report that cotton production in India is among the lowest-cost in the world.49
The industry is diverse, from small-holder farmers to large concerns, and relatively well-
organized, as demonstrated by the speed of diffusion of these varieties. While the Government of
India sets a reserve price for cotton, so does China’s, at levels consistently 5 to 10 percent higher
than India’s.50 In 2012, cotton shortages elsewhere coincided with a substantial crop in India,
resulting in escalating domestic prices as supplies were diverted to exports until the imposition of
an export ban. In most years, however, the domestic yarn industry is fully supplied, alongside
substantial exports. As is usual in a commodity market, spinning firms and intermediaries are
most often “price makers,” at least above the reserve price, except when occasional shortages
cause price spikes. It is difficult to find much difference between the cotton market in China—
the world’s largest producer, which is similarly regulated and where market disruptions often
cause much higher price spikes—and India.

22.     The situation is very different in synthetics, the largest category of manmade fibers
(MMF).52 Production of MMF in China is highly competitive: no less than 150 producers are
active in polyester staple fiber (PSF) only, mostly owned by private interests with the support of
local governments.53 In India, only a few firms (Reliance Industries, Indorama and Grasim
Industries, a company of the Aditya Birla Group) have substantial production. After
consolidation in the 1990s and 2000s, they account for more than 80 percent of the production of
the most popular MMF.54 Although official tariffs on MMF are low, often lower than in China,
high anti-dumping tariffs—above 17 percent, and in absolute terms above US$500 per ton55—
have been imposed against China, Korea, Indonesia, and other major producers. This protected
oligopoly is then able to act as price-maker, and dictate the terms of supply.56 The relative costs
of this are only likely to rise in coming years, as Asia faces a general glut of MMF supply, which
will lower costs outside but not inside India, and it is exacerbated by differential tax treatment, as
MMF is subject to 10 percent excise tax, whereas cotton is not.57 In fiscal year 2011–2012 the
Ministry of Textiles proposed a “fiber neutral” policy that would eliminate this differential, but it
has not been enacted in the face of opposition from cotton growers. It should be noted that in
China, which has long encouraged MMF use, consumption of synthetics is 10 times that in India,
but cotton consumption is almost three times higher as well, and cotton prices are sustainably
higher than those in India. The consequences of this, as well as of other regulatory factors that
similarly damage the competitiveness of synthetic-based products, will be explored in further
detail below.

23.     Finally, the market of raw materials that serve as critical inputs for producing
manmade fibers is characterized by even stronger concentration. Only two large firms in
India produce purified terephthalic acid (PTA), a critical raw material for the manufacture of
polyester fiber, with the largest producer owning 79 percent of the total Indian production

   Other MMF are those made from natural polymers and those made from inorganic materials.

domestic production.

D.       TEXTILES SEEN FROM APPAREL BACKWARDS

24.     These different segments of the value chain often have conflicting interests. For
example, weavers and spinners have lobbied for removing excise taxes and anti-dumping duties
from manmade fibers, both of which cotton growers and MMF producers resist. Apparel makers
seek to have easier imports of processed fabric, but weavers, processors, and integrated mills
disagree. While a domestic textile industry creates a favorable environment for the initial
development of the apparel industry (by avoiding costs related to imports), its further growth is
often hindered by the textile industry’s lobby for import barriers, forcing the apparel industry to
source locally.59 Given the size of the value chain, each segment wields substantial influence,
each commissioning reports to support their respective point of view. This is a potential
explanation for the policy reliance on subsidies and schemes, which are least likely to arouse
opposition from another part of the value chain (other than requests for expansion of the
scheme). While this may not imply an automatic judgment about such schemes, it does mean that
they are unlikely to reshape the business environment. Not all issues are amenable to win-win
solutions, at least in the short term, so eventually the interests of one segment must be taken as a
priority, even when striking compromises. Many of the issues identified above and below are of
this type, so that short-term adjustment costs to other segments should be considered justified if
they improve the competitiveness of a reference segment.

25.    This report will prioritize the competitiveness of the apparel segment above the
others; it is this segment that will make or break inclusive growth. As noted above, the
apparel sector accounts for an overwhelming proportion of the job creation in the textiles and
apparel value chain. If the apparel industry does not succeed, ten million jobs are at stake.60 If it
does, not only will it be able to sustain those jobs, but it may also witness rising wages, as has
happened in the last decade in China. Conversely, if this does not occur—if the apparel industry
wastes away or only survives through formal and informal protection—then it is hard to see how
India will meet the targets in its National Manufacturing Plan.61

26.    As a result, the apparel industry’s prospects will structure the remaining sections.
Section 2 will identify the specific choke points that result in a textile supply chain that is

currently unable to deliver the supply the apparel industry would need to be competitive; Section
3 will consider the potential policy responses to these choke points; and Section 4 will conclude
with some potential pathways to implementing them, and the impact they may generate.


SECTION 2: CAUSES

27.     Low utilization, market fragmentation, and slow diffusion of management
capabilities are the proximate causes of the value chain’s constrained competitiveness. The
value chain from apparel backwards is locked into small market niches, principally cotton-based
commodity fabric and clothing. This implies that firms miss out on the peak sales season in
developed markets, driving down utilization. At the same time, the supply chain is fragmented,
so apparel firms complain they cannot source supplies and weaving and processing firms
complain of stop-start production. Interacting with these two factors are relatively slow rates of
diffusion of management capabilities among firms. While leading firms are able to overcome
most constraints, most other firms learn slowly, if at all.

28.     The root causes of these are regulations that affect domestic and international trade,
shelter firms from competition, and push up realized costs in practice. First, the pockets of
excellence around the country are poorly connected to each other, both in terms of cost and time
—taking as much of each to ship yarn to Tamil Nadu from Gujarat as from Guangdong—and in
terms of knowledge, as market middlemen struggle to establish a foothold. Moreover, in the
center of the value chain, processing faces a crisis of its social “license to operate,” centered on
its environmental record, which will disconnect the industry further if unaddressed. Next to this,
weak monitoring and tying schemes to quantitative thresholds incentivizes firms to stay small,
creating a dual market in which small, informal firms offer lower prices—until closed down.
Alongside low domestic integration is low international integration, in particular for synthetic
fiber and fabric, due to restrictive trade practices and an absence of a concerted drive to attract
high-capability foreign direct investment (FDI). Finally, some of the “usual suspects” in the
business environment, such as land price dynamics and power shortages, push up costs in
realized operations.

29.     The remainder of this section describes each of these constraints in turn. The next section
will then consider the process and policy changes that might be undertaken to begin transforming
this fragmentation into connection—locally, domestically and internationally.

A.     UNDERUTILIZATION: CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES

30.     Low annual capacity utilization and ageing technology is pervasive across the value
chain. Despite improvements as part of the economic reforms in the 1990s, capacity utilization
remains suboptimal across the Indian textiles and apparel value chain. According to official
figures, capacity utilization of the installed spindles and rotors, including small-scale units, is

                                                25
estimated at 80 percent; of installed looms in the organized mills sector at 83 percent, and in the
readymade garments segment at 70 percent.62 However, the methodology for these figures is at
times unclear, and if taken as point estimates at a given period in the year may even be
overstating utilization. Moreover, it is insightful to consider the amount of modern machinery
that would be required to reach today’s production levels in India. If replaced by modern
machinery and assuming an operating utilization of 90 percent, it is estimated that only 56
percent of the current 49.2 million installed spindles are required to achieve current fiber output.
More so, only a fraction—18 percent—of the 2.35 million looms in use would be needed to
produce similar fabric outputs (Table 6). As such, it seems clear that either utilization is much
lower than reported, or productivity and the use of modern technology is low, or— most likely—
a combination of both holds true.

31.     This substantially damages India’s cost competiveness. For an illustrative calculation
of the effect of low utilization, assume that an average newly installed loom is only utilized at
two-thirds’ the level of China, because it is idle for a third of the year or is constantly turning
over small orders (both of which occur for reasons described below). Depreciation and interest
charges per hour will escalate (scenario 1). If the idle period is predictable and continuous, labor
costs might be avoided during the idle hours. However, as most labor in the segment consists of
machine tenders, this will not be the case if the idle hours are interspersed throughout production
(scenario 2). A final reality adjustment to India’s cost competitiveness comes through electricity
charges: the comparisons above (Table 5) assume full grid connectivity. More realistically, with
capacity shortages on average of around 10 percent of demand, escalating to above 30 percent in

32.     A principal cause is that India is missing out on the synthetic export market in
apparel, which cascades through the supply chain. A historical bias towards cotton and
against manmade fibers still affects India’s downstream textiles and apparel industry today.
India’s export composition is skewed towards cotton garments. In fiscal year 2012, apparel
constituted the largest share (40 percent) of India’s textiles and apparel exports; it predominantly
includes cotton garments (68 percent).66 While the production of manmade fibers and yarn and
the exports of manmade fiber fabric and readymade garments are growing rapidly, the full
potential of the synthetic market is not being realized, particularly not in terms of apparel
exports. While the share of cotton fiber in India’s total textile fiber consumption has declined to
66 percent in 2012,67 the worldwide cotton to manmade fiber ratio for the production of apparel
is roughly the opposite. Cotton constituted only 32 percent and synthetic fibers 67 percent out of
total world consumption of major textile fibers in 2013.68 Worldwide, natural fibers are a

declining market, while synthetic fibers are growing and are expected to continue to do so due to
a mix of push (agricultural land scarcity) and pull (price advantages, enhanced properties, and
economies of scale) factors.69 About 40 percent of the total US apparel market, or almost US$30
billion in import value, is for manmade fiber garments. China is responsible for US$13 billion in
US MMF apparel imports, while India only takes a small share of US$0.6 billion.70

33.     This results in a concentration of India’s apparel production for the overseas
spring/summer season. Predominantly exporting spring/summer cotton garments, India is
losing out on the larger autumn/winter season market. This is reflected in significantly lower
export values in the period of August to November, when Indian exports are low, with an
average monthly apparel export value of about US$890 million (compared to the remainder of
the year, when average monthly export value reaches US$1,240 million).71 In contrast, for other
major garments exporters, the most attractive season in terms of global demand is precisely the
garments winter season.72 Apparel imports by the US, the world’s largest importer, are the
highest during the period of June to October for the autumn/winter season (in stores from July till
December) and the peak winter/holiday season (arriving in stores from late October). China’s
garments exports effectively respond to this attractive autumn/winter season and peak winter
holiday demand, but the Indian export market is not taking advantage of this (Figure 5). As a
consequence, while the world’s major apparel exporters respond to two seasons and operate at
peak production for nine months a year, India’s factories only operate 6.5 months a year.73

34.     The missing winter season makes labor mobilization particularly difficult. Operating
only six and a half months per year, the Indian apparel exporters cannot build effective
employer-employee relations. Indian monthly attrition rates are particularly high compared to
other garment exporting countries. Being a seasonal industry, keeping attrition low will always
be challenging. However, in India, garment factories reported 10.4-12.4 percent of monthly
worker attrition.74 With so many people leaving each month, incentives for providing the most
basic job training for basic skill acquisition, which occurs over a three-month period, are limited.

35.    The “cotton trap” is related first of all to the protection and market structure of
synthetic fiber and fabric. In recent years, custom duties on manmade fibers and taxation on
goods made from manmade fibers generally have been reduced, but remain higher compared to
those on cotton and cotton goods.75 For instance, excise duties on the production of manmade

fibers are 12 percent, while natural fibers (cotton, wool, and flax) are exempt.76 Also, manmade
fiber production is protected by a customs duty of 10 percent for most imports,77 but anti-
dumping restrictions increase those duties to the mid-teens for imports from Korea, China, and
other principal producers. Total duty and tax rates for some fabrics add up to about 30 percent.78
Both weavers and garment producers have lobbied for the removal of the excise duty and the
anti-dumping provisions on synthetic fibers, but this has been resisted by cotton farmers and
domestic synthetic producers. In the absence of a sustained process of engaging these
stakeholders to find a positive-sum path to reform, such efforts seem to have largely stalled for
the time being.

36.     Most garments producers identified not tariffs but operational customs difficulties
as their principal constraint in importing high-quality synthetics. The categorization of
different inputs and goods has led to space for interpretation and negotiation, creating risks for
the firms trying to import critical inputs for the production of garments with time-sensitive and
tight production schedules. For example, one firm described how, in importing synthetic fabric,
it might obtain pre-clearance for a shipment listed as a certain weight, but since fabric production
is inherently unpredictable, the actual consignment could contain a few items at a slightly
different weight.80 Rather than accept this as falling within a tolerance band, customs officers
would hold up the consignment on the grounds of applying a different tariff rate, or on suspicion

of tariff violation. In the interim, the firm would be unable to complete production, even if these
fabrics made up only a small share of inputs.

37.      Domestic production of high-quality synthetic fabrics is constrained by market
failures more than by technical factors. As noted above, India is already producing large
amounts of manmade fiber, so the main challenge is moving towards higher-quality synthetic
fabrics that are readily accessible to the garment firms that require them. While foreign sources
and inputs are one means to enable this, the other is domestic production of fabric combining
synthetic and natural fibers. In processing manmade fiber, industry sources report that firms can
largely rely upon similar machinery to that of cotton, albeit with some productivity differences
(water jet looms being considered better suited to MMF) and requiring a one-off investment in
the machinery of approximately 15 percent of the machinery cost. This implies that India’s
ability to enhance its production of manmade fiber is not hindered by substantial technical
barriers. Instead, on the supply side, raw MMF supply is subject to the oligopoly and custom
difficulties described above; equally importantly, and of more general consequence, on the
demand side a crucial market institution is largely absent.

38.     A second cause of low utilization is an absence of formal aggregating agents and
other forms of order distribution and market connection. Indian garment exporters indicated
that domestic supply of manmade fabric lacks the volume, quality, and consistency needed to
meet their demands. While theoretically the capacity to produce substantial supply is there, the
fragmentation of the industry as well as limited coordination between suppliers leave garment
exporters without sufficient guarantees that their fabric orders will meet quality standards and
timelines. One might expect aggregating agents to enter this space, to assist in delivering the
right fabric at the right time. Indeed, in the 1990s, in response to the ever-increasing number of
textiles and apparel-exporting countries in the context of the Multi-fiber Arrangement “a rapid
process of third-party organising and supply sourcing functions spread throughout the
developing world to provide access to established markets.”81 Sourcing agents in importing
countries increasingly worked through sourcing agents in supplier countries or large-scale
manufacturing houses. These latter then sorted orders as they aggregate them, clubbing together
volumes of like products to maximize the scale economies of individual production runs. Such
agents, based in particular in Hong Kong, played and continue to play a vital role in structuring
the value chain in China, aggregating and distributing orders and spreading manufacturing
practices.

39.     However, these sourcing agents have struggled to emerge in India, trapped in a low-
level equilibrium by difficulties in enforcing contracts or disciplining through reputation.
Within some clusters and segments, local agents do exist who play this role, such as “master

weavers” in Tamil Nadu. However, there is little evidence of them working across clusters or
nationally. Global agents, such as Li & Fung, have established a presence in India, but industry
sources report they have not expanded rapidly, especially in terms of domestic aggregation.
While evidence is patchy, it seems likely that this market failure is created by low contract
enforceability. Aggregating agents are only likely to survive if they can enforce quality and
service levels of a large range of suppliers at once, creating the trust and relationship
management that are critical to the sourcing process. Once established, such agents should be
able to use their control of access to markets to generate compliance without recourse to
contracts; however, to become established, they must themselves become trusted by buyers, so
they must be able to enforce agreed service levels. This is difficult without contract enforcement.
Hence garment firms, when asked about such agents, responded that they hesitated to use them,
since “inevitably” the ultimate suppliers would deliver late to the agents, the agents would be
helpless, and the garment firm would have to negotiate directly with the supplier.

40.     So the emergence of such agents is constrained by a low-level equilibrium: without a
broad base of buyers whose access agents control, such agents cannot discipline suppliers in the
absence of contract enforcement; without being able to discipline suppliers, they cannot establish
control over buyer channels. This is only exacerbated by the unpredictability of logistics in India,
a result of state border crossings and road checks, which simply add a factor over which agents
have little control but which erodes their value proposition: timely delivery at consistent quality.
As a last note, the absence of intermediaries is likely to be particularly harmful for the sourcing
of high-end, specialized fabrics, rather than for standardized commodities, since these come with
higher monitoring and enforcement costs, which individual firms will find difficult to absorb in
the absence of economies of scale. Without these agents to bring together a large number of
orders for the same fabric, weavers and processors must start and stop production frequently as
they produce one variety for one firm (even if a large one). Since some textile machinery, in
particular modern looms, takes a long time to change over product type, this substantially
reduces overall operating time.

41.      Low utilization from apparel backwards thus stems from the market structure of
synthetic fiber and fabric and related problems of coordination. While garment exporters are
complaining about the limited local availability of specialized manmade fiber fabrics and import
hassles, the fiber-producing units could say there is no latent demand. With many hurdles in the
imports of MMF products still pending a solution, enhanced competition and availability by
foreign suppliers is unlikely. As a result, textiles firms—especially small-scale weavers—operate
at full capacity only a few times a year; have to stop production much more often than similar-
sized firms elsewhere; are far less competitive on an annual than on an hourly basis; and struggle
to generate predictable and sufficient revenues to pay back quickly, unless with exceptional
management and embedded in well-functioning clusters. This is likely the reason why
mechanized weaving has remained so stubbornly concentrated in only a handful of clusters in
India, despite those clusters being in states with high costs and high land prices. By contrast,

                                                31
textiles “moved West” in China much earlier, abandoning its traditional centers, such as
Shanghai, by the early 1990s as intermediaries facilitated relocation.82 The lack of connective
tissue in India’s textile value chain thus has wider ramifications than simply utilization, and leads
into the more general topic of fragmentation, international and domestic.

B.      TRADE BARRIERS AND FRAGMENTATION

42.     Unpredictability in customs increasingly hinders Indian firms’ integration in global
supply chains. This is being addressed, but implementation is lagging. Garment exporters,
especially those exporting fashion garments, reportedly face constraints exporting their fashion
garments as officers do not acknowledge the value of the product to be exported. Room for
interpretation creates room for negotiation and thus creates delays. Another issue at customs was
that not all ports operate 24/7; a delay in transit to the port could move the arrival time to a
Saturday, resulting at some ports in further delays until the end of the weekend. This issue
recently seems to have been addressed.83 Uncertainty about possible delays combined with tight
delivery deadlines imply that exporters risk not meeting their buyers’ deadlines. With today’s
short lead times, such risks are substantial. Exporters report that, in some cases, they have even
accepted higher transport costs by seeking faster alternatives such as air shipment, particularly
for samples. While it is difficult to quantify the impact of such delays, since it results principally
in firms not being considered for subsequent bids, several firms reported being downgraded
several tiers in the sourcing lists of purchasers after their shipments missed deadlines. Such
effects are liable to leave India continually trapped into exporting basic commodity clothing, and
hence to restrict its growth, even if electricity suddenly became plentiful and labor laws relaxed.

43.     As well as the absence of national intermediaries, long and uncertain delivery times
for domestic shipping fragment the domestic market. One of the main challenges for Indian
garment exporters in meeting large orders is compressing key components of the lead time to
supply those orders quickly.84 The first key constraint in doing so is the fragmentation of the
national market, created by the time and cost to move supplies around India. For example, firms
report that it costs Rs 5 per kg to transport cotton from Gujarat to Tamil Nadu, but only Rs 2 per
kg to send it from Gujarat to China. Domestic regulations mean that domestic freight cannot
travel by sea, so the same ships that take cotton from Gujarat to China cannot also take it to
Tamil Nadu. Road freight is subject to a range of regulatory barriers, in particular check posts at
state borders and permit checks. The result is that firms report it takes the same amount of time

delivery times, and their unpredictability, are treated in depth in a separate report.85

44.      These barriers to domestic connection have a range of effects on market structure,
beyond mere costs. First, they restrict the radius within which an apparel firm can effectively
source, which is bounded by the need to receive material in time to meet their own purchasers’
deadlines. So a needed quality of fabric might be available in theory in India, but not in practice
to the firm that needs it. Second, even when a supplier does exist within the range imposed by
slow and unpredictable domestic logistics, there will be fewer firms competing to supply a given
good, which is liable to increase prices and decrease quality and service levels. Both effects then
have a further, second-order impact, on management capabilities: the first, by lowering the
number and range of suppliers brought into any purchasing firms’ network; the second, by
decreasing competitive pressure in the supply chain.

C.    UNPROCESSED FABRIC

45.     General fragmentation is now being exacerbated by a crisis in processing, which, if
not resolved, may snap the domestic value chain. As mentioned in Section 1, the processing
segment is facing a regulatory crisis. If this is not resolved, the overall textiles and apparel value
chain is likely to disaggregate into two disconnected halves, one producing yarn and, in limited
quantities, unprocessed fabric, both for export; the other using only imported, processed fabric to
make garments. In effect, the textiles and apparel value chain would become analogous to the
electronics industry in India as it stands today, with some segments integrated into global value
chains, but no domestic integration, and hence low barriers for existing activities to simply move
elsewhere.86

46.     The origins of this crisis in processing are a cycle of increasing regulation,
increasing violation, and decreasing trust. Textile processing generates substantial byproducts,
principally liquid effluents from the dyeing process. These effluents have historically been one of
the largest sources of water pollution, especially when discharged with minimal or no treatment.
As a result, environmental regulations—in India as elsewhere—have required increasing levels
of effluent treatment from processing plants. However, making such regulations effective
requires close monitoring and testing of the effluent discharge. Enforcement was widely
circumvented by firms, leading to rapidly increasing river pollution and a judicial response,
starting with the Madras High Court in January 2011, to mandate “zero liquid discharge”
(ZLD).87 This is widely in advance of the global industry, with large players such as Inditex,

H&M, and Gap committing to sourcing only ZLD products by 2020,88 providing Indian firms’
competitors almost a decade longer to find solutions.

47.     Since 2011, hundreds of plants have closed, and a series of policy responses have
followed, with a durable solution still being sought. Following the 2011 ruling, a wave of
closures began with over 400 plants in the Tirupur cluster in Tamil Nadu (one of the largest in
the country). Since then, a series of policy responses has included an allocation of Rs 200 crore
in the Union Budget of 2010 for common ZLD facilities in Tirupur; further State-level
allocations for common facilities; and the revision of a Common Effluent Treatment Plant
(CETP) scheme by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), with a subsidy of a
maximum of Rs 20 crore, or 50 percent of the cost, for such common facilities.89 As these
policies indicate, the problem is one of scale: ZLD facilities are highly capital-intensive, creating
large economies of scale.

48.      Those policy responses have run aground on the difficulties of gaining sufficient
scale, and particularly of collaboration among units. Officials in the states, as well as industry
consultants and firms, reported that operational issues had blunted the effectiveness of the
common facilities erected so far.90 Effluent treatment is a complex process, and a common
facility requires that all firms using it do minimal internal processing, so that inputs are of a
homogenous quality. When many firms are using the same facility, there is a temptation for each
firm to skip the initial, internal processing, since the costs of maintaining the facility are widely
shared and cheating is hard to detect. This is a classic free-rider problem, one difficult to solve
without strong bonds of trust among members or innovative means of collective monitoring and
discipline. The smaller the median firm (excluding those that are vertically integrated), the more
will have to be included to gain sufficient scale for a common facility, and the more difficult the
problem of collaboration.

49.     Most of India’s processing industry is either vertically integrated or tiny, and
investment in it is lagging. Processing fabric is more capital-intensive than in the apparel
industry; however, historical legacies (e.g., small-scale sector reservations) have left this
segment with a small-scale business model, while the current environment does not invite new
investment to modernize dyeing and processing activities. In numbers, a survey by the Textiles
Committee in 2005 revealed at least 2,500 processing plants in India, with less than 500 having a
turnover above Rs 5 crore. Industry sources estimate that as few as 25 of those are operating with
the latest technology machines. By contrast, in China, in 2006 almost 2,500 processing houses
had a turnover of above Y 5 million, roughly equivalent to Rs 5 crore at today’s exchange rates

(with statistics not available on units under that turnover).91 A recent, detailed project report for
a common facility estimated that ZLD requires investment of at least Rs 100 crore to become
economical.92 To illustrate what this implies for necessary collaboration, if the average firm
using the common facility has a revenue of Rs 2.5 crore and a margin of 5 percent, some 160
firms would have to forego all of their profits to pay back the plant in five years, or half of their
profit to do so in 10 years. For an average plant size of Rs 7.5 crore, the number required drops
to around 50. In starkest contrast, one of India’s largest fully integrated textile companies, with
annual revenue of US$2 billion, has implemented ZLD with barely a dent to its
competitiveness.93

50.      The small size is encouraged by strong incentives for processing firms to “stay
under the radar,” avoiding monitoring and availing SME schemes and exemptions. For
most processing firms, not only does being small provide benefits in terms of access to
government schemes, it also makes them harder to keep a close watch on than large units. As a
result, they are effectively left without oversight in terms of environmental regulations, and can
price their services far more competitively than larger, formal units.94 As one firm put it, “the
minute you succeed, you become swarmed with inspectors, so better to have a number of
scattered, small units so you can operate in peace.” Another firm added that “if you don’t, the
other small guys will undercut your prices and you’ll soon go under.” Unsurprisingly, the
processing industry has remained dominated by small units and compliance with environmental
regulations is particularly low.95 With limited effective oversight and an active judiciary, the
thousands of processing SMEs generating a large proportion of India’s total industrial pollution
load have few other incentives than to lie low—until they are shut down by court order.

51.     The result has been stagnating investment, and, most worrying, the decay of current
or potential integrated clusters. Given the substantial policy risk around environmental issues,
together with uncertainty about the apparel sector to absorb larger volumes, few textiles and
apparel players have been willing to take the risk to expand into processing. Moreover,
increasing nervousness by the Government over these environmental issues seems to be
excluding processing from some important schemes. This is apparent, for example, in the
Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP): it has been successful in attracting spinning and
weaving firms, but reluctance to accept processing units in the parks means that apparel firms

have generally avoided them.96 As the representative of one apparel firm said in an interview, “if
you tell the Government you want to build an industrial park, they welcome you with open
arms—if you tell them you want a processing plant in the park, they push you away just as fast.”
In general, any cluster is unlikely to integrate across the value chain without a proximate
processing unit, e.g., such that a single area might specialize in a particular type of men’s shirts,
with weavers, processors, and garment makers all developing high proficiency in their
production. These types of integrated clusters are often cited by the sector as a core strength of
China’s industry. Given the domestic fragmentation described above, this would threaten to
deepen the issues of under-utilization by breaking up or preventing even local coordination. As
such, restoring trust between processing units, regulators, and civil society, as well as finding
effective models to aggregate small units to achieve economies of scale and monitoring, must be
considered urgent tasks for the industry.

52.      Finally, even after a solution to the treatment problem is found, management
capabilities in processing will need to be upgraded. The costs of effluent treatment can often
be mitigated by simple management steps, such as tightening controls of leaks and other simple
cost-saving techniques. Recent initiatives have shown these can save 20 percent of water and 30
percent of fuel use per ton treated.97 For small units, the resulting savings are unlikely to be
worth management time, and do not solve the central problem of attaining ZLD, but for large
units the savings could be substantial. It is unclear how many large firms may implement such
facilities, but most of the garment firms interviewed testified to widespread issues—as they
perceived it—with the management capabilities of some of the larger, stand-alone mills. Many
large garment firms described the frustration of dealing with these larger mills, from having to
call back dozens of times to determine the status of an order to chasing instead of being chased
by marketing and sales teams. Indeed, the slow diffusion of capabilities in textiles in India, in
contrast to the same industry in China and some other industries in India (notably auto
components), is, however, an issue that extends beyond the processing segment.

D.      MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES

53.     Management capabilities, especially those to manage deliveries and expand on time,
seem to be diffusing slowly. Inability to deliver and expand on time is not only a function of the
absence of effective third-party sourcing agents, trade barriers, or processing difficulties.
Weaknesses in supply chain management capabilities at the firm level play a substantial role,
exacerbating those constraints, even when indirectly exacerbated by them. The larger garments
firms in India are mostly managed by technical staff; smaller firms are more often family-run

businesses.98 Strong management capabilities are often lacking, or diverted towards managing
more urgent problems, such as dealing with power, customs or man-power challenges. Sourcing
strategies involve choice among various supply markets and the choice among various supply
channels. This requires substantial management capabilities to effectively assess hidden costs of
different sourcing options, as well as identify optimal sourcing channels. For instance, double
sourcing, i.e. the “use of one close, quick and expensive supplier and of one distant, slow and
inexpensive supplier for the very same garment,” is a strategy that has effectively been used to
minimize costs and keep flexibility at the same time.99 Such a strategy might be applicable to the
Indian domestic context where lead times of domestic suppliers can be unpredictable. However,
our interviews found little evidence of the use of such strategies, and other empirical work has
documented process gaps in such tasks as inventory control, even in clusters considered
relatively advanced, such as Pune.100

54.     The fragmentation described above clearly plays a part in this slow diffusion,
compared to, for example, the auto-components industry. As noted above, the absence of
third-party agents removes a crucial market intermediary that could otherwise play a crucial role
in diffusing capabilities. The same weaknesses in contract enforcement that hobble the
emergence of such agents may also play a role in restricting the use of middle-managers in firms,
although the existence of large, technical firms, and the general experience of the auto-
components industry, caution against placing too much weight on this explanation. Indeed,
building on a comparison to the latter industry, it is the lack of intermediaries that would seem
more binding, since in autos the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) could play the role of
connector. Case studies from the outset of the auto boom, almost a decade ago, point to exactly
this source of the rapid diffusion of world-class capabilities in that industry.101 Another
difference has been the more national and integrated character of auto-components, driven in part
by the larger, natural scale of components firms, and in part by their historically easier ability to
integrate across states.102

55.     This is particularly the case for protection from domestic and international
competition, in processing and in general. If a small group of domestic firms operates behind
high trade barriers (whether de facto or de jure), then they can exist in a low-capability
equilibrium, since buyers will lack the ability to force change by switching suppliers (as all offer
equally low levels of service). If this, in turn, results in the purchasers being uncompetitive, and
hence providing low levels of demand, the suppliers may be both protected and have poor

    However, as shown by Jordan and Kamphuis, “Freight and Logistics in India” this is under threat, given the
continued delays in integrating the national market and OEMs’ ever-greater shifts to lean production are starting to
fragment even auto-components.

financial results. From our interviews, this appears to be the case for fabric supply, as apparel
firms cannot obtain high-quality fabric, but integrated mills resist dismantling barriers to trade,
citing their precarious financial position. The key to breaking such an equilibrium would be the
gradual introduction of competition, through opening windows for trade liberalization, greater
national integration, and the introduction of FDI, combined with forms of support for operational
consultants to improve basic management practices.103 Such support policies would, however,
have to be substantially different from those of the past, many of which seem to have worked
against, rather than in favor of, the diffusion of capabilities.

56.     The general tenor of support policies protect small firms and subsidize capital,
rather than protecting capable firms and subsidizing capabilities. This is not to say that such
management capabilities do not exist. They clearly do, particularly among the stronger firms,
whether the large integrated ones, or in high-performing clusters, such as Surat in Gujarat. In a
well-functioning market, resources would be reallocated to the more capable firms, or clusters
thereof. Less capable firms would be forced to invest in their own capabilities, or would go out
of business, clearing the way for the stronger firms’ expansion. However, less capable firms
benefit from both formal and informal protection: formal, in the shape of subsidies, formal
exemptions, and barriers to exit; and informally, through “flying under the radar.”. Many firms
reported that the smallest units are able to violate costly regulations, undercutting the prices that
larger units must charge, and thereby gaining an advantage that subsides their lower capabilities.
Of course, some of the smaller firms are highly capable, but they also report staying small—and
avoiding orders—for fear of attracting increased inspections and demands for informal
payments. So large, capable firms face unfair competition from small, lightly regulated firms,
and small, capable firms do not grow. The justification for the support to less capable firms may
be to enable technology acquisition and upgrading, but this requires that such firms be
disciplined to undertake the needed effort to upgrade, and, as described above, there is little
evidence that this is occurring.104 Instead, many schemes simply provide a direct subsidy to
capital, or indefinite protection and support, with little means for discipline. As long as
domestically the “carrots” (support from the Ministry of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises
(MoMSME) and Ministry of Textiles (MoT) schemes and trade protection) so greatly outweigh
the “sticks” (poor regulatory oversight), low-capability firms will be able to undercut higher-
capability ones and subvert aggregation mechanisms or common action.

57.     It is also not clear to what extent national associations have taken up the task of
diffusing capabilities effectively. Experience elsewhere, especially in Italy, demonstrates that
large firm sizes are not necessary for the spread of capabilities in textiles and apparel. There,
industry associations played a crucial role both in spreading capabilities directly and in
intermediating with government and with labor unions to strike common bargains in favor of

such upgrading.105 In doing so, however, they relied on exceptionally high levels of pre-existing
social capital, and on government willingness to withdraw support if the overall industry did not
fulfill its side of the deal.106 In general, the ability of associations—local or national—to
credibly commit their members to discipline is seen as crucial to public schemes to promote
investment in intangibles, whether worker skills or firm R&D. Where these links are missing,
even small, homogenous and developed countries such as Denmark and Finland struggle to
achieve success in such schemes.107 In India, some of the textiles associations have shown a
strong ability to connect firms, though principally in areas of existing capabilities (above all in
the south, through the South Indian Mills Association). However, many firms and government
officials reported a perception that a substantial portion of the associations are primarily focused
on lobbying for incentives and subsidies. How to build up associations’ own capabilities on
difficult soil is an important question, but also points deeper, towards the problems of common
action.

E.      COMMON THREADS

58.     Across the value chain, multiple segments are trapped in similar problems, with
long lead times and low capacity utilization constraining investment and jobs. As follows
from the discussion above, the different segments in the textiles and apparel value chain are
awaiting stronger demand downstream, while upstream players have worries about ensuring
supplies. There is little foundation for joint action with mutual benefit, indeed often the opposite
is the case, with each segment lobbying against the others, privately or publicly. The
fragmentation of the critical middle of the value chain, with small informal processing units
between larger weaving units and garment exporters, further complicates such coordination
throughout the value chain. Lobbying, engagement in dialogue, and even investment itself is thus
often about seeking rents (duties, market structure, etc.) rather than enhanced value addition and
the promotion of industrial learning.

59.     A complex set of inter-connected causes create these equilibriums. Figure 6 attempts
to trace, in summary form, the interaction of regulatory constraints, common action problems,
and interrelated outcomes that are at work. At its heart sit the twin problems of fragmentation
and low diffusion, traceable to barriers to trade and contract enforcement difficulties, restricting
the connections that can form among the elements of the supply chain. Customs difficulties
likewise restrict the scope of common action by limiting the operational effectiveness of, for
example, common marketing, and restricting the diffusion of capabilities by capping competitive

with global supply, the value chain is characterized by isolated pockets, with fewer connections,
smaller scale, little pressure to upgrade and transform, and a consequent proclivity to chase
further protection and subsidies rather than productive common action.

60.     On the other hand, this bleak picture is neither universal nor pre-determined: such
equilibriums can and have been broken in some parts of the industry in India. One story
that gives rise to optimism is provided by fittings: the small items such as lace and specialty
buttons that make up a small portion of material but without which many garment orders cannot
be completed. In May 2006, a scheme was introduced that allowed apparel firms to import such
trimmings worth up to 3 percent of their export revenues, duty free but—just as importantly—
hassle free. Apparel firms reported that this led to a surge in their use of such fittings, as they
could compete for orders that previously had gone unfulfilled. However, when such demand was
demonstrated, other firms became interested in the segment, and soon lace production began to
expand rapidly in India itself.108 When undertaken by high-capability firms, this turned out to be
competitive with imports, and a similar dynamic repeated itself in other fittings segments, such
as specialty buttons. The result was that, in time, the same garment firms reported using a
declining share of their quotas for fittings, as they were able to source locally (one firm reported
that over the last two years it has only used 70-75 percent of its quota). So the gradual

108
   This was also enabled by the development of lace machinery in China, such that capital costs for lace production
dropped to one-fifth that of European technology (however, this was available to Chinese lace producers as well).

                                                            40
introduction of competition allowed the demonstration of demand, which subsequently led to
local investment to meet this demand. If this experiment were repeated, for example, in high-
quality synthetic fabric, it could play a substantial role in shifting the value chain towards higher-
capability and more competitive supplies. On the other hand, this would increase competition for
domestic production upstream in the value chain, which—these firms having been protected for
so long—is likely to be fiercely resisted, even if over three to five years it is likely to result in a
larger market and more productive and competitive producers.

61.     Moreover, “shock therapy” would likely be counterproductive, removing incipient
capabilities and firms that could grow to compete. In fact, it is unlikely that the instant, full
opening of all segments to competition would be a route to long-term growth. This was
attempted, for example, in electronics in the mid-1990s, and resulted in the decimation of local
capabilities, from which the industry has still not recovered.109 The existing value chain
represents a base of capabilities and learning that is a substantial asset, even if it is not as
globally competitive as it needs to be. This is not an excuse to continue protections
indefinitely—in which case the asset would gradually lose all its value, just the same as if
exposed suddenly to full competition—but it is a motivation to proceed gradually, reducing
protection step by step. Naturally, though, this argument does not hold for domestic barriers to
movement, and the integration of the national market in full and as quickly as possible remains
an urgent need.

62.      So the route out is to follow a phased approach of providing support for capabilities,
rather than capital, while gradually dismantling barriers to movement and competition. In
all, the choke points described above point to a clear agenda: capital or export subsidies and
other common instruments are unlikely to be effective. What is needed is to remove the barriers
to the integration of the domestic value chain, and its ability to source and compete globally,
while supporting the diffusion of capabilities to manage environmental challenges and deliver on
time and at scale, so that apparel exporters can break out of the trap of single-season,
commoditized production. If that happens, then the cost structure and scale advantages of India
may be unleashed; if not, then a fragmented industry will continue to be consigned to niches,
with stagnant incomes for firms and workers, and its sustainability under threat. We now turn to
the specific components of an agenda that might lead to the former.

SECTION 3: RESPONSES

A.     PHASE IN MORE COMPETITION, WITH INITIAL SUPPORT

63.     Key segments of the value chain face implicit protection through trade barriers. As
described above, the apparel industry is unlikely to register strong growth unless the de facto
protections for fabric, especially synthetic fabric, are gradually dismantled. Without this, India’s
entire value chain will lose out on the garments winter season, the most attractive season in terms
of global demand. Enabling rapid access to large quantities of high-quality synthetic fabric must
therefore be among the highest priority reforms for the sector. The same holds for MMF, where
the current anti-dumping duties should be removed, if necessary with a phase-out window.

64.      These changes could be phased in to convince stakeholders of their benefits. It is
likely that cotton growers would object to the cheaper availability of MMF, even if in the long-
run the case of China indicates that such availability would also raise demand for cotton. A
second-best solution could be to provide a guarantee that the reserve price of cotton would be
maintained (or even increased to that set in China). The current oligopoly would be likely to
resist such a reform, requiring political will to be exerted in the interests of the tens of millions
employed in the rest of the value chain.

65.     Another means to open the market could be to allow a specified percentage of their
needs to be imported by firms without duty or inspection, subject to extremely stiff
penalties for abuse (such as having every shipment of any size inspected, plus substantial fines).
Drawing on the example of fittings imports given above, garment or weaving firms could be
given certificates worth a tenth of their exports; such certificates could be used for free imports
of yarn or fabric. Over time this proportion could be raised, with the domestic industry expected
to adjust to the competition. This would be particularly valuable for apparel and garment firms
(which have suggested such a mechanism), as they could manage their use of such certificates to
top up inventories and secure emergency, high-quality fabric for particularly important orders.
Special attention should be given to new entrants or rapidly growing firms to prevent that such
policies protect existing players against new entrants. More ambitiously, all inputs imported for
the purpose of garment exports could be allowed to enter the country hassle free. Once again, the
domestic processing houses and integrated mills would be likely to resist such a policy, although
such resistance might be softened by temporary support schemes.

66.     High-capability foreign investment should also be attracted to demonstrate the
effect of the ability to respond to orders quickly. A long-standing justification for foreign
direct investment is its role in demonstrating and diffusing new management capabilities. East
Asian integrated mills and processing houses have a demonstrated ability precisely to deliver




                                                  42
with speed and scale, a capability so far absent in the industry in India.110 As such, another
priority would be to facilitate the entry of foreign investors in integrated mills close to centers of
apparel production. However, such investors are unlikely to commit until demand is proven,
which is unlikely to occur until garment makers can sustainably bid for larger orders and winter
collections, which in turn would require at least partial import liberalization. Since opening a
protected sector to both foreign trade and investment at once would incur high political costs,
trade liberalization might need to precede investment attraction. However, if the foreign
investors facilitated also possess strong capacities for managing environmental costs, such
facilitation would be an important subsequent step.111 Korea, with its long history of textile
production, its remaining base of high-tech firms, and its own advanced environmental
regulations, could be a promising source of such investment. A concrete next step could entail
in-depth interviews with successful, vertically integrated players in India and elsewhere (the later
as potential FDI) to better understand why there are not more of them.112

67.     Small, informal processing units need help to aggregate sustainably, but with the
discipline of competition, through dismantling their formal and informal protection. As
described above, the processing industry’s proliferation of small-scale firms is one of the largest
threats to the competitiveness of the entire value chain. These firms need to be subjected to a
stronger inspections regime, not only to create a level playing field between them and larger
units, but simply to preserve the social license to operate of the processing industry as a whole.
The schemes that provide them exemptions and subsidies based on their small size likewise
should be gradually phased out. However, these firms provide a base of capabilities about how to
run processing houses. Those capabilities are an asset that would be inefficient to discard.

68.     As such, the subsidies that currently keep the firms small should be replaced with
schemes that encourage them to consolidate and regularize. This might take a form similar to
the SITP, in which a number of smaller processing firms were required to merge into a single
special purpose vehicle (SPV), which would then be eligible for funding to build ZLD facilities,
with funding large enough to make a difference (and not requiring approvals at multiple tiers).
These larger units would then be more easily and strictly monitored, but also eligible for support
to build capabilities (e.g., some subsidies for technical and process consulting to cut down on

    Another area that seems to be in need of foreign entry is trimmings, as identified by Birnbaum, “Benchmark
Study India,” p. 17. In today’s fashion garments industry, buyers generally designate suppliers of trim items. As a
consequence, “the major designated global trim suppliers have all set up branch factories in virtually every major
garment-exporting country, with the notable exception of India.”
111
    Foreign investment might also be attracted in synthetic fibers, to increase competition and reduce the current
oligopoly, but given forecasts of a huge oversupply in Asia within the next two to three years this is likely to be
difficult. Moreover, the issues in that segment could be addressed equally well by domestic or foreign investment.
112
    Interviews with transnational garment factories as part of an apparel export benchmark study suggest that India’s
relative low number of transnational garment factories is related to its (perceived and real) unreliable regulatory
environment. Birnbaum, “Benchmark Study India,” p. 89.

waste). After some cut-off date, firms not having crossed a scale threshold, on their own or via
some equivalent scheme, would be subject to the full force of regulation requiring shut-down.

69.     Given the fragile state of these segments, and the need to retain a domestic value
chain as a core competitive advantage, competition should be phased in. A common thread
above is that the immediate introduction of competition is likely to be both infeasible as well as
damaging to the value chain’s long-term prospects. On the other hand, growth will not be
sustainable under the status quo. As such, two processes need to be undertaken together:
gradually exposing the synthetic fiber and processing industries to competition, while providing
support for the latter, in particular to gain the capabilities needed to survive. Unless this is done,
the development of a full value chain capable of delivering large orders quickly and in all
seasons is unlikely, and hence, so is the ability of the apparel industry to generate the growth and
jobs needed to meet India’s targets for the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, if done
effectively, this can result in a virtuous cycle of new demand being created, new investment
coming to supplement it, and a general increase in wages and jobs.

B.     REMOVE THE BARRIERS TO MOVEMENT

70.     A high priority must be to ease the barriers to movement of goods within India, so
firms can obtain needed inputs swiftly. As noted repeatedly, in terms of the cost and time to
move goods, Tamil Nadu is as integrated with Guangdong as it is with Gujarat. The value chain
will not be able to combine localized scale, diversity of supply, and rapid response times if this
remains the case. Achieving easier movement of goods internally requires investments and
reforms of much wider scope than the textiles and apparel industry, in particular for
implementation of the long-delayed national Goods and Services Tax (GST), the dismantling of
check-posts, and continued infrastructure investment. While the MoT and textile industry’s role
here would be limited, at the least it should add its voice to the pressure for the implementation
of such reforms. Moreover, the very large number of jobs at stake in textiles and apparel should
be made part of the motivation for those reforms.

71.     Customs risk management systems (RMS) should be implemented more vigorously,
as should announced policies on “no halting” of textiles and apparel shipments. As well as
easing domestic movement, exports must be made dramatically simpler. There have been policy
movements in this regard, such as the announcement in 2012 of a “no stopping” policy, whereby
customs officers would not be allowed to stop shipments in case of disputes, but rather could
make note of and subsequently follow up on the case. However, apparel firms report varying
implementation of this policy by port. Tutticorin in Tamil Nadu, for example, is said to now
clear exports in a matter of hours (but only receives a few calls from shipping lines); at Mumbai,
a few shipments were stopped in violation of the order, but the officers concerned were later
reprimanded and, by some reports, removed; in Delhi, however, firms report the order is hardly
heeded.


                                                 44
72.     More generally, India has begun to implement a risk management system for
customs, which is designed to ease exports and imports. Such systems have been increasingly
common reforms around the world in the last two decades. Under these systems, firms with clean
records of obeying customs regulations use a “green channel” that allows their shipments to be
cleared without inspection, as long as paperwork (electronically filed) is in order. Inspection is
thus shifted to a graduated “trust but verify” system, such that more honest firms are allowed
more trust and less verification, enabling much smoother trade. An RMS for imports was
formally notified in 2005 in India, and notice was given for its expansion to cover exports in
June 2013.113 However, firms report that implementation at many entry points is in theory more
than fact, with only the largest firms able to secure “green channel” treatment. Many are subject
to intense scrutiny, with customs officers questioning the item value of pairs of socks being
shipped to major US chains, or holding up large imports of fabric because one item differed in its
technical specifications from the manifest. Universal implementation of RMS must be a priority,
one much more important for export performance than further export subsidies or subvention
schemes. Doing so will require stronger voice and accountability mechanisms vis-à-vis customs
officers, balanced with much more severe penalties for violations.

73.      More rapid dispute resolution processes need to be put in place for clarifying
inevitable tariff line disputes. A third priority for customs reform is to streamline processes to
clarify disputes on tariff lines. These arise when notifications exempt or lower tariffs on certain
specific imports, or differentiate between products at a granular level (e.g., on the basis of the
quality level of the fabric). Since production processes can be variable, and international
standards evolve, these notifications can quickly become a barrier rather than a help, as
shipments that differ slightly from the specifications are held up and disputes ensure over which
policy is relevant. Such disputes are natural and inevitable; the issue is the length of time needed
to resolve them, with firms reporting months to clarify regulations as files are passed between
departments. As above, care must be taken to avoid dispute, and all firms interviewed agreed that
penalties for violations should rise, but the relevant departments should consider putting in place
a fast-track process to clear these disputes and allow production to proceed.114

C.      SCHEMES NEED TO CHANGE

74.     Most current and prior schemes are subsidizing capital, rather than addressing the
real constraints to the industry. The most substantial scheme for the textile industry at present
is the Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (TUFS). Begun in 1999 for an initial period of five
years, and repeatedly extended and modified thereafter, it provides a subsidy of some 15 to 25
percent of the cost of a textile machine that is less than 10 years old.115 As noted above, self-

114
    An identical issue is faced by the electronics industry.
115
    The scheme has a budget of Rs 11,900 crore (~US$2 billion) for the 12 th Plan period, and contains a number of
variations, e.g., the subsidy can also be taken as a 5 percent interest rate subvention, has varying eligibility

                                                        45
generation of electricity and low capacity utilization may double the effective cost per square
meter of weaving in India, making it more expensive than for any comparator, and almost as
expensive as in the US.116 A subsidy to the cost of capital will not make much headway in this
case. For any capital subsidy scheme to overcome the costs of low utilization and unreliable
electricity it would have to subsidize almost 75 percent of the capital costs. Since this does not
seem plausible, additional schemes of this sort or increased funding for them would seem to have
little point. Since electricity availability is a larger issue, well beyond the textiles industry, any
reform efforts should focus first on addressing the constraints to utilization.

75.     A proliferation of schemes from different Ministries in itself furthers fragmentation,
particularly when tied to size thresholds. Much of the remaining policy support for the
industry derives from schemes tied to SME size categories. There are a multitude of such
schemes: whether related to SMEs in general and under the purview of the Ministry of MSME;
or run by the Ministry of Textiles at the Centre or in the States and defining eligibility through
the MoMSME’s criteria. Such schemes provide funding for everything from consultancy in lean
operations to common facilities, and, most importantly, provide exemptions ranging from excise
taxes to electricity duties. If there existed strong, well-functioning market intermediaries which
could aggregate the capacity of many small units, these schemes could have substantial and
beneficial impact. As it is, with the lack of scale to deliver large orders quickly being the root
cause of the value chain’s low performance, and few integrated programs to develop connective
tissue among small firms, subsidizing a lack of scale is counter-productive at best. Reasonable
size units in every segment substantially exceed the current thresholds even for “medium
enterprises” in the manufacturing sector, namely Rs 5-10 crore in terms of investment in plant
and machinery,117 by up to a factor of ten. A spinning, processing, or weaving unit employing
200 to 300 people—“medium” by almost any standard—requires investment of Rs 120 to 200
crore, a garment firm employing around 1,000 people requires Rs 40 crore. In particular, a
moderate-sized new processing plant (with advanced equipment) will cost Rs 150 crore. In other
words, the new units required to meet the environmental challenge are explicitly excluded from a
vast range of schemes, which their old, informal, and often unmonitored competitors can avail.118

76.     The Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks has facilitated some forms of common
action, but could do more to support capabilities and integration, especially for processing.
SITP has had an unusual ability to bring otherwise scattered firms together to get things done and
to form clusters.119 However, albeit less prone to failure than most, it remains an industrial park

program, with all the limitations thereof, and is unlikely to address the root cause issues affecting
the industry. Moreover, it has been most successful in areas with pre-existing industry and high
social capital, so that one entrepreneur could mobilize a group to pursue collective action; and in
textiles and spinning, whose lower labor demands make them more amenable to locating further
from cities, where land prices allow expansion.120 Where it has taken root, its success will only
be meaningful if the forms of common action it induces are used for “softer” activities than
construction, namely common marketing and common purchasing. Finally, as described in the
section on processing above, the scheme needs to effectively integrate processing, or the
“integration” in its title will be elusive.

77.     There are some schemes that support some root causes, though their designs need to
be tweaked if they are to be more effective. As noted above, the Ministry of MSME and other
agencies have tried to fashion schemes to address more root-cause issues, such as the diffusion of
management capabilities and the difficulties in financing and operating effluent treatment.
However, even the State agencies most successful at promoting such schemes (e.g., those in
Tamil Nadu), have reported lackluster demand. This is most often because the schemes are
cumbersome and detached from the real prices of goods and services: the lean management
scheme, for example, provides a subsidy of Rs 2 lakhs per firm, hardly enough for a few days of
a high-quality consultant; and the CETP scheme provides a mere Rs 20 crore for a CETP facility,
whereas zero-liquid discharge can require capital costs of Rs 100 core plus. Moreover, the CETP
scheme requires concomitant approval of State and Center, which is notoriously difficult to
obtain. As a result, the schemes have gone largely unused.121

78.     The need of the hour is then a substantial shift in the policy agenda, towards
tackling the root causes of the textiles and apparel industry’s faltering growth. Traditional
policy responses are therefore unlikely to unlock the industry’s growth. Measures such as freight
subsidies or other sops to MSMEs (as currently defined) are particularly liable to be ineffective,
if not directly harmful.

79.     On the other hand, the positive story is that the industry has not gone into
remission, and retains an exceptionally strong base from which to build. Many firms, when
interviewed, stated that in fact the quality of management had gone up in the industry, as weaker
firms had been eliminated in the downturn. So if the root causes of low growth are tackled, the
industry could be in a position for a sustained upswing, as the only viable alternative to China.
Seizing that potential, however, will require a different agenda to subsidies and schemes and a

121
   Similarly, two World Bank projects in this sphere over the last two decades, which were similarly designed, were
closed with the outcome of both projects rated moderately unsatisfactory, according to Independent Evaluation
Group (IEG), “Project Performance Assessment Report: India: Industrial Pollution Control Project (Loan 3334-IN
and Credit 2252-IN) and Industrial Pollution Prevention Project (Loan 3779 & 3780-IN and Credit 2645-IN),”

concerted effort to create consensus on some difficult reforms and opening of the market, if with
some temporary supports to ease the transition and make the agenda possible.

80.     Among schemes themselves, the most important general shift is to prioritize
capabilities over capital. There has been strong recent evidence that management capabilities
among firms in India could derive substantial gains from subsidized provision of world-class
technical assistance. Current provisions for capital subsidies might be profitably redirected
towards such underwriting of the acquisition of such capabilities. However, this would need to
be done with care, with frequent revision of the design details, and, above all without limitations
to ‘SMEs’ as currently defined (i.e., either without size restrictions, or with much larger
definitions of “small” and “medium”). A World Bank review of such technical assistance
schemes has emphasized that they must be decentralized, and customized to individual firms’
needs; and that interventions need to be substantial, as a few days’ training usually has little
impact, versus several weeks of support.122 A putative scheme might, for example, draw on an
empanelled list of supply chain and delivery planning consultants, with flexibility left to firms
drawing on such support to define the terms of engagement, but grants released in tranches that
are conditional on performance (for example, meeting productivity targets).123

81.      Any such scheme though would not have durable impact unless paired with
measures to increase the rigor of competition, domestically and internationally. This would
provide needed discipline, such that firms that failed to exert sufficient effort to upgrade their
quality or productivity would fall by the wayside. Without such discipline, any support is liable
to fail.

D.       LINKS TO BROADER REFORMS

82.      The ongoing debates about power sector reform will clearly have a substantial
impact on the value chain, particularly weaving. As noted above, with access to uninterrupted
grid power, weaving in India is competitive; without it, even high-capacity utilization does not
suffice. Schemes to subsidize diesel generation are unlikely to make more than a small impact,
and the issue is as much avoiding interruption as the price of self-generating, since a high-end
weaving machine is costly to restart if stopped unexpectedly.124 This issue is acute, though less
so, for spinning (which has a higher process tolerance for stoppage), even less so for processing
and least of all for apparel, which is low in its power intensity. So the longer term prospects of
weaving in India, with the several lakhs of new machines that ride on it, and the similar number

    The tranched disbursal procedures of the SITP and of many R&D grants provide fertile grounds for learning.
124
    The power consumption profile of such machinery, with its pronounced peak at different times of the day as
production runs begin, makes difficult the use of, for example, distributed solar or other forms of renewable energy,
and leads to firms’ heavy reliance on diesel generators.

                                                         48
of higher income jobs that come with supervising those machines, will ultimately remain hostage
to solving the power shortage issue in India’s states.

83.     Finding new ways to strengthen the environmental compliance framework will be
necessary to salvage processing and could be a model for other sectors. The potential support
scheme described above for small-scale processors might provide a bridge mechanism for the
upgrading of the processing industry. If this can be done effectively, the policy innovation might
provide a model for other sectors that face the same problem of a large number of small polluters
that need to be aggregated. The clearest example is leather processing, where leather plants are
also now being told to implement ZLD, an even steeper requirement than for textiles.125 Unless
the framework for environmental regulation, monitoring and enforcement is substantially
reformed, to make it more credible, more predictable, and less a source of antagonism between
all stakeholders, the processing industry—and others like it—is likely to lurch from one crisis to
another until it disappears.

84.     The labor environment is cited as a constraint, in particular by apparel firms. There
are a number of contrary indications about the importance of labor regulations in constraining
different parts of the value chain. As noted in the World Development Report (2013), in India the
key labor constraint is the Industrial Dispute Act (1947), which involves the State in any
decisions to fire employees when firm size exceeds 100 employees. Any mid-sized firm will
cross this threshold, but the volatility of the industry will place a premium on the flexibility that
these regulations restrict. The response has been the widespread use of contract labor and other
means to avoid permanent employment, with many apparel firms having a de facto size of many
times the Act’s limit. However, the use of such tactics has in turn been linked to rapid turnover,
with most shop-floor employees lasting less than a year, given low incentives to remain in one
firm (and many firms’ own desire to keep attrition high to prevent disputes). Basic skills can be
imparted in a month or two, but more advanced supervisory skills are reported to require several
years of shop-floor experience.126 Unless these issues are addressed, for example through new
forms of labor contracts, the supervisory and mid-level skills shortage is likely to continue.127
Other problematic regulations cited by the apparel industry include constraints on overtime (and
female adolescents’ working hours) imposed by the Factories Act (1948). Coordination issues
are also at work here on a deep level: without institutional forms of industry-labor cooperation,
whether through unions or high-quality labor brokers, active labor market interventions to

127
    This is also unlikely to be solved by the various “Skills Missions,” whose focus on achieving “big headline
numbers” has skewed them away from such mid-level skills towards large-volume, entry-level placements.

                                                        49
support skills are unlikely to have much benefit.128 However, these issues are being tackled in
other, more dedicated studies, and so will not be pursued further here.

85.     Cutting across all the segments is the importance of fixing contract dispute
resolution, which prevents scale and collective action. The problems in contract dispute
resolution are a regulatory constraint barely mentioned, because even more than labor
regulations, firms “have learned to live with it” (and no firm interviewed took credibly the idea
of suing for breach of contract to remedy a supply problem). Yet addressing it could lead to some
of the largest long-term gains, because the means of living with it are precisely those that work
against the scaling up of the rest of the industry.

86.      The first such means is for individual firms to bypass sourcing or aggregation
agents, who cannot enforce the contracts they write with suppliers, to deal with supplier
firms directly. As described above, this fragments supply and demand, generating a low-
utilization equilibrium in which end-user firms cannot find material if their usual suppliers do not
produce it, and supplier firms complain of low utilization. Mid-tier agents cannot substitute the
effects of reputation in a repeat game, because lack of performance is so universal that threats to
drop firms are unlikely to be credible. As Hirschmann described it, exit is an ineffective
customer response if the quality problems affect all the alternates.129 Note that this marks a stark
contrast to, for example, the auto industry, where the OEMs were in precisely the position to
intermediate and both promote capability diffusion and discipline those who lagged behind. The
textiles and apparel industry contains few to no such players.130 For them to do so, they must
receive the legal and other support needed to enforce quality, or the equilibrium will persist.

87.     The second coping mechanism is vertical integration. This is a natural response to the
high transaction costs and proliferation of hold-up problems caused by weak contract
enforcement.131 It is noticeable, for example, that one of the most successful new garment
exporters of the last decade, Alok Industries, is completely integrated vertically, with its own
spinning, weaving and (zero liquid discharge) processing mills. Founded in the late 1980s, it now
employs about 30,000 people. However, it is unique for another reason: the professionalism of
its management, which reportedly contains few to no family members.

88.    These coping mechanisms reinforce fragmentation, and work against scale. They
are unlikely to be fixed until contract enforcement is. Alok and other large firms seem

    In China, anecdotal reports suggest the first agents were from Hong Kong and Taiwan and were able to secure
local authority’s intervention on their behalf by holding out the promise of access to foreign know -how, but
intermediated through people culturally similar (and often with access to local social capital). In this way the agents
were able to become established without a general ‘rule of law.’

exceptionally able to manage such problems, but the industry’s broader growth cannot take place
solely on exceptions. For the industry to grow at scale, management capabilities must diffuse
among the broad swath of merely above-average firms. Those firms must then sell to and
purchase from intermediaries that can make markets across the value chain. Feasible contract
enforcement will not be sufficient for those outcomes, but it is necessary. Other means of
supporting the growth of such agents will run high risks of simply creating distortions, as have
well-intentioned attempts to promote “market makers” in other markets, from agricultural
produce to financial markets. These agents are natural to the industry, if they have the tools to
serve their function. Without swifter and better contract enforcement for buyers, the value chain
is likely to remain not only small—which may not be a problem if it is connected—but it will
remain small and fragmented, and hence fundamentally uncompetitive.

E.     THE FORM AND FUNCTION OF POLICY DIALOGUE

89.      Overall, multiple agendas can be crafted from the reforms above. One, the
narrower, focuses on the reforms that just seek to boost apparel. The processing and
weaving segments are left to themselves. Reforms are focused on the health of the apparel sector
alone, given its disproportionate job creation. Customs processes are overhauled (e.g. hassle-free
import of fabrics); protection on fabric is gradually but inexorably removed; and new contract
types are introduced to ameliorate labor issues. The environmental issues caused by processing
fester, leading to the long decline of the segment, are not addressed and weaving does not
overcome its power and capacity utilization difficulties. India makes some inroads into non-
cotton markets, and captures some new niches, so that it pulls even with Bangladesh and
Vietnam in apparel, and maintains its second place in the global yarn market.

90.     A more ambitious agenda would seek to rejuvenate the entire value chain, setting
the stage to become the next market leader. In addition to the customs reforms and the
dismantling of protection, this would require the type of sophisticated support measures for
capability diffusion, processing aggregation and foreign investment, and the removal of anti-
dumping duties on manmade fibers described above. It would require the broader reforms to be
pursued as well: without power reforms, weaving will not be competitive; without contract
enforcement, the whole value chain will remain fragmented; without the reform of MSME
schemes more broadly, it will remain subscale. Most of all, a comprehensive effort would be
undertaken to reform the processing segment, without seeking to protect it again from global
challenges or to overly subsidize the costs it must bear for environmental sustainability. This
would be complemented by a process to generate acceptance and understanding of the inevitable
environmental risks (a process only feasible if the processing industry itself becomes a trusted
partner in dialogue). If this can be done, though, in this scenario the whole value chain might
begin to capitalize on its inherent strengths, which are unmatchable by other competitors of the
future.



                                                51
91.     The resulting agendas, which overlap, can then be organized as in Table 8. This
presents and orders the reforms and support measures discussed above. It divides them into those
that are specific to the different segments of the textiles and apparel value chain, and economy-
wide reforms that cut across it. It likewise divides them by whether they are part of the “narrow
apparel” or the “ambitious textiles and apparel value chain” agendas.

92.      Implementing even the narrower agenda will require a different kind of policy
dialogue; the ambitious agenda will run extreme risks without such a change. The more
general change needed is one of the basic mindsets behind schemes and interactions among the
stakeholders in the value chain. Implementing such an agenda however is unlikely under the
current forms and function of policy dialogue among the different segments of the value chain,
different stakeholders, and the government. That dialogue is characterized by firms and
policymakers alike as having an emphasis on schemes rather than reforms and a desire to protect
all participants at once, rather than broker compromises and make difficult decisions. The result
is that all parties put forward maximal demands: fabric producers claim lower protection will
bankrupt them; fiber producers maintain anti-dumping tariffs are the only bulwark for domestic
production; small producers clamor for capital subsidies as they attempt to survive fluctuating
power; and so forth. More broadly still, there is deep distrust of the industry by those that would
have to participate in reforms, whether customs officers or environmental stakeholders. Unless
this is addressed, inevitably there will be a hue and cry regarding each aspect of reforms, and few
will get done, except for schemes and subsidies as in the past.

                  Remove anti-dumping duties on PSF

93.      One way to do so may be to introduce greater elements of time, adjustment, and
trade-offs into policy formulation and enactment. To date, many policies in the sector, at the
Central or State level, have tended to be in the form of final outcomes and absolute decisions on
principle, versus more time-bound, incremental changes. The contention over a possible National
Fibre Policy in 2011–2012 was perhaps an example, ending in gridlock over an optimal excise
price on fibers; the time-bound window for fittings would be an example of a more productive
process. Moreover, implementation needs stronger monitoring, involving Government, the
private sector, and civil society representatives in regular (as opposed to ad-hoc) forums. These
should also ensure the continuous improvement of the schemes themselves; at present, if a
scheme is overly complicated, or overly generous, or for other reasons not achieving its desired
result, the revision process is lengthy and difficult. Overall, the policy process needs to be more
about the timing and phasing of change, give-and-take between competing interests, and ongoing
refinement, than a matter of one-off decisions.132 To this end, the Government needs to play a
more proactive role in facilitating compromises among competing interests, rather than assume
the position of sitting in final judgment between them. Without such a process, the textiles and
apparel value chain is likely to continue to miss its potential for growth.

94.    A pre-condition for doing so, however, will be ensuring the underlying stability of
the principles behind the policies, and of bargains made in policy formulation. It may go
without saying, but if policy bargains cannot be respected in the course of implementation, then
building the capacity to make such bargains is liable to be fruitless. As has been noted of
bureaucracy and policy dialogue in the United States that if those unhappy with a deal can
simply appeal it elsewhere, no participant will have a strong incentive to engage in difficult




132
   The India Backbone Implementation Network (IbIn), a recently launched initiative of the Planning Commission
of India and the private sector, is an attempt to spread the capabilities to undertake just such processes.

                                                      53
discussions.133 The result is that stakeholders will organize, as now, principally around obtaining
subsidies, and seeking to obtain satisfaction through the judicial process.134 Without the
capability to make, enforce and stick to policy compromises, with predictability and an absence
of sudden policy responses,135 the reform agenda for the sector is unlikely to be realized.

95.     On the other hand, the key reforms cannot wait for these structural changes to
occur. Changing the form and substance of policy interaction is a long process: even in a much
smaller country, such as Malaysia, and with the Prime Minister’s weight behind this sort of
reform, enacting it is expected to take anywhere from five years to a decade. In the interim, the
global apparel industry is shifting, and opportunities today may not exist in the future. As such,
the goal should be to change “being” by “doing,” as that same Malaysian effort describes it: to
achieve results now, but achieve them in a new way, and in so doing to plant the seeds for more
fundamental change in the long term.

96.     To return to the agenda set out above implies tackling, first, the opening up of the
fabric sector, customs processes, dispute resolution (for clarifying tariff lines disputes), and
processing aggregation. The Government could set a series of goals for multiple intermediate
actions and pursue them one-by-one, through a process that builds trust. To gain momentum,
such an initiative should avoid the most contentious issues at first, such as fiber policy, and
concentrate on areas where a compromise may be within reach, for example in fabric, or in areas
where agreement in principle exists but operational details are proving difficult, such as customs
operations. This effort could be complemented by tackling one or two initiatives that require
policy innovation—such as the green aggregation of the processing industry and the reform of
schemes to support capabilities—before moving on to more difficult terrain, such as contract
enforcement for buyers and agents (further rationale for this sequence is described below).

97.     Importantly, any dialogue process would have to see as its goal not merely
formulating and enacting a policy, but jointly monitoring its impact and conducting
iterations afterwards. The process mandate, in other words, should be for six years rather than
six months. The devil will be in the details, to avoid “talk shops,” but such processes do not lack
precedent, and the capabilities to undertake them are being diffused through the India Backbone
Implementation Network (IbIn). If approached successfully, however, the seeds would then be
planted for a larger, more ambitious effort, one that will doubtless be difficult and bound to

    In fact, the recent upsurge in judicial activism may be dangerous to the long-term health of policymaking in India
for precisely this reason. Wilson documents the effects of similar judicial developments in the US from the 1960s
onwards, with consequences on policymaking that are still felt today.

    For example, the newly released sector skills plan for Textiles contains as one of its first proviso the
Government’s right to halt any project. Giving prominence to such clauses is unlikely to further the type of pl anning
and risk-taking needed for stakeholders to make substantial compromises with each other.

encounter resistance but which is the only way forward in seeking to secure the tens of millions
of jobs that are at stake.


SECTION 4: CONCLUSION

A.     THE POTENTIAL OF CHANGE

98.      The differential in exports between high- and low-growth scenarios is vast,
amounting to a two-fold difference in exports in 2021. Extending the targets contained in the
Twelfth Plan, as a high scenario, would result in approximately US$110 billion in exports in
2021. In contrast, the moderate projections by industry would result in approximately US$60
billion in that year, while continuance of recent five-year rolling growth rates for the next decade
would result in growth to only around US$50 billion. Of course, an even lower figure would
result from the most recent year’s trends, in which growth was static, leaving exports in the range
of US$25–30 billion. The differences among these scenarios are meaningful fractions of India’s
current account deficit in 2013, though, as noted repeatedly above, higher exports will require
higher imports. Nevertheless, the difference between status quo and the full potential of textiles
and apparel in India is equivalent to a multiple of the size of the whole industry today.

99.     While net job impacts are impossible to estimate, the industry’s jobs would be more
secure, sustainable, and at higher incomes. Given the industry’s existing low productivity and
low utilization, this more rapid growth would be unlikely to lead to the creation of a vast number
of net new jobs. However, the existing workforce in the industry would become more
productive, with the likelihood of substantial increases in income levels. Given that the industry
employs tens of millions, increasing income in these jobs would give a large boost to inclusive
growth. Moreover, the counterfactual is not the maintenance of these jobs, but the likely
shrinking of employment, as stagnant or declining industry revenues coincide with moderately
increasing productivity growth and the continuing substitution of capital for labor.

100. An increase in global market share to match China’s current presence would create
exports worth just over 10 percent of India’s GDP today. As noted above, as China rotates
out of the textiles and apparel industry, no other country is alone capable of picking up its market
share except—at the limit of ambition, and over the long-term—India, which has the potential
scale and the presence of the full value chain. If it could do so, this would imply exports growing
to some US$250 billion, China’s exports in 2012. Indeed, if global trade in textiles and apparel
continues to grow at roughly 7 percent per annum, this absolute value would be less than 10
percent of the global market in the mid-2020s. On the other hand, it would represent over 10
percent of India’s nominal GDP today (though, again, imports would rise too). Such growth
would likely catalyze even more substantial growth through effects on the non-export value
chain, the stimulation of local capital goods in textile machinery, and induced effects through
higher incomes across the industry. Achieving such an ambitious goal is, however, likely to be

                                                55
impossible without—at the very least—coordination and collaboration to execute the ambitious
reform agenda, both within and beyond the textiles and apparel industry.

101. Realistically, much of the impact will be concentrated in States with existing
concentrations of industry, until domestic fragmentation is decisively overcome. Even in the
most ambitious scenarios, it remains likely that investment and production will continue to locate
in the traditional centers of the industry in the short to medium term. The common theme
throughout this study has been the importance for apparel and textile firms of, first, collective
action, whether in securing and dividing orders, purchasing in bulk, or engaging in policy
dialogue; and, second, the easy availability of key inputs, which may not mean having suppliers
collocate but does imply being near others who know where to find supplies, and the suppliers
themselves being easy to find. Moreover, firms need to be easily identified and reached by global
purchasers: even in China, only the construction of extensive high-speed rail, allowing inland
firms to reach coastal buyers easily and frequently, has been able to shift production away from
the coast.136 Until a strong base of intermediaries is in place, able to transfer the trust and
connection of local clusters across State borders, these connections will remain localized in
existing areas.

102. Hence, though some firms may shift to second-tier cities close to the major metropoles—
and the two largest clusters in the country, near Tiripur and Surat, are already in second-tier
cities—they are unlikely to move to virgin territory, at least until states with existing industries
are entirely saturated. On the other hand, those states do require new pools of industrial labor,
and there is anecdotal evidence that almost a fifth of the entering labor pool in Tamil Nadu’s
textile industry is from low-income states, especially Odisha.137 Even if investment does not
take place in low-income states, the gains from the positive reform scenarios are likely to accrue
to the residents of those states; even if such growth is not inclusive among geographic units, it
will be inclusive among people. On the other hand, once the market is integrated—such that a
firm that moves across a state can retain its customers and its suppliers via trusted intermediaries
and be assured of timely deliveries in a reasonable timeframe—then the industry will, as it has in
China, naturally move out of high-cost locations into low-income States.138 Without integration,
cost differences alone have not and likely will not induce investment in other States, no matter
the improvements in their theoretical investment climate.

    A few interviewed garments firms (December 2013, Gurgaon) expressed interest in setting up factories in Bihar,
because of market access (Bihar and its neighboring states and Nepal), the availability of laborers, the absence of a
textiles and garments policy, and the willingness of the Government of Bihar to engage in a meaningful dialogue
with the industry on such a policy. However, while the investment climate in Bihar has radically improved during
the last decade, investors are still reluctant to invest in assets —that is, land and infrastructure.

B.     PATHWAYS TO IMPLEMENTATION

103. It would be wishful thinking to presume that such reforms will lack opponents. The
reforms described in Table 8 are not without cost. They will be vigorously resisted by inefficient
industries that are currently protected, by small firms that fear growing large, and by the informal
interests that benefit from restrictive and discretionary regulatory regimes. The more other
stakeholders are uncertain about the dynamics of long-term growth, the more likely they will be
to opposing reforms. For example, cotton growers have in the past opposed reforms that would
make manmade fibers more widely available, for fear they would depress cotton prices. As noted
above, with sufficient vigor in the reforms, the opposite might in fact occur: the apparel industry,
liberated to take share in garments that use synthetics, would increase cotton use across the value
chain. However, it is wishful thinking to believe that cotton farmers, or other such interests, will
be easily persuaded to take such risks, necessitating a deep, continuous process of consensus
building, and, most importantly, building credibility through action.

104. But a developmental coalition exists that could propel change. There are a wide range
of interests that would support change, beginning with the millions employed in the industry. A
number of States have economies highly dependent on the value chain, and could be allies in
reform. The loosely organized, dispersed producers at present operating well below capacity
could be strong allies in a process of reform, if given a credible vision of how that reform will
benefit them. Most of all, there are the growing and capable firms across the value chain, which,
if strengthened within the industry instead of penalized, could create an increasing constituency
for change. It will be difficult to piece together this sort of coalition, but it is necessary for the
long-term health of the industry, and could be twinned with a careful sequencing of reforms that
escalated from the simpler to the more difficult, aiming to strengthen the developmental coalition
as it progressed.

105. Sequencing and credible commitment to policy continuity will be important to avoid
strong opposition to reforms. For instance, inefficient mills, many in poor financial condition,
would resist duty and hassle-free import of fabric: some might be brought on board if the scheme
starts small and gradually expands, and if such mills are also eligible for interim support. As a
first step, various policy options for facilitating the easy sourcing of (manmade fiber) fabrics
should be identified and evaluated carefully, both in terms of their consequences for different
parts of the textiles and apparel value chain as well as their wider economic impact. In the end,
however, this is likely to require a difficult decision, though one against a relatively small
interest, so long as it is not seen as a threat by the broad mass of cotton weavers. As above, a
coherent long-term growth and reform agenda will thus need to be communicated aggressively.

106. An industry in which the balance of interest is shifting to growing, capable firms, as
opposed to small, protected ones, would then be a strong partner to engage in economy-
wide reforms, such as continual customs reform. The price of such reform would have to be
far more stringent penalties for violations of regulations, enough to threaten the continued

                                                 57
operation of weak firms, which more capable and growing firms would be willing to accept; in
exchange, young firms and those with clean track records—regardless of their size—should have
access to green channel facilitation. Such full implementation of a risk management system
would, however, require sustained consensus and trust building between industry and the
Customs Service. Without this, yet more notices without ground-level buy-in would likely be
sabotaged.

107. The most significant and enduring changes, though, must be fundamental: the GST,
the end of checkpoints, and the end of paying firms to stay small. Finally, an industry that
was globally open, with a healthier balance among its constituents, shifting continually towards
more medium-sized and capable firms, would, hopefully, have the type of weight in policy
dialogue that could shift broader reforms. In that case, aside from the problems of electricity and
space, the focus of Government and industry should then shift strongly towards promoting
broader reforms: namely, the GST and accompanying end of check posts; and the sustained
reform of cross-industry schemes that pay firms to stay small.

108. In the best scenario, these changes would combine to restructure the industry’s
relationship with government and society, facilitating continued change. If this agenda can
be achieved, a vibrant, strong, connected, and globally competitive textiles and apparel industry
in India could drive growth and rising wages. Even if an initial set of reforms did not achieve all
its goals, an enhanced process of policy dialogue could lead over time to more long-lasting and
profound changes. Namely, the forms and institutions of collective action would, it might be
hoped, change their “being” through doing, becoming more representative of growing and
capable firms, and more trusted partners in the rest of society. That would then smooth the path
for future reforms, allowing for more rapid adjustment and hence the type of endogenous policy
learning that is the surest route to long-term growth.

109. Change needs to start now. The window of opportunity is closing quickly. There is
little time to waste. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the purchasing agents who shape global
production are passing India by. This, after a few years of intense interest in the country in which
they sought alternatives to China. As such, reforms to the business environment facing the
textiles and apparel industry are urgent, before increasing scale and cluster economies in
competitor economies increasingly lock in the shape of the industry for the next decade. On the
other hand, such reforms are within reach, and if the journey starts now, if the hard reforms are
made and the trust and cooperation built that will lead to policy learning over decades, by 2030
India could aspire to dominate the world textiles and apparel industry much as China does today.
