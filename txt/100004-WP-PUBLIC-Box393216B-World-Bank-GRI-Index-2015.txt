This 2015 index of sustainability indicators has been prepared in accordance with the internationally recognized standard for sustainability reporting
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines and comply with the “core option.” The GRI Index provides an overview of sustainability considerations
within the World Bank’s lending and analytical services as well as its day-to-day operations and management of staff. The World Bank aims to be
comprehensive in its reporting and thus the Index includes indicators from GRI's Financial Sector Supplement.

The GRI Index covers activities from fiscal 2015, July 1, 2014, through June 30, 2015.

About the World Bank Group
The World Bank Group plays a key role in the global effort to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. It consists of five institutions: the
World Bank, which includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association
(IDA); the International Finance Corporation (IFC); the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA); and the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). Working together in more than 130 countries, these institutions provide financing, advice, and other
solutions that enable countries to address the most urgent challenges of development.

This GRI Index addresses the activities of the World Bank and its two agencies. Except for the eligibility of support and terms of lending to member
countries, the IBRD and IDA are tightly integrated and work as a single unit.


DEFINING THE REPORT

Methodology for Determining Materiality

The topics deemed relevant for disclosure in this GRI Index were identified by assessing annual corporate priorities outlined by the institution’s
Boards and President and by considering stakeholder input, as well as by ascertaining sustainability impacts of carrying out the Bank’s mission and
strategy. To determine if a GRI aspect is material for the World Bank to report on, an assessment was carried out based on (1) the potential impact
on the Bank’s business and (2) the sustainability impacts stemming from its business.
Report Boundary

The differentiation between “operational” and “corporate” indicators establishes the boundaries of the GRI Index disclosures.

a. Impacts external to the organization [“operational boundary”]

The World Bank, a development institution, works closely with member country government counterparts and stakeholders to achieve lasing results.
Indirect impacts occur in member countries as a result of its lending and analytical services and may not be directly controlled by the Bank’s
management. Impacts stemming from the World Bank’s work with clients are specified as “operational.”

In terms of satisfying GRI reporting specifications, the World Bank references its entire portfolio of activities, but does not include the performance of
individual investments in its portfolio. Descriptions of individual investments can be found on the projects website.

b. Impacts internal to the organization [“corporate boundary”]

“Corporate boundary” refers to the impact from our day-to-day operations on buildings and staff members. GRI indicators for the environment apply
primarily to performance of Washington, DC, facilities (which house 60 percent of World Bank staff) with Country Office data noted when relevant.
Indicators related to labor practices apply to global staff policies and practices.

Validating the Methodology: Stakeholder Panel

The World Bank invited selected stakeholders in May 2014 to meet in person to review the Bank’s materiality approach and resulting reporting, and
advise it in that undertaking for the 2014 reporting cycle. Details are available in the 2014 materiality discussion.


RESULTS: WHAT IS MATERIAL?

Operational impact

The World Bank’s most pertinent sustainability impacts from financial and technical services to clients can be summarized in the following GRI-
related aspects:

1. Economic Performance—Because creating and distributing economic value is part of the mission of eliminating extreme poverty, shareholders
and investors care about the sustainable economic performance of this institution.

2. Indirect Economic Impacts—These impacts are an essential aspect of the Bank’s second goal of ensuring shared prosperity. Numerous
stakeholders have also asked for better valuation of results, direct and indirect, from World Bank lending and analytical services.



                                                                                                                                                        2
3. Biodiversity—Through lending and grant support to client countries, the World Bank Group is one of the largest international funding sources for
biodiversity worldwide.

4. Human Rights / Child Labor / Indigenous Rights—The World Bank significantly promotes human rights through its projects, for example,
improving poor people’s access to health, education, food, and water; promoting the participation of Indigenous Peoples in decision making,
strengthening the accountability and transparency of governments to their citizens; supporting justice reform; and fighting corruption. In addition,
civil society is actively following the World Bank’s current process of updating its safeguard policies. Stakeholders have al so raised concerns about
inadequate protections for child labor by member countries in projects implemented through World Bank lending.

5. Local Communities—The very nature of the Bank’s mission is to positively impact communities through investments in education, health, public
administration, infrastructure, and so on.

6. Anti-corruption—A well-functioning public sector that delivers quality public services consistent with citizen preferences and fosters private,
market-led growth while managing its fiscal resources in a prudent manner is critical to the World Bank’s mission to alleviate pover ty. Opinion
leaders in the Bank’s client countries listed anti-corruption as one of their development priorities.

7. Grievance Mechanisms (environmental and human rights, for impacts on society)—Grievance redress mechanisms (GRMs) are crucial for
managing risk in the Bank’s portfolio. By offering a channel for citizens to express concerns, comments, and complaints, GRMs create opportunities
to resolve disputes before they escalate. GRMs can help the Bank and member countries improve project outcomes, prioritize supervision, identify
systemic issues, and promote accountability. “Percent of resolved registered grievances” is now a key performance indicator f or the World Bank
(see Corporate Scorecard).

8. Product Portfolio and Audit Aspects from the Financial Sector Supplement—World Bank stakeholders look to the Bank to ensure that policies and
procedures are in place to assess and screen environmental and social risks in its lending portfolio.

Corporate impact

The most material aspects of the Bank’s internal operations include the following:

1. Staff are the World Bank’s greatest asset. They bring a wide range of perspectives to bear on poverty-reduction issues and emerging
development challenges, and are critical to the effectiveness of the Bank’s core operational and knowledge services. Staff-related indicators are
pulled from the following GRI aspect categories: economic performance, market presence, employment, occupational health and safety, training
and education, diversity and equal opportunity, labor practices grievance mechanisms, and nondiscrimination.

2. The Bank recognizes that reducing its own corporate environmental impacts is in line with the institutional mission to reduce poverty, as
environmental degradation affects the world’s poor disproportionately. Increasing the efficiency of how the organization runs its business—through
facility-level and staff-behavior changes—reduces natural-resource waste and decreases the cost of day-to-day operations. Key aspects related to

                                                                                                                                                         3
the Bank’s environmental footprint include the following: energy, emissions, effluents and waste, and procurement practices (including supplier
environmental assessment, supplier assessment for impacts on society, and supplier human rights assessment).

For the fiscal 2015 Index, the GRI aspects “materials” and “procurement practices” were not deemed material based on the methodology used. This
was mainly because World Bank stakeholders were not asking the Bank how it managed its corporate procurement practices. Thus these aspects
scored low on the materiality scale. The Bank continues to consider its procurement practices an essential part of reducing its footprint impact;
therefore, information about these practices are included in The 2015 Sustainability Report (PDF).

                              The World Bank works with its member countries to achieve equitable and sustainable economic growth in
                              their national economies and find solutions to pressing regional and global problems in economic development
                              and in other important areas, such as environmental sustainability.
                              Despite progress during the past decades, humanity still faces urgent and complex challenges. More than 1
                              billion people live in destitution, making eliminating extreme poverty a continuing priority. Against a backdrop
                              of rising inequality and social exclusion in many countries, poverty remains an urgent challenge. The simple-
                              sounding mission has proven to be a complex issue, with multiple dimensions requiring coordinated action
                              from the entire international community on many policy fronts. Combining concern for greater equity with the
                              need for growth will help to ensure that the bottom 40 percent of society will share in prosperity.
       Description of key     The World Bank believes that the depth and breadth of its sectoral knowledge, along with its range of financial
G4-2   impacts, risks, and    and technical assistance instruments, can help countries address these challenges. With this in mind, the
       opportunities
                              World Bank Group has set two goals: (1) strive toward reducing the extreme poverty rate to no more than 3
                              percent in 2030 and (2) promote shared prosperity by fostering income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the
                              population in every country. It endeavors to pursue both of these goals in an environmentally, socially, and
                              fiscally sustainable way.
                              A detailed discussion on significant environmental, social, and economic impacts of the World Bank and
                              associated challenges and opportunities as it continues on the path to end poverty and boost shared
                              prosperity is available in the World Bank Group Strategy. Unveiled at the 2013 Annual Meetings, the strategy
                              brings together for the first time the combined strength of the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA and places the
                              collective institution in a position to become the “Solutions Bank with results for the poor as our central
                              benchmark.” In addition, to ensure the availability of adequate resources that are aligned with the twin goals

                                                                                                                                           6
                      and its strategy, the World Bank Group has undertaken significant financial reforms that will increase its
                      capacity to provide lending services to clients while strengthening its financial resilience. Performance for
                      these goals includes more than one indicator.
                      Improved client services—which will ultimately help the World Bank Group deliver on its goals—can only
                      happen within a strong risk-management culture and framework that preserve the Bank Group’s reputation
                      and financial sustainability in an increasingly uncertain and challenging environment. The Bank Group’s
                      approach involves the proactive identification and management of risk in operations to ensure that risks are
                      adequately assessed, measured, monitored, and reported so that corrective action can be taken, if necessary,
                      in a timely manner. The Chief Risk Officer assists Bank management with identifying and managing Bank-
                      wide crosscutting risks, enhancing risk response decisions, reducing financial and operational surprises and
                      losses, seizing opportunities, and improving deployment of capital.
                      The Bank Group faces a variety of risks related to development impacts, environmental and social safeguards,
                      integrity, and financial management. It manages them through a customized risk rating and regular monitoring
                      system as well as through engagement with clients. It manages other risks, including fiscal and operational
                      risks, using leading industry practices and standards adapted to the Bank Group’s purposes.
                      As both a development and a financial institution, the World Bank Group faces special challenges in the
                      current environment. Initiatives in fiscal 2015 on financing for development, the Sustainable Development
                      Goals, and climate change will affect the development agenda for years to come. The emergence of new
                      multilateral development institutions creates both opportunities and challenges for creative partnerships and
                      requires fresh thinking about the financial structure of the World Bank Group.

                                 The World Bank is not a bank in the traditional sense but a unique partnership to reduce poverty and support
                                 development. IBRD is governed by and works with its 188 member countries to achieve equitable and
                                 sustainable economic growth in their national economies and to find solutions to pressing regional and global
                                 problems in economic development and other important areas, such as environmental sustainability. IDA
                                 works with its 173 member countries to reduce poverty by providing loans (called “credits”) and grants for

                               As of June 30, 2014, the World Bank employed 11,933 staff and 4,262 consultants who worked in
                               Washington, DC, and in 8 headquarters satellite offices and 127 Country Offices worldwide.
                               World Bank lending commitments for development support totaled $42.5 billion in fiscal 2015.
                               New lending commitments by IBRD totaled $23.5 billion for 112 operations in fiscal 2015. This volume was
                               higher than the precrisis historical average ($13.5 billion a year in fiscal 2005–08) and the $18.6 billion in fiscal
                               2014. As of June 30, 2015, net commitments in IBRD's active portfolio stood at $96.8 billion. IBRD also offers
                               financial products that allow clients to efficiently fund their development programs and manage risks related to
                               currency, interest rates, commodity prices, and natural disasters. In fiscal 2015, the Bank’s Treasury executed
                               US dollar equivalent (USDeq) 3.3 billion in hedging transactions on behalf of member countries, including
G4-9   Scale of organization   USDeq 2.0 billion in interest rate conversions and USDeq 1.2 billion in currency conversions, to assist
                               borrowers in managing interest rate and currency risks over the life of their IBRD loans. In addition, the Bank’s
                               Treasury executed swap transactions totaling USDeq 24 billion to manage the risks of IBRD’s balance sheet
                               and USDeq 727 million to manage the risks of IDA’s balance sheet.
                               IDA commitments amounted to $19.0 billion for 190 operations in fiscal 2015, including $15.9 billion in credits,
                               $2.4 billion in grants, and $600 million in guarantees. As of June 30, 2015, net commitments in IDA’s active
                               portfolio stood at $91.4 billion. IDA is financed largely by contributions from partner governments. Additional
                               financing comes from transfers from IBRD’s net income, grants from the International Finance Corporation
                               (IFC), and borrowers’ repayments of earlier IDA credits. Under the IDA17 Replenishment, which covers fiscal
                               2015–17, total resources amount to 33.7 billion in Special Drawing Rights (equivalent to $50.8 billion). For

                                 The World Bank’s workforce is composed of some 16,300 individuals of 170 nationalities—about 5,500 on
                                 permanent contracts, 6,500 on fixed-term or temporary contracts, and 4,300 full-time-equivalent (FTE) short-
                                 term consultants. The richness of the backgrounds and experience of Bank staff continues to be a hallmark of
                                 the products and services that clients seek.
                                 There has only been a 3.2 percent decrease in the number of full-time employees (those on permanent, fixed-
                                 term, and temporary contracts) since fiscal 2014. The Bank also employed about 4,262 FTE short-term
                                 consultants in fiscal 2015, a 6 percent increase over FTE short-term consultants employed in 2014. These
                                 self-employed workers make up about a quarter of the Bank’s workforce.
                                 The World Bank has a significant global footprint, with 40 percent of full-time staff now working outside the
                                 United States. Eighty-three percent of the staff and 2 percent of managers of director level or above (grade
                                 GI+) located in non-US offices were locally hired.

                                    mission and goals. The sustainability impact refers to environmental and social criteria, as outlined by the
                                    Natural Step, namely: material extracted from the earth’s crust; accumulation of persistent or toxic emissions;
                                    extractive industry or destructive processes; and the extent to which people’s ability to meet their needs are
                                    undermined. To ensure representation of sustainable development, an additional criterion was added to give
                                    preference for impact on the local economy.
                                    The Principles for Defining Report Content have been applied to identify, prioritize, and validate the
                                    information to be disclosed by considering the World Bank’s activities, impacts, and the substantive
                                    expectations and interests of its stakeholders. Each criterion above is given a point and a threshold is set to
                                    prioritize GRI aspects to include in the report.

                                   As a global citizen and a global employer, the World Bank consults and collaborates with thousands of
                                   stakeholders throughout the world. The Bank groups the stakeholders into two main categories: internal and
        Stakeholder groups
                                   external. Internal stakeholders include Bank owners (shareholder governments) and Bank employees (internal
G4-24   engaged by the
                                   staff). External stakeholders include civil society, faith-based organizations, academics, foundations,
        organization
                                   parliamentarians, citizens impacted by projects, private sector (including socially responsible investors),
                                   partnering agencies, and international, national, and local media.

                                          views on a variety of key areas—from leadership to career development to
                                          the work environment.

                          Civil society   Engagement ranges from focus groups to community panels to invitations to

                                          Annual Meetings. Twice a year, during the Spring and Annual Meetings, the
                                          World Bank hosts the Civil Society Policy Forum, where civil society
                                          representatives from around the world convene to deliberate priority
                                          development issues with a broad group of stakeholders. At the global and
                                          regional levels, civil society organizations (CSOs) have been formally
                                          consulted on the major policies introduced or updated in recent years by
                                          World Bank staff in such areas as access to information, social
                                          accountability, and environmental and social safeguards. Consultations have
                                          also become common; they are based on such reports as the annual World
                                          Development Report (WDR) and evaluations carried out by the Independent
                                          Evaluation Group (IEG). At the country level, the World Bank consults with a
                                          broad spectrum of CSOs on the System Country Diagnostic, the Country
                                          Partnership Framework, sector studies, and individual Bank-funded
                                          development projects. Often these consultations are multi-stakeholder and
                                          involve CSOs, governments, businesses, and other donor agencies. With the

                      CSOs’ social accountability initiatives aimed at strengthening transparency
                      and accountability. For more information on the Bank’s engagement with civil

Citizens and others   Stakeholder consultations are a time-limited engagement platform through
                      which interested and impacted parties can share their input and perspectives
                      on a proposed area of the World Bank’s work. This exercise is done with the
                      objective of influencing decisions. Therefore, the objective of consultations is
                      to seek the views of those affected by our work but outside the internal
                      decision-making process. By ensuring that affected and interested parties
                      express their views about a particular policy, strategy, study, or program, and
                      by ensuring that a wide range of potential impacts is taken into account, the
                      Bank’s decision-making process becomes better informed, more rigorous,
                      and more accountable. Moreover, consultation has become an essential
                      component of the open and accessible governance of the institution.
                      Consultation methods and formats vary depending on the scope of the World
                      Bank Group’s proposed engagement (local, regional, national, or global), the
                      purpose of the engagement, the nature of the issues being discussed, and
                      the parties and stakeholders interested in influencing the outcome of the
                      process. For more information, see http://consultations.worldbank.org/.
                      The Country Opinion Survey Program results are aggregated data from
                      approximately 40 countries per year. The program systematically measures
                      and tracks the perceptions of the World Bank’s clients, partners, and other
                      stakeholders across the globe in member countries. For more information,

                         regional and global levels. Consultation methods and formats vary depending
                         on the scope of the World Bank Group’s proposed engagement. For more

Local, national, and     On a daily basis, the World Bank approaches media to cover its major report
international media      launches, corporate priority campaigns, and messages, including events
                         involving the President. At key opportunities, like the Annual and Spring
                         Meetings, the Bank proactively drives the primary messages of the institution,
                         such as its commitment to the twin goals of ending extreme poverty by 2030
                         and boosting shared prosperity. The Bank approaches traditional media
                         outlets (via interviews and op-eds) and actively uses social media to promote
                         issues that need to be addressed to achieve those goals, such as major
                         reports on climate change. It also responds to all media queries and interview
                         requests to help the media better understand the Bank and what it does. In
                         addition, the Bank’s reputation is managed by working with reporters to clarify
                         Bank priorities and activities, providing them with institution views so they can
                         write balanced and well-represented articles. Press releases, speeches,
                         transcripts, and feature stories from the Bank can be found on the World
                         Bank’s website homepage, http://www.worldbank.org, and on the news site,
                         http://worldbank.org/news
                         The key priority in fiscal year 2015 was the continued promotion and
                         implementation of the World Bank’s twin goals. This included outreach to key
                         audiences through mechanisms such as press releases, op-eds, report
                         launches, and other stakeholder engagement about activities achieve these
                         goals. Significant communications efforts were also directed toward the Bank
                         Group’s enhanced efforts in combating specific issues, such as tackling the
                         Ebola outbreak and fighting climate change, while the Bank’s issuance and
                         promotion of global economic outlooks also garnered strong media coverage.

                                   The World Bank is a development institution for which its 188 member countries are shareholders. The Bank
                                   works with members to achieve equitable and sustainable economic growth in their national economies and
                                   find solutions to pressing regional and global problems in economic development and critical areas such as
                                   environmental sustainability. It pursues its overriding goal to overcome poverty and improve standards of living
                                   primarily by providing loans, risk-management products, and expertise on development-related disciplines and
                                   by coordinating responses to regional and global challenges. Member countries govern the Bank through the
                                   Boards of Governors and the Board of Executive Directors (EDs).
                                   The Boards of Governors consist of one governor and one alternate governor appointed by each member
                                   country. The office is usually held by the country’s minister of finance, governor of its central bank, or a senior

                                  The World Bank's mission is to fight poverty with passion and professionalism for lasting results. The twin
                                  goals--ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity--guide the mission. To achieve the goals, the
                                  Bank strives to promote environmental and social sustainability at the country and global levels, and to pursue
                                  a fiscally responsible development path. It seeks to help people help themselves and their environment by
                                  providing resources, sharing knowledge, building capacity, and forging partnerships in the public and private
                                  sectors. The institution’s core values are personal honesty, integrity, and commitment; working together in
                                  teams with openness and trust; empowering others and respecting differences; encouraging risk-taking and
                                  responsibility; and enjoying both work and family.
                                  There is a mandatory e-learning training on the Code of Conduct for all new staff, including consultants with
                                  contracts of more than 30 days. There is a separate Code of Conduct for Board officials. Business partners
                                  are informed of ethics expectations through a separate Code of Conduct document.
                                  In addition to the training for new staff, a number of ethics training courses are offered at the WBG. For

                                  In 2012, the World Bank Group elevated the head of the ethics function to a vice presidency. As indicated in a
                                  June 2015 communication from the Office of the President: “The leadership of this function by a Vice President
                                  and Group CEO reflects the importance attached to EBC’s mandate across its four key areas of responsibility:
                                  (1) responding to and investigating allegations of staff misconduct, and policies and procedures; (2) providing
                                  training, outreach, and communication on business conduct; (3) providing advice on conflicts of interest and
                                  implementing the Bank Group’s financial disclosure programs; and (4) tracking trends and providing insights
                                  and periodic reports to senior management.” A summary of the Code of Conduct is available in nine

                                    The Office of Ethics and Business Conduct (EBC) enables staff members to seek ethics-related advice and
                                    guidance. Employees, business partners, and other stakeholders are informed of EBC’s advisory services
                                    through a range of communication media. EBC advisory services are cited in various training programs offered
                                    by the WBG.
                                    The Ethics Helpline is an email service account (ethics_helpline@worldbank.org) that is accessible to staff and
                                    advertised on the external website. Staff members also can seek advice directly from EBC staff during office
                                    hours or arrange to speak with advisory team members at a convenient time. Most advisory services are
                                    provided in English, which is the working language of the World Bank. Staff members can also contact the
                                    Ethics Helpline 24/7 by phone (800-261-7497), which is administered in multiple languages by an outside
                                    vendor.
        Internal and external
                                    Advisory requests are treated with the highest possible level of confidentiality given the requirements of the
        mechanisms for seeking
                                    case. However, requesting advice on a misconduct matter does not provide immunity in relation to this
        advice on ethical and
                                    misconduct. In most cases, with this exception, advice is treated confidentially. Requests for advice can be
        lawful behavior, and
G4-57                               made anonymously.
        matters related to
        organizational integrity,   There were 830 requests for advice and guidance received by EBC in fiscal 2015. The most frequently
        such as helplines or        received queries involved questions concerning a staff member’s outside activities. For additional information
        advice lines                on the types of requests received, refer to EBC’s Annual Reports, posted online.
                                    EBC does not currently administer a satisfaction survey to individuals who contact the office. However,
                                    individuals who approach the office frequently express satisfaction, in particular because most requests for

         The World Bank is a vital source of financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the world. The World Bank’s lending
         is aimed at two different groups of countries: IBRD strives to reduce poverty in middle-income and credit-worthy poorer countries through
         loans, guarantees, risk-management products, and analytical and advisory services. Its companion organization, IDA, offers below-market-
         rate financing to the world’s 77 poorest countries, primarily through credits and grants.
         IBRD funds itself through high-quality bonds offered in the international capital markets. IDA’s funding is predominantly from contributions
G4-DMA
         by donor countries, including OECD countries and, increasingly, middle-income nations.
         The World Bank’s Corporate Scorecard is designed to provide a snapshot of the Bank’s overall performance in the context of development
         results. It facilitates strategic dialogue between management and the Board on progress made and areas that need attention. Aspects of
         financial strength are measured under the Scorecard’s Tier III, which reviews the overall success of Bank activities in achieving
         development goals and examines the effectiveness of Bank operations, including the performance of its lending portfolio.

                                      and 2013, respectively), and IDA’s revenues were $2.15 billion ($2.5 billion and $2.1
                                      billion for 2014 and 2013, respectively). Sources of revenues include revenue from

                                     As of June 30, 2015, the value of accrued pension liabilities for IBRD/IDA was $15.9
                                     billion, supported by assets held in trust of $15.2 billion. The funded ratio (asset over
                                     liabilities) was 96 percent as of June 30, 2015.


                                     Assets are evaluated at their fair value, and liabilities are measured as the Projected
                                     Benefit Obligation, discounted with high-quality corporate bonds rates. The two

         The World Bank is a vital source of financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the world. It is not a bank in the
         ordinary sense, but a unique partnership formed to reduce poverty and support development. The Bank supports a wide array of
         investments in such areas as education, health, public administration, infrastructure, financial and private sector development, agriculture,
         and environmental and natural resource management.
G4-DMA   The Bank has established ambitious but achievable goals to galvanize international and national efforts: (1) strive toward reducing the
         extreme poverty rate to no more than 3 percent in 2030 and (2) promote shared prosperity by fostering income growth of the bottom 40
         percent of the population in every country. It endeavors to pursue both of these goals in an environmentally, socially, and fiscally
         sustainable way. The World Bank Group’s Corporate Scorecard measures the progress on these goals. The results provide key sectoral
         and multisectoral results achieved by our clients with the support of World Bank Group operations in pursuit of the goals.

                                      The World Bank works with its borrowing country members to achieve equitable and
                                      sustainable economic growth in their national economies and to find solutions to
                                      pressing regional and global problems in economic development and in other important
                                      areas, such as environmental sustainability. The Bank pursues its principal goals of
                                      overcoming poverty and improving standards of living primarily by providing loans, risk
                                      management products, and expertise on development-related disciplines, and by

         Countries rely on healthy ecosystems and biodiversity to survive, grow enough food, and make a living. But the world is experiencing a
         dramatic loss of biodiversity, negatively affecting livelihoods, clean water supply, food security, and resilience to environmental disasters.
         This situation particularly affects the 75 percent of the world's poor who live in rural areas and often rely on ecosystems to make a living.

G4-DMA   The World Bank works with countries around the world to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity. With a portfolio of 229 projects worth
         $1.078 billion in the 10 years from fiscal 2006 through 2015, the World Bank is one of the largest international financiers of biodiversity
         conservation and sustainable use.
         The World Bank helps countries put policies in place so that biodiversity is valued as a key driver of sustainable development. It works with
         clients to improve their administration to better conserve and sustainably use their biodiversity. The Bank invests in those aspects of
                                                                                                                                                    26
          biodiversity services—such as watershed management and protected areas—that help countries achieve their development goals. The
          World Bank also helps countries find ways to generate revenues from biodiversity, such as tourism income, in addition to fighting wildlife
          crime. Biodiversity projects range from establishing and strengthening terrestrial, freshwater, and marine protected areas, to eradicating
          invasive alien species, to improving biodiversity management planning in the production landscape.
          The World Bank does not support projects that involve the significant conversion or degradation of critical natural habitats. Wherever
          feasible, Bank-financed projects are sited on already converted lands. The Bank does not support projects involving the significant
          conversion of natural habitats unless there are no feasible alternatives for the project and its siting, and comprehensive analysis
          demonstrates that overall benefits from the project substantially outweigh the environmental costs. If the environmental assessment
          indicates that a project would significantly convert or degrade natural habitats, the project takes mitigation measures, including minimizing
          habitat loss and establishing and maintaining an ecologically similar protected area. In deciding whether to support a project with potential
          adverse impacts on a natural habitat, the Bank takes into account the borrower's ability to implement the appropriate conservation and
          mitigation measures.
          A 2010 review of the Bank's safeguard policies regime by the Independent Evaluation Group found that 11 percent of projects triggered
          Operational Policy 4.04 on Natural Habitats. Among these, the policy was satisfactory in 72 percent of cases.


                                       The Bank supports the protection, maintenance, and rehabilitation of natural habitats
                                       and their functions in its economic and sector work, project financing, and policy
                                       dialogue.


                                       From fiscal 2006 to 2015, 87 projects supported habitat-protected or -restored areas,
                                       with a geographic emphasis on Latin America and the Caribbean region, with 31
                                       projects, and Africa, with 29 projects. There were 16 projects in East Asia and the
                                       Pacific, 6 in Eastern and Central Asia, 2 in Middle East and North Africa, 2 in South
          Habitats protected or
G4-EN13                                Asia, and 1 other. Habitat restoration was supported through five projects (2 in Africa, 1           Full

                                       in East and Central Asia, 2 in Latin America and the Caribbean region).
                                       Bank projects with natural habitat components include appropriate environmental
                                       expertise for project preparation, appraisal, and supervision arrangements to ensure
                                       adequate design and implementation of mitigation measures. Global and regional
                                       partnerships play an important role in promoting biodiversity conservation. Some of the

         The World Bank has two ambitious goals: to eliminate extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. Poverty, as
         the Bank recognizes it, encompasses lack of opportunities (including capabilities), lack of voice and representation, and vulnerability to
         shocks.
         Grievance redress mechanisms (GRMs) are crucial for managing risk in the Bank ’s portfolio. GRMs create opportunities to resolve disputes
         before they escalate by offering a channel for citizens to express concerns, comments, and complaints. Beyond their benefits to citizens,
         GRMs can help the Bank and client improve project outcomes, prioritize supervision, identify systemic issues, and promote accountability.
         The Bank promotes human rights principles through the projects it supports, for example, improving poor people's access to health
G4-DMA   services, education, food, and water. Moreover, the Bank promotes the participation of project-affected people, including Indigenous
         Peoples, in decision making and participation; helps strengthen the accountability and transparency of governments to their citizens; and
         supports justice reform and fighting corruption. Although development projects are intended to bring about positive change, their
         implementation involves risks, and people or the environment can be adversely impacted. The Bank has policies to help avoid such
         unintended outcomes, but some problems may remain unrecognized or unaddressed. In such circumstances, citizens must speak out to
         bring attention to these problems. This can be done either through project-level Grievance Redress Mechanisms or the Bank’s corporate-
         level Grievance Redress Service (GRS), which was established in January 2015 to field complaints that could not be addressed at the
         country level. This mechanism complements the borrower’s project-level grievance mechanisms (where they exist), and the Board’s
         Inspection Panel.

                                                                                                                                               28
          The Environmental and Social Standards-Advisory Team (ESSAT) leads the Bank’s corporate work on grievance redress. GRS provides a
          consistent and systematic approach to the handling of complaints and conflict resolution across all IBRD/IDA operations. The work involves
          a number of the Bank's major initiatives, in particular, work on risk, results, and beneficiary feedback.
          The Global Review of Grievance Redress Mechanisms found that half of all Bank projects featured a GRM in project-design documents.
          However, new research shows implementation challenges.
          A major focus for the Bank in the future will be to further integrate grievance redress in all projects, increase support for implementation,
          and enhance collection and monitoring of grievances received and resolved across the project’s portfolio.

          The Bank significantly promotes human rights principles in a range of areas, including: (1) improving poor people's access to health
          services, education, food, and water, (2) promoting the participation of project-affected communities, including Indigenous Peoples, in
          decision-making, (3) strengthening the accountability and transparency of governments to their citizens, and (4) supporting justice reform
          and fighting corruption. Thus, the Bank's role is facilitative, helping its members realize their human rights obligations.
          The Bank screens each project proposed for financing to determine the appropriate extent and type of environmental and social analysis to
          be undertaken during project preparation, and whether the project may involve the use or application of other safeguard policies. Policies
          that may be triggered include: OP/BP 4.01, Environmental Assessment; OP/BP 4.04, Natural Habitats; OP 4.09, Pest Management; OP/BP
G4-DMA    4.10, Indigenous Peoples; OP/BP 4.11, Physical Cultural Resources; OP/BP 4.12, Involuntary Resettlement; OP 4.36, Forests; and OP/BP
          4.37, Safety of Dams. In addition, the Bank recognizes that gender issues are important dimensions of its poverty reduction, economic
          growth, human wellbeing, and development effectiveness agenda. OP/BP 4.20 establishes a country-level, strategic approach to
          mainstreaming gender issues in Bank work. For more information on gender issues, see: http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/gender.
          The Bank classifies the proposed project into one of four categories (A, B, C, and FI) depending on the type, location, sensitivity, and scale
          of the project, and the nature and magnitude of its potential environmental impacts. The borrower is responsible for any assessment
          required by the safeguard policies, with Bank staff providing general advice. Depending on the type of project and its safeguard policy
          category, the Bank project design incorporates into project development such issues as public consultation, environmental and social

         part of the legal agreements for grants and loans.
         In October 2012, the World Bank launched a review and update of its policies to protect people and the environment in its projects. The
         World Bank’s environmental and social safeguard policies contribute to sustainability and development effectiveness in Bank projects and
         programs by helping to avoid or mitigate harm to people and the environment. The goal of this review and update is to better align these
         policies with the changing needs and aspirations of borrowers, the external context, and the business of the Bank. The third phase of
         external consultations on the proposed Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) is now underway. For updates, see

         The World Bank recognizes that child labor is one of the most devastating consequences of persistent poverty. All standard World Bank
         bidding documents contain a clause prohibiting the use of child or forced labor in contracts financed under any World Bank projects. Staff in
G4-DMA
         Bank-supported operations are required to assess social issues such as child labor within the environmental and social aspects of the
         projects to mitigate risk.


                                      Concerns have been raised about the practice in Uzbekistan of using forced child and
                                      adult labor for cotton harvesting.
                                      Projects that could potentially relate to cotton production in Uzbekistan include
                                      measures to prevent the occurrence of child or forced labor within the Bank-supported
                                      projects, and further seek to contribute to achieving this beyond the project boundaries.
                                      These include the following requirements: government compliance with national
                                      legislation that prohibits the use of child or forced labor; implementation of a third-party
         Operations and               monitoring and feedback mechanism that focuses on child or forced labor issues in

         child labor                  the relevant financing agreements. Independent of this, the Bank retains the right to
                                      exercise remedies in cases of borrower noncompliance with the financing agreement.
                                      Since 2013, the Government of Uzbekistan has implemented a range of measures to
                                      fully eliminate child labor and reduce the risks of forced labor in the country. The World
                                      Bank has pursued intensive policy dialogue with the Government to address these
                                      issues in the context of broader agricultural sector reforms, and has developed a

         Central to the Bank’s mission of reducing poverty and promoting sustainable development is ensuring that the development process fully
         respects the dignity, human rights, economies, and cultures of Indigenous Peoples. The Bank recognizes that the identities and cultures of
         Indigenous Peoples are inextricably linked to the lands on which they live and the natural resources on which they depend. These distinct
         circumstances expose Indigenous Peoples to different types of risks and levels of impacts from development projects, including loss of
         identity, culture, and customary livelihoods. Gender and intergenerational issues among Indigenous Peoples also are complex. As social
         groups with identities that are often distinct from dominant groups in their national societies, Indigenous Peoples are frequently among the
         most marginalized and vulnerable segments of the population. As a result, their economic, social, and legal status often limits their capacity
         to defend their interests in and rights to lands, territories, and other productive resources, or restricts their ability to participate in and benefit
         from development. At the same time, the Bank recognizes that Indigenous Peoples play a vital role in sustainable development and that
         their rights are increasingly being addressed under both domestic and international law.


         The World Bank policy on Indigenous Peoples, OP/BP 4.10, Indigenous Peoples, underscores the need for borrowers and Bank staff to
G4-DMA
         identify Indigenous Peoples, consult with them, and ensure that they participate in and benefit from Bank-funded operations in a culturally
         appropriate way. It also emphasizes that adverse impacts on them are avoided or, where not feasible, minimized or mitigated. For all
         projects that are proposed for Bank financing and involve Indigenous Peoples, the Bank requires the borrower to engage in a process of
         free, prior, and informed consultation. The Bank provides project financing only where there is broad community support to the project by
         the affected Indigenous Peoples.
         In 2012, the World Bank began a process to update the Bank’s environmental and social safeguard policies, in an effort to better address
         new development challenges and reflect current international good practice. Part of the ongoing review is a Global Dialogue and
         Engagement process with Indigenous Peoples that aims to include Indigenous Peoples in the ongoing Review and Update of the World
         Bank’s Environmental and Social Framework (ESF), and to strengthen World Bank support to and engagement with Indigenous Peoples.
         The consultations on the proposed framework have included a number of dedicated Indigenous Peoples Dialogue sessions that have
         yielded important results in terms of participation, information gathered, and the beginning of a renewed and stronger relationship with
         Indigenous Peoples. For more information, see http://www.worldbank.org/indigenouspeoples.

          The very nature of the World Bank's mission is to positively impact communities through investments in education, health, public
          administration, infrastructure, financial and private-sector development, agriculture, and environmental and natural resource management.
          Our stakeholders are consulted at different points throughout our projects and policy development. In recent years, the World Bank has
          increasingly focused on lending to community-driven development (CDD) programs in order to let communities lead their own
          development. This process lets communities identify their own development priorities, design the relevant response, manage project funds,
          hire contractors, and, on completion of construction, manage and sustain the project. CDD approaches have been used to support a range
          of local development and service delivery needs identified by communities themselves, including water supply and sanitation, school and
          health facilities construction, rural roads, bridges and other access infrastructure, nutrition programs for mothers and infants, and support
G4-DMA    for livelihoods and microenterprises.
          Worldwide, CDD has attracted a growing body of robust impact and other evaluations demonstrating results, and the portfolio has become
          much more closely monitored, using, among other technologies, geo-tagging and SMS-based grievance redress systems. Robust impact
          evaluations generally find positive evidence of poverty reduction, targeting of the poor, and increased access to services; evidence is
          limited or mixed on these programs’ effect on governance, social capital spillovers (such as local collective action or trust among
          members), and conflict impact.
          Increased training, knowledge exchange, and quality assurance (through the Global Solutions Group) improves program designs, and
          increased evaluations and analytical work advances the approach.


          Percentage of                Community-driven development (CDD) programs operate on the principles of local
          operations with              empowerment, participatory governance, demand responsiveness, administrative

                                 The World Bank recognizes that CDD approaches and actions are important elements
                                 of an effective strategy for poverty reduction and sustainable development. Over the
                                 past decade, the Bank has increasingly focused on lending to CDD programs to reach
                                 local communities directly. The Bank has used the CDD approach across a range of
                                 countries and contexts (particularly fragile and conflict affected, and post-disaster) to
                                 support a variety of urgent needs, including water supply and sanitation, school and
                                 health facilities construction, rural roads, bridges and other access infrastructure,
                                 nutrition programs for mothers and infants, and support for livelihoods and
                                 microenterprises.
                                 In fiscal year 2015, the total amount of financing going to communities and local
                                 governments as grants or loans through this program was approximately $1.8 billion (a

                                 The Bank undertakes screening of each proposed project to determine the appropriate
                                 extent and type of environmental and social analysis, including the use of Environmental

         Critical to the World Bank’s mission is a well-functioning public sector that delivers quality public services consistent with citizen
         preferences and fosters private, market-led growth, while managing its fiscal resources in a prudent manner. Bank operations across
         sectors systematically incorporate governance and anticorruption measures into project design. The objective is to better manage
         corruption and fiduciary risks and ensure that development funds are used for their intended purposes. The World Bank’s Integrity Vice
         Presidency (INT) plays an important role in this respect.
         INT investigates allegations of fraud and corruption in World Bank–supported activities (external investigations), as well as allegations of
         significant fraud and corruption involving Bank staff and vendors (internal investigations). INT also pursues sanctions against firms and
         individuals who have engaged in sanctionable misconduct. The resulting debarments prevent these parties from participating in future
G4-DMA
         Bank-financed projects and serve as a deterrent to other potential wrongdoers.
         Within INT, the Integrity Compliance Office works closely with sanctioned entities to promote the adoption and implementation of corporate
         compliance standards consistent with the World Bank Group’s Integrity Compliance Guidelines. Sanctioned entities must satisfy certain
         compliance conditions in order to be released from sanction. At the end of this fiscal year, the Integrity Compliance Office was engaging
         with 40 entities regarding their efforts toward satisfaction of their compliance conditions. By combining investigations with an enhanced
         focus on compliance, detection of red flags, and building preventive measures in projects, INT promotes a proactive approach to managing
         fraud and corruption risks. It is vital to manage these risks in an efficient and effective manner as they can impact development resources,
         particularly in fragile contexts and high-risk sectors.


                                      In fiscal 2015, INT received 323 complaints about possible fraud and corruption in World
                                      Bank–financed projects, leading to 99 new investigations. Among those reporting

                                     Within INT, the Preventive Services Unit (PSU) worked with more than 200 Task Teams
                                     across the World Bank Group’s six regions. PSU assisted 94 Task Teams in building

         The World Bank has two ambitious goals: to eliminate extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. Poverty, as
         the Bank recognizes it, encompasses lack of opportunities (including capabilities), lack of voice and representation, and vulnerability to
         shocks.
         Grievance redress mechanisms (GRMs) are crucial for managing risk in the Bank ’s portfolio. GRMs create opportunities to resolve disputes
         before they escalate by offering a channel for citizens to express concerns, comments, and complaints. Beyond their benefits to citizens,
         GRMs can help the Bank and clients improve project outcomes, prioritize supervision, identify systemic issues, and promote accountability.

         The Bank promotes human rights principles through the projects it supports, for example, improving poor people’s access to health
         services, education, food, and water. Moreover, the Bank promotes the participation of project-affected people, including Indigenous
         Peoples, in decision making and participation; helps strengthen the accountability and transparency of governments to their citizens; and
         supports justice reform and fighting corruption. Although development projects are intended to bring about positive change, their
         implementation involves risks, and people or the environment can be adversely impacted. The Bank has policies to help avoid such
         unintended outcomes, but some problems may remain unrecognized or unaddressed. In such circumstances, citizens must speak out to
         bring attention to these problems. This can be done either through project-level Grievance Redress Mechanisms or the Bank’s corporate-

          The World Bank is a vital source of financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the world. We are not a bank in the
          ordinary sense, but a unique partnership to reduce poverty and support development. We support a wide array of investments in such
          areas as education, health, public administration, infrastructure, financial and private sector development, agriculture, and environmental
          and natural resource management. Bank stakeholders look to the institution, as a lending facility, to have policies and procedures in place
          that assess and screen environmental and social risks in its lending portfolio.

G4-DMA    In 2013, the World Bank adopted a new World Bank Group Strategy focused on aligning all of the institutions’ work with the twin goals of
          eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The two goals are now at the heart of the World Bank
          Group’s work. A newly developed World Bank Group Corporate Scorecard is monitoring implementation and aggregating the contributions
          of all the World Bank Group institutions.
          On a day-to-day basis, in close partnership with country government counterparts and their stakeholders, Bank staff members shape the
          role, financial products, and technical and advisory services to the unique development needs and capacities of each country client. Thus,
          interactions with clients, investees, and business partners regarding environmental and social risks and opportunities form the foundation of

      the Bank’s advisory and loan services. The Bank’s environmental and social safeguard policies are the cornerstones of the financial,
      technical, and advisory services; they are applied to prevent and mitigate impacts and risks to people and their environment in the
      development process. There are 10 safeguard policies: Environmental Assessment, natural habitats, forests, pest management, physical
      cultural resources, dam safety, Indigenous Peoples, involuntary resettlement, international waterways, and disputed areas. Without these
      safeguards, the positive effects of the development work can be severely diminished. These policies provide mandatory guidelines for Bank
      and borrower staffs in the identification, preparation, and implementation of investment programs and projects. The World Bank is currently
      in the process of reviewing, updating, and strengthening its environmental and social safeguards for the projects it finances. This review is
      currently in its third phase. For more information, see http://consultations.worldbank.org/consultation/review-and-update-world-bank-

                                 In general, a World Bank environmental and social specialist is assigned to each project
                                 with the potential to have environmental and social impact or risk in its design and
                                 planning stage. A sector manager who is responsible for a collection of projects, most
                                 often in sector and regional associations, oversees this process.
                                 As the project moves through design, the Bank works with the clients to understand the
                                 technical features of each project and, in partnership with borrowers, works to develop
                                 approaches for addressing these impacts as risks as required in the suite of World Bank
                                 safeguards policies. For category A and B projects, there is also involvement by the
                                 Regional Safeguard Advisor and his or her team or unit. Higher-risk projects must
                                 submit a series of “safeguard documents” to identify and explain how the borrower will
                                 undertake safeguard requirements. Several quality-control and review committees, such
                                 as the Regional Operational Committee (ROC), meet to agree on processes. Finally, the
                                 Board of Directors must approve all projects. Those approvals also require submission
                                 or summaries of any environmental assessment and social safeguards documents.
                                 Information is shared with all decision makers and stakeholders.
                                 These thresholds are based on environmental and social impact and risk defined in the
                                 safeguards policies and the Environmental Health and Safety Guidelines.

                              stakeholders can bring concerns forward and settle arising disputes. In addition,
                              stakeholders can bring concerns to the independent Inspection Panel, a permanent
                              body reporting to the Board of Executive Directors, to ensure accountability of the World

                              Most often, Bank environmental and social specialists work with the project Task Team
                              and borrowers to identify noncompliance issues and provide suggestions and
                              procedures for bringing projects into compliance. Remedies are also available as
                              needed.
                              During project supervision, both environmental and social specialists undertake project
                              site visits and consult with numerous stakeholders. When safeguard issues of concern
                              are encountered, the Bank engages in discussions with the borrower to arrive at
                              mutually agreed courses of action that are both time bound and identify responsible
                              parties. These actions are documented in the Aide Memoire and regularly in technical

         Two entities hold responsibilities for assessing and monitoring the Bank Group’s effectiveness:
         The Internal Audit Vice Presidency (IAD) has an independent and objective assurance advisory function designed to add value by
         assessing whether governance, risk management, and control processes of the Bank Group are effective in achieving the organization’s
         goals. IAD also provides advice to management in developing control solutions, and monitors the implementation of management actions
         to mitigate risks and strengthen controls.
G4-DMA
         The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) is responsible for appraising the WBG operations self-evaluation and development risk-
         management systems, and attesting to their adequacy to the Board of Executive Directors. To this end, IEG periodically reviews the
         relevance, effectiveness, and efficacy of key operational policies, such as the environmental and social safeguards framework for WBG
         lending. For more information, see IEG’s website: http://ieg.worldbank.org.

                                       management units, in the context of the broader expenditure review; and advising on
                                       the Bank Group’s adoption of cloud computing.
                                       IEG carried out a review of the World Bank safeguards policy framework in October
                                       2010. To read the report, see IEG’s website: http://ieg.worldbank.org.




         The World Bank values the diversity, health, safety, and security of its 12,000 full-time staff and 4,000 short-term consultants, who work in
         Washington, DC, and in 136 countries worldwide. The institution’s diverse workforce brings a wide range of perspectives to bear on
         poverty-reduction issues and emerging development challenges. It is critical to the effectiveness of the Bank’s core operational and
         knowledge services. Our staff diversity is a strategic business asset that directly contributes to achievement of our two goals: reducing
         extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.
         To that end, it is important that the Bank employs the right people in the right place with the right skills at the right time. To deliver on that
G4-DMA   commitment, HR Strategy has five critical components: (1) building a culture of performance and accountability, (2) driving a more effective
         organization, (3) fostering a more diverse and inclusive workforce, (4) creating career opportunities, and (5) ensuring HR excellence and
         business-driven delivery.
         As the Bank retools to increase its delivery and responsiveness to its clients, Human Resources has played a pivotal role in the transition of
         staff from the earlier structure to the new Global Practices. Looking forward, the Bank will continue to make aligning staffing and skills to
         the World Bank Group Strategy a priority.

                                     To recruit and retain highly qualified staff, the World Bank has developed a
                                     compensation and benefits system designed to be internationally competitive, to reward
                                     performance, and to take into account the special needs of a multinational and largely
         Ratios of standard entry    expatriate staff. The Executive Directors annually review the staff salary structure and, if
         level wage by gender        warranted, the salary structure is adjusted on the basis of a comparison with salaries
         compared to local           paid by private financial and industrial firms and by representative public sector
G4-EC5                                                                                                                                  Partial
         minimum wage at             agencies in the US market. The salary structure is reported according to job position for
         significant locations of    Washington, DC, staff, which comprises more than 60 percent of total staff. Salary

         Energy is a key input to the World Bank’s business operations. Through investor questionnaires, stakeholders have identified e nergy as an
         important aspect for the Bank’s business. The purchase and use of energy can have various impacts because of the extraction of materials
         from the earth’s crust and the production of persistent toxic emissions from the combustion of fuels. Combustion of fossil fu els can have
         severe health impacts on people. Moreover, the purchase and use of energy affects the expense-to-business revenue ratio. The World
G4-DMA   Bank manages its energy use carefully by tracking use in each owned facility on a monthly basis. Quarterly tracking of the Ba nk’s energy
         use is evaluated by the Director of General Services. This metric is part of the Corporate Real Estate manager’s performance objectives.
         Energy use is evaluated both as an absolute figure as well as on an intensity basis to determine progress.
         Data from Country Offices lag by one year; therefore, all fiscal 2014 data (including that from HQ) is presented in the 2015 GRI Index.

                                   The World Bank purchases natural gas, propane, and diesel fuel for combustion onsite.
                                   In fiscal 2014, total global fuel use was 92,793 gigajoules (GJ). The portion of this fuel
                                   consumption from renewable resources is not tracked, because data from fuel providers
                                   are not appropriately detailed.
                                   In fiscal 2014, global energy use decreased by 5 percent. Of the total global energy use
                                   of 519,589 GJ, the Bank used 420,951 GJ in electricity; 5,817 GJ in steam; 28 GJ in
                                   cooling; and 18,704 GJ in heating, including natural gas and propane. The remainder
                                   was from diesel and other fuel consumption for energy generation. The World Bank
                                   does not sell any electricity, heating, cooling, or steam.

                                      In fiscal 2014, the Bank reduced its energy consumption by 28,583 GJ.
                                      In the Bank’s main headquarters building, savings from the replacement of the legacy
                                      central chiller plant began to be realized, resulting in a reduction of energy consumption
                                      of 5,845 GJ in the building based on utility data. Further savings potential will be
                                      realized as the optimization program continues. In other Bank headquarters buildings,
                                      LED lamps replaced various fluorescent and halogen bulbs throughout the buildings,

         Addressing climate change is part of the World Bank’s core mission of helping countries end extreme p overty and boosting shared
         prosperity. Climate change threatens to erode development gains around the world—and its effects will be greatest on the poorest and
         most vulnerable countries, which are the World Bank’s clients.
G4-DMA   As a demonstration of its corporate commitment to addressing climate change, the Bank continues to deepen its efforts to measure,
         reduce, offset, and report its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with its global internal operations, including its facilities, key
         meetings, and corporate air travel. The Bank has measured the GHG emissions from its facilities in Washington, DC, since 2005 and
         globally since 2007. Emissions data are collected and emissions are calculated in accordance with the World Resources Institute and
         World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s GHG Protocol, with additional information on proxies, emissions factors, and the
                                                                                                                                                  48

                                      The World Bank measures direct GHG emissions for its internal operations based on
                                      site-specific data for facilities. Estimates are made for those facilities with missing data.
                                      In fiscal 2014, total gross direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions equaled 9,333 mtCO2e.
                                      For the World Bank’s US facilities, Scope 1 GHG emissions were 1,181 metric tons in
                                      fiscal 2014, compared to base-year (fiscal 2010) emissions of 1,615 mtCO2e. Scope 1
                                      GHG emissions from Country Office facilities and vehicles were estimated to be 8,152
          Direct greenhouse gas       mtCO2e in fiscal 2014, compared to base-year emissions of 4,228 mtCO2e in fiscal
G4-EN15   (GHG) emissions             2010. The increase in Country Office emissions was due to improved measurement                      Full

                                 major meetings that the Bank organizes. In fiscal 2012, the Bank began measuring
                                 GHG emissions from contractor-owned vehicles. In fiscal 2014, these emissions totaled
                                 around 101,667 mtCO2e, compared to base-year emissions of 115,545 mtCO2e in fiscal

                                 The World Bank measures GHG emissions intensity in two distinct categories. Scope 1
                                 and Scope 2 emissions are normalized per square meter, while Scope 3 emissions,
                                 mostly pertaining to employee air travel, are normalized per full-time (employee)
                                 equivalent (FTE).

                                 was still greater than the 2010 base-year emissions of 0.107 mtCO2e/sqm.
                                 Scope 3 emissions per FTE also decreased, from 9.5 in fiscal 2013 to 8.24
                                 emissions/FTE in fiscal 2014. Emissions/FTE are on a downward trend when compared
                                 with the emissions intensity of 9.9 mtCO2e/FTE in fiscal 2010, the base year.

                                      Estimated reduction in CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from Scope 2 activities totaled 500
                                      metric tons including the projects listed below. Reduction reporting is based on major
                                      initiatives taken in fiscal 2015 as related to achieving reductions from the fiscal 2010
                                      base year. Fiscal 2010 was chosen as the base year because it was the first year that
                                      confidence for data related to emissions from Country Offices was high.
                                      In fiscal 2015, savings continued to be realized from the optimization of the central
          Reduction of                chiller plant. The system was modified to provide the most efficient cooling to the facility,
G4-EN19   greenhouse gas (GHG)        while taking advantage of the demand-flow response system. These operational                        Full
          emissions                   changes resulted in additional savings of 133 metric tons of CO2e, based on utility bills.
                                      In the Bank’s Chennai, India, office, variable frequency drives were installed in the
                                      majority of the HVAC system, and LED fixtures were installed throughout the building,
                                      resulting in modeled savings of 282 metric tons of CO2e.
                                      Methodologies and assumptions for calculating reductions are based on initiative
                                      proposals for each reduction project.

          The World Bank views reducing effluent and waste production as a material aspect because of the potential negative environmental
          impacts, which include the release of persistent toxic chemicals through waste disposed of in landfills or by being incinerated. Bank
G4-DMA    stakeholders also consider reducing the Bank’s effluent and waste production important.
          The Bank has worked to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills through a combination of source reduction, reuse, and recycling.
          Minimizing the amount of material brought into Bank facilities is the first way it manages the amount of waste created. Avoiding

                                                                                                                                                  51
          unnecessary packaging for purchased items, including encouraging minimum purchase thresholds for office supplies, is one way the Bank
          accomplishes this. Another way is by mandating that large purchases from vendors, such as the Bank’s latest computer monitor purchase,
          be delivered in bulk instead of individually packaged. In fiscal 2015, the Bank continued to pursue efficiencies in the standardization of
          waste management in its headquarters facilities. The concentration in 2015 was on the waste being created in the cafeterias. Through work
          with the food services vendor, the Bank was able to standardize waste bins with labels, mount posters in the kitchens, and provide training
          to cafeteria staff. The Bank set a goal of 80 percent diversion of waste from landfills from the back-of-the-house cafeteria operations. In the
          most recent audit, conducted in summer 2015, the average diversion rate was 78 percent for all cafeterias, showing much progress from a
          baseline of 54 percent in fiscal 2014 and the potential to divert as much as 89 percent in fiscal 2016.
          There are no related adjustments to the management approach.


                                       The Bank has worked to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills through a
                                       combination of source reduction, reuse, and recycling. See the discussion about
                                       sustainable facilities for details. No hazardous waste is generated by the World Bank.
                                       Total nonhazardous waste produced by the Bank’s Washington, DC, offices in fiscal
                                       2015 was 1,959 metric tons, a slight increase from 1,913 metric tons in fiscal 2013. In
          Total weight of waste by     fiscal 2015, 858 tons of waste were sent to a landfill, whereas 930 tons of waste were
G4-EN23   type and disposal            recycled, which includes paper, bottles and cans, cardboard, toner cartridges, carpet                 Full
          method                       tiles, and electronics. In addition, 171 tons of food waste were composted in fiscal 2014.
                                       The information is provided by the waste-disposal contractor and the electronic- waste
                                       recycler, subcontracted through the Bank’s PC provider. Weights from roll-off
                                       compactors used for landfilled waste and recycling are exact weights to the closest one
                                       tenth of a ton. Proxies for estimating composting weight from trash cans are not
                                       available, but will be included in future reports.



          Reducing the Bank’s own corporate environmental impacts is in line with the Bank’s mission of reducing poverty, as environmental
          degradation affects the world’s poor disproportionately. For internal operations, this means engaging in responsible business practices that
G4-DMA    reduce negative environmental and social impacts while enhancing the wellbeing of staff, as well as the ecosystems, communities, and
          economies in which staff operate. The World Bank employs a small team of environmental specialists who work to mainstream
          sustainability throughout the organization.

                                    In addition, the Bank offsets its emissions in two different ways. It purchases Renewable
                                    Energy Certificates (RECs) in equal amounts (MWh) to the electricity it consumes
                                    globally. In addition, the Bank offsets other emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 3) through
                                    the purchase of Verified Emissions Reductions (VERs). In fiscal 2015, the Bank
                                    maintained carbon neutrality by the purchase of credits totaling nearly $200,000 from a
                                    portfolio of projects, including a Gold Standard efficient cook stove project and small-

                                    projects in India. An additional $325,000 was spent on emissions reduction efforts in
                                    country offices. Efforts in fiscal 2015 included upgrading lighting to LEDs in many
                                    buildings, installing solar panels on the Islamabad office, and using more variable
                                    frequency drives in the Chennai office to help efficiently manage HVAC demands.

                                    The World Bank is committed to providing benefits that respond to staff needs globally
                                    and are aligned with best practices. This includes life insurance, health care, disability
                                    and invalidity coverage, retirement provisions, parental leave, and opportunities for
                                    flexible work arrangements, as well as mobility, relocation, and resettlement benefits.
                                    These benefits vary with appointment type (whether open-ended or fixed-term staff or
                                    consultant) and whether the position is based at headquarters, in Washington, DC, or in
                                    a Country Office. The World Bank’s compensation and benefits policy is to provide a
                                    package to attract and retain diverse and highly talented staff while responding to
                                    external market situations and our shareholders. These policies are specified in the
                                    internal Staff Manual, which is available to all staff. The Board meets every year to
                                    review compensation and determines the overall group-wide pay increase.
                                    Benefits for staff on open-ended, fixed-term, and extended-term-consulting contracts

         operation                         provide medical, dental, vision, and pharmacy benefits. The plans cover the staff
                                           member, one spouse or domestic partner, and dependent children or step-
                                           children under the age of 26. The staff member pays 25 percent of the premium
                                           costs, and the Bank pays 75 percent. Staff leaving the organization may elect to
                                           receive continuation of their medical, dental, vision, and pharmacy coverage for
                                           up to 36 months at their own cost.
                                          Staff who are on sick leave for more than 20 consecutive days can apply for
                                           short-term disability, which pays 70 percent of salary for up to 24 months. If a
                                           staff member remains disabled beyond the 24-month period, long-term disability

                                           staff will increase from age 62 to age 67. The normal retirement age for staff on
                                           board at that time will remain 62, and it will increase for future staff to age 65.

                                            The Bank offers a variety of options to help staff save and plan for retirement.
                                            Effective January 1, 2015, the Staff Retirement Net Plan (SRP) has two
                                            components: (1) Defined Benefit Component, which is Bank-funded and based
                                            on 1 percent of the highest average of three years net annual salary for each
                                            year of plan participation, not to exceed 35 years. (2) Cash Balance Component,
                                            wherein the Bank contributes 10 percent of net annual salary, and the staff
                                            member contributes a mandatory 5 percent of net annual salary and can
                                            voluntary increase contributions to as high as 11 percent of net annual salary. In
                                            addition to the SRP, Washington-based staff can voluntary participate in a 401(k)
                                            plan. Effective January 1, 2015, Country Office staff can elect to participate in
                                            the Country Office Savings Plan.
                                           Staff receive between 26 and 30 days of paid annual leave, depending on the
                                            length of service, and 15 days of sick leave per year, as well as paid leave for
                                            various specific circumstances such as adoption and paternity/maternity leave
                                            (10 days and 70 days, respectively).
                                           There are also services to support staff and their families, such as the
                                            opportunity for flexible working arrangements and the World Bank Family
                                            Network (WBFN), which provides assistance to staff, spouses, and domestic
                                            partners.
                                    The Bank’s benefits package also includes global mobility benefits, relocation, and
                                    resettlement policies.

                                    not eligible for leave, life insurance, or pension benefits. However, short-term
                                    consultants and short-term temporaries are covered under Worker’s Compensation, and
                                    have accidental death and dismemberment insurance of three times’ net annual salary
                                    while on official Bank business travel. They are also eligible for limited medical expense
                                    coverage while on official Bank business for emergency medical care.

         The aim of the Bank’s investment in staff learning is to ensure that learning is a strategic tool for the organization, so that staff members
         have the cutting-edge knowledge and skills to carry out the Bank’s mission. In April 2010, Bank senior management endorsed the Staff
         Learning Strategy, which outlines three complementary and mutually reinforcing pillars: Corporate Core Curriculum (includes onboarding
G4-DMA   of new staff, operational learning, and management and leadership development), Professional and Technical Learning, and Unit and
         Individual Learning (such as languages for business purposes, mentoring, and behavioral skills.). Cross-cutting principles underpinning
         the Learning Strategy are ensuring geographically neutral access to learning, more on-the-job learning and less formal classroom
         learning, common quality-assurance processes, and linkage with competencies. The Bank offers a broad range of learning resources via
         online and face-to-face sessions through its internal learning program. Funding support for external training or education is made possible
         based on annual discussions between staff and managers about individual yearly learning plans.

         World Bank staff are located in offices in 127 countries and work in core finance, administrative, legal, economics, and technical
         specializations in more than 20 sectors. Staff contribute an impressive breadth and depth of professional expertise, academic background,
         industry, and international experience. The World Bank recognizes that meeting the demands and needs of its diverse client base more
         effectively means the Bank must consider a range of ideas and perspectives to find the best solution to development challenges. Achieving
         shared prosperity in a sustainable way is, by definition, about equal opportunity, empowerment, and economic and social inclusion.
         The Articles of Agreement for IBRD and IDA emphasize the need to “pay due regard to the importance of recruiting personnel on as wide a
         geographical basis as possible” when appointing Bank officers and staff, “subject to the paramount importance of securing the highest
         standards of efficiency and of technical competence.” This directive was reiterated in the 1983 Principles of Staff Employment, approved by
         the Executive Directors, to set forth the broad policies according to which the President shall manage staff. In addition, the principles direct
         the Bank to “encourage diversity in staffing consistent with the nature and objectives of the Organizations.”
G4-DMA   In addition to reflecting the World Bank’s global nature, the importance of staff diversity in enhancing the effectiveness an d credibility of the
         Bank’s institutions has been underscored by ongoing reforms to increase the voice and participation of emerging markets and developing
         countries at the Bank. It is incumbent upon the Bank to consider how to organize and manage people internally as it works with our
         partners to help countries achieve gender equality as a pathway to ensuring lasting poverty reduction and shared prosperity. The World
         Bank mission statement describes the work environment the Bank strives to maintain: “an excellent institution able to attract, excite, and
         nurture diverse and committed staff with exceptional skills, who know how to listen and learn,” underpinned by the core values of working
         together in teams, with openness and trust, empowering others, and respecting differences.
         Consistently in staff surveys, a large majority of staff agree that they work in a climate in which diverse perspectives are valued, where we
         treat each other with dignity and respect, and where colleagues are treated fairly regardless of gender, age, race/ethnicity, national origin,
         native language, religion, disability, and sexual orientation. Staff are drawn to and energized by the Bank’s dynamic multicultural
         environment, making diversity and inclusion a key element of its employment value proposition.

          The Bank considers the diversity of its staff a strategic business asset. Due to its immunities from most national courts, the Bank Group
          provides staff with comprehensive Internal Justice Services to resolve and provide redress of staff's issues and grievances using informal
          and formal mechanisms. These services increase the level of collaboration among staff, provide spaces for the effective management of
          conflicts, and increase the Bank’s capacity to build and retain a globally representative workforce that has a voice and is valued by the
          organization.
          Most staff's concerns are handled by one of the informal services of Internal Justice: Respectful Workplace Advisors, Ombuds Services,
G4-DMA    and Mediation Services. Use of these mechanisms is voluntary, and staff also have direct access to the system’s formal grievance
          mechanisms of Peer Review Services (PRS), the Business Ethics and Conduct (EBC) Vice Presidency, and the Integrity (INT) Vice
          Presidency. EBC investigates allegations of staff misconduct, and INT investigates allegations of fraud and corruption committed by
          individuals and companies involved in Bank-supported projects, as well as allegations against internal staff. PRS considers whether the
          World Bank Group’s actions are consistent with the staff member’s contract of employment and/or terms of appointment, including the
          pertinent Bank Group rules and policies. If these internal grievance mechanisms are exhausted, staff can access the World Bank
          Administrative Tribunal (WBAT), which is the independent judicial forum of last resort for the resolution of cases submitted by staff alleging
          non-observance of their contracts of employment or terms of appointment. WBAT’s decisions are final and binding.


                                       In fiscal 2015, there was an increase in staff using Internal Justice Services, mostly
                                       informal services provided by the Respectful Workplace Advisors, Ombuds, and
                                       Mediation. The combined caseload of these services grew to 1,617 cases in fiscal 2015,
                                       an 18 percent increase over fiscal 2014. Peer Review cases also grew from 50 to 54,
          Number of grievances         and the WBAT caseload increased from 20 to 28. A concerted outreach effort to staff in

                                       opened during fiscal 2015 were closed in the same fiscal year. Seventeen PRS cases
                                       filed in fiscal 2014 that were resolved in fiscal 2015 for PRS, as were 44 for EBC, 11 for

         such as race, color, gender, language, physical ability, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, or sexual orientation.” The
         Code of Conduct stipulates that each individual has a role to play in preventing discrimination in the workplace.
         The World Bank Group Office of Ethics and Business Conduct (EBC) promotes high ethical standards by staff members in the performance
G4-DMA   of their duties. It ensures staff understand their ethical obligations to the World Bank as embodied in its core values and the terms under
         which they operate. The office is accessible to all staff members and their families.
