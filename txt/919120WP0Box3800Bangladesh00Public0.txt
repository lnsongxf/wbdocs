THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bot tom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

                   Bangladesh made getting electricity more
                   difficult by imposing a moratorium on new
                   electricity connections from April 2010 to
DB2012             March 2011 because of an electricity supply
                   shortage. This moratorium has led to long
                   delays for customers and has increased the

  The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is
defined as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall distribution for all years included in the analysis. It is calculated and adjusted on a
yearly basis. The threshold is not based on any economic theory of an “optimal tax rate” that minimizes distortions or maximizes efficiency in the tax
system of an economy overall. Instead, it is mainly empirical in nature, set at the lower end of the distribution of tax rates levied on medium-size
enterprises in the manufacturing sector as observed through the paying taxes indicators. This reduces the bias in the indicators toward economies
that do not need to levy significant taxes on companies like the Doing Business standardized case study company because they raise public revenue
in other ways—for example, through taxes on foreign companies, through taxes on sectors other than manufacturing or from natural resources (all
of which are outside the scope of the methodology). This year’s threshold is 26.1%.

Doing Business measures the efficiency of the judicial
system in resolving a commercial dispute before             Time to file and serve the case
local courts. Following the step-by-step evolution of       Time for trial and obtaining judgment
a standardized case study, it collects data relating to

a commercial lawsuit. The ranking on the ease of          Cost required to complete procedures (% of

The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a
sales contract between 2 domestic businesses. The           Enforcement costs
case study assumes that the court hears an expert on
the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes
the case from simple debt enforcement. To make the
data comparable across economies, Doing Business
uses several assumptions about the case:
       The seller and buyer are located in the
        economy’s largest business city. For the 11
        economies with a population of more than               The seller requests a pretrial attachment to

Social protection schemes and benefits & Labor disputes

Doing Business collects data on the existence of unemployment protection schemes as well as data on whether
employers are legally required to provide health insurance for employees with permanent contracts.


Doing Business also assesses the mechanisms available to resolve labor disputes. More specifically, it collects data
on what courts would be competent to hear labor disputes and whether the competent court is specialized in
resolving labor disputes.
