THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
                                                               Region: Latin America & Caribbean

from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 109,371

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

       Search and reserve company name

       Pre-approval of a company name is obtained by filing a request for
       name search and reservation (form 26) with the Commerce and
       Intellectual Property Office (CIPO) in advance of the related application.
       To avoid unnecessary delays, statutory instructions for form completion
       are distributed at CIPO. A fee of XCD 25 is payable to CIPO. Form 26
       makes provision for the choice of 3 alternative names.

       On receipt of a request for name reservation, CIPO will conduct a
   1   comparative search of registered business and corporate names and             1 day             XCD 25
       will consider the overall suitability of the proposed having regard to the
       prescribed restrictions. Where a name is approved, it will be reserved
       for a period of 90 days from approval. It’s recommended that all
       applicants use the name reservation procedures to avoid the
       inconvenience of having to prepare a new set of forms should the first
       chosen name be declined.

        Obtain building permit from the Physical Planning Unit

        To obtain a building permit, BuildCo must first obtain an
        application form and a set of conditions and guidelines for
        building. BuildCo must then submit the application, along with
        the building plans and a location map.                                   40 days               XCD 300

        Upon receiving the application and building plans, the Physical
        Planning Unit (PPU) advertises the proposed plans in the local
        newspaper for a minimum of 2 weeks to officially notify the area
        residents of the proposed commercial construction. If no
        complaints are raised and the file is complete, the PPU grants

      Though inspections are required by law, they are rarely enforced
      in practice because manpower and resources are limited. There
      are two conditions under which an inspection would certainly
      take place:
      • If there is a complaint or the Physical Planning Unit (PPU)

        Obtain inspection certificate for internal wiring

        Before applying for an electricity connection, the customer should obtain
        an internal wiring Inspection Certificate signed by the Government
        Electrical Inspector (GEI). The customer's licensed electrician (the licenses
        are issued by GEI) is in charge of the internal wiring, and the GEI has to
        inspect the internal wiring. The request for the inspection can be filed as
        soon as the internal wiring is done. The construction company should fill 14 calendar days                XCD 85

        out a form and submit it at the GEI. After the GEI estimates the cost, the
        applicant has to pay the fee at the treasury. The treasury gives the
        applicant a receipt. With the receipt the applicant goes back to the GEI
        to schedule an inspection.

        After the application is submitted the external inspection is carried out
        by St. Vincent Electricity Services Ltd (VINLEC) to check whether the it is
        possible to add the requested load. The planning department of VINLEC
        inspects the site and specifies what is required of VINLEC to meet the
        additional load. There is no need for presence of someone from the
        applicant's party. After the inspection the customer signs a connection
        offer. To reduce the delay time the applicant can submit the Written
        statement of the required peak electricity demand before the
        engagement of the electrician to wire the premises, so that both the load

        Once the connection offer is signed VINLEC carries out the external
        connection works. The customer is required to pay the security deposit.
        The deposit is equivalent to the value of two months’ estimated
        electricity consumption. The deposit is expected to provide security for
        the payment of electricity account debts and it may be revised from time
        to time. Deposits bear interest at 4% per annum. Deposits and earned
        interest are refunded to customers after their supply is permanently
        disconnected and all outstanding bills are paid. Given the assumptions

        kVA transformers. 3. Three (3) 15 kVA transformers will be recovered.
        The cost of the transformers is recovered by the utility; the value is
        reflected in the reduction to the customer.
        The customer has to wait for the completion of the connection works
        and the meter installation, thereafter electricity starts flowing.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       Search root of title at the Land Registry

       It is common practice for the lawyer or lawyer’s clerk to search the Index
       of Deeds at the Lands Registry for the root of title. This can take a long
       time if the title is not properly indexed- i.e. names of individuals not
       recorded accurately or omitted. If the indexing is not up-to-date, it may
       be necessary to search individual deeds for the relevant timeframe. Also,
       the indexing is done by hand and the quality of paper is diminishing,
       making the durability of the records more susceptible to wear and tear.                         EC$2 per day +

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
