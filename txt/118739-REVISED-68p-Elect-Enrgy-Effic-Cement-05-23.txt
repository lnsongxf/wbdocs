This report and an accompanying report on alternative fuels provide a summary of international best practice
experience in the cement sector and focus on specific technical measures that could be implemented by cement plants

FOREWORD



Cement is paramount for economic development and poverty reduction in emerging markets. Along with aggregates
and water, cement is the key ingredient in the production of concrete, and, as such, is an essential construction material
that enables large infrastructure projects in energy, water, and transport, as well as, importantly, the construction of
modern buildings and urban infrastructure. Given the rapid urbanization rates in developing countries, cement is
crucial for delivering on the climate-smart cities agenda. Emerging markets have been rapidly increasing their cement
use and now account for over 90 percent of cement consumption worldwide (4.1 billion tons in 2016).

Cement accounts for at least 5 percent of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, and, according to some
estimates, this share may be even higher. At the same time, energy-related expenses in the cement sector, mostly
on fossil fuels and electricity, account for 30 to 40 percent of the industry’s cash costs. While current energy
prices are still recovering from the global financial and economic crises, there is no doubt that they will continue
to increase in the long run. In recent years, the cement industry has been successful in reducing its operating costs and
improving its carbon footprint (emissions per unit of output) by improving energy efficiency, increasing the use
of alternative fuels, and deploying renewable energy sources.

With a cumulative investment portfolio in cement of over $4.2 billion, IFC has accumulated a vast experience in the
industry, including in sustainable energy projects. To share its knowledge with external stakeholders and to promote
sustainable practices in the sector, IFC commissioned two studies on international best practice in the cement sector,
covering thermal and electric energy efficiency, and alternative fuels. These studies were developed as part of the Brazil
Low Carbon Technology Roadmap led by the National Cement Industry Association of Brazil (SNIC), the Brazilian
Association of Portland Cement (ABCP), the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Cement Sustainability Initiative
(CSI) of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), and IFC.

This report, and an accompanying report on alternative fuels, provide a summary of international best practice
experience in the cement sector and focus on specific technical measures that could be implemented by cement plants
to reduce their operating costs and improve their carbon footprints. The reports provide a plethora of practical
information from implemented projects and include detailed technical descriptions, capital and operating costs, and
case studies and references from locations where the measures have been implemented. A combination of general and
in-depth information will make these reports a helpful read to both management and technical and operating personnel
of cement plants as well as to a larger range of stakeholders.

high-pressure roller press as a pre-grinding step for ball mills.


In high-pressure roller press comminution, the feed material
is exposed to very high pressure for a short time. The high
pressure causes the formation of microcracks in the feed
particles and generates a substantial amount of fine material.
If the pressed material is fed directly to a ball mill, the power
consumption required to produce finished cement will be
much lower than that of a mill fed with unpressed material.
This makes it possible to increase the throughput of a given
size ball mill and to reduce the specific power consumption
of the whole mill system.


Here, two process configurations are possible. In the
pre-grinding system, the roller press is used for grinding

These properties create a mismatch between the current
lending practices of local financial institutions and the
needs of energy efficiency projects, making energy efficiency
lending discouragingly difficult. Local banks typically:


 •	 Provide asset-based lending limited to 70 percent to
   80 percent of asset value (energy efficiency project
   value = savings).

 •	 Do not believe or acknowledge that cash flow from
   energy efficiency projects = increased host credit capacity.

 •	 Are not familiar with unique “intricacies” of energy
   efficiency projects.

 •	 Do not have internal energy efficiency finance capacity
   to properly evaluate the risks/benefits of energy
   efficiency projects.

 •	 Lack experience to properly evaluate the risks/benefits of
   energy efficiency projects.

 •	 Are unwilling to invest in building energy efficiency
   finance capacity due to the relatively small monetary size

To address these barriers, various business models were

In a guaranteed savings energy performance contract, the
client essentially applies for a loan, finances the project,
and makes periodic debt service payments to a financial
institution. The ESCO bears no direct contractual obligation
to repay the lender; only the energy end-user assumes this
obligation. The ESCO’s guarantee is not a guarantee of
payment to the lender, but rather a guarantee of savings
