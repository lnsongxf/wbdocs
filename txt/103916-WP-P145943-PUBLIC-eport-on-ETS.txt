Executive Summary

At the request of the Government of Romania, the World Bank launched a two-year Reimbursable
Advisory Services (RAS) Program on climate change and low-carbon green growth in July 2013.
Component D of the RAS Program will target supporting Government institutions in implementing,
monitoring, and evaluating climate change actions and sharing their experiences. A first deliverable
will focus on prioritization criteria for mitigation opportunities in Romania that could be financed from
revenues obtained from the auctioning of EU Allowances during the period 2013 – 2020 as well as
other sources of financing. In this context, the present report provides a background overview and
analysis on the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), as well as on the participation and compliance
of Romanian EU ETS installations.
Since its inception in 2005, the EU ETS has imposed a cap on GHG emissions from energy-intensive
industries, power plants and, since 2012, from commercial aviation in Europe. Aiming to achieving the
general European mitigation targets, such a cap is materialized through a corresponding quantity of
allowances distributed to targeted emitters—one allowance covering one ton of GHG emissions. The
tradability of allowances gives emitters the opportunity to adjust their emission levels based on the
market price for allowances, minimizing the overall compliance cost.
A number of achievements can be attributed to the EU ETS. First, it has introduced a common, reliable
and efficient European price for carbon emissions, based on clear market drivers—the regulatory
framework, climate and economic conditions, relative fuel prices, and emissions abatement
possibilities. Despite the economic downturn and the resulting drop in economic output levels, it has
brought about additional emissions reductions without a detectable effect on EU competitiveness or
carbon leakage. The EU ETS has supported innovation, and low-carbon investment in particular,
through dedicated provisions in favor of CCS and innovative renewable energy technologies. The EU
ETS has also enabled the European Union and its Member States to leverage new funding for
international and national climate-friendly actions and policies. Finally, as the first large-scale ETS in
the world, it has generated a number of lessons and experience for both EU and other juridictions.
This report presents some figures exploring the way Romanian installations have been operating under
the EU ETS. In 2013, 201 installations and operators were included in Romania’s EU ETS. Among them,
185 actually emitted GHG emissions, the majority (58%) pertain to the fuel combustion sector. The
Romanian installations are bigger, in terms of emissions, than the European average. While free
allocation was considerably reduced between phase 1 and phase 3 (-46%), the surplus in allowances
reached 113 MtCO2e in 2013.
As the result of acquired experience, the EU evolved key features of the EU ETS over time, in particular
when entering the third phase of the scheme in 2013, a time when auctioning became the main rule
for allocating allowances. In Romania, the combustion sector remains the most affected. However, the
transitional free allocation provision diminished the combustion sector’s deficit in allowances by 66%
in 2013.
At the European level, work is already advanced in the preparation of phase 4 (2021-2030). Main
challenges include the revision of the free allocation process, which is expected to be more restrictive
in terms of both sector coverage and individual entitlements. Also, the implementation of the Market
Stability Reserve in 2018-2019 will be closely examined, as this measure is expected to modify the
market equilibrium for allowances, thus auctioning revenues for Member States. The review of the EU

                                                    7
ETS ambition, included in the 2030 legislative proposal published by the Commission on 15 July 2015,
will also impact price expectations as it highlights an accelerated decrease in the allocation, in
coherence with the European target of reducing GHG emissions by 40% by 2030.
The auctioning regulatory framework is composed of Directive 2009/29/EC (Article 10) and the revised
Auctioning Regulation, which leaves little room for Member States to maneuver in the management
of the allowances they have to auction. The chosen methodology is a sealed-bid, one-round, uniform
price auction. Adjustments to the auction calendar, once published for a given year, are severely
restricted by article 14 of auctioning regulations. Member States have the last word regarding the use
of revenues from their auctioned allowances. Nevertheless, Directive 2009/29/EC stipulates that at
least 50% of the revenues generated from allowances auctioning—100% for allowances auctioned for
intra-European redistributional purposes—should be used to fund mitigation and adaptation actions
through fiscal or financial support policies in the EU or in developing countries.
Romania is entitled to auction 324 million EU allowances over the period 2013-20. Revenue estimates
will depend on the future market price. Because large uncertainties remain related to the legislative
framework, as well as the evolution of the supply and demand equilibrium on the market, price
forecasts over the long term should be viewed cautiously, keeping in mind that they reflect simplified
socio-economic hypotheses. The MSR is expected to significantly increase the carbon price when
implemented, with estimates of the prices for carbon in 2030 ranging from 30€ to more than 80€ per
allowance. On average, the value of 50 to 60€ can be retained—for 2020, estimates are below 10€,
even if in practice the price difference between phase 3 and 4 will be lessened by the financing of
market participants. It means potential revenues for Romania could amount to around 4 bn€ per year
by 2030.
Some experience in the use of auctioning revenues is already available in other Member States. The
report presents a review of policies and measures showing that Member States have to consider a
number of parameters in their use of auction revenues. One in particular is that policies funded by
auction revenues face a quantitative risk linked to the difficulty in foreseeing the actual amount of
money raised, instead of pledges for an ex-post earmarking.
In 2013, off the 2,712 M€ aimed at financing climate and energy related policies, and for which the
split between domestic and international actions was declared, more than 80% was dedicated to
domestic policies. This shows that recycling of auctioning revenues can be a decisive instrument for
financing climate-friendly actions in Europe, in coherence with EU long-term objectives and Member
States national strategy and priorities.

    1. Introduction

At the request of the Government of Romania (through its Ministry of Environment and Climate
Change and Ministry of European Funds), a two-year Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) Program
on climate change and low-carbon green growth was launched by the World Bank in July 2013. The
RAS project focuses on operationalizing Romania’s national climate change strategy and action plan,
identifying and integrating climate-related actions in new operational programs, building a solid
analytical base for impact assessments and climate-related decision making, and enhancing climate-
friendly practices and monitoring systems.
Component D aims at supporting the Government institutions in implementing, monitoring, and
evaluating climate change actions and sharing their experiences. A first deliverable is to focus on
prioritization criteria for mitigation opportunities in Romania that could be financed from revenues
obtained from the auctioning of EU Allowances in the period 2013 – 2020 and other sources of
financing.
In this context, the present report provides a background overview and analysis on EU Emissions
Trading System (EU ETS) in general, as well as on the participation and compliance of Romanian EU ETS
installations.


    2. Overview of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)

Emissions Trading Systems (ETSs) are tradable environmental rights schemes in which public
authorities seek to regulate the use of environmental goods – fresh water, fish stocks, air… - thanks
to market mechanisms. A number of ETSs have been implemented to curb air pollution, in particular
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, in order to mitigate climate change.
While the theoretical framework for ETSs was initiated in the 1960s, one of the first effectively
implemented systems was launched in the US in the 1990s to limit industrial SO2 emissions causing
acid rains. Another major milestone was the implementation of an ETS to regulate GHG emissions from
industrialized countries between 2008 and 2012 under the Kyoto protocol framework, signed in
December 1997.
Worldwide, the largest system to date, in terms of both emissions covered and number of countries
involved, nevertheless remains the EU ETS1. In total, the EU ETS covers more than 11,000 combustion
and industrial installations as well as 4,000 airline operators, responsible together for 45% of EU GHG
emissions.


    2.1.    Reducing European emissions at the lowest cost
The EU ETS works as a cap-and-trade scheme in which European authorities set the overall emissions
“cap” that should not be exceeded by energy-intensive industries, power plants and commercial
aviation in Europe. Such a cap translates the general European mitigation targets for a given period.

                                                     9
To do so, a limited quantity of permits – corresponding to the « cap » - is distributed to the targeted
GHG emitters, the incumbents.

                                      Box 1 – The EU ETS in a nutshell

The EU ETS aims at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on the EU territory in a cost-efficient
manner. It sets a ceiling on 45% of EU GHG emissions, through the downstream cap imposed on the
+11,000 highest emitting power plants and industrial installations on the European territory - now the
28 EU member states plus 3 countries of the European Economic Area (EEA). It also limits CO2 emissions
from commercial flights departing and arriving in the EEA, with specific provisions.
The EU ETS has now been in operations for 10 years. The current period (2013-20) saw significant
changes with:
      - A European-level emissions cap setting, in line with Europe’s 2020 GHG emissions targets;
      - The inclusion of additional sectors and gases;
      - The harmonization of the allocation process, auctioning becoming the default allocation mode
and the remaining free allocation being based on benchmarking;
      - Fewer international credits allowed for compliance until international negotiations lead to a
binding emissions reduction agreement; cost containment is achieved mainly through flexibility
provisions and the allocation of free allowances to trade-exposed sectors.
       - The increasing role of the European Commission in the EU ETS regulation and market
surveillance.
Among the main lessons that can be drawn, the first is that the EU ETS has been actually working and
providing a reliable and efficient price for GHG emissions, by reflecting the evolution of supply and
demand for allowances. It has reduced emissions, in the order 460-580 million tCO2 from 2005 to 2009;
since 2009 and the economic downturn, its impact might have been lower, including by other energy
policies, but there is no consensus on the matter.
The emissions reductions have not impacted short-term European competitiveness on international
markets, through the combination of the lower-than-expected carbon price, some flexibility features
(banking, borrowing, use of international offsets), pass-through on to consumers and free allocation
to exposed industries.
The EU ETS is also believed to favor innovation and low-carbon investment in Europe, while beyond
anecdotal evidence is hard to gather at this stage. It nevertheless provides very concrete incentives to
develop carbon capture and storage, and renewable technologies, and has contributed to leveraging
funds for climate action both at the international –through CDM/JI imports- and European levels –
through the recycling of phase 3 auctions revenues.
Those lessons helped to improve the phase 3 regulatory framework and also contributed to the design
of other ETSs under development worldwide.

Once distributed, those electronic permits, known as European Union Allowances (EUAs)2, can be
transacted freely – the « trading » side - by incumbents as well as any other participant allowed

2
  Commercial aviation is allocated European Union Aviation Allowances (EUAAs), which cannot be used by
industrial and power installations.

(financial intermediaries, citizens, NGOs…). Demand is driven by the obligation incumbents have to
surrender to public authorities, for each compliance period, as many allowances as their emissions,
one allowance corresponding to one ton of greenhouse gas expressed in CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) (see
Figure 1).
Incumbents may also offset a limited share of their emissions by buying emissions credits from the
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) or the Joint Implementation (JI) mechanism.

                                                                greenhouse gases (GHGs). Abatement costs are
                                                                lower for Entity B than for Entity A.

                                                                A regulator wishes to cap their emissions to a
                                                                given level, symbolized by the grey line.

                                                                A permit market allows entity A to buy permits
                                                                from entity B, a solution that is economically
                                                                efficient.

Trading allowances results in the emergence of a market price that allows incumbents to arbitrate on
the cheapest option given their individual situations, assuming perfect rationality:
   If emissions reduction costs are higher than the market price, incumbents would buy allowances
    or credits rather than reducing their emissions, if they foresee they will miss some to ensure their
    compliance, or if they anticipate an increase in the carbon price over time;
   If emissions reduction costs are lower than the market price, incumbents would engage into
    operational changes and/or low carbon investments (e.g. shifting to less carbon-intensive energy
    sources, optimizing the existing technologies, investing in more efficient technology). They would
    either keep the spared allowances or sell them on the market, depending on their expectations
    regarding the evolution of the market price and their future compliance needs.
Accurate and reliable market information is essential to ensure the abatement options with the
lowest costs are undertaken. The overall compliance cost is minimized for each incumbent, meaning
the environmental target (reducing emissions to the set cap) is achieved cost-effectively.
The “market” for allowances or credits is the set of all transactions, which occur either bilaterally,
through professional brokers (over-the-counter -OTC- trading) or through organized exchanges, which
make public the prices and amounts of allowances traded. Traded products include spot contracts with
immediate delivery, futures/forward contracts in which the delivery is delayed by several days, months
or years, and derived contracts.

       2.2.     Key design features and their evolution since 2005
The EU ETS was proposed in 2001 by the European Commission to help EU countries meet their
national commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. It has been endorsed as the central tool of the EU
climate policy since its inception on January 1st, 2005.
Its original design provided for two periods: a trial phase (2005-07) to enable stakeholders to gain
experience with emissions trading 3 , and a second phase (2008-12) corresponding to the first

    2.3.    Major achievements

2.3.1 Providing a reliable and efficient price for carbon emissions
The first achievement of the EU ETS has been to create the conditions for the emergence of a reliable,
single price for GHG emissions. The carbon price has been reflecting the expectations of market
players regarding the allowances supply and demand equilibrium.
a) The institutional and regulatory framework governs supply: the cap fixed to incumbents,
compliance requisites (e.g. the types of CDM/JI credits allowed), implications of international
negotiations, etc. Future evolutions are also under scrutiny because of the banking provision, which
makes decreasing caps an incentive to save allowances already today. Because the EU ETS is a pure
regulatory market, the institutional framework plays a key role in driving the carbon price.
b) Allowance demand corresponds to the incumbents’ needs to cover their emissions. It is also
driven by clearly identified market fundamentals:

   Climate conditions impact power and heat demand and production: higher or lower than normal
    temperatures modify heating and air-conditioning demand; rainfall impacts CO2-free hydropower
    production. For instance, mild and wet climate conditions in winter 2006 and summer 2007 led to
    lower electricity consumption and CO2 emissions.
   Economic activity increases energy demand and industrial production, leading to higher GHG
    emissions. On the contrary, the 2009-10 economic downturn in Europe led to a drop in industrial
    emissions.
   Relative fuel prices influence the merit order of power plants and may favor higher CO2-emitting
    fuels: calling a natural gas-fired power plant instead of a coal-fired power plant, for example, saves
    approximately 1.7 tCO2 per ton of oil equivalent. The low cost of coal observed in Europe, since
    mid-2011 in particular, has led to increased emissions.

   Emissions abatement: short-term (e.g. switching to less carbon-intensive fuels or increasing
    energy efficiency) as well as longer-term abatement (investments in low-carbon technologies or
    capacities) lead to decreased emissions (see

It should be noted that the carbon price is still significant despite the current surplus in allowances
observed on the market (see section 2.4.2). Indeed, cap-and-trade systems can only be in a surplus
situation, as the emissions cap cannot be excessed. The carbon price thus reflects the long-term
constraint imposed through the EU ETS cap, thanks to the possibility of banking allowances from one
period to the following one.

2.3.2 Reduced EU emissions
Installations integrate the cost of emissions allowances in their production costs, being them “short”
(i.e. having received less allowances than their actual emissions) or “long” (i.e. having received more
allowances than their compliance needs). The EU ETS carbon price affects operational choices of
existing installations as well as investment decisions for new and existing installations.
The EU ETS contributed to reducing EU emissions, despite over-allocation in some sectors and
Member States in the first period, and consequences of the 2009 economic downturn.
   The pre-downturn period showed attributable emission savings of between 40 and 80 MtCO2/yr
    on average, about 2-4% of capped emissions, which constitutes a strong impact for an individual
    energy-environmental policy instrument. For example, Ellerman et al. (2010) estimated
    abatements due to the EU ETS from 2005 through 2007 in the range of 120 to 300 MtCO2, i.e. 2 to
    5% below the business-as-usual scenario. In the first 2 years of the second period, additional



                                                     17
    reductions were estimated at approximately 340 MtCO2e, i.e. 8% below projected business-as-
    usual emissions.

   From 2009 on, fewer studies are available and no consensual effect of the EU ETS on emissions
    reduction can be drawn. For instance, Egenhofer et al. (2011) estimate emission-intensity
    improvements attributable to the EU ETS at 3.35% per year. Another study by New Carbon Finance
    (2009) shows that 40% of the 3% fall in 2008 emissions compared to 2007 can be attributed to EU
    ETS abatement. Finally, Gloaguen and Alberola (2013) find a 0-10% effect of carbon pricing on
    emissions reductions, due to interactions with energy policies and the economic downturn4.
It should be noted that despite the current issue of allowances surplus, prospects for long-term
ambitious targets and potential structural reforms of the EU ETS have maintained an incentive to
reduce emissions, even if at a reduced pace (see section 2.4.2).

2.3.3 No effect has been detected on EU competitiveness and carbon leakage
With the EU ETS, emitters in Europe have to take into account an additional cost for carbon emissions
in their production function. Because most industrial sectors (and even some power producers at the
European borders) and commercial aviation compete with installations and companies not covered by
similar carbon costs, two risks have been put forward:
   On the short term, a relative loss of competitiveness for EU industries on international markets,
    leading to reduced EU economic outputs;
   On the medium and long terms, the delocalization or relocalization of emitting activities outside
    the EU ETS geographical scope.
The resulting potential carbon leakage decreases the environmental efficiency of the EU ETS as
emissions are artificially reduced in Europe while increased elsewhere; it also threatens the
economic efficiency of the system by reducing the economic activities.
Nevertheless, as reported by Vivid Economics & Ecofys (2014), no consensus emerges on carbon
leakage estimates. Empirical studies, based on ex-post evaluation, conclude that no substantial carbon
leakage is provoked by the implementation of the EU carbon price. Other macro-economic factors
(labor costs, energy prices, etc.) appear more important for economic choices than carbon, especially
in economically dynamic times and when the allowance price is low. Theoretical studies, based on ex-
ante estimates, can conclude differently, but caution has to be taken as regards simplified assumptions
used in models5. Also, they usually present long-term effects rather than immediate ones.
The characteristics of the EU ETS explain why, despite strong concerns, limited impacts of the carbon
price on the overall economy have been detected. Indeed, flexibility provisions, the carbon price pass-

  For example: no carbon abatement measures are undertaken when the carbon price goes up, no carbon
regulation is implemented in competing markets (while carbon pricing is developing in other countries), no
counter-balancing policies are put in place to protect EU firms…

through and continued free allocation have mitigated compliance costs for sectors deemed to be
sensible to international competition.

2.3.3.1 The flexibility provisions in the EU ETS
The EU ETS, which intrinsically aims at minimizing the cost of reducing emissions, provides flexibility
provisions, which facilitate capital investment cycles and industry planning:

   Banking is unlimited: allowances can be used for compliance any time, whatever their issuance
    vintage. Banking thus provides incentives for early abatement.
   Informal year-on-year borrowing is possible with free allocation, but within the limits of each
    period: incumbents can surrender allowances issued for year N+1 for their year N compliance6.
    Borrowing is forbidden from one period to another, meaning borrowing has to be compensated
    ultimately at the last compliance of the period.
   Use of offset credits: by enlarging the scope of possible abatements, the possibility to use credits
    from CDM and JI mechanisms provides lower-costs abatement options, which is reflected in lower
    prices. Maximizing the use of offset credits thus diminishes the cost of compliance for incumbents.
Also, the EU ETS has demonstrated its counter-cyclical effect: when economic growth is down,
emissions tend to diminish because of lower production demand, leading to reduced GHG emissions.
In that case, demand on the carbon market is also reduced and the carbon price drops, alleviating the
compliance costs for incumbents.

                                       Box 2 - Limited transaction costs

Firms incur EU ETS transaction costs, but the European Commission and governments also do. Public
authorities have invested into dedicated teams in charge of developing and implementing the
regulatory framework and the EU ETS infrastructure. No estimate is available for the public costs
incurred, but it is likely they would not be significantly different from those incurred by another
regulatory instrument (e.g. taxation incurs recovery costs and similar data management).
As regards EU ETS incumbents, costs are linked to early-implementation issues (e.g. human resources
training), emissions monitoring, reporting and verification, and trading (e.g. brokerage fees). Jaraite
et al. (2009)7 showed that those costs were limited, at 0,14€/tCO2 emitted on average8.

2.3.3.2 The carbon price pass-through and the windfall profits
The increase in input costs due to carbon pricing is born by all incumbents, who face an opportunity
cost when using allowances to cover their emissions while they could have sold them at the market
price. It is true whatever the allocation was free or auctioned.



6
  Incumbents receive their free allocation for year N+1 on February 28 at the latest, while they have to
surrender allowances for year N compliance by April 30 of year N+1. They can also surrender allowances
bought at auctions before that date.

  Quoted by Ellerman et al. (2010).

  Nevertheless, discrepancies were recorded between small (less than 22,300 allowances allocated/yr),
medium (between 22,300 and 446,000 allowances allocated/yr) and large emitters (more than 446,000
allowances allocated/yr). The overall costs were estimated respectively at 2.07€/tCO2, 0,87€/tCO2 and
0,11€/tCO2.

                                                      19
The opportunity cost is incorporated through a combination of three strategies: by reducing profit
margins, by improving efficiency to reduce emissions, and by passing the additional costs onto the
consumer. The latest, known as the carbon cost pass-through, is desirable as it drives demand towards
lower carbon-intensive goods.
The literature review by Laing et al. (2013) concludes that there is robust evidence of the existence of
carbon cost pass-through, with rates ranging from low (30%) for some sectors to high (over 100%)
for others.
Combustion is one of the sectors that benefitted the most from carbon cost pass-through as power
and heat are not transferable on long distance and are thus less sensible to international competition.
Profits derived from the inclusion of the carbon price, in the power price in particular on the gross
market and unregulated detail market, were huge in phases 1 and 2 because of the then free allocation.
CarbonTradeWatch (2011)9 estimated the order of magnitude to €19 billion in phase 1 and expected
it would reach up to €71 billion in phase 2.
Other industrial sectors also received windfall profits due to free allocation, especially after the drop
in emissions following the economic downturn. Surplus allowances could then be sold on the market
and sometimes provided important gains. A study by De Bruyn et al. (2010)10 estimated that the full
cost-pass-through rates in the refineries and iron and steel sectors could have generated windfall
profits of €14 billion between 2005 and 2008.
Windfall profits represent a transfer of income from consumers and states to power and industrial
emitters. To address the issue, the combustion sector in phase 3 is now submitted to full auctioning,
the only derogations ending in 2020. Also, when they receive free allocation, industrial sectors are now
submitted to output-based benchmarking aligned on the 10% most efficient installations of their
sector.

2.3.3.3 Protecting the EU competitiveness through free allocation and compensations
European industries have long warned European authorities of the possible adverse effects of carbon
pricing on their competitiveness on international markets. When reinforcing the carbon constraint in
phase 3 and deciding that auctioning should become the basic allocation principle, the EU also decided
of special provisions for “energy-intensive sectors or subsectors that have been determined to be
exposed to significant risks of carbon leakage” (article 10b of Directive 09/29/EC).
The methodology used to determine the corresponding industrial sectors at risk of carbon leakage is
based on two criteria: carbon cost intensity and trade exposure. One of the following conditions shall
be met:
     Direct and indirect additional costs induced by the EU ETS would lead to an increase of production
      cost of at least 5% of the Gross Value Added; and the trade intensity (imports and exports) of the
      sector with countries outside the EU is above 10%.
     Direct and indirect additional costs is at least 30%;

      Non-EU trade intensity is above 30%.
The European Commission may include in the carbon leakage list some sectors or sub-sectors that do
not respect the above-mentionned quantitative criteria, based on a qualitative analysis of the socio-
economic situation of the considered sectors and of the evolution of third-countries’ climate
policies11.
Industrial installations responding the criteria receive 100% free allowances over the 2013-2020
period, while other industrial installations received 80% free allocation in 2013, the ratio diminishing
each year down to 30% in 2020. Free allocation is calculated in both cases on the basis of product-
specific benchmarks corresponding to the performance of the 10% most efficient installations.
Benchmarks are multiplied by the historical production figure and adjusted to fit the annually
decreasing total EU ETS cap.
With such allocation methodology, installations falling short of the benchmark receive a
proportionately lower free allocation compared to their emissions, raising their needs for emissions
abatement or allowances purchase, compared to installations at or below the benchmark.
Such free allocation is thus expected to counterbalance the risk of carbon leakage while providing
more incentive to reduce EU emissions than the grandfathering allocation process used in phases 1
and 2. It should be noted that a great proportion of industrial sectors were found to be at risk of carbon
leakage (around 95% of industrial emissions); nevertheless the carbon price used in calculations -30€
in 2020- is criticized as disconnected from the actual carbon market price and is a much debated issue
in the current revision of the leakage list (see section 2.4).
The cost of CO2 that is passed on in electricity prices could also expose indirectly electricity-intensive
installations to the risk of carbon leakage. Article 10a(6) of the revised ETS Directive gives Member
States the possibility to compensate them for increases in electricity costs resulting from the ETS
through national state aid schemes. The Commission has published guidelines to ensure that such
measures are coherent with the EU's state aid rules, and is responsible for approving national state aid
schemes.

2.3.4 Support to innovation and low-carbon investment
The implementation of a carbon price gives an advantage to low-carbon products and services, and is
thus expected to stimulate technical as well as organizational innovation. In return, such innovation
could improve the international competitiveness of carbon-constrained firms. Apart from
technological and organizational changes, the carbon price is also expected to modify the investment
profile of investors, as GHG emissions constitute a new liability.
Evidence of EU ETS support to innovation and low-carbon investment is scarce as the system is still
quite new. As underlined by Laing et al. (2013) such changes would depend on the magnitude and
long-term credibility of the carbon price signal and would have a full effect only on the timescale of
decades. Also, public and private decision-makers not only face the carbon cost but other factors like
fuel prices, technology-specific support policies, economic policies, etc., which makes it difficult to
disentangle the sole EU ETS impact.

     See paragraphs 17 and 18 of Article 10a of Directive 2009/29/EC.

                                                        21
Nevertheless, Calel and Dechezleprêtre (2013) investigated for the first time the impact of the EU ETS
on technological change through firms patenting. The conclusion is that the EU ETS has increased low-
carbon innovation among regulated firms only, by as much as 10%, but has had no effect on the
patenting volume for non low-carbon technologies.
Finally the EU ETS also contributes in a targeted way to developing low-carbon technologies thanks to
two specific provisions:

    The inclusion of sequestered carbon emissions in its scope since 2013, which provides an
     incentive to develop Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies to reduce operational costs
     of big emitters;
    The set-aside of 300 million allowances from the third phase New Entrants Reserve, to be
     auctioned to fund large-scale CCS and innovation renewable energy projects. The NER 300
     programme has awarded €2.1 billion in total to 39 projects, most of them relating to innovative
     energy and only one dedicated to a large-scale CCS project in the EU12.

2.3.5 Leveraging funds for climate actions at the international and European levels
Since the very beginning of the EU ETS, Europe has made clear that its instrument was also aimed at
promoting the development of carbon pricing worldwide in order to achieve both European
emissions reduction at the lowest cost and internationally agreed mitigation goals.
In that regard, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the Joint Implementation (JI)
mechanisms created under the Kyoto Protocol were considered as « important to achieve the goals of
both reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the cost-effective functioning of the
Community scheme (recital 19 of the original Directive 2003/87/EC). The 2004/101/EC Linking
Directive completed Directive 2003/87/EC by specifying how credits issued from CDM of JI projects
may be used for EU ETS compliance until 2012.
The link between the EU ETS and the international Kyoto credit market has been a key driver of the
development of CDM projects in developing countries. It also contributed to additional emissions
reductions in Europe and other industrialized countries through JI projects. The maximum amount of
international credits that can be used by 2020 is estimated around 1.6 and 1.7 billion, while 1.058
billion were used in phase 2. Retaining an average capital investment per tonne of CO2 reduced of
USD20013, the EU ETS contributed to investments in an order of magnitude of 250 billion euros, mostly
in developing countries.
At the European level, two mechanisms aim at redistributing the carbon value created by the EU ETS:

    Within Member States: 88% of the auctioned allowances are first allocated to Member States on
     the basis of their share in the EU ETS verified emissions in 2005. But 10% are allocated to the least
     wealthy Member States to help them invest in reducing the carbon intensity of their economies
     and adapting to climate change. The remaining 2% constitute an early-action bonus to nine
     Member States whose GHG emissions were down by at least 20% in 2005 compared to their Kyoto
     Protocol baseline (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania

     and Slovakia). Romania thus receives in phase 3 the entitlement to auction 152% of its 2005 EU
     ETS emissions (Ellerman et al., 2010).

    Recycling auction revenues towards climate-friendly actions: at least 50% of revenues from
     auctioning should be used to finance climate-friendly actions, this ratio raising to 100% of the
     revenues for the auctioned allowances attributed to the least wealthy Member States and early
     bonus actions (see article 10 of Directive 2009/29/EC).

2.3.6 Generation of lessons and experience for both EU and other jurisdictions
As the first large-scale ETS, the EU ETS has been closely followed since its inception by other
jurisdictions willing to curb their GHG emissions. Youth defaults as well as success stories have
provided a valuable experience to improve the regulatory framework of a number of ETSs
implemented or on their way to be implemented: the Californian/Quebec ETS, the 7 pilot Chinese
ETSs, the Korean ETS…
The European Commission and EU Member States are also supporting international initiatives aiming
at developing the understanding and the used of market mechanisms to mitigate climate change,
including:
    The International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP) 14 , which provides a forum for sharing
     experience and knowledge on the development of ETSs
    The Partnership for Market Readiness (PMR) 15 , which provides grant financing and technical
     assistance for capacity building and piloting of market-based tools for GHG emissions reduction.

    The Carbon Pricing Statement 16 , a call of the World Bank on governments and companies to
     support putting a price on carbon.

                             Box 3 – Detection and amendment of initial flaws

Because few ETSs have been functioning before, and no one with such a scope, the design of the
European cap-and-trade system was a fierce challenge to the European authorities. If economists
could warn of potentially undesirable effects (e.g. the second-best option of allocating allowances for
free instead of auctioning them), other difficulties the EU ETS encountered could not be foreseen. The
best example is that of criminal activity which emerged over 2009-11 and obliged the EU to strengthen
its regulatory and market surveillance frameworks.
Two rather “classic” frauds were evidenced: a fraud on carbon transactions’ VAT; and phishing attacks
on EU ETS registries, in the same way phishing can be used to steel money from bank accounts17.
The first alerts on the VAT fraud appeared in 2009 when authorities realized allowances were bought
in one European country (without paying for VAT as cross-border sales were exempted) then resold
with VAT added in a domestic transaction without paying the VAT collected to the State. Because end
customer businesses could claim the VAT refund from the State, the State ended up paying out tax
refunds for tax money it never received. The answer was the cancelling of VAT on carbon market
transactions.
Phishing attacks developed in several waves, first in January and November 2010 in Germany and
Romania. In January 2011, national emissions allowance registries of 5 Member States (Austria,
Romania, Czech Republic, Greece and Italy) were also attacked, resulting in the theft of several million
EUAs, quickly resold into the market by cyber-criminals who took advantage of defaults in the
registries’ security. To protect the market, the European Commission decided to suspend allowances
transfers until the security of registries in all 27 EU Member States could be verified, freezing the spot
market.
In parallel to the amendment of VAT regulation and improvement of registry security, the European
Commission also engaged into the review of the carbon market oversight and regulation. If the futures
market appeared adequately regulated, oversight in the spot market had to be improved. The new
Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MIFID II) and Regulation (MIFIR) adopted by the European
Parliament and Council in April and May 2014 respectively will cover both spot and derivative contracts
relating to EU ETS allowances by early 2017 (30 months after the entry into force of MiFID II on 2 July
2014).

European Commission website (http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/oversight/faq_en.htm) or in

     2.4.   Major challenges today: the EU ETS towards phase 4
A number of works have been launched by the European Commission over the last couple of years to
deal with the future of the EU ETS, in particular to solve its low carbon price, and more broadly to
clarify long-term targets of European climate and energy policies.

2.4.1 The revision of the carbon leakage list: changes only in 2020 at the earliest

2.4.1.1 Pre-2020 period
The first list specifying the sectors and sub-sectors exposed to a risk of carbon leakage was prepared
in December 2009. It has to be updated every five years thereafter according to Directive 2009/29/EC.
The European Commission has therefore drafted a revised list for the 2015-19 period.
Critics reported by stakeholders during the consultation period have concentrated on the carbon price
used to model the risk of carbon leakage. A report by De Bruyn et al. (2013) finds three major outdated
assumptions:

    A carbon price of €30 by 2020, although De Bruyn et al. (2013) considers it unlikely to exceed €12;
    Emissions from exposed sectors would exceed the benchmarked free allocation by 60%; De Bruyn
     et al. (2013) reckons a figure of 20% seems more likely;
    Non-EU countries are not part of the EU ETS; but inclusion of Croatia, Iceland, Norway and
     Liechtenstein in the EU ETS with potential linkage with Switzerland in the coming years may change
     the picture.
If such new assumptions were to be applied, the sectors deemed at risk of carbon leakage would have
fallen from the current 60% of sectors, representing 95% of industrial emissions, to 33% of sectors,
accounting for only 10% of emissions. It is important to note that in that case revenues would increase
for Member States, as the share of auctioning would not be null anymore for 90% of covered
emissions. Also, it would reduce the risks that a cross-sectoral correction factor is applied to all free
allocations, including for sectors not deemed to be exposed to carbon leakage.
Nevertheless, the draft regulation prepared by European Commission maintains the current criteria
and existing assumptions, to account for the impacts of structural reforms of the EU ETS and the
implementation of 2030 long-term targets. They are supposed to significantly raise the carbon price
even before 2020 because of the banking of allowances, which ensure continuity in demand over
phases 3 and 4. It means that the composition of the carbon leakage list is not significantly changed18.
The revised carbon leakage list for 2015-19 was adopted by the European Commission on 27 October
201419 and will apply to determine free allocations as from 2015.

2.4.1.2 Post-2020 period
2014 also saw the start of consultations on the future of free allocation for the post-2020 period. The
European Commission recognizes the « need to continue with an improved and better focused system
of free allocation post-2020, as long as there are no comparable efforts undertaken in other major
economies, in order to ensure the competitiveness of Europe's energy-intensive industries »20. It also

suggest the future framework will have to be designed as a complement to policies supporting low-
carbon innovation, like the NER300 program.
Results of the consultation opened until the end of July 2014, as well as proceeds from three
stakeholder meetings organized were used by the European Commission to draft a proposal, which
was published on 15 July 2015. Only limited changes to the existing rules are proposed, including a
more targeted approach to free allocation – meaning the number of sectors deemed to be exposed to
carbon leakage would be reduced to 50, the updating of benchmarks based on technological progress
achieved over time and a better alignment of free allocation to actual production levels by a more
frequent calculation of individual allocations.

2.4.2 Structural reforms to regulate indirectly the carbon price
The economic downturn and the subsequent fall in EU emissions since 2009, the possibility to use a
significant amount of international credits and the depressing effect of energy policies on GHG
emissions, have logically reduced demand for allowances, hence their price. But this economically-
rationale evolution questions the role the EU ETS should play in driving a carbon price signal that is
compatible with Europe’s long-term mitigation targets. A too low carbon price is feared to override
low-carbon actions by reducing abatement and innovation efforts. If that were the case, mitigation
options for the next decades would be reduced and would lead to increased emissions reduction costs
in the future, damaging the inter-temporal efficiency of the EU ETS (European Commission, Executive
summary of the Impact assessment, 2014).
So is the current EU ETS price the “fair price” for short- and long-term carbon abatement? The answer
by many stakeholders is no. The European Commission started to address this economic and political
issue in 2010 by proposing to reduce the EU ETS cap in the revised Energy Efficiency Directive. As no
political agreement could be reached, the European Commission proposed in November 2012 to re-
schedule the auctioning of 900 million allowances from the years 2013 and 2015 to the years 2019
and 2020. This proposal was much debated, but was finally adopted in February 201421. However, the
backloading proposal does not modify the overall supply-demand equilibrium, as allowances will be
put back on the market at the end of phase 3. So the early bullish effect on prices would probably be
followed by a bearish effect in the last years, possibly increased by the higher abatement due to a
higher carbon price at the beginning of the phase, unless demand grows significantly meanwhile.
This is why the European Commission started in parallel a large reflection on “structural measures”
that would ensure the European carbon price would remain at a significant level. Six proposals were
put on the table in November 2012:

      To tighten the emissions reduction target from 20% to 30% of 1990 emissions by 2020, which
       implies the retirement of 1.4 billion of allowances from phase 3.
      To permanently retire allowances from those foreseen for auction between 2013 and 2020, leaving
       the amount of freely allocated EUAs untouched.
      To increase the 1.74% linear factor by which the overall EU cap decreases annually below the 2008-
       2012 average emissions, in line with the first proposal (the 30% target).

     To increase the demand of allowances by including new sectors within the scheme, which are less
      responsive to economic cycles (e.g. fuel consumption).
     To impose a limit on the use of the offsets.
     To introduce a discretionary price mechanism. This would include an auction price floor and a price
      management reserve, similar to the design of the newly implemented Californian ETS.
The European Commission concluded from the stakeholders’ consultation that a seventh option, the
establishment of a Market Stability Reserve, would be the best option by dealing directly with the
allowances surplus issue22.
The design of the MSR was proposed by the European Commission on 22 January 2014. It was
approved by the EU Parliament and Council on 8 July and 18 September 2015 respectively. The MSR
will enter into force in 2019 and will automatically adjust the volume of auctions. The adjustment will
be done on the basis of the estimated surplus level on the market. The surplus will be calculated as
the number of allowances in circulation i.e. the difference between, on the one hand, distributed
allowances and the amount of international CDM/JI credits used for compliance, and on the other
hand, verified emissions. Note that this calculation method does not estimate the actual amount of
allowances available on the market – which would have been extremely difficult; EU ETS participants
may chose to keep their surplus instead of selling them thanks to the banking provision, raising the
issue of the interaction between the MSR and companies’ compliance strategies.
How would the MSR work in practice?

     In 2018, 900 million allowances which were withheld under the backloading measure will be added
      to the MSR rather than coming back to the market via government auctions in 2019 and 2020, as
      set out in the EU’s original legislation.
     In 2020, unallocated allowances for the period 2013-2020 will be added to the MSR.
     Beginning in 2019, 12% of the surplus allowances in circulation at the end of year x-2 shall be
      placed in the MSR, unless it amounts to less than 100 million allowances. It means that the MSR
      would be fed in only when the estimated surplus of allowances is higher than 833 millions.
     Any year, if the number of surplus allowances in circulation is lower than 400 millions, 100 million
      allowances — or what remains in the MSR if it is less than 100 million allowances — shall be
      released from the MSR.
The MSR would also be used in case of “excessive price fluctuations”, as defined in article 29a of
Directive 2009/29/EC. In complement, 100 million allowances taken from the MSR would be auctioned.

2.4.3 Reviewing the EU ETS ambition, taking into account interactions with the energy
      policies and competitiveness worries

2.4.3.1 The proposed 2030 package
The EU ETS is one of the building blocks for achieving the European energy and climate targets by 2020.
The European Commission proposed on 22 January 2014 an energy-climate package for 2030 whose
first target would be to reduce EU emissions by 40% by 2030 compared to 1990 level. It would ensure
the EU is on track to achieve the emissions reduction of at least 80% by 2050 set out in the 2050
roadmap23. To achieve the overall 40% target, the sectors covered by the EU ETS would have to
reduce their emissions by 43% by 2030 compared to 200524. This estimate takes into account the
interactions between climate and energy policies. Indeed, other policies of the 2020 package will also
be pursued: the European Council agreed on 23 October 2014 on the European Commission’s
proposals to increase the share of renewable energy to at least 27% of the EU's energy consumption
and to increase energy efficiency by 27% by 2030 compared to forecasts. The energy efficiency target
should be reviewed by 2020 “having in mind an EU level of 30%” (European Council, 2014).
It should be noted that the EU climate and energy policies are not the only source of potential overlap
with the EU ETS. Member states’ national policies can impact ETS-covered emissions and therefore
the EU ETS supply-demand equilibrium, hence the distribution of abatement. Ellerman et al. (2014)
quotes two examples: 1/ the German phase-out of nuclear power in the aftermaths of the Fukushima
accident, implying more emissions from fossil-fuelled power plants before renewable energies can


23
   Other components of the package include an increased share of renewable energy to at least 27% of the EU's
energy consumption by 2030, and increasing energy efficiency by 30%.
24
   Non EU-ETS sectors would be subject to a 30% cut below the 2005 level by 2030.

take over and higher abatement demand in the EU ETS perimeter; and 2/ the UK’s carbon price floor
on fossil fuel supplies to power facilities, which imposes a significantly higher carbon price on the UK
power sector with effects on the dispatch of existing capacity and the demand for allowances.

2.4.3.2 Potential evolutions of the EU ETS in phase 4 — the European Commission outlook
In its assessment of the 2030 package, the European Commission assessed potential evolutions of the
EU ETS and presents its position on a number of issues.

   No unconditional import of international credits from 2021?
The European Commission advocates for not allowing an additional import of international credits in
the EU ETS, to avoid increasing the expected surplus; nevertheless to facilitate higher ambition by 2030
in the rest of the world, a conditional target could be envisaged with a large share of additional efforts
being met through international credits.

   Continued support to linking with other carbon markets
Europe has been promoting bottom-up initiatives through linking between EU ETS and ETSs compatible
in design and ambition. Nevertheless prospects for linking are limited to Switzerland for the time being.

   A necessary modification of the annual linear reduction factor from 1.74% to around 2.2%
To ensure the 40% emissions reduction target by 2030, the constraint in the EU ETS has to be
reinforced, meaning the annual linear reduction factor applying to the allowance cap should be
increased. The three scenarios developed in the impact assessment conclude on similar targets from
2.1% to 2.3%. This is why the European Commission proposes to increase the annual linear reduction
factor to 2.2%, to be complemented by specific measures to reduce the allowance surplus to make
sure the 2030 emissions target is achieved. The European Council agreed to this proposal in its
conclusions of 23 October 2014.
   Free allocation kept as a safeguard against carbon leakage, if no comparable climate action from
    other major economies
The European Commission acknowledges there is no evidence of carbon leakage already, but indicates
that future emissions limits, if not comparable to other regions’ efforts, may const itute a risk for
industries who cannot influence the price of their products on international markets. The European
Commission thus advocates for continued free allocation on the basis of periodically updated
benchmarks.
Regarding indirect impacts from carbon prices on electricity prices, the European Commission
estimates improvements are needed regarding state aids to avoid distortion of intra-EU competition.
It evokes the possibility to foster innovation in industries through dedicated schemes, similar to the
NER300 mechanism, to both reduce costs to meet long-term objectives and create a technological
advantage.
In its conclusions of the 23 October 2014 summit, the European Council indicates it supports such
provisions as well as the continuation of specific support to low-income EU Member States through
the redistribution of a share of allowances to be auctioned and the possibility to continue to allocate
free allowances to the power sector for modernization purposes. A new reserve made of 2% of the




                                                   29
allocation is also proposed to “address high additional investment needs in low income Member
States”25.
On 15 July 2015, the European Commission published its proposal for the 2020-2030 EU ETS legislation
including provisions corresponding to its previous analysis.

2.4.4 Inclusion of new EU members, additional sectors & gases
The inclusion of new sectors and gases in the EU ETS is conditioned by a favorable cost-benefit analysis,
compared to other forms of public regulation. It has not been included in the EU ETS 2020-2030
legislative proposal by the European Commission.
Three inclusions may be considered:
    International flights from and to Europe
Because of the “stop-the-clock” procedure 26 , flights departing from or arriving in Europe are not
covered by the EU ETS, pending an international agreement obtained by the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO). ICAO has started its work to provide by 2016 such an agreement, to be
operational from 2020 on.
However, if the agreement was not to be reached, the EU may consider covering international flights
from and to Europe in the EU ETS, while it would not be politically easy as discussions with third parties
showed before the “stop-the-clock” proposal was made.
    Covering diffuse energy-consumption emissions through an upstream approach
Instead of covering direct emitters, which would be too many and would incur disproportionate
administrative costs, including fuel suppliers, tax warehouse keepers or excise duty points in the EU
ETS seems feasible. Such an upstream approach is already functioning in some ETSs like the Californian
one.
The European Commission nevertheless warns against some difficulties that may arise, in particular
linked to different taxation practices among Member States, and the interaction with existing
measures addressing CO2 emissions and energy consumption in sectors such as transport and the
housing segment.
An upstream inclusion of fossil fuel combustion in the residential, services and transport sectors (road,
rail and inland navigation) would result in a 37% emissions reduction by 2030 in the EU ETS compared
to 2005 emissions

    Including (non-energy related) emissions from agriculture, forestry and land use (AFOLU)
The conclusions of the European Commission are that there are benefits in cointegrating sectoral
mitigation policies. The first option would be to include AFOLU emissions in the Effort Sharing
Directive, which may be complicated due to annual variations in AFOLU emissions, complex
verification processes and the differences in national abatement potentials among Member States.



25
   Technical discussions will continue in the following months in the European Council, in parallel to the
European Parliament’s examination of the proposal, which incurred some delay due to the European elections.
26
   For further detail, see Decision No 377/2013/EU, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32013D0377

                                                    30
Another option would be a dedicated policy, which can build on the Common Agriculture Policy,
including through improved incentives for climate friendly and smart agriculture.
On the contrary, the European Commission has not promoted the inclusion of other sectors or gases
through a domestic offset projects scheme. This option, which was included in Directive 2009/29/EC
(article 24a), may be problematic to the European Commission as it only creates a new source of
carbon credit supply while not increasing at the same time demand. It has nevertheless proven it could
favor low-cost abatement innovation in sectors where emissions could be difficult to cap, either by
lack of information on abatement costs or because the abatement potential is too little to justify the
inclusion in the EU ETS with a somewhat heavy administration burden.
Nevertheless, domestic offset schemes are developing in other ETSs (e.g. Californian ETS, Chinese ETSs,
etc.), proving they can be an efficient answer to reduce emissions domestically without formally
expanding the scope of an ETS.

2.4.5 Linking prospects and international negotiations
Besides its domestic role in limiting European emissions, the EU ETS has given credibility to the EU
foreign climate diplomacy. It has been presented by the European Commission as a building block for
developing an international network of emission trading systems. Such a network involves informal
cooperation to support design and experience sharing, but has also resulted in more formal
discussions to establish a direct link between the EU ETS and other trading schemes. The rationale is
that it reduces the overall cost of cutting emissions, increase market liquidity and stabilize the carbon
price. It also contributes to leveling the international playing field for ETS participants. Finally, linking
supports cooperation on climate change, facilitating international negotiations on tougher mitigation
targets.
To date, the EU ETS has already achieved two linking processes: with the international CDM/JI credit
markets, although not an ETS as such, and with the three countries of the European Economic Area. It
implied in particular that the Norwegian ETS was adapted to fit with the EU ETS provisions.
Over the last past years, discussions have been well advanced with both Australia and Switzerland
to link their projected or existing ETSs with the EU one:

   The agreement with Australia was announced in August 2012, as a full two-way link to start no
    later than 1 July 2018. Businesses would then have been able to use carbon units indifferently from
    the Australian or the European ETS for compliance. An interim link was to be established from 1
    July 2015 enabling Australian incumbents to use EU allowances. Nevertheless, the Australian
    government nominated in September 2013 repealed the ETS and bilateral linking talks are on hold.

   The European Commission is also negotiating with Switzerland but subsequent to the vote in
    Switzerland on 9 February 2014 for the reintroduction of immigration quotas with the European
    Union, ETS linking talks are currently on hold.
The EU domestic policy has also been designed to give incentives for ambitious international climate
targets. The 2020 package foresaw that the European emissions reduction target would be increased
from -20% to -30% if a binding international agreement was to be found for the post-2012 period. But
the adoption of a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol without a legally binding
agreement did not meet the European criteria.

Similar provisions might have been included in the design of the EU ETS Phase 4. For example, the use
of international offset credits might have been be allowed if Europe was to take on additional efforts
and possibly restricted to projects originating from countries taking on mitigation targets. Europe has
also be pushing for the development of a New Market Mechanism (NMM) in developing countries
that would cover whole economic sectors and not only projects as the CDM does. If NMM materializes,
its credits might be usable for compliance in the EU ETS, to an extent to be determined.

    3. Expected prices up to 2030 and auction revenues for Member States

    3.1.    A constrained auctioning framework
The auctioning regulatory framework is composed of Directive 2009/29/EC (Article 10) and the revised
Auctioning Regulation, which leaves only few room of manoeuvre for Member States in the
management of the allowances they have to auction.
Indeed, the stated objective is that “to provide predictability to the secondary market, this Regulation
should provide (…) for determining the volumes of any allowances to be auctioned in 2011 and 2012,
(…) clear and transparent rules that determine the volume of allowances to be auctioned in each year
thereafter, (…) rules and procedures to establish for each calendar year a detailed auction calendar,
with all relevant information for each individual auction well before the beginning of that calendar year.
Any subsequent changes to the auction calendar should only be possible in a limited number of
prescribed situations. Any adjustments should be made in a manner least affecting the predictability of
the auction calendar.” (Recital 19 of the Auctioning Regulation).

3.1.1 Auctions in practice
Article 10.4 of Directive 2009/29 determined that the auction procedure is to be conducted in an
“open, transparent, harmonised and non-discriminatory manner”.

3.1.1.1 Methodology
The chosen methodology is a sealed-bid, one-round, uniform price auction. Participants to the auction
can propose an unlimited number of bids during the 2-hour auction window — provided they transfer
the corresponding requested collateral to the platform.
As shown in Figure 3, at the end of the auction window, bids are sorted by descending bidding price.
Bidders are served as long as the total quantity of allowances that was available for the auction is not




                                                   33
reached. In the example below, the ceiling of 300,000 allowances offered is met with Bid G. Bid G thus
determines the auction’s clearing price, the same for all successful bids27.

                  Figure 3 – The auctioning procedure – how bids are sorted out

            http://www.dehst.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/Publications/Auctioning_5-years.pdf?__blob=publicationFile

3.1.1.2 Two auction platforms
The European Commission and 24 Member States appointed the European Energy Exchange (EEX) as
the transitional common auction platform. Croatia also joined in when entering the EU. The three EEA
countries have indicated they would contract EEX too for the auctioning of their allowances. The
common auction platform is to be appointed following the on-going tender procedure launched on 21
June 2014 by the European Commission. Pending the completion of this procedure, the transitional
auctioning platforms continue to assure the auctioning of EU allowances.
Germany, the United Kingdom and Poland chose to opt-out from the common auctioning platform.
Germany appointed EEX as its permanent auction platform while the UK appointed ICE Futures Europe.
Poland finally contracted EEX on an independent basis to conduct its auctions.

3.1.1.3 A detailed framework for the auctions organization
The Auctioning Regulation applies to all auctioning platforms and constitutes the detailed framework
of how auctions work, in particular:
    On the timing and sequencing of auctions as well as on the estimated volumes of allowances to
     be auctioned; to avoid market abuse, all information should be given to all participants at the same
     time.
    On eligible participants, i.e. financial intermediaries and operators, including small emitters; any
     auction is open to all eligible participants, whatever their countries or the auctioning platform.
    On monitoring; the Commission is responsible for monitoring the functioning of the market with
     the support of Member States. It should in particular report on the cost-effectiveness of the
     scheme and ensure that “undue administrative costs are avoided”.


27
  Nevertheless, Bid G will only receive the amount of allowances remaining after bids A to F are served. If
another bid (or more) had been made at the same price as Bid G, the remaining allowances would have been
attributed randomly to one of the ex-aequo bidders.

                                                          34
Adjustments to the auction calendar once published for a given year 28 are severely restricted by
article 14 of the auctioning regulation, as shown in Table 3. Whenever allowances have to be retained
from auctioning, the equivalent amount is spread evenly over the next auctions – the exact number
depends on the circumstances but is usually between 2 and 4. As allowances are auctioned with a high
frequency29, the actual delay incurred in the auction process is very limited.

3.1.2 How the amount of auctioned allowances is calculated and distributed among
      Member States
Directive 2009/29/EC states that the total quantity of auctioned allowances for Phase 3 and
subsequent periods is the difference between the overall EU ETS cap and the amount of free
allocation (including free allocation to industries, temporary free allocation for the power sector in 8
Member States, the new entrants reserve). This is why any change in the free allocation - e.g. through
the revision of the carbon leakage list, see section 2.4 - will have an impact on the amount of
allowances auctioned, hence on Member States’ revenues.
Following the adoption of National Implementation Measures (NIMs), the European Commission
calculated that the total amount of EU allowances to be auctioned over 2013-20 was expected to
reach 8,176,193,157 (i.e. 1, 022 million allowances per year or 48% of allocation on average).30
Regarding the 15% of the EU aviation allowances to be auctioned in phase 3, the European Commission
estimates it to 11,940,329 million for 2012 and 5.8 million annually from 2013 to 2016. This amount
will be revised for 2017 when the « stop-the-clock » proposal ends.

Because of the partial redistribution of auctions revenues agreed in Directive 2009/29/EC (see
section 2.3.5), Romania is entitled to auction 324 million EU allowances over the 2013-20 period.
This volume takes into account the fact that Romania was allowed to allocate a maximum of 71.4
million free allowances on a transitional basis to 39 power plants over Phase 332.

   Early auctions were implemented by Regulation No 1210/2011 of 23 November 2011. To provide liquidity to
the market and allow incumbents (in particular the power sector) to hedge their production costs for Phase 3,
120 million Phase 3 allowances were to be taken from Phase 3 allocation and auctionned in 2011-12.

For phase 4, the European Commission has already indicated33 that the redistributive mechanisms
implemented in Phase 3 would continue. It estimated the total revenues to €8 to 17 bn annually,
depending if auctions only concern the power sector or apply to all ETS sectors. Such estimate
corresponds to the scenario with -40% GHG emissions and 30% renewable energy targets, with no pre-
set target for energy efficiency, and no MSR. It can thus be considered as a lower bound estimate.
However, the set-aside of allowances to fund dedicated projects, for example relative to the
demonstration and deployment of promising new technologies, would reduce revenues from
allowances auctionning to be perceived by Member States.

3.1.3 At least 50% of auction revenues should be used for ‘climate-friendly’ actions
Member States have the last word regarding the use of revenues from their auctioned allowances.
Nevertheless, Directive 2009/29/EC stipulates that at least 50% of the revenues generated from
allowances auctioning — 100% for allowances auctioned for intra-European redistributional
purposes — should be used for funding mitigation and adaptation actions through fiscal or financial
support policies in the EU or in developing countries (see section 2.3.5), such as:

     Contributing to European or international climate funds;
     Funding mitigation and adaptation projects, in particular:

        Avoided deforestation and increased afforestation and reforestation in developing countries
         committed under the international agreement on climate change;
        Technology transfer and adaptation facilitation in these countries;

        Environmentally safe capture and geological storage of CO2, including in third countries.

    Developing renewable energies and other technologies to meet the European 2020 targets related
     to renewable energies and energy efficiency; in particular:

        Funding R&D projects aiming at increasing mitigation and adaptation as well as energy
         efficiency and clean technologies in sectors covered by the EU ETS Directive;
        Supporting measures to increase energy efficiency and insulation or providing financial support
         to address social aspects in lower and middle income households;
        Encouraging low-emission and public forms of transport;
    Administrative expenses related to the management of the EU ETS.
The wording – the use of « should » instead of « must » or « shall » - leaves Member States with a
strong incentive, rather than a formal obligation, to devote a large share of their auction revenues to
climate actions. Article 17 of Regulation No 525/2013 of 21 May 2013 establishes the Member States’
obligations regarding their reporting on the use of auctioning revenue and project credits34.


     3.2.    Estimates of emissions, shortfall, and price projections up to 2030
A number of estimates for the EU carbon prices have been published over the last years, reflecting
the evolution of market participants’ expectations and the on-going institutional discussions
regarding structural reforms in Phases 3 and 4. Indeed, because of the inter-period banking possibility,
participants to the EU ETS would modify their strategies immediately even if the change in the
regulatory framework is only implemented in Phase 4. For example, a more ambitious annual
reduction factor for allocation in Phase 4 would increase the incentives to buy allowances already in
Phase 3, increasing the carbon price and delivering more incentives for early abatement.
Forecasts for the European carbon price at the 2020 and 2030 horizons have often experienced a
downward trend, because of low economic activity prospects and the concern that other EU energy
policies, in particular as regards renewable energies and energy efficiency35, might create additional
incentives for emissions abatement and slacken the emissions constraint in the EU ETS where the
power sector represents the bulk of allowance demand.
Finally, the European Commission’s proposal to implement a Market Stability Reserve lead market
analysts to model alternative scenarios.

     3.2.1. Limits to modeling results
Forecasting the price of EU allowances can be done on the short term – up to a few days - thanks to
financial econometric techniques.
Longer-term estimates can be obtained, albeit with much larger uncertainties on the evolution of the
market fundamentals — economic growth, relative energy prices, pace of low-carbon technologies
development, costs of low-carbon technologies at different time horizons, effectiveness of energy

  The proposal of the European Commission for an indicative energy efficiency target of -30% for 2030 was
interpreted by market participants as highly likely to be implemented.

efficiency and other environmental policies, etc. In practice, long-term estimates of the carbon price
are based on models using marginal abatement cost curves (MACCs) at different time horizons.
When reviewing past forecasts of the European carbon price, one can realize participants and analysts
have often — if not always — overestimated the carbon constraint, as shown in Figure 4. Thus, price
forecasts on the long term should be taken with caution, keeping in mind they reflect simplified
socio-economic hypotheses.

     3.2.2. Estimates of market balance by 203036
The term “market balance” is often used to describe, over a given period, the difference between:
    The quantity of carbon assets that is available on the market — free and auctioned EU allowances
     not surrendered yet for compliance, unused share of CERs/ERUs ceilings;
    And verified emissions in the EU ETS perimeter.
Because ETSs are designed so that emissions cannot surpass the cap, the market balance is always
positive and is often called a surplus. Its actual level depends on a number of factors, in particular the
stringency of emissions caps vs counterfactual emissions, and also importantly the corresponding
strategic behavior of market participants who can chose to reduce their emissions more or less
depending on their anticipation of emissions prices and internal abatement costs over time.
The market balance and participants’ expectations of its evolution are reflected in the market price37.
Analysts scenarios try to estimate the evolution of the allowance surplus until 2030 with the Market
Stability Reserve implemented. The actual effect of the MSR is highly dependent on EU ETS participants’

behavior: if hedging or banking behaviors have been underestimated, the MSR will artificially decrease
the amount of allowances available on the market, thus raising prices. In this case, more abatement
will be triggered.
Overall, as shown in Figure 5, most scenarios logically predict a decreasing surplus over time, in some
cases up to zero — however, it is highly unlikely the surplus will be null because of the need for market
liquidity; in this case more abatement would be undertaken38. In a nutshell, estimates of the market
balance would range between a few hundreds to a little more than 1,000 million allowances39.

From a market dynamic point of view, the implementation of the MSR will reduce the surplus more
quickly than in baseline scenarios, meaning the effect on market prices will be higher all over the
implementation period. The situation will be reversed when the MSR will start putting allowances
back on the market.

       3.2.3. Main price projections available40
The scenarios presented above are also used to forecast the potential allowance price levels up to
2030. The MSR is expected to increase significantly the carbon price when implemented, with
estimates of the carbon price in 2030 ranging from 30€ to more than 80€ per allowance.
On average, the value of 50 to 60€ can be retained — for 2020, estimates are below 10€, even if in
practice the price difference between phase 3 and 4 will be smoothened by the arbitrages of market
participants.




38
   The only reason why the price would drop to zero would be that the EU ETS would not be continued after
2030.
39
   The only scenario above this amount corresponds to Scenario 1 of the Climate Economics Chair in which EU
ETS participants have a very strong preference for banking allowances instead of using them. Such a scenario
remains unlikely if the market surplus decreases, as allowance prices will go up.

    3.3.      Potential revenues from auctioning for Romania up to 2030
Auction revenues for Member States until 2030 depend on the volume of allowances distributed,
the share of auctioning in the whole allocation process, and the expected market price. However,
each of these parameters depends on a variety of regulatory and economic evolutions:
   The volume of allowances to be distributed is dependent on the 2030 target which will be
    adopted; it can be complemented by the possibility to use international offsets, although it seems
    unlikely by 2030 unless a higher emissions reduction target is decided by the European Union in
    case a satisfactory international agreement is obtained;
   The share of auctions in the allocation is expected to increase as derogatory provisions end (e.g.,
    for the power sector in 8 Eastern Europe countries). Uncertainties still remain regarding the level
    of free allocation that should continue for trade-exposed industries, political pressure to avoid any
    loss in industrial competitiveness making it likely to continue even after 2020. Also, redistributive
    mechanisms among EU Member States might be modified in the future while it is rather likely
    some kind of redistribution will be preserved. Finally, the set-aside of allowances to fund dedicated
    projects, following the NER300 experience, would reduce the actual auction revenues for Member
    States.

   The market price for allowances will be determined by the evolution of market fundamentals,
    including any regulatory decision modifying the market supply — e.g. the implementation of the
    Market Stability Reserve, as discussed above.
For each set of parameters, several scenarios have been tested:
   The volume of allowances to be distributed until 2030 depends on the linear annual reduction
    factor that is to be reviewed at the latest in 2025. Two scenarios are tested: the factor remains at
    -1.74% per year until 2030 or it is increased to -2.2% from 2021 on, on the basis of the European
    Commission’s proposal.

                                                          42
   The share of each Member State in the auctioned allocation is supposed to remain the same as in
    Phase 3, i.e. 4% for Romania. The level of auctioning in the overall allocation is expected to increase
    up to 90% in 2030, on a linear basis.
   The market price for allowances is differentiated based on upper, middle and lower bounds of
    market analysts’ forecasts.
Table 6 presents the resulting auction revenues estimates. The estimates of auction revenues have to
be interpreted as an order of magnitude, taking into account that the gaps between phases 3 and 4
will be probably smoothened.

    3.4.1. Overview of allowance auctioning in phases 1 and 2
As chargeable allocation was limited to 5% and 10% of the allocation in phases 1 and 2 respectively,
the actual amount of auctioned allowances remained low. Along with auctioning, some Member
States chose to sell allowances directly on the secondary market, a solution that can be economically
efficient as long as the quantities sold are limited, to avoid distorting the market.

As pointed out by Haita (2013), among the various experiences of allowance auctioning in Phases 1
and 2, only a few Member States actually used all or part of the revenues to finance environmentally-
related projects. In general, the revenues fell in the general public budget or were earmarked to cover
administrative expenses of the EU ETS.
Such choices correspond to the economic theory of the double-dividend: the dual benefit of carbon
pricing, in addition to the environmental benefit, is that revenues captured by the public authorities
can be used to reduce distortionary taxes, for example on labour or capital. The choice in the use of
revenues will therefore redistribute the economic rent which was created along with the creation of
the emissions allowances.

Formal earmarking — i.e. institutionalized by law — remains limited to a small number of countries,
probably because governments may see it as too constraining and giving less flexibility (see Table 8).

 France          Up to 100%            EU ETS auctioning revenues are attributed to the National
                                       Agency for Housing — up to a limit of €590 million — for

                                       As a revolving fund, it was expected to offer low interest
                                       loans for EE (incl. buildings), distributed generation and

According to the Commission Regulation N°525/2013, Member States had until 31 July 2014 to report
to the European Commission on their use of auction revenues for 2013..
The European Commission made a synthesis available on 28 October 2014 (European Commission,
2014), reproduced in Table 9. It shows all Member States reckon at least 50% of the 2013 auctioning
proceeds were used for climate and energy purposes even if no formal earmarking was implemented
— e.g. in Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands or Denmark.
Whether the reported funding is effectively additional to previous commitments remains to be seen
and one can question a 100% additionality given the current economic/fiscal constraints for a
number of countries. In that regard, some guarantee, although not absolute, is provided when
auction revenues are earmarked for specific purposes.
Also, off the 2,712 M€ aimed at financing climate and energy related policies and for which the split
between domestic and international actions is declared, more than 80% is dedicated to domestic
policies. It shows recycling of auctioning revenues can be a decisive instrument for financing climate-
friendly actions in Europe, in coherence with EU long-term objectives and Member States national
strategy and priorities.

3.4.2.2. The German experience
Germany is often quoted as a model when it comes to auctioning revenues recycling in favor of
climate-friendly policies. As shown in the section 3.4.1, the country started selling and auctioning
allowances in phase 2 and has fully dedicated proceeds from sales and auctions to climate actions
since then — either by covering administrative costs linked to climate policies or by funding national
and international climate- and energy-related initiatives.
Since 2011, the revenues are managed by the Special Energy and Climate Fund (EKF). A dedicated
structure allows the effective earmarking of auctioning revenues and enables the bundling of climate-
related expenditure, especially when several ministers are involved as it is the case for Germany (Esch,
2013). EKF contributes to financing climate- and energy-related projects both at the national level,
through the National Climate Initiative's programmes (NKI), and at the international level, through the
International Climate Initiative (IKI) — see Box 4.
Because of low-carbon prices, however, the EKF had to be complemented since 2013 by other
sources of revenues to make sure it could meet its financing commitments , in particular for
international climate actions. In 2013, KfW, the German government-owned development bank,
provided €311 million from its own resources. In 2014, the federal budget for programs dedicated to
the international climate and environmental protection was sollicited, implying a redistribution from
development aid funding to climate change policies and an only partial additionality of climate
finance41.

The German example illustrates the difficulty Member States will face when earmarking ex ante EU
ETS revenues, given the uncertainties on the carbon price. The consequences of an overestimation
of the auctioning revenues are to put at risks other policies (here development aid and potentially
support to domestic policies).

                    Box 4 – German national and international climate initiatives

The German National Climate Initiative (NKI) of the Federal Environment Ministry supports various
programmes and projects related to:
- climate protection in municipalities, and in social and cultural institutions
- innovative projects in industry and in the consumer, education and municipal sector
- highly-efficient small combined heat and power systems (mini CHP systems) and
- commercial cooling and air-conditioning plants.
The International Climate Initiative (IKI) is geared towards meeting the needs of the partner countries
and supporting climate protection measures, in particular reducing greenhouse gases, improving
adaptability to the consequences of climate change and conserving and using climate-relevant areas
which merit protection. It is part of the German contribution to fast-start financing, the commitment
of industrialised countries in the Copenhagen Accord to financing immediate climate protection
measures in developing countries until 2012.

3.4.2.3. The UK experience: EU ETS revenues included in the general budget with parallel
         support to electricity-intensive industries
The UK has shown a traditional opposition to the hypothecation or earmarking of tax revenue, because
it is alleged to reduce flexibility in spending decisions with a reduced value for money for taxpayers.
However, some examples exist in the energy sector, in particular regarding the support to renewables
development, as reported by Vase and Sunderland (2014). Hepburn and al. (2006) give the example of
the Carbon Trust established in 2001, which relied on the earmarked revenues from the Climate
Change Levy, a tax on energy delivered to non-domestic customers. The aim of the Carbon Trust was
to assist businesses to reduce their emissions, multiplying the impact of the price signal provided by
the tax by supporting energy efficiency investment and commercialization of low-carbon technologies
by UK companies.
The association for the Conservation of Energy (2012) reports the announcement in the 2011 Autumn
Statement, confirmed in the 2012 Budget, of the recycling of energy policies’ revenues towards
electricity-intensive industries to reduce the impact of policy costs . While it does not constitute a
formal recycling of the EU ETS revenues, the government has committed to:
    compensate electricity-intensive businesses to help offset the indirect cost of the carbon price
     floor and the EU ETS, subject to EU state aid guidelines43;

    increase the level of relief from the Climate Change Levy on electricity from 65 to 90% for those
     entities who commit to Climate Change Agreement with the UK government.

3.4.2.4. The Polish experience
Poland is planning to adopt an innovative ex post resource allocation system, where funds are spent
after one year, increasing certainty on their volume.

            4. EU ETS participation and compliance for installations in Romania

      Romanian industrial and power installations entered the EU ETS in 2007 when Romania joined the
      European Union. Romanian aircraft operators were included in the scheme in 2012.
      Since 2007, 289 installations and operators have been listed as participating to the EU ETS, although
      some are no longer included because of installations closures or change in the EU ETS scope in
      particular in Phase 3 from 2013 on.


            4.1.     Typology of Romanian EU ETS installations

            4.1.1. Number of installations covered over time by sector
      In 2013, 201 installations and operators were included in the EU ETS in Romania. Among them, 185
      actually emitted greenhouse gas emissions, the majority (58%) pertaining to the fuel combustion
      sector, which includes the production of electricity, heat and co-generation.

      The combustion sector is very diverse as it includes any installation burning fuels to produce power
      and/or heat, whether power/heat is the final product for sale or an input to produce other goods.
      Figure 8 shows that combustion installations operating in 2013 are in majority (66 i.e 53%) producing

or manufacturing sectors.

        Note: the data used in this figure corresponds to the 109 combustion installations operating in 2013 for which a sub-
                                                 category was known (out of 119 combustion installations operating in 2013).

The modifications of the list of EU ETS incumbents in phase 3 reduced the number of installations
and operators covered in Romania by 13%, mostly because of the evolution incurred by the
combustion sector. In total, 35 installations operating in 2012 were not included in the EU ETS in 2013;
out of them, 18 belonged to the combustion sector. Indeed, since 2013, combustion installations
emitting less than 25 ktCO2e/yr can be excluded from the EU ETS. It appears to be the case for 9
installations.

        4.1.2. Size of Romanian installations
The Romanian installations are bigger in terms of emissions than the European average , whatever
the reference groupe that is taken into account. Figure 10 shows that installations emitting more than
50ktCO2e/yr account for 45% of installations in Romania in 2013 while the European average is 32%, a
share that does not vary much if one considers EU Western or Eastern countries.

        4.1.3. Estimated number of market participants by sector
The actual number of market participants does not correspond directly to the number of
installations and operators as:
       Several installations can be owned by the same entity, who generally manages EU ETS compliance
        at the group level44;

       Financial intermediaries and other participants may be allowed to open an account in the
        Romanian registry and thus participate in the EU ETS market.
For example, among the 282 operators or personal accounts recorded in Phase 1, it is possible to
isolate 166 distinct entities, thanks to the grouping proposed Jaraite et al. (2013).
It is also possible to analyze for each sector the type of mother company, as shown in




Table 12. Unsurprisingly, industrial companies hold the large majority of industrial accounts.




44
  As recalled by Trotignon (2013), “this facilitates long-term strategies, limits risks for individual installations
and allows a more efficient use of the limited expertise on such a new market”.

   4.1.4. Emissions volumes over time
As many Member States, Romania experienced a sharp drop in verified emissions under the EU ETS, a
combination of emissions abatement and reduction in industrial production following the economic
downturn.
Between 2007 and 2013, emissions covered by the EU ETS decreased by 39%. While free allocation
was also considerably reduced between phase 1 and phase 3 (-46%), the surplus in allowances
reached 113 MtCO2e in 2013.

    4.2.             Compliance since 2007
Compliance refers to the annual process through which incumbents have to surrender as many carbon
assets — European allowances and/or international Kyoto offsets under qualitative and quantitative
conditions — as their previous year’s emissions.
To achieve this goal, incumbents can use a variety of strategies, in particular through the active
management of allocation and carbon assets.

    4.2.1. Compliance status
When analyzing the compliance status, an important indicator remains the ‘position’ of each
installation or sector, i.e. the difference between the allocation received freely and the emissions
for a given year. Installations or sectors receiving more (respectively less) allowances than their needs
are said “long” (resp. “short”). Even if in theory the position does not influence the compliance strategy
— installations are supposed to only compare their abatement costs to the market price — in practice
it is widely recognized that ‘long’ installations may not use market mechanisms as much as they might
do, while ‘short’ installations have a more intense use of the market since they are obliged to buy
carbon assets. Hence an asymmetry in the market behavior between ‘long’ and ‘short’ installations or
sectors.

4.2.1.1. Compliance by size of installation
Figure 13 presents the position of Romanian installations in Phase 2 and in 2013, by sector. The first
result is that all categories of size showed a surplus in allowances in phase 2, whatever the sector
considered. In the combustion sector, where all size categories are represented, the majority of the
surplus came from the largest installations.
The picture for phase 3 is more contrasted. Now several sectors show a deficit, for one or all size
categories. The combustion sector remains the more impacted by the change in the allocation
process and the end of free allocation for the power sector. However, the transitional free allocation
provision diminishes the deficit in allowances of the combustion sector by 66%.
For other industrial sectors, the situation differs substantially among sectors. Some still experience a
rather large surplus in allowances, reflecting either a good level of efficiency compared to the EU
average which is possible for a few installations, or a weak production45, or a combination of both;
others are already in deficit, although not by much, meaning their production is either close to the
European carbon-efficiency benchmark or their production is still below pre-downturn levels.

   Benchmarks that were used to determine the free allocation are calculated using historical outputs. The
baseline period is chosen by the operator between the 2005-08 period or the 2009-10. It means that all
operators who chose as the reference period the one preceding the economic downturn will receive more
allowances in proportion ; if their output has not reached pre-downturn levels, the allocation may be higher
than their actual emissions.

4.2.1.2. Sectoral compliance
In many EU Member States, the combustion sector has been the only sector “short” in allowances
since the beginning of the EU ETS. Indeed, because of its lower exposure to international competition,
Member States often chose to put a higher burden on this sector. With the programmed ending of
free allocation for the whole sector by 2020, the power sector will be obliged to buy all the allowances
it needs, less banked allowances from phase 2.
In Romania, the combustion sector received more allowances than its needs in phase 2, and experience
the first deficit in freely allocated allowances only in 2013, as shown in

       4.2.2. Use of international credits46
International credits issued from the Kyoto Clean Develoopment Mechanism (CDM) and Joint
Implementation (JI) mechanism are accepted under conditions in the EU ETS since the adoption of the
so-called ‘Linking Directive’ (Directive 2004/101/EC) in 2004. As the credits — respectively called
Certified Emission Reductions or CERs and Emission Reductions Units or ERUs — have been available
at cheaper costs, there is a high incentive for EU ETS installations to use them to the maximum
allowed by law. Spared European allowances can then be banked or sold on the market to cash in the
price difference with international credits.
Figure 16 shows Romanian installations used this strategy of surrendering international credits while
they received more allowances than their compliance needs. All sectors surrendered at least one
international credit47.
Figure 17 illustrates the use of international credits on average by sector. Because of the over-
allocation and because the entitlement of using international credits refers to the equivalent of a share

   The analysis is limited to 2007 and Phase 2 as it is impossible from 2013 on to differentiate EUAs from
international credits converted into EUAs.
47
   To the exception of the production of soda ash and sodium bicarbonate which includes only one installation
which did not emit during Phase 2.

                                                                                            65
of allowance allocation (10% in Romania), some sectors could cover a large share of their emissions
thanks to international offsets. The level of international offsets’ use does not appear to be correlated
to each sector compliance position.

 Note: the right axis corresponds to sectors’ positions — i.e. the difference between allowances received for free and verified

EUTL data also reveals that Romanian installations used proportionately a high number of ERUs
within international offsets. They rank 6th among EU ETS participating countries in terms of the share
of ERUs in surrendered units (at 6%).

                                                             66
Finally, Figure 18 shows that contrary to what could be expected, smaller installations have also
accessed the CDM and JI markets. A first explanation is that they benefitted from a pooled
management of compliance needs, at their holding group level. A second explanation is that specific
arbitrage products have been proposed by specialized brokers, aiming at maximizing the use of CERs
and ERUs to benefit from the price difference with allowances.

       4.2.3. Banking, borrowing and use of trading
EU ETS incumbents can use other flexibility provisions than the use of international offsets, in
particular banking of allowances. Given the surplus observed over phase 2, borrowing strategies were
probably limited. As details regarding transactions recorded in the EUTL are only disclosed after 5 years,
only scarce information is available to analyze phase 2 strategies, let alone phase 3 strategies.
However, Martino and Trotignon (2013) offer a partial picture of banking, borrowing and trading
strategies through the analysis of phase 1 EUTL data. Their conclusions are that:

      Borrowing was used by at least 25% of operators and involved large amounts of allowances.
      For the year 2007, because no banking was allowed towards phase 2, it was estimated that half of
       the surplus expired worthless.

      Participation to trading was much higher for large installations, especially in the energy sectors
       where installations were more frequently missing allowances to cover their emissions and had also
       a larger exposure to commodity markets given the nature of their activity. On the contrary, a gross


                                                                  67
    25% of installations did not participate in any trading, reflecting a possible lack of an optimization
    strategy for installations with enough allowances to cover their needs. Financial intermediaries
    and utilities trading desks seem were very active in intermediating trades: only 12% of the volumes
    traded took place directly between two operators.


    4.3.    Concluding remarks
The choices in the allocation process made by European Member States since the inception of the EU
ETS in 2005 have modified the way the “carbon rent” created through allocation is distributed among
economic players — industries, utilities, but also governments and indirectly citizens and tax payers.
The development of auctioning is the opportunity to raise public money but also questions the use
governments will make of auction revenues. Economists have long favored the recycling of such
proceeds, under the so-called theory of “double dividend”: by increasing public spending or relieving
distorsive taxes, on labour for example, the use of auction revenues is expected to boost economic
growth. In the present times of strong public budget constraints, they are often viewed as a good
opportunity to alleviate public debt or to fund strategic projects, even if they have no link to
environment and climate change.
In parallel, European governments have committed to report on their use of auction revenues and
to dedicate at least half of them to climate-related policies. Analysis has shown some countries like
Germany will go beyond and dedicate 100% of auction proceeds to national and international climate
actions. However, the issue of the additionality of the funding remains. The German hand in case
shows that political arbitrage is needed among the range of public policies.
In particular, the changes in the allocation process raise questions regarding their impact on
European competitiveness. Because European industries are already fighting to keep market shares
on the international market, it is often feared that an additional constraint, through carbon pricing,
would make their playing field even less leveled. As recalled by Vivid Economics and Ecofys (2013),
various policy options remain available for mitigating carbon leakage, including thanks to the auction
revenues, but each one with its drawbacks:
   Provision of financial compensation to firms; it does not effectively mitigate carbon leakage and
    would have to follow European state-aid guidance to avoid creating distorsions among EU
    industrials. Nevertheless, carbon revenues might be used to finance R&D projects to prepare EU
    industries to the decreasing cap on emissions, as suggested by the European Commission on the
    model of NER300.

   Exemption of economic sectors from the trading scheme; it does not achieve the original policy
    goal of reducing carbon emissions. The exclusion of small installations from the EU ETS seeks to
    reserve the participation to the EU ETS to the cases where it is the most cost-efficient regulatory
    instrument. On the contrary, other sectors might join the EU ETS in the future if such cost-
    advantage analysis proves positive.

   Provision of free allowances to firms; it controls carbon leakage only indirectly and its
    performance has not been demonstrated in empirical studies. Nevertheless, it remains the easiest
    political solution to be implemented after the failure of the unilateral inclusion of international air
    flights. As such, it is not likely to be reconsidered on the short to medium terms.



                                                    68
Member States thus have to consider a number of parameters in their use of auction revenues. One
of them in particular is that policies funded by auction revenues face a quantitative risk linked to the
difficulty to foresee the actual amount of money raised. It pledges rather for an ex-post earmarking.
