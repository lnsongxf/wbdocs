    Foreword	

	
The office of the World Bank in the Republic of Congo is pleased to launch this publication “the Republic of
Congo Economic Update”, which reviews the main recent economic developments. It will be an annual publica-
tion and a very important aspect of the program of the World Bank in the Republic of Congo, a country with
substantial monetary reserves from nearly a decade of oil revenue boom, engaged in an ambitious program of
rehabilitation and construction of economic infrastructure, but where social indicators is slowed to improve.
This publication aims to stimulate a constructive dialogue on public policy with the country's authorities, aca-
demics, the private sector and civil society.

This first edition covers the year 2013 and the first half of 2014. Beyond the review of recent economic develop-
ments, the report highlights the main results of some analytical work of the World Bank in the Republic of Con-
go, with the aim to establish the consistency of economic policies in the medium and long-term.

This edition covers a variety of macroeconomic topics, from policies and economic indicators of the real sector
to fiscal, monetary, and external sectors. It shows that Congo's economy is growing at a weaker pace than a pace
likely to enable a faster medium-term economic and social development. However, the government could signif-
icantly reverse this trend by investing efficiently in its existing infrastructure and future projects.

While welcoming the efforts of the Congolese authorities for investment in infrastructure, we hope that this edi-
tion will provide a useful contribution to the debate on economic policies in support of the transformation of the
Republic of Congo from a low-middle income country to a high-middle income country in a medium-term hori-
zon.

Main	Points	
♦   Congo needs faster economic growth than the current growth trend, which is lower than the growth rate projected
    in the 2012-2016 National Development Plan (NDP). This unsatisfactory GDP growth is largely due to the poor
    performance of the extractive sector. However, the public investment boom appears to have contributed to the rela-
    tively strong performance of the non-oil sectors, which has counterbalanced the disappointing performance of the

♦   The Congolese economy is projected to grow at the annual rate of about 7.6 percent over the next three years in a
    context of low inflation, but the potential adverse impact of oil price and production volatility cannot be ignored.
    Moreover, the projected rate of growth is still shy of meeting the 8.5 percent average growth rate targeted by the
    National Development Plan.

♦   In 2013, the government improved the sustainability of its fiscal policy by adopting a fiscal rule. In addition, the
    government improved non-oil tax revenues by broadening the tax base and improving tax administration. Overall,
    the country enjoyed a sustained budget surplus.

♦   Government policies directed at advancing production transformation have boosted manufacturing exports in the
    last three years. However, its share of total exports remains low.

♦   The financial sector in Congo remains significantly undeveloped. In addition, banks have abundant liquidity as
    demonstrated by their large excessive reserves held in the central bank--about 25 percent of total deposits in end-
    2012, but they are having difficulties to provide credit to the private sector.

     In real terms, nonetheless, the story is a little bit different. The share of the oil sector in GDP has been falling since 2000, with an annual average
    growth of (-2.2) percent, dropping from 43.6 percent in 2000 to 23 percent in 2013.

domestic debt arrears to build up, which will weigh
heavily on prospects in the non-oil sector. In recent years,
the government disbursement system has been under pres-
sure with an important number of SMEs experiencing diffi-
culties obtaining funds to launch activities of public con-
tracts or to receive payment upon satisfactory execution of
the contract. The accumulation of internal debt by SMEs
could hamper their development and render them ineffec-

    	             Leveraging	Economic	Infrastructure		
                         for	Sustained	Growth 	




    Main	points	
•   The poor state of Congo’s economic infrastructure has led to exceptionally high input costs, which in turn has held
    back economic growth and the country’s development. In the past few years, substantial efforts have been made to
    rehabilitate the infrastructures that were severely damaged during the civil war, but their quality remains low.

•   The Congolese government is implementing an ambitious investment program to improve access to and delivery of
    basic services, and these ongoing and planned infrastructure investments have the potential to enhance Congo’s eco-
    nomic diversification by significantly reducing input costs for the country’s productive sector, and by helping to re-
    shape the economy.

•   It is essential to manage public investments efficiently to maximize the impact of using Congo’s resource wealth and
    to increase investment outcomes. Congo currently ranks 70th out of 71 surveyed countries in the Public Investment
    Index, which indicates that it needs to improve all aspects of the public investment management project cycle in order
    to maximize its return on investment.

•   The ongoing infrastructure investments alone would positively impact the country’s economic growth. However, if
    not managed well, these investments could pose a challenge to the country’s limited absorptive capacity and drive up
    building and maintenance costs. At the same time, inefficient public management of infrastructure resources can also
    reduce growth by up to 40 percent loss compared to the case in which such resources were efficiently used.

•   By focusing on improving government efficiency, Congo would be well positioned to achieve sustained and diversified
    growth. Focusing on increasing the productivity of economic infrastructure would significantly improve the growth
    outcome of these investments by providing less steam to domestic markets and therefore to infrastructure building
    costs.

•   Congo’s government can achieve better outcomes of public investments by implementing sound PFM policies. For
    example, the government could: (i) better prepare and plan investment projects before they are included in the budg-
    et; (ii) put in place systems-based commitment controls in budget execution to track public spending; (iii) speed up
    procurement procedures; and (iv) make the disbursement system more transparent.

these 10 plants, Djiri is the most important one. The con-

      Within the framework of PEEDU, investments are made to sustainably increase access to safe drinking water in Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire
and to improve management in the urban water subsector. This will be achieved through investments in Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire as well as the
provision of support to the Government and to SNDE towards technical, commercial, and ﬁnancial recovery of the SNDE. The main results ex-
pected are to: (i) expand access to basic services by supplying safe drinking water mainly through household connecƟons and standpipes; (ii) re-
duce losses and boost producƟvity; and (iii) stabilize the ﬁnancial situaƟon of the SNDE by establishing a partnership with the private sector. A
private operator (PO) has been hired under a services contract for a 4-year period. The speciﬁc objecƟves of hiring the private water operator will
be to (i) improve the knowledge of the current condiƟon of the SNDE’s physical assets and of water supply services in Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire;
(ii) support the SNDE in operaƟng the investments under the proposed project; and (iii) contribute to the company’s recovery through an increase
of its performance, which will be sought by developing its capacity on technical, commercial and ﬁnancial maƩers.

    The government is commiƩed to the reform of the electricity sector with the support of the Bank under the PEEDU. The objecƟve in restructur-
ing the electricity sector is to rearrange the main funcƟons of the sector: producƟon, transport, distribuƟon, markeƟng and rural electriﬁcaƟon. As
for the restructuring of the SNDE, its purpose is improving its economic and ﬁnancial viability so as to create favorable condiƟons for the private
sector. Three opƟons for restructuring were analyzed: (i) maintaining SNDE as verƟcally integrated undertaking; (ii) cuƫng the SNDE into separate
companies by funcƟon; (iii) cuƫng the SNDE in companies with combinaƟons of funcƟons. The Government has signed a services contract with
EDF whose purpose is to provide technical assistance to the Republic of Congo to sustainably contribute to the structuring and development of the
electricity sector and improve the performance of the SNDE.

investments for infrastructure improvement therefore needs
to be considered carefully and measures taken to ensure
that the country’s resources are used as productively as
possible.
100. Ensuring higher efficiency while slightly delaying
investments seems to be more effective in achieving
higher results. Nielsen and Lofgren (2011) find that signif-
icantly improving efficiency alone (an increase of the in-
vestment return rate by 400 percent by end 2025) could
increase average annual growth by 1.3 pp over 2010-2025.
In fact, improved efficiency implies that less capital and
labor is needed per unit produced. For example t the same
amount of recurrent spending could produce 1 percent more
services, applying to all inputs (labor, capital and interme-
diate), thereby reducing investment needs. Starting from a
low level, efficiency gains in the short- and medium-term
can be expected and could result from improved processes
for investment management (project selection and imple-
mentation in particular), but also through better cost recov-
ery for the provision of public services (Estache, 2005).

Rwanda and implement a rigorous national public in-
vestment policy that covers all aspects of public invest-
ment projects. In fact, Rwanda defined its policy on PIM in
the National Public Investment Policy Document in 2009
and rigorously implemented PFM reforms in the spirit of the
Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005) and the Accra
Agenda for Action (2008). During the implementation of the
reform, the Government of Rwanda strengthened its own
administrative capacities and actively solicited the use of its
national systems and procedures. A Public Investment Com-
mittee that has decision-making authority over the public
investment program was created. The PFM system makes
sure that future budget implications of public investments
fully account for operations and maintenance costs. All these
have helped Rwanda to improve significantly its efficiency
in public investments.
