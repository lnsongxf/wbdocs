Introduction

The emergence of global value chains (GVCs) and their rapid expansion over the past two decades has
transformed the global trade environment. GVCs involve task-based trade across multiple stages of the
production process that take place across a number of different countries, in which multiple inputs and
exports of intermediate goods and services are necessary to produce a final good, which may also be
exported. This ‚Äúsecond unbundling‚Äù of global trade2 was made possible by a combination of improved
shipping technology, revolutionary changes in ICT, and global trade liberalization which enabled
multinational firms to take advantage of differences in comparative advantage across locations to
establish integrated networks of intra and inter-firm production and trade.

GVC-oriented trade is seen to offer significant opportunities for developing countries, especially smaller
ones, to benefit from global integration by changing the nature of competitiveness. In the past, for a
country to become an apparel exporter, for example, it would need design capabilities and textile mills;
to export in the automotive sector it would need to produce engines and all subcomponents, as well as
having the scale to carry out assembly. Under the new GVC dynamics, a developing country can
specialize in certain activities (sewing, specific components or subassemblies) within the chain and trade
in intermediates. In this sense, GVCs denationalize comparative advantage3, as global lead firms
construct global production networks by exploiting the most competitive locations for specific activities.

Given this situation, and in an environment where developing countries are urged to ‚Äújoin‚Äù and
‚Äúupgrade‚Äù in GVCs4, policymakers in developing countries rightly seek to understand what it takes to do
so. And in practice this means understanding what it takes attract lead firms to place stages of the
production value-adding process in your country5. Here, the advice remains a bit less clear in several
ways. First, identifying what specific aspects of a country‚Äôs competitiveness matter most for GVC trade
remains a question. Policy advice points to things like trade facilitation, trade agreements, NTMs,
contract enforcement, and property rights protection6. On the other hand, the emergence of countries
like Bangladesh and Vietnam as major players in global production networks suggests that it may be all
about globally low wages and large labor forces; while the development of automotive value chains in
Central and Eastern Europe points more to relative wages, technology, and proximity. This points to a
second practical challenge ‚Äì the fact that what drives competitiveness in GVCs is likely to vary across
GVC sectors as well as across GVC positions (upstream or downstream). Finally, with competition for
GVC investment taking place in a truly global market, factor competitiveness relative to other countries
matters a lot.

In this context, the purpose of this note is to shed some light for policymakers, in this case specifically in
the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) countries, on where to focus efforts to drive
competitiveness for GVC participation. We do this by generating ‚Äúrevealed factor intensity‚Äù

measurements of traded goods, extending the traditional theory of factor-content of trade to account
for the factors that would be most relevant in task-based trade, and utilizing these measurements to
illustrate how underlying capabilities shape participation of SACU economies in global value chains7.

II. The factor content methodology and its extension

We draw on the methodology outlined by Shiritori, Tumurchudur and Cadot (2010), which generated
revealed factor intensities for all traded goods from 1971 to 2003 with respect to physical capital,
human capital and natural resource endowment. In this way, for example, a product exported
predominantly by countries that are richly endowed with physical capital is ‚Äúrevealed‚Äù to be intensive in
physical capital. Then we use these measurements to assess SACU‚Äôs GVC-related performance.

The revealed factor intensity for each product j for a given factor type is summarized by the following
equation:


                                                        Ì†µÌ±òÌ†µÌ±ó = ‚àë Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì†µÌ±ìÌ†µÌ±ñ
                                                                     Ì†µÌ±ñ




where fi is the factor endowment level for a given country i and the weights (w) are given by:


                                                                Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±ñ /Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ñ
                                               Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±ñ   =
                                                            ‚àëÌ†µÌ±ñ(Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±ñ /Ì†µÌ±ãÌ†µÌ±ñ )


The methodology uses a slightly modified version of revealed comparative advantage (RCA) that was
proposed by Hausman, Hwang and Rodrik (2007) in generating their measure of revealed technology
content (PRODY). This modified RCA serves as the weight in averaging the factor abundance across
countries producing a good. Whereas the denominator in Balassa‚Äôs index is the share of good j in world
trade, in this variation the denominator is the sum of export shares across countries of good j. This
ensures the weights add up to one and eliminates a problem of large RCA values when values are very
close to zero.

Nevertheless, Shiritori, Tumurchudur and Cadot (2010) mention two main limitations of use the
Balassa‚Äôs index or its variations: countries and commodities are double-counted and, secondly, they are
based on gross exports instead of net exports (exports minus imports). As the study points out, the
double-counting actually makes little difference, and therefore correcting for it is not worth the trouble.
Meanwhile, we discuss the second item in the next section.

Traditional theory of factor-content of trade is based on relative factor endowments, as expressed in the
Heckscher-Ohlin theory of trade: countries export goods intensive in the factor with which they are
relatively well-endowed. The discussion of factor endowments traditionally has been isolated to human
and physical capital. Recent studies in development economics make a strong case for treating
institutions as not only essential for development but also a factor input into the production process on
par with physical and human capital. An economy in which firms can trust in enforcement of contracts
and rule of law would be one in which economic actors can coordinate their actions. Applying the
analysis to the specific case of Eurasian economies, Lederman, Pathikonda and Rojas (2012) generated
these figures and included institutional capital as a factor endowment. In this study, we extend this
model to additional ‚Äúfactors‚Äù as there may be a slightly broader set of capabilities that determine
involvement in task-based trade.

III. Framework and Data

This is a data-intensive exercise that requires indicators to represent underlying capabilities,
disaggregated international trade data, and finally, a classification of which products are likely to be
trade within GVCs. We take up each of these in turn.

A. Identifying the factors and indicators that matter for GVCs

As noted previously, the global value chain literature is yet to give a clear picture of the drivers of GVC
participation and competitiveness. A number of studies have looked at the determinants of production
fragmentation in general8and of supply chain trade between countries9. Other studies have tested the
importance of specific drivers of GVCs, including trade policy10, transport11, trade logistics12, and time
zones13. Finally, several firm-level studies have assessed the determinants of offshoring strategies,
identifying the importance of factors like productivity and both skills and capital intensity at the firm
level14. So while these studies, along with the policy literature on GVCs, give us a sense of what factors
are likely to be important in determining GVC dynamics, the question of which specific drivers matter
most and when they matter most for country-level participation in GVCs remains open. One of the
reasons for this is that data that identifies clearly what is and is not ‚ÄúGVC trade‚Äù is still problematic,
despite the significant progress that has been made in recent years. Another reason is that there are
significant links across many of these drivers, making endogeneity problematic.

We therefore focus on a set of capabilities that are most common in the theoretical, policy, and
empirical literature on GVC trade. These are summarized in Table 1, along with the specific variables
chosen and their data sources. It is worth noting that because this analysis is carried out by looking at
global at the country and sector level, some factors that may have a big impact on GVC trade and

investment at a bilateral level ‚Äì such as preferential trade agreements, bilateral investment treaties,
common language, and time zone ‚Äì are not included.

Selection of capabilities to include in the analysis, and most importantly the specific variables chosen to
represent them, were in part dependent on country coverage (see Annex Table A1 and A2). In each case,
the most recent data point was used in the case of each dataset. Our final dataset covers 102 countries,
which together represent 81% of world trade in 2012 (Annex Table A3).

We divided our capabilities into three categories:

    ÔÇ∑   Fixed: capabilities that cannot be changed by a country.
    ÔÇ∑   Long-term policy variables: capabilities that can be changed gradually over a relatively long time
        horizon.
    ÔÇ∑   Short-term policy variables: capabilities that can be changed directly through a policy shift or
        negotiations.

Fixed capabilities include proximity to markets and natural capital. In terms of proximity to markets, we
utilized a GDP-weighted distance measure provided by CEPII. This was then indexed and reversed so
that it becomes a measure of closeness. The level of natural capital in dollar terms was provided by the
World Bank Wealth of Nations dataset, with a custom update provided for Botswana. This measure
includes subsoil assets,

Long-term policy variables include human capital, physical capital and institutional capital. Human
capital is measured as average years of school of the population ages 15 and up. This is the most
comprehensive set of human capital data available, as international PISA test scores are not available
with such country coverage. Physical capital stock per capita is based on gross fixed capital formation
estimates from the World Bank World Development Indicators, where initial capital is set by the rate of
depreciation, growth rate and population rate, and accumulation by the perpetual inventory method.
We elect to divide physical capital by the population and keep natural capital in aggregate terms
because the former can serve as a proxy for productivity while the total value of an extractable resource
is what may more likely influence investors‚Äô decisions rather than how it compares to the size of the
population. The level of institutions is given by the World Governance Indicators‚Äô rule-of-law rating. This
is an incomplete measure of institutional strength, as the WGI itself also covers voice and accountability,
political stability and absence of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality and control of
corruption. In practice, however, these measures are highly correlated and we choose the measure that
may best relate to the strength of the business environment.

Short-term policy variables include logistics/connectivity, wage competitiveness, market access and
access to inputs. Logistics capabilities are given the Logistics Performance Index (LPI), a widely known
and cited international rating system by the World Bank. There is some overlap between this measure
and proximity to markets. Wages are measured by the World Bank Doing Business minimum legal wage.
Although unit labor costs were preferred as a measure of productivity-adjusted wages, there is no
database with sufficient coverage of countries to be suitable for the dataset. Finally, market access and
access to inputs are taken from the estimates generated by Kee, Nicita and Olarreaga (2008, 2009), who

B. Underlying product-level trade data

The analysis used disaggregated trade data from 2012 at the six-digit HS 1998 classification. The data are
tabulated using importer records, which are considered to be more accurate than the corresponding
exporter records. Shiritori, Tumurchudur and Cadot (2010) took the additional step of accounting for
agricultural distortions. We also remove country-product pairs with nonzero nominal rates of assistance,
the rationale being that export and production subsidies would otherwise distort the revealed factor
intensities of products.




                                                                 5
Our methodology does not adjust for the use of imported inputs for the production of export goods.
Using value-added data15 or net exports would not be consistent with the goals of this analysis, which is
aimed at assessing participation in GVC networks.

Value-added data would be more appropriate to use in explaining the extent to which the country was
involved in global value chains. To use an illustration, during the 2000s, the small South Caucasus
country of Armenia was involved in cutting and polishing imported raw diamonds and sending them
onward to Belgium and Israel. This activity ultimately declined. From our perspective we would be
interested in knowing that Armenia was first involved and then lost that business. Even in the height of
Armenia‚Äôs diamond trade, the activity from a value-added perspective was quite minimal given the high
value of the raw diamonds, but participation in this production network was robust and we would want
to take proper account of it.

Furthermore, if we were to net out imports from exports in the same product line, this would not
account for robust intra-industry trade taking place among the largest exporters. Additionally, the
databases available are not available at the level of disaggregation (~5000 products) that we take
advantage of by using trade data. Finally, as described in a recent survey paper by Amador and Cabral
(2014), the advantage of using this method as opposed to the value-added method from input-output
tables is the high country coverage and comparability between countries.

C. Classification of individual ‚ÄúGVC products‚Äù

The designation of GVC products is taken from lists generated by Athukorala (2010)16 and Sturgeon and
Memedov (2011). Athukorala uses a list of parts and components in the UN Broad Economic
Classification (BEC) Registry and the product list of the WTO Information Technology Agreement with
the harmonized system (HS) of trade classification at the 6-digit level. The author then relied on firm-
level surveys from Thailand and Malaysia to fill gaps in the list. Therefore, the list has a bias toward the
products that made up the network activities in Southeast Asia at that time. The list has been used a
number of times to measure GVC trade, as in a recent paper by Wignaraga, Kruger and Tuazon (2013).

Separately, Sturgeon and Memedov (2011) compiled a list of GVC-related products, with broader
sectoral coverage. They begin with modifying the BEC registry, combining capital and consumption
goods into a single ‚Äúfinal goods‚Äù category. They isolate ‚Äútrue‚Äù (differentiated, customized, product-


15
   Value-added data has been collected at a sectoral level in such databases as the World Input-Output Database
(WIOD), UNCTAD‚Äôs EORA database, and the Trade in Value Added (TiVA) database. A recent study (African
Development Bank, 2014) took the approach of calculating GVC participation using the EORA database defined as
the sum of backward and forward integration as a share of gross exports. (Backward integration is the share of
foreign value added in a country‚Äôs exports, and forward integration is the share of a country‚Äôs value -added exports
that are embedded in the exports of other countries.)

set of products coded by Sturgeon and Memedovic (2011). Athukorala coded a greater number of network
products, although mainly focused on parts and components. There was only minor overlap between the two
coding systems.

specific) intermediates out of the BEC classification. This list has greater industry coverage of clothing
and textiles than Athukorala‚Äôs list.

To get the largest measure of GVC products, we combine the two lists. The original lists by Athukorala in
HS 1996 nomenclature and Sturgeon and Memedov in SITC Revision 3 nomenclature were converted to
HS1988/92 nomenclature using a concordance table. In total, the Athukorala provide 500 codes and the
Sturgeon and Memedov provide 860 codes at the HS 1998/92 six-digit classification. Duplicate codes
were removed to yield a total of 1237 product codes (see Annex Table 5 for a breakdown of products by
sector).

There are shortcomings in utilizing these lists. Most importantly, they do not take into account the
expansion of network activities after they were composed. Agri-food cross-border value chains have
become increasingly important, for example, and provide opportunities for developing countries, but we
do not take these sectors into account. The list of products is isolated to manufacturing sectors.
Additionally, by looking at products that are most likely to be traded within production networks
globally, we ignore any production sharing that may occur based on the unique capabilities of a certain
country or set of countries.

Based on this coding scheme, Table 2 shows the value of GVC exports for SACU and comparator regions.
SACU countries produce less than 3 percent of the value that ASEAN exports and about 4 percent of

This remainder of this paper is structured as follows. First, we investigate what capabilities matters for
participation in GVCs. Then, we outline how SACU countries fare on these capabilities. Finally, we take
up the issue of how SACU countries have performed with the endowments they have and which sectors
may be most consistent with existing capabilities.

A. What capabilities matter for GVC trade?

     In this paper, we refer to Eastern Europe as EU11 countries plus Turkey.

The previous section gave a preview of the capabilities assessed in this study and the indicators used to
represent them. We can then assess the extent to which these capabilities vary with one another. The
two fixed endowments are not correlated with each other: natural capital and proximity to markets
have largely no relationship. However, many of the capabilities considered changeable endowments are
correlated to one another (Table A5). Physical capital and institutions have a correlation coefficient
above 0.8, meaning that these largely occur together across countries. As for the policy variables, wage
competitiveness and logistics are highly negatively correlated with each other, but the other variables
have little or no linear relationship.

We run a test of statistical significance between GVC products and non-GVC products on each capability.
Table 2 shows that all of these capabilities except wage competitiveness are generally important in the
export of products known to be traded within production networks (‚ÄúGVC products‚Äù). This is illustrated
by the greater intensity of GVC products compared to non-GVC products for each indicator type, except
low wages. Countries with low wages are not more likely to be involved in global value chains.

Table 3 shows the differences between final and intermediate products. Intermediate products have a
greater intensity of capabilities, except natural capital, wage competitiveness and access to inputs. This
aligns with our understanding of the evolution of production networks in Eastern Europe, for example,
where only after years of assembly of imported car components did countries begin to produce and
then export car parts.

B. How do SACU countries rate on these capabilities?

SACU countries vary on these capabilities. On the level of human capital as measured by the average
years of schooling, Botswana and South Africa score high, while Namibia lags behind. South Africa‚Äôs total
natural capital far outpaces other countries, with Botswana in a distant second. In terms of physical
capital per capita, Botswana and South Africa have a substantial lead over the other countries. Having
had success managing revenues from resource extraction, Botswana‚Äôs institutions are rated ahead of
the other countries, including South Africa, with Lesotho and Swaziland lagging behind the others in this
area. Geographically, of course, all countries are in a similar situation. South Africa is a much more
sophisticated logistical hub, however. South Africa, being a more industrialized country, has a higher
minimum wage, which should be seen in the context of its higher productivity. In terms of market access
and access to inputs, all countries are in a favorable position, except for Swaziland on market access.

To put the above figures in context, Figure 1a and 1b show the standardized capability levels and
compared to two regions of major importance in global value chains, ASEAN and Eastern Europe. South
Africa is separated from the rest of SACU given its size and level of industrialization. Because the figures
are standardized, capabilities can be compared to one another and read in terms of standard deviations




                                                                           9
from the average country. Once standardized, we show the difference between the standardized
capability level of the SACU countries and that of comparator regions to create a ‚Äúcapability gap‚Äù.

South Africa has several advantages relative to ASEAN and Eastern Europe: logistics, natural capital,
market access and access to inputs. The figures illustrate the large distance from markets for South
Africa, particularly relative to Eastern Europe. South Africa also lags behind the two other regions in
terms of physical capital per capita and wage competitiveness. South Africa has better level of human
capital and institutions than ASEAN on average, but lower levels of these two capabilities than Eastern
Europe on average.

We repeat the same exercise with the average of the Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho and Swaziland. These
countries fare worse than South Africa but they are not without some advantages relative to
comparators. These countries are more competitive than South Africa on wages. BLNS countries also
have better access to inputs relative to both comparators and more highly rated institutions than ASEAN
countries on average. On the other hand, BLNS countries have, on average, lower levels of logistics
capabilities, market access and natural capital than comparators, all of which are strengths for South
Africa.

C. How has SACU performed in GVC trade given its mix of capabilities?

The transformation from endowments to exports is not automatic. For SACU countries, we compare the
intensity on each capability throughout a country‚Äôs export basket against the underlying abundance of
that capability. Each of the five countries‚Äô nine capabilities is represented by points on Figure 3. The
standardized level of each capability is measured along the x-axis, and the extent to which each of these
nine capabilities is represented in the export basket (‚Äúaverage revealed capability intensity‚Äù) is
measured by the y-axis. For a given trade flow, the average revealed capability intensity is a weighted
average derived by multiplying the revealed intensity of a product in a capability by that product‚Äôs share
in a given trade flow and summing across the entire basket. This is analogous to the EXPY calculation of
Hausmann, Hwang and Rodrik (2007).

We can see an upward trend, showing that as a country has a greater endowment of a capability, that
capability is more likely to be represented in its export basket. This is not a surprising result, but the
figure also shows dispersion around the trend line and several instances where an endowment is not
‚Äúexpressed‚Äù. Many of the instances where endowment is not ‚Äúexpressed‚Äù are related to Botswana. The
overwhelming preponderance of diamond exports may be producing this result.

Are SACU countries out-performing or under-performing their capabilities? Table 5 compares each SACU
country‚Äôs ranking on a particular capability with the country‚Äôs ranking on its averaged revealed capability
intensity. As shown previously, we generally expect that the abundance of a capability shows up in
exports intensive in that capability. The deviation from the global rank in abundance and the global rank
in export intensity can be exploited to see how countries are faring in turning capabilities into exports.
We show the difference between the ranking of each SACU country‚Äôs capability level against the rank of


                                                                                  12
the average revealed capability intensity of exports, with a positive number denoting that a country is
outperforming its capabilities and a negative number indicating that a country is under-performing.

The results present a mixed picture across endowments, but with some useful takeaways across
countries. Focusing on the most important capabilities (as shown in Table 2), Swaziland is doing far
better than its endowment levels would suggest. South Africa, Lesotho and Namibia are doing roughly
on par with their endowment levels, while Botswana is lagging given its endowment levels.

D. Which GVC sectors should SACU countries target based on their current capabilities? What sectors
could they participate in with greater capabilities?

To understand the current situation and prospects for SACU countries more deeply, we now
disaggregate GVC products by industry and products. We sub-divide the entire product universe into 17
sectors, of which GVC products span 12 of these. Table 6 shows the sectoral breakdown and the value of
global trade by sector in 2012. The two-digit codes refer to the first two digits of the HS chapter. GVC
trade is dominated by the machinery/electronics and transportation sectors. The sectors with the
greatest trade value are not necessarily those for which GVC intensity is greatest. We define ‚ÄúGVC
intensity‚Äù as the share that GVC trade comprises in world trade within that sector.

Each GVC sector may also be broken down between final and intermediate products. Intermediates
have been shown to take up an increasingly large portion of global trade in recent years (citation
needed). Table 7 shows the breakdown between final products and intermediate products within each
GVC sector. Many sectors are aligned with only one GVC position (final or intermediate). Clothing (final)
is downstream of textiles (intermediate), for example. For other sectors such as transportation, there is
a more equal split between final products and intermediates in world trade: 25 percent of
transportation products are final products and 75 percent are intermediate products.

*These sectors have a substantial number of both final and intermediate GVC products and are therefore broken up in later tables.

Any GVC product ‚Äì as well as any other product ‚Äì requires a particular mix of capabilities to be
produced. GVC participation is to a great extent the result of the available mix of capabilities in the
economy. The series of radar charts presented in Figure 6 help illustrate the difference between SACU‚Äôs
‚Äúendowments‚Äù and the capabilities required by GVC products. Each of the nine capabilities is a separate
direction on the spider chart. The units of the axes are standard deviations. The two lines presented

The figures show the distance between SACU‚Äôs capabilities and the capabilities required for participation
in the largest sectors of GVC trade. In the subsequent section of the paper, we quantify the total
distance between what is available and what is required as a ‚Äúsimilarity index.‚Äù Taking
machinery/electronics, for example, SACU‚Äôs capabilities are substantially below what is required to
produce in this sector except in two areas: access to inputs and wage competitiveness. On the other
hand, existing capabilities seem to be more aligned with clothing and textiles.

The following tables show the total gap between SACU‚Äôs current capabilities and the capabilities
required to export within a GVC sector. We rank the sectors on this ‚Äúsimilarity index.‚Äù In this index, the
lower the score is, the greater the similarity between existing and required capabilities. This similarity
index is weighted by the importance of a given capability for a sector, so that if a capability like physical
capital is more important for a producing within a sector, the gap between the physical capital that is
available and what is required takes on greater importance.



                                                                15
We show the sectors that are within one standard deviation and two standard deviations. Neither
should be taken as an absolute threshold for participation. None of the scores are below zero because
an "excess" capability in one area does not cancel out a deficit in another area. The reason that not all
sectors are in play is the role of fixed endowments.

We include both final and intermediates, and where applicable, we divide final products from
intermediates. Four sectors (footwear, machinery/electronics, transportation and miscellaneous
manufactured articles) were broken up in this way. The products within a sector are weighted according
to their share of the product‚Äôs trade value.

We show several scenarios as listed below. In the simulations two through five, if a country‚Äôs capabilities
are lower than the listed threshold, they were replaced by a higher capability level. If they are higher
initially, they remain the same.

         1.   Current capabilities19
         2.   Only short-term policy variables20 raised to the median
         3.   Both short- and long-term policy variables21 raised to the median
         4.   Both short- and long-term policy variables raised to the 60th percentile
         5.   Both short- and long-term policy variables raised to the 75th percentile

The results show that clothing and leather goods are the GVC exports most closely aligned with current
capabilities. From the starting point, South Africa and Botswana have capabilities closer to some of the
biggest GVC sectors by value such as machinery/electronics and transportation, while the other three
countries are relatively further away. This is denoted by the similarity scores below 3 for all sectors for
these two countries.

When short-term policy variables are placed at the median, more sectors are in play for Swaziland and
Lesotho. It does not change the picture much for South Africa. Bringing long-term policy variables as
well to the median lowers the distance to the sectors requiring greatest capabilities. Capabilities at the
75th percentile bring an even greater number of sectors under one standard deviation, including
machinery/electronics, wood and footwear.

It is important to note that interaction between the capabilities is not fully accounted for here. For
example, if physical capital per capita is raised to the 90th percentile, then wage competitiveness, by the
measurement we are using, would decrease, not increase. Because of that, we do not simulate any
changes in a country‚Äôs wage competitiveness, but instead leave it where it is.

The results illustrate an important message about feasible participation. Textiles, for example, appear on
the export horizon for several SACU countries, but then the sector never seems appears within one


19
    Two measurements are missing in the original databases and these gaps were filled in the following way. Namibia‚Äôs wage
competitiveness is assumed to be no better than Swaziland, and Swaziland‚Äôs logistics are assumed to be the same as Lesotho‚Äôs.
20
    Short-term policy variables are logistics, market access and access to inputs. We elect to leave wage competitiveness where
it is.
21
    Long-term policy variables are human capital, physical capital and institutional capital.


                                                              16
standard deviation even at the 75th percentile of capabilities because SACU‚Äôs fixed endowments are not
favorable for this sector. For nearly all countries, this story applies to footwear as well.

The results also provide a surprising story about final versus intermediate GVC exports. While
intermediates generally tend to have a greater intensity in many capabilities (referring back to Table 3),
within sectors divided between final and intermediates, intermediate exports of machinery/electronics
appear ahead of final products. This does not align with the conventional understanding of production
networks in which intermediates are seen as more sophisticated than final assembly. Certain
intermediates in this sector may indeed be in play before final products.

V. Concluding Remarks

   ÔÇ∑   GVC participation is based on a variety of factors, but logistics, proximity to markets and
       institutions seem to be most important.
   ÔÇ∑   SACU‚Äôs low participation in GVCs can be traced back to the level of capabilities these countries
       have. Nearly all SACU countries are either performing roughly at the expected level.
   ÔÇ∑   SACU countries can remove or counteract deficiencies that have thus far left them out of
       production networks.
   ÔÇ∑   Increasing capabilities can lead to increasing participation in manufacturing sectors. Initially this
       relates to participation in sectors like clothing and footwear and over the long-term in sectors
       like machinery/electronics.
