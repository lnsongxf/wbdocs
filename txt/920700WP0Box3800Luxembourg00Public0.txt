THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

      A private limited liability company must be incorporated before a

      of incorporation which includes the articles of association of the
      company. Model of articles of association may be found on Internet
      (the national Chamber of Commerce’s E-space Entreprises information                             EUR 1,000+ EUR 75

      * Apply for business license

      This license/permit is issued by the Ministry of Middle Classes for a
      commercial activity or by the Ministry of Economy for industrial
      activities upon request and on proof of knowledge of business
      management.

      To apply for a business license, promoters must submit the following
      documents:
      • Application form (completed and signed) for an establishment permit.
      • Tax stamp for EUR 24 EUR (This varies from EUR 24 to EUR 2,500,
      depending on the type of activity. 24 EUR refers to a sales/trade
      company). The amount can be transferred to the national Giro account
      (CCP) of the Registration and Domains Administration (Administration           15 days,
4     de l’Enregistrement et des Domaines): LU47 1111 0087 9262 0000, with      (simultaneous  with         EUR 24
      the reference: “Office Fee for Establishment Permit [ENTER APPLICANT’S       procedure  3)
      NAME].” In this case, proof of payment must be presented. The tax
      stamp can also be obtained from the E-space Entreprises information
      center.
      • For non-residents and persons residing in Luxembourg for fewer than
      10 years, a recent notarized certificate of non-bankruptcy.
      • Articles of association (executed or draft) for a commercial company.
      • School certificates or professional diplomas (certified by the
      institution) required for the intended activity. Otherwise, proof of
      relevant professional experience such as an EU certificate or certificate
      of registration with a social security authority.
      • An affidavit on the exercise of any management posts previously held
      in Luxembourg, for verification of non-bankruptcy.
      • The applicant’s identity card (copy).

      • The applicant’s police record or affidavit. Note: This applies to non-
      residents and persons residing in Luxembourg for less than 10 years. In
      practice, the Ministry of the Economy and Foreign Trade tends however
      to request the provision of a police record or affidavit to every applicant
      although not required as such.

      The business permit application can be submitted before executing the
      notary deed because the Ministry of the Economy checks the draft
      articles of association—the company name, business purpose, and
      identity of directors and officers for compliance with the provisions of
      the applicable law. Generally, the business license/establishment permit
      application and notary deed processes start more or less at the same
      time and are pursued simultaneously. Although the company
      incorporation process requires a notary, the founder may directly
      register the company with different administrations and obtain
      identification numbers and the business license/establishment permit.

      Since October 2011, business license requests can be handed in online
      at www.guichet.lu. The required documents are the same ones. They all
      need to be transformed into a PDF and attached to the online form. In
      order to be able to deposit the business license online, the applicant is
      required to have a LUXTRUST certificate in order to sign the application
      form electronically.

       After signing a sale agreement ("compromis de vente") between each
       other, as per common practice, the parties will visit a civil law notary so
       he can draft and authenticate the notarial deed. The sale is complete
       between the parties, and ownership is acquired as of right by the buyer
       with respect to the seller, as soon as the property and the price have
       been agreed upon, although the property has not yet been delivered or
       the price paid (Article 1583 of the Civil Code). As a sale of real estate
       must be registered (which triggers the payment of registration taxes) and
       recorded in the mortgage registry in order to be enforceable vis-à-vis
       third parties and as only duly certified deeds may be entered in the
       register, the sale must be recorded in a notarial deed ("acte de vente").                    4 EUR stamp per

uses several assumptions about the case:
