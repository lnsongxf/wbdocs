     1. Strategic Framework
        In the Former Yugoslav Republic (FYR) of Macedonia, the government is the
        strongest advocate and initiator for strengthening workforce development (WfD).
        However, Macedonia’s top-down approach to WfD policy has not engendered
        coordination among government agencies and non-government stakeholders.
        This has impeded the establishment of institutionalized mechanisms for ensuring
        an efficient and rational approach to WfD and an efficient utilization of the
        capacities of state institutions. Social dialogue is the weakest component of this
        dimension, as it is still insufficiently developed.

     2. System Oversight
        Numerous reform efforts have been undertaken in the last decade to increase
        the attractiveness and relevance of vocational education and training (VET) to
        the labor market, yet the VET system remains in a transitional stage. The
        country has embarked on processes to develop standards of qualification,
        changes in the structure of the VET system, quality assurance, expansion of the
        network of providers, and diversification of pathways for education and training,
        but it will take time for these initiatives to generate the desired effects.

     3. Service Delivery
        The relevance of training programs is high on the policy agenda; however, the
        results are still not at a satisfactory level. Despite a number of good practices
        and initiatives at the central level, there are consistent mismatches between
        education supply and labor demand. Collaboration between the business sector
        and training providers has been weak, something that has negative implications
        for the relevance of the education supply. Existing opportunities for business to
        become more involved have not been sufficiently utilized. Efforts are being made
        to develop and continuously enhance standards of delivery through education
        reform, legislative change, and the development of mechanisms for support to
        public and private providers.

Implementing the Analysis
Information for the analysis is gathered using a
structured SABER-WfD Data Collection Instrument
(DCI). The instrument is designed to collect, to the
extent possible, facts rather than opinions about
WfD policies and institutions. For each topic, the
DCI poses a set of multiple choice questions which
are answered based on documentary evidence and
interviews with knowledgeable informants. The
answers allow each topic to be scored on a four-
point scale against standardized rubrics based on
available knowledge on global good practice (See
Figure 2).4 Topic scores are averaged to produce
policy goal scores, which are then aggregated into

This chapter highlights findings from the
assessment of Macedonia’s WfD system based on
the SABER-WfD analytical framework and tool. The
focus is on policies, institutions, and practices in
three important functional dimensions of
policymaking and implementation: strategic
framework, system oversight, and service delivery.
Because these aspects collectively create the
operational environment in which individuals, firms,
and training providers (both state and non-state)
make decisions with regard to training, they exert
an important influence on observed outcomes in
skills development. Strong systems of WfD have
institutionalized processes and practices for
reaching agreement on priorities, for collaboration
and coordination, and for generating routine
feedback that sustains continuous innovation and
improvement. By contrast, weak systems are               Source: Authors’ analysis of data from the SABER-WfD questionnaire.

these bodies for collaboration among government
and other stakeholders is the Economic and Social

convened for the first time in 2010 as a forum for
tripartite coordination among the government, the

and Employers' Organization of Macedonia. The
VET and AE Centres, which by law include
representatives of employers, the government,
local authorities, trade unions, and the ESARM, are
both important bodies for proposing strategies,
standards, qualifications, policies and intervention

Another recent demand-focused mechanism is the
conclusion of cooperation agreements between
education/training providers and industry, such as
the Joint Protocol for Collaboration with Social
Partners in VET, which was signed on a national
level (between MoES, MoLSP, trade unions, and
chambers of         commerce);    and    individual
memoranda for cooperation, which were signed by
universities, chambers and companies (for higher
education) and by the VET Centre, chambers, and
associations (for secondary VET).

and competencies. This can only be achieved
through the introduction of a high degree of
flexibility in the approach to and delivery of
education services. In turn, the introduction of
flexible pathways to learning requires the
integration of formal, non-formal, and informal
learning and the development of an institutional
basis for continuing education and lifelong learning.
Such increasingly numerous and flexible learning
and training pathways will enhance VET’s
attractiveness, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness
and contribute to making the concept of lifelong
learning a reality.
The TVET system can further be strengthened by
adapting curricula to meet regional and local
demands and individual needs, introducing modular
learning and training programs, establishing new
competence-based programs, introducing a system
for the accumulation and transfer of credits, and
increasing the availability and quality of post-
secondary VET.

       The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) initiative
       produces comparative data and knowledge on education policies and
       institutions, with the aim of helping countries systematically strengthen
       their education systems. SABER evaluates the quality of education
       policies against evidence-based global standards, using new diagnostic
       tools and detailed policy data. The SABER country reports give all
       parties with a stake in educational results—from administrators,
       teachers, and parents to policymakers and business people—an
       accessible, objective snapshot showing how well the policies of their
       country's education system are oriented toward ensuring that all
       children and youth learn.

       This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of Workforce
       Development.
