1.1 Growth: a er almost two years of recession, Russia entered a path to recovery
Global growth and trade started to strengthen at the end of 2016. Russia’s economy showed signs
of overcoming the recession caused by the shocks of low oil prices and economic sanctions. Tradable
sectors benefitted from the relative price adjustment and stabilizing commodity prices in the second half
of 2016 and became the main drivers of economic growth, partly through increased exports. There was
positive momentum in non-tradable sectors as well, which slowed the pace of contraction compared to
2015. The incipient positive momentum appears to have spilled into early 2017.

Part 1. Recent Economic Developments


Box 1:              Varying implica ons of an oil price shock: Russia had adapted well compared to other oil
                    exporters
  Oil prices plunged by 77% from June 2014 to January 2016, severely undermining the activities of energy exporters.
  However, the macroeconomic implications of the shock varied across countries. This box reports the divergences among oil
  exporters to provide a cross-country perspective on the situation in Russia.

  Exchange-rate flexibility plays a key role in cushioning an export-price shock (IMF 2016). Figure B1-1 shows the impact of
  the oil price shock on growth, measured by the change in growth forecasts before the oil price shock and after the oil price
  shock for countries with and without flexible exchange rates, and for Russia. Figures B1-2 and B1-3 shows the impact on
  inflation and the current account. While the 2014-15 period marked most of the decline in oil prices, countries with an
  inflexible exchange-rate regime experienced modest decline in growth, due in part to supportive fiscal measures and an
  absence of high inflation. However, current accounts in inflexible exchange-rate regimes worsened significantly during the
  same period. Furthermore, by 2017, growth declined sharply in these economies. Five years after the oil shock, growth is
  expected to continue to drag. In contrast, countries with flexible exchange-rate regimes experienced both an earlier and
  smaller decline in growth, with growth expected to broadly recover in the five years following the shock. The implications
  for the current account were minimal.

  For Russia, growth adjustment happened earlier than for many oil exporters, reflecting the early impact of economic
  sanctions and the high inflation associated with the introduction of a floating exchange-rate regime. Exchange-rate pass-
  through is high when monetary policy credibility is not well established (Carriere-Swallow et al, 2016). Stabilizing exchange
  rates and inflation contributed to the V-shape recovery in 2016-17, reflecting increasing monetary credibility in Russia.

 Notes:
 1-3) Samples are energy-exporting emerging economies and frontier markets. Exchange-rate regime classification is as of 2014, and inflexible exchange rates
 include peg and no separate legal tender. Countries with flexible exchange rates include Colombia, Ghana, and Indonesia. Countries with inflexible exchange rates
 include Bahrein, Bolivia, Ecuador, Gabon, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. Azerbaijan, Nigeria, Malaysia, and Kazakhstan are excluded from the
 sample because they are managed floats. Numbers are median of each country group. 2014-2015 data is the difference between the actual figures and forecasts.
 2016-2019 data shows the difference in forecasts. The negative number indicates downward revision.
 1) Change of GDP growth forecast by IMF from March 2014 to March 2017.
 2) Change of inflation forecast by IMF from March 2014 to March 2017.
 3) Change of current account forecast (percent of GDP) by IMF from March 2014 to March 2017.


  In the Europe and Central Asia region, in addition to Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan moved toward more exchange-rate
  flexibility (Figure B1-4,5,6). The Russian ruble started to depreciate in late 2014, which led to the acceleration of inflation and
  a growth slowdown in 2015. Conversely, depreciation of the Kazakh tenge and the Azerbaijani manat started in 2015, and
  inflation picked up in 2016. While the adjustments to the low oil prices are close to complete in 2017 for Russia, adjustments
  in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan are expected to continue in 2017 and beyond. Currency depreciation and economic slowdown

1.2 Balance of payments: stable despite substan al external vola lity
Despite adverse terms-of-trade conditions in 2016 and continued restrictions on Russia’s access
to international capital markets, the balance of payment remained stable, with the REER slightly
depreciating. The current account surplus shrank as the trade surplus decreased on lower export
receipts, especially in the first half of the year. An incipient import recovery was an additional negative
factor for the trade balance in the second half of 2016. Meanwhile, net capital outflows decreased on
the back of lower debt payments. Relatively tight monetary policy increased interest in ruble assets and
limited net capital outflows. Improved terms-of-trade conditions helped the current account in the first
quarter of 2017, which translated into larger net capital outflows.

The current account, which remained in surplus, was                                                                                           bottomed out by mid-2016 (Figure 12). In the

   As Figure B2-1 shows, over the past nine years, ULC* in Russia grew by about 2.5 times, compared to 2007 (2007 levels are
   set to 100). As the same figure shows, the growth of ULC across sectors in Russia was not uniform, with the fastest growth
   in mining, and the slowest in the financial sector. Growth in agriculture and manufacturing was lower than average for the
   economy in the period 2007-2016.

   The sharp ruble depreciation in response to the terms of trade shock of 2014 resulted in substantial improvement in Russia’s
   competitiveness with respect to the OECD countries. Bilateral Real Exchange Rates (RERs), calculated with a change in ULC
   in the manufacturing sector as a measure of inflation, depreciated substantially in 2014. Nevertheless, even accounting for
   this depreciation, as Figure B2-2 shows, Russia’s competitiveness with respect to many comparators remains relatively low
   (recent RERs exceed the 2007 levels set to 100 for France, Spain, Czech Republic, for example). This suggests that growing
   ULCs are pulling down competitiveness, despite the benefits of the ruble depreciation.

  * Unit labor costs is one indicator to track changes in competitiveness over time. ULCs are defined as the average cost of labor per unit
  of output produced. According to the OECD definition, ULC is ratio of “total labor compensation per hour worked” to “output per hour
  worked” (labor productivity). For the sectoral analysis in Russia analyses, we used a simplified approach due to lack of data of total labor
  compensation in Russian statistics. ULCs are calculated as average formal wages in sector multiplied by number of employed and divided
  by real gross values added in the sector.



1.4 Monetary Policy: gradual monetary easing amidst an uncertain and vola le
external environment
Monetary policy remains prudent and consistent with inflation targeting. A moderately tight monetary
stance helped reduce the average inflation rate from 15.6 percent in 2015 to 7.1 percent in 2016.
Headline inflation almost reached the end-year target of 4 percent as early as April 2017, falling to 4.1
percent, y/y. Recognizing that several one-off factors supported the reduction in headline inflation, the
Bank of Russia pursued a cautious approach to monetary easing as inflation expectations, although
following a downward trend, remained elevated.

The Bank of Russia pursued a measured approach to                              at 9.25 percent following the most recent cut of 50 bps
monetary easing in 2016 and in the first quarter of                            in April 2017, when CPI inflation fell to 4.1 percent y/y.

1.6 Government Budget: important ac ons have been taken in prepara on for a
new ﬁscal rule
In 2016, the federal and general government’s fiscal deficits grew on the back of lower oil prices.
However, the authorities contained the fiscal deterioration by consolidating expenditures and mobilizing
some revenues (including from the privatization of Rosneft). In preparation for the introduction of the
fiscal rule, the government passed a three-year federal budget law for 2017-2019, which emphasized
fiscal consolidation and introduced a system of currency interventions in the domestic market. Adoption
of the fiscal rule is expected to smoothen the influence of external volatility on the budget and the real
exchange rate.


The federal budget’s primary deficit widened in 2016                  Expenditure consolidation was an important plank
but remained contained. The primary deficit grew                      for containing the deficit. Compared to 2015, the

  The draft version of the fiscal ruIe is linked to a base oil price of US$40/bbl in real terms. Federal budget expenditures would
  be capped by the sum of three components:

  (i) oil and gas revenues at base oil price and corresponding exchange rate;

  (ii) non-oil and gas revenues in accordance with the baseline scenario, and

  (iii) interest payments.

  Oil and gas revenues deriving from an above-the-baseline oil price would be saved in the Reserve Fund, with extra non-oil
  and gas revenues used to pay off debt (and vice versa). In addition, if the size of the Reserve Fund will not exceed 5 percent
  of GDP, spending from the Reserve Fund cannot go beyond 1 percent of GDP. This condition establishes an additional limit
  on expenditures when the oil price is below the base price.

  The fiscal rule aims to support fiscal sustainability and smooth the impact of oil price volatility on the real exchange rate,
  budget system, and domestic demand.

  * The proposed fiscal rule is planned to be included to the amendments to the Budget Code in 2017.

THE OUTLOOK FOR THREE YEARS:
GROWTH PROSPECTS ARE MODEST

A moderate recovery of the global economy is expected for 2017, on the back of continued solid growth
by commodity importers and a pickup in commodity exporters during the year. Russia is heading toward
a moderate growth rate over the 2017-to-2019 period (between 1.3% and 1.4%), supported by rising oil
prices and macroeconomic stability.

Box 5:         The Russian oil sector: Increasing produc on and exports despite headwinds

  Russia, the world’s third-largest oil producer after the United States and Saudi Arabia, accounts for over 12 percent of
  global oil supplies (Figure B5-1). It exports nearly 8 million barrels per day (mb/d), only marginally less than Saudi Arabia’s
  oil exports (by contrast, the United States imports around 12 mb/d). Russia accounts for a little over 3 percent of global
  consumption (Figure B5-2), and Russian oil consumption has been relatively stable during the past two decades at around
  3 mb/d. Thus, all growth in production goes for exports. Oil and oil products accounted for about 40 percent of Russian
  merchandise exports in 2015. Oil is also the largest source of tax revenue to the Russian economy.

  Russian oil consumption, which had been relatively stable at 2.7 mb/d during 1996-2010, began increasing and reached
  3.3 mb/d in 2014. However, the recession, along with economic sanctions, exerted downward pressure on domestic oil
  consumption in 2015.Russian oil production still increased during the past 2 years by 0.19 mb/d in 2015 and 0.25 mb/d in
  2016 and reached a record 11.34 mb/d in 2016.

  A further, (though marginal) increase in Russian oil production is also expected in 2017, but the larger cuts in production will
  decelerate the production growth. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), production growth reflected higher
  production by small- and medium-size producers (including Gazpromneft, Novatek, Tatneft, Russneft, and Bashneft) as well
  as deceleration in decline rates across mature fields. Such growth was a result of investment in upstream activity thanks to
  the ruble devaluation, lower tax rates, and lower input costs. Total oil production is expected to increase to 11.38 mb/d in
  2017 and peak at 11.54 mb/d in 2018, as new projects (including Lukoil’s Filanovskoe, Gazpromneft/Russneft’s Messoyakha,
  Gazpromneft’s Novoport, and Russneft’s Suzunskoe) will more than offset brownfield declines. Production is projected to
  decline marginally thereafter (Figure B5-3).

  In late 2016, Russia, along with Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, and Oman, agreed to join OPEC on production cuts to ease
  a supply glut and eventually support prices. Russia agreed to a 0.3 mb/d cut, beginning in January 2017 (OPEC and non-
  OPEC producers agreed to cut 1.2 mb/d and 0.56 mb/d, respectively). Russia’s cuts, which were expected to be gradual,
  were calculated over October 2016 production levels of 11.6 mb/d. Russia’s compliance was at 40 percent in January and
  February, increasing to 58 percent in March (or 0.174 mb/d) and 78 percent in April (Figure B5-4). Whether the agreement
  will be extended to the second half of 2017 will be decided during the May 25 OPEC meeting. Russian officials have expressed
  public support for a likely extension.

Box 6:
               increase, but opportuni es remain to improve land and capital produc vity.

  This box examines selected factors, namely the productivity and profitability of farms, to interpret drivers and bottlenecks
  for agriculture-sector performance in Russia. The Ruslana database was used to assess the performance of farms in two
  priority livestock sectors: pork production and dairy farming. These are priority sectors for agricultural development and
  have been the focus of much policy attention since the 2000s. The two samples paint a representative picture of the
  performance of small, medium and large agro-enterprises.

  Both sectors – pork production and dairy farming – have demonstrated significant growth since 2007. Revenue growth in
  real terms between 2007 and 2016 was more than 200 percent for dairy and more than 1,000 percent for the pork industry.
  The largest growth in revenues was reported by large agro-enterprises, with averages of 40 percent per annum in the dairy
  sector and 150-200 percent per annum in the pork sector. More than the capital-intensive dairy sector, three-digit growth
  rates in revenues are transforming the pork industry, which is now being dominated by medium-to-large enterprises.

  Profitability in the dairy and pork sectors has also been growing, although the pace of growth has been slowing down since
  2007. The main drivers of profitability in both sectors are relatively high domestic prices for both pork and milk (Figures
  B6-1 and 2) and relatively low domestic prices for feed, which makes up to 60 percent of production costs. So far, Russian
  farming enterprises enjoy favorable domestic market conditions characterized by protection from import competition and
  higher prices.

  In addition to their favorable domestic market situation, pork and dairy farms have also demonstrated advances in
  productivity. A separate analysis of economy-wide labor productivity in the agro-food sector (partial TFP analysis) shows
  that labor productivity has been increasing in the past 10-12 years, though with a small growth rate of 1.5 percent per
  year on average. Productivity increases are fueled by major technological advances that the agro-food sector carried out in
  the last decade, notably imports of new technologies and improved genetics, animal health conditions and management
  methods.

  However, at the farm-enterprise level, results for dairy vary depending on the farm size (Figure B6-3). Medium and large dairy
  farms reported average annual labor productivity growth of 3.3 to 3.6 times over the past 10 years, with large companies
  reporting labor productivity growth in the order of 10 times during this period. Small enterprises reported a productivity
  decline, and considering the sizeable contribution of small and medium enterprises in the dairy production, their results
  weighed on overall sector productivity.

  development and increasing wage levels, the agriculture
  sector must improve labor productivity if it wants to remain
  competitive with other sectors. In this context, the lack of
  skilled labor is also a profound disadvantage that needs to
  be addressed.

future, its longer-term growth prospects remained                     same conclusion: TFP growth in Russia is low and
constrained by low Total Factor Productivity (TFP)                    declining.


Box 7:           Russia’s poten al GDP and TFP revisited: declining produc vity trends

  Total factor productivity (TFP) is a measure of efficiency that is notoriously difficult to calculate. Simply put, it is the portion
  of output that cannot be explained by the traditional inputs of capital, labor and land. Its level is the measurement of how
  efficiently the inputs are utilized, and it depends critically on the accuracy and availability of data and of the behavioral
  forms that translate inputs into outputs.

  Traditionally, TFP is estimated as the residual explanation of GDP growth after accounting for the contribution of the factors
  of production: capital, labor (both unskilled and skilled) and land. The relative shares with which these inputs contribute to

 growth are determined by the wage bill, the cost of capital, the returns to education and land rents. Often, data on factor
 quantities and prices are unavailable and need to be estimated; as a result, the residual, or TFP, is subject to measurement
 error.

 For example, the factor shares are often estimated using volume data (the number of hours worked, the number of
 employees and the amount of capital stock). This also requires various assumptions regarding the functional form of the
 economy-wide production function. The production function that is most commonly used in this type of exercise is the Cobb-
 Douglas production function, which assumes that labor and capital are used in fixed proportion in the production of goods.
 This result can be tested by nesting the Cobb-Douglas function into a constant elasticity-of-substitution (CES) function.
 Depending on the estimated coefficients, the factors of production may be complements, in which case an increase of labor
 in production will also result in an increase in capital, while substitution effects imply that using more labor in production
 will result in a reduction of capital*. The residual measure that is often labelled as TFP is, then, a catchall for all efficiency,
 technological effects and even measurement errors.

 The economy of Russia has been hit by deep structural changes over the last couple of decades. The transition to a market-
 based economy and changes in population and in its natural-resource base imply large shifts in TFP. Russia produces
 significant amounts of oil and gas, which contributes substantially to its output. The production function must therefore
 be augmented for resources to avoid possible bias in measuring TFP. The share of resources in output is calculated by
 multiplying the rents of oil and gas with the production of oil and gas and expressing it as a share of GDP.

 Another source that contributes to TFP is structural changes in employment mobility and human capital. This exercise
 assumes that skilled workers (skills are determined by education) are more efficient. Furthermore, we think of labor
 productivity growth as the contribution of within sectoral contributions (such as an increase in research and development)
 and between sectoral contributions that account for shifts in employment shares between sectors. If the employment
 share has increased in a productive sector, then structural change has contributed to productivity growth. In Russia, the
 share of employment in industry has declined since 2000, while the share of service employment has increased. A second
 measure of TFP is constructed by controlling for the number of years of education and the labor share of each industry (see
 McMillan et al. [2014] and Burns (2016]). The number of years of education is obtained from the Barro and Lee (2013) data
 set. Controlling for structural change and skills nets out more effects from TFP and arguably allows us to get closer to an
 accurate interpretation of TFP.

 Three estimates of TFP are presented in this box: (i) The CES production function without oil that uses only capital and
 labor as inputs; (ii) the estimate derived from a Cobb-Douglas production function and netting out the contribution of labor
 share changes from growth (here referred to as structural change) and (iii) one estimated from a Cobb-Douglas production
 function, but that includes hydrocarbon resources and education. The three methodologies provide useful comparisons in
 understanding TFP where (i) is a reference point to compare TFP growth by netting out distinctly different aspects of growth
 using (ii) and (iii). To calculate potential GDP, we follow Burns (2016) by smoothing TFP with an HP-filter and assume that
 capital is fully utilized.

 Figure B7-1 decomposes potential GDP into its components using (iii). The transition away from a centrally planned
 economy to a market-based economy is captured by the change in capital’s contribution to potential GDP growth in the
 late 1990s. The role of TFP in potential GDP growth started moderating in the early 2000s, while the labor force and the
 resources started contributing more to growth towards the end of the sample. The contribution of TFP to potential GDP
 since the global financial crisis of 2008/09 has almost disappeared, highlighting the constraints placed on productivity from
 the adverse effects of the crisis. Figure B7-2 summarizes the different TFP outcomes from the three methodologies. The
 estimate of TFP using (i) above is labelled CES and strikingly shows how large TFP was in the late 90’s controlling only for
 labor and capital. The magnitudes of TFP are markedly different in the late 1990s, illustrating the effects of leaving out oil
 and education (iii) and structural change (ii). More importantly, ignoring the effects of resources and education would have
 implied that TFP growth was moderating sharply, whereas the other measures suggest a more gradual moderation in TFP
 growth.

 None of the approaches is necessarily superior to the other. Each methodology strips some component from TFP. For
 example, TFP adjusted for skills and resources is much lower in the initial periods compared to the other measures. More
 importantly, the decline in TFP is also less marked when adjusting for skills and resources. Adding the resources reduces
 capital’s share in measuring TFP and seems to be an important factor in explaining the initial differences.

 However, regardless of the method used, all have the following in common: TFP growth across all measures has been
 declining over time, underscoring the challenge of addressing declining productivity growth in Russia.

 * Rough estimates using a CES specification for Russia suggest that the production function is a Cobb-Douglas.

This part analyzes subnational fiscal trends in Russia in the context of an overall slowing of economic
growth and falling oil prices since 2014. It discusses how Russian regions fared during the crisis and
examines their fiscal prospects, focusing particularly on whether their crisis measures – driven by
spending cuts – are sustainable over the medium term.


Russia has a complex structure of subnational                          comprising more than 500 cities and more than 1,800
government. At the top level, the country is divided                   raions; and there are more than 20,000 second-tier

 Box 8:           Russian federalism in the interna onal context

     In aggregate terms, the degree of fiscal decentralization in Russia is similar to that of other large, middle-to-high-income
     federal countries. The first figure below shows the share of total general government expenditures that are accounted for
     by subnational governments in Canada, the U.S., Australia, Russia, Brazil, and Germany. As shown, Russia is not unusual.
     It is less decentralized by this measure than the U.S. or Canada but roughly on par with the other three comparators.
     Another way to measure decentralization is to look at the size of subnational government as a share of GDP. Again, Russian
     subnational governments are not as large as those in Canada, but they are roughly on par with those in the U.S., Germany,
     and Brazil. Interestingly, the split in Russia between spending at the regional level and at the local (municipal) level is also
     similar to that in the U.S., Brazil, and Germany. A third approach is to calculate the percentage of subnational revenues
     that are derived from own-source revenues. By this measure, Russia is again fairly typical of large federations. Regional
     governments in Russia derive 80 percent of their income from own-source revenues (including shared taxes, distributed on
     the basis of origin). This is similar to the proportions in Germany (84 %); Canada (81%); and Brazil and the US (both 77 %).
     (Note that these figures refer only to regional governments. Local/municipal governments in Russia and other federations
     derive a larger proportion of their revenues from transfers from their respective regional governments.)

   In calculating this percentage, the total is calculated as the sum
of federal expenditures, regional and municipal expenditures, and
expenditures of federal extra-budgetary funds (the pension fund,
social security fund, and the medical insurance fund together
with its regional divisions). Due to intergovernmental transfers
between these entities, when estimating the shares of each entity,
all intergovernmental fiscal transfers are netted out. Thus, for
example, subnational spending on hospitals, financed through the
national health insurance fund, are not included in ‘subnational
expenditures’.

The general budgets of all three tiers of subnational
government (regional, and first and second-tier
municipal governments) are financed from a
combination of shared taxes, exclusive local taxes,
own non-tax revenues, and intergovernmental
transfers. All taxes are administered by the federal tax
service with revenues returned in whole or in part to
the jurisdiction in which they were collected.

Shared taxes are the largest source of subnational
government revenue. Two of them — the personal
income tax (PIT) and the corporate income tax
(CIT) — accounted for over half (53 percent) of total
subnational revenues in 2016 (Figure 40). Regional

 Box 9:                             Subna onal ﬁscal performance is not aﬀec ng the federal government much

            At present, the fiscal difficulties of subnational governments are not directly affecting the federal government budget. This
            is because the federal government is taking a hard line: between 2013 and 2016, transfers from the federal government fell
            22 percent in real terms.

            The federal government does have some exposure to subnational loan defaults. As of end-2016, federal loans to subnational
            governments totaled Rb 1 trillion. Subnational governments also have a significant level of debt to commercial banks. But
            the level of debt in most jurisdictions (including the largest ones) appears to be manageable.

            On the surface, therefore, the outlook from the federal government’s perspective is fairly good: subnationals are responding
            to the declines in revenues by cutting expenditures, rather than by running up debt or demanding federal bailouts (at least
            not successfully). One should not be too sanguine, however. Subnational governments may be engaging in fiscal maneuvers
            that are not evident in the data: e.g., accumulating arrears and unfunded obligations. Moreover, it is not clear how long
            the federal government can continue relying on expenditure cuts at the subnational level before the social and political
            consequences become so great that it is forced to step in.

Box 10:         Federal controls over subna onal deﬁcits

  At present, subnational deficits are controlled by a tight system of regulations set out in the Budget Code. The code specifies
  three types of ceilings.

  The first refers explicitly to deficits. Budget deficits of regional governments may not exceed 15 percent of annual revenues.
  For municipalities, the ceiling is 10 percent. In both cases, the calculation of revenues excludes intergovernmental transfers.
  In the case of municipalities, it also excludes revenues from shared regional taxes. Even tighter limits are placed on
  regions that are highly dependent on transfers. For regional governments that derived more than 40 percent of revenues
  from transfers during two of the three previous years, the deficit may not exceed 10 percent of revenues, excluding
  intergovernmental transfers. For municipalities that derived more than 50 percent of revenues from transfers, deficits may
  not exceed 5 percent of revenues (again, excluding transfers and shared regional taxes).

  The second and third ceilings control borrowing — i.e., the source of financing for deficits. In particular, the second ceiling
  refers to debt stocks. The Budget Code stipulates that the outstanding debt of a region or municipality may not exceed 100
  percent of its annual revenues, excluding intergovernmental transfers. For transfer-dependent regions and municipalities,
  the ceiling is 50 percent. The third ceiling refers to debt service. The Budget Code stipulates that the debt service of a region
  or municipality may not exceed 15 percent of expenditures of the relevant year.

  In theory, these restrictions should act as a brake on subnational deficits. With explicit ceilings on the size of deficits and
  limited access to debt, subnational governments should be compelled to finance their expenditures from recurrent revenues
  supplemented by the sale of assets. But there are loopholes in the regulations, which are being addressed. For example,
  until 2017, federal refinancing loans were exempted from the debt ceilings. However, subnational governments may also
  accumulate debt in ways that evade tighter regulations. These can take the form of arrears to their employees and suppliers,
  including public utilities. These arrears can be accumulated by subnational governments themselves or by enterprises they
  own. The scale of these liabilities cannot be determined, as such information is not collected and published on a regular
  basis by the federal government or by the regions.
