THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

      Obtain building permit

      A building commission composed of the following persons is
      responsible for reviewing and approving all building permit requests:
      head and deputy head of the Buildings Department, deputy head of the
      buildings department, chief engineer, representative of the Ministry of
      Housing and Equipment, representative from the Ministry of
      Development, and representatives from each of the main utility
      companies (STEG, ONAS, and SONEDE).

      The building commission meets at least once a week or more often
      depending on the demand. If the building commission finds minor
      issues with the designs, it will correct the plans accordingly and issue
      the building permit on a conditional basis. The permit applicant will be
      granted the building permit as long as the suggested changes to the
      plans are accepted and carried out. The building permit is valid for 3
      years. After these 3 years have elapsed, an applicant can renew the
      permit at the Municipality for a fee of TND 250.00.

      The construction license file must include the following:
      • An application
      • Architectural plans approved by an architect and consistent with local
      building code requirements and land development regulations
      • A safety file approved by an engineer registered with the Tunisian
      Association of Engineers.
5     • Proof of property rights                                                 28 days       TND 900
      • Tax discharge
      • A topographical survey prepared by the qualified topographic
      services or an approved topographer
      • Work design documents (dossier de coffrage)

      Once license documents are approved by the Construction Licensing
      Commission, BuildCo must submit the structural design documents to
      the Commission signed by an engineer registered with the Tunisian
      Association of Engineers.
      • An order of alignment delivered by the Ministry of Equipment, if the
      building is located on a classified road or an urban avenue

      After 21 days, and in the absence of a response from the municipal
      authority, the construction license is automatically granted. Though the
      time limit is 21 days, permits are issued on average in 4 weeks
      (between 4 and 6 weeks). However, according to regulations, municipal
      services reserve the right of demolition if the construction takes place
      without authorization. The license is valid for 3 years. Renewal is not
      required if construction has started but is not completed before the
      expiration of the license. A Ministry of Housing and Equipment decree
      issued in April 2007 introduced two changes affecting the submission
      of building permits.

      First, the architect responsible for the building works must be present
      to submit the application and explain the project to the building

                                                                                 complete
      authorities in the municipality.

      Second, a “fiche technique” signed and stamped by an architect
      admitted to the Ordre des Architects de Tunisie is now required with all
      building permit applications. Both of these requirements were
      introduced to avoid forgery of architect stamps on building plans.


      Agency: Municipality

      When companies receive their building permit, they must notify the
      Municipality when they begin digging; at this point the Municipality

        (STEG) and await estimate

        The request can be made online to start the process, however it is not a
        real online application. After submitting the application, the customer
        has to return to the utility to receive the estimate and pay it. An
        inspection for the preparation of the estimate for the connection fee is     26 calendar days              TND 0

        STEG will inspect the site once it has processed the application
        documents. There is no need to request it. The process of preparing the
        estimate is distinct and independent from the technical control process
        (preparation de dossier technique). While there is no inspection for the

        The customer hires an electrical contractor that is registered with the
        utility. The electrical contractor purchases the transformer station and
        constructs the beton structure (the room) for the transformer and
   3    installs the transformer. Most of the material including the transformer     17 calendar days     TND 38,000

        installation of the transformer. The final connection is done. Everything is
        done by the same department. A clearance for the underground
