EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Integrated Transport Planning Ltd. (ITP) worked in partnership with the World Bank to support the
Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority’s (DTCA) efforts to take on new organizational
responsibilities for transportation policy, regulation, coordination, planning and management for
the Greater Dhaka. Open source software tools for editing public transport data using the open
General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), and accessibility-mapping, were provided in
conjunction with hands-on training delivered in Dhaka as a means of building capacity among the
DTCA and RAJUK (Dhaka Improvement Agency) teams against the following defined objectives:

             Assisting DTCA with data management and transport planning.
             Providing technical tools and training to build capacity among colleagues at DTCA.
             Deploying an accessibility-mapping tool for use in Dhaka.
The analysis contained in this report was undertaken on a pilot basis, with the aim of providing
Dhaka and other cities with policy guidance and planning tools that facilitate the integration of
accessibility planning into urban and transport planning processes. The pilot analysis seeks to
demonstrate the capacity and benefit of accessibility analysis tools through sample results.
Activities delivered through the project
The project ran from January to August 2015, and involved the following activities:

The project was highly collaborative, and involved a total of six ‘hands-on’ training workshop
sessions delivered for DTCA across three site visits to Dhaka. These were supplemented by
meetings with smaller groups to collate relevant datasets and explain the purpose of the project.
The key outputs delivered through the project were:

             A detailed review of DTCA’s transport data needs relating to the Greater Dhaka area,
              taking into account datasets gathered for research projects supported by donor banks.
             A thematic catalogue of all datasets currently held by DTCA and RAJUK that are relevant
              to travel demand and transport in the Greater Dhaka region.
             A Transport Data Hub, hosted using Dropbox cloud storage until July 2018, with access
              shared between DTCA and RAJUK team members to provide a central repository for
              transport data collected through major transport projects in the city.

             Training and capacity building for the DTCA and RAJUK on the topics of open transport
              data, strategic evidence-based transport planning, accessibility modelling, and use of the
              GTFS Editor and Transport Analyst software tools.
             A set of GTFS feeds that model, at a high-level, the current operation of public transport
              services in the Greater Dhaka region, as well as all planned BRT and MRT routes that are
              yet to come into operation.
             Open access to the GTFS Editor and Transport Analyst software tools until September
              2016. Neither of these tools tie DTCA and its local partners to a proprietary set of data
              formats or software providers. Both allow for open datasets to be exported and used in
              other transport modelling and GIS software tools.
             A set of draft open data sharing and collaborative working agreements based on those
              implemented in other similar cities.
             Analysis of public transport accessibility levels for a range of scenarios in Greater Dhaka,
              covering current bus networks and the planned delivery of all BRT and MRT routes in the
              city. All three scenarios were also contrasted on the basis of estimated levels of public
              transport accessibility for female residents of Dhaka, drawing on prior social research
              conducted by the World Bank.

Key project outcomes and findings
The project’s findings can be separated into two broad strands: those which relate to the delivery
of capacity building with the DTCA and RAJUK teams in Dhaka, and the findings from the
accessibility modelling work by the project team.
The capacity building work delivered through this project has resulted in DTCA being able to
share all of its transport data with local partners, and most significantly RAJUK. DTCA also has
the option to extend access to other local partner agencies and consultants, and/or share
commonly requested data files more publicly via its website. The DTCA team plans to upload
datasets from current projects, such as BRT3 and MRT6, into the Data Hub structure established
through this project. Consequently colleagues at DTCA and RAJUK are now better placed to take
independent responsibility for transport data management in Dhaka, and support international
donor bank efforts to improve the city’s transport networks. This is underpinned by a clearer
understanding of the range of open data formats relevant to urban transport systems, and the
approaches other city authorities have adopted to open up their transport datasets (and the
benefits of doing so).
The dedicated training relating to the GTFS Editor and Transport Analyst tools has given the
teams at DTCA and RAJUK the skills they need to manipulate the Greater Dhaka GTFS data
feeds created through the project, and apply them (alongside accompanying GIS data) to perform
accessibility modelling analyses and visualisation. Applying this learning will enable DTCA’s team
to rapidly prototype and model the accessibility impacts of larger numbers of potential new
transport lines (or reorganised bus networks), prior to investing time and resources in more
detailed travel demand modelling that informs prioritisation of transport network improvements.
Findings from the accessibility modelling work delivered through this project demonstrated that
current public transport accessibility levels are very low. By virtue of their faster operating speeds,
and dedicated running lanes, the proposed BRT and MRT lines are expected to significantly
increase the levels of public transport accessibility in the city region. When completed, all of the
planned BRT and MRT lines will increase by around 30% the number of people living in the Dhaka

Metropolitan Area who can access Motijheel in Dhaka within 90 minutes by public transport and

of Motijheel, compared with 59% currently.

Prior research evidence suggests women are far less likely to use the existing network due to the
threat of harassment and abuse. This study tested two different methodologies for estimating
female accessibility using a reduced travel speed, and population-based estimates derived from
best-available total population numbers. Based on these analyses it is possible to estimate that:

             Between 31% and 34% of the 3.7 million females who reside in Metro Dhaka are currently
              able to access Motijheel within 90 minutes travel time by public transport + walking.
             This is projected to increase to between 50% and 77%, depending on methodology used,
              of all females in Dhaka once all planned BRT and MRT routes are introduced.

The planned BRT and MRT lines are therefore expected to significantly narrow current public
transport accessibility inequalities in Dhaka. Females will benefit from comparable levels of
accessibility along the alignments of planned new routes – particularly in the direction of Mirpur,
Kuril, Shymoli, and Gabtoli.
Opportunities for follow-up activity in Dhaka
This report identified the following potential ‘next-step’ activities for DTCA and RAJUK to apply the
new capabilities they have developed through the course of this project:
             Using the existing GTFS datasets developed through this project to support additional
              practically-focused tasks. This could include modelling the impact of proposed BRT and
              MRT lines on local access to healthcare and education facilities, and employment
              opportunities. It may also involve establishing public transport accessibility benchmarks to
              key destinations in Greater Dhaka (% of population within a defined travel time by public
              transport to Farmgate) as a means of measuring the impact of future transit network and
              population distribution changes.
             Using the ongoing bus network reorganisation activities in Dhaka to update the GTFS feed
              for current and future bus-based public transport routes. An improved current GTFS
              dataset could be released publicly for consumption by online journey planning tools, while
              the more accurate future scenario could be used as the basis for detailed public transport
              accessibility appraisal to help prioritise the order of network reorganisation.
             Using the editing and analysis tools to capture other modes of transport in addition to
              buses, in particular the water-based transport that exists in Dhaka. Many different transport
              modes are supported by the GTFS specification, and analysis of their availability is
              possible using the tools provided.

OPEN TRANSPORT DEVELOPMENT IN DHAKA                                                          FINAL REPORT


             Facilitating a more integrated urban planning process to understand the transport
              implications of proposed new and master-planned developments, for example estimating
              the total population within a given travel time of a proposed scheme or land-use.
             Creating an open data webpage to facilitate the open sharing of key transport datasets.
              This would help to maximise the value of the Dhaka Transport Data Hub by increasing
              transparency and public engagement in transit reorganisation, encourage third parties (e.g.
              app developers) to create bus maps and journey planners for the city, reduce the amount
              of time DTCA spends responding to public requests for datasets.
             Developing proactive transport data collection regimes to ensure datasets collected
              through the course of strategic transport planning projects in Dhaka (STP, DHUTS, bus
              network reorganisation) are regularly updated for monitoring and operational improvement
              purposes.
             Migrating data onto the Transport Data Hub to the DTCA server when it becomes
              available, leveraging the thematic folder structure developed through this project.

In considering these potential next steps there is a need to recognize a change in the project
environment. At the time of this project’s inception the World Bank was preparing Dhaka BRT Line
3 project, which is expected to provide further capacity building training opportunities and support
for DTCA, including on accessibility analysis and data management. By the time of preparing this
final report, the BRT project has been dropped.
Lessons learned for successful replication
A number of lessons learned through this project will be relevant should World Bank or DTCA
choose to replicate its outcomes in other locations. A common theme running through the lessons
learned relates to ensuring software tools such as GTFS Editor and Transport Analyst are
deployed in contexts where there is:
             A clear understanding of the local need for improved public transport data to power
              strategic transport planning and public information tools.
             A near-term strategic transport planning objective (in the case of Dhaka, planned BRT and
              MRT lines) against which the significant up-front effort needed to collate and edit public
              transport data can be aligned.

The willingness among local teams to take responsibility for maintaining, and exploiting such
datasets after the project is complete. Broader lessons learned, which have been highlighted
throughout this report, include:

             That significant effort and cross-government commitment is required if the high-level GTFS
              feeds used for this project are to be taken forward and used as the basis for digital public
              information services in the future.
             Involving important local stakeholders in project decision-making helps to secure their buy-
              in at key junctures of the project (for example when determining how to host open transport
              data) and the commitment of financial and staff resources that are needed to support a
              longer-term data strategy.
             That robust and ongoing data collection efforts would significantly improve the quality of
              baseline information that is available to support projects of this nature. The data hub
              established as a rudimentary by-product of the capacity building-focused TOR covering

              ITP’s involvement has potential to serve as a repository for all datasets created through
              public transport investment projects that are currently being undertaken in Dhaka.
             That intermediate technology solutions – such as the Dropbox data hub and file saving
              protocols developed in partnership with DTCA colleagues through this study- can provide a
              quick-launch option for more complex data-sharing platforms and approaches in the future.

1             INTRODUCTION
1.1           Integrated Transport Planning Ltd. (ITP) was appointed by the World Bank to work with the
              Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority (DTCA) and support its efforts to take on new
              organizational responsibilities for transportation policy, regulation, coordination, planning
              and management for the Greater Dhaka. To achieve this, the project team deployed an
              accessibility-mapping tool, and provided technical tools and training in order to build the
              capacity of the DTCA team in relation to:
                 Using the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), and associated open source
                  software tools, as the basis for maintaining a record of all public transport routes and
                  services in the Greater Dhaka region.
                 Transport data management good practices that enable the DTCA team to take
                  ownership and coordinate responsibility for transport datasets currently spread across
                  team member’s laptops and local/international consultancy teams.
                 Using the open source Transport Analyst software tool as the basis for visualising
                  public transport accessibility in Dhaka and evaluating the impacts of new
                  routes/scenarios, as well as visualising reported inequalities in public transport access
                  for females.
1.2           The project represented a pilot from which the project delivery team was aiming to learn
              key lessons to aid replication of the tools, techniques, and capacity building activities in
              other country contexts. The project was started when a separate investment project for
              Bus Rapid Transit was being prepared, having DTCA as the common counterpart. The
              expectation of the team, and DTCA, was to include an activity in the BRT project to build
              the capacity further to operationalize and scale up the use of the tools on which this project
              provided support.
1.3           Later the preparation for the BRT was suspended due to several reasons. While there are
              no other efforts ongoing at this moment, it is expected that DTCA will take the initiative
              further through activities funded by international donors or by Government of Bangladesh
              itself.
              Purpose and structure of this report
1.4           This final report sets out the key findings from this project, and has been structured around
              the following sections:
                 Chapter 2 provides an overview of the project’s objectives and the methodology
                  adopted by the project team to address them.
                 Chapter 3 summarises the capacity-building activities delivered by the project team
                  through collaborative working with colleagues at DTCA and other transport agencies in
                  Dhaka. It highlights process learning recommendations that may be relevant for future
                  similar projects in other locations.
                 Chapter 4 presents our analytical findings, conclusions, and recommendations in
                  respect of females’ accessibility in Dhaka and the impact of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) /
                  MRT (Metro Rapid Transit) line proposals being implemented.

2             PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY
              Project objectives
2.1           The overarching objective for this project was to assist DTCA by helping the organisation’s
              small transport planning team to build in-house capacity related to its new organizational
              responsibilities for transportation policy, regulation, coordination, planning and
              management across Greater Dhaka. Three interrelated sub-objectives were set out in the
              World Bank’s Terms of Reference for the project. They were to:
                 Assist DTCA with data management and transport planning.
                 Provide technical tools and training to build capacity among colleagues at DTCA.
                 Deploy an accessibility-mapping tool for pilot use in Dhaka.
2.2           The common thread linking these tasks was a commitment to data-driven transport
              planning and coordination efforts, and in particular the use of Open Data sources to help
              reduce the cost and effort associated with maintaining key urban transport datasets.
              Methodology
2.3           The project particularly focused on developing knowledge, understanding and skills around
              evidence-based approaches to coordinating, planning and managing public transport
              services in the region. It drew on previous research, conducted on behalf of the World
              Bank by the consultants ALG, which set out bus network reorganization proposals
              designed to accommodate forthcoming Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and Metro Rapid Transit
              (MRT) lines that were being planned and constructed in Greater Dhaka in 2015.
2.4           The project team’s approach for building capacity around open transport data in Dhaka
              involved a high degree of collaboration and engagement, working in-country with the DTCA
              team. This was necessary both in terms of understanding the team’s existing capabilities,
              as well as determining the value they placed on specific open transport data opportunities
              we were able to identify.
2.5           Table 2-1 summarises the activities conducted in relation to each of the project objectives
              listed above. These activities are discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.

3             CAPACITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES AND PROCESS LEARNING
3.1           This chapter has been structured around the key project tasks delivered by the project
              team over the course of the study. As well as detailing the approach used to deliver each
              capacity building activity, the tools and resources established for use by the DTCA team in
              Dhaka have been thoroughly documented and explained.

               Throughout the chapter we have picked out key process learning recommendations,
               which may be of value in the context of successful replication for similar efforts in other
               contexts, in green text boxes like this one.

              DTCA transport data review and ICT capacity needs assessment
3.2           Before first travelling to Dhaka, the project team reviewed all available data received from
              the DTCA via colleagues at the World Bank. This included the Dhaka Bus Network and
              Regulatory Reform Implementation Study and Design Work Final Report (2012) and
              previous World Bank gender equality studies related to transport (2000 & 2003).
              Accompanying GIS data files (in .SHP format) were also reviewed to understand the scope
              and scale of existing public and private bus services that operate in Greater Dhaka. This
              dataset was compiled from geospatial bus route data, and operational insights, gathered as
              part of the ALG report on bus reorganisation in Dhaka (2014).
              Transport data and ICT capacity needs assessment
3.3           A collaborative review of DTCA’s transport data and ICT capacity needs was completed
              early in the project. It was contextualised by DTCA’s planned evolution, and strategic
              transport planning objectives related to the proposed BRT and MRT lines that are currently
              in advanced planning stages. DTCA envisages becoming responsible for:
                 Strategic planning and business case development for new public transport systems.
                 Operational monitoring, management, and oversight of new mass transit systems.
                 Strategic reorganisation of existing public transport routes.
                 Regulation of reorganised public transport routes and services.
                 Strategic traffic management and road network planning.
3.4           Work on these mass transit projects has, to date, been led mainly by international donor
              banks and consultants acting on their behalf. Consequently, the knowledge and datasets
              created in Dhaka are spread across multiple agencies. Moving forward it is desirable for
              the DTCA to play a more central role in devising and defining strategic, evidence-led
              transport policies; and in doing so take responsibility for the underlying datasets.
3.5           The Transport Data Needs Assessment Report (Appendix A) produced by the project team
              mapped out a relatively common suite of transport datasets that are considered essential
              to enabling DTCA to evolve into an organisation capable of fulfilling the roles above. This
              covered key data themes of: roads and traffic, public transport networks and operations,
              travel demand, land use and population, and transport analysis outputs. The exercise
              drew on experience from working in other megacities that have grown rapidly and are now
              grappling to establish appropriate transport management functions. In doing so it set out

OPEN TRANSPORT DEVELOPMENT IN DHAKA                                                           FINAL REPORT


              the types of data typically held by metropolitan transport agencies, file formats used, and
              tasks undertaken by an agency to manage and maintain current datasets.
3.6           The following observations and knowledge gaps emerged from the review:
                 The DTCA team is familiar with all the common file formats used to maintain transport
                  datasets, with the exception of GTFS (training on which was delivered in this project).
                 Data sharing between agencies in Dhaka currently happens on a piecemeal basis that
                  relies heavily on personal contacts between staff members, rather than formal process.
                 DTCA does not always receive the technical data and analytical files from consultancy
                  partners that underpin reports and strategy documents.
                 DTCA staff most commonly share data with colleagues at RAJUK (land-use and geo-
                  spatial data), BRTA (data on public transport operations, drivers and vehicles), Dhaka
                  City Corporations (public services), and Road Standards Department (RSD – road
                  alignments and engineering data).
3.7           While internet connectivity was not a barrier, the lack of server/shared data storage means
              key transport datasets are spread across the team’s laptops. Limited ICT capability and
              resources within DTCA mean the team relies on informally appointed external contractors.

               Existing technical capability, coupled with DTCA’s limited financial resources, act to limit
               the technical complexity of transport data management options that can be sustained in
               Dhaka. As such an intermediate technology option (a simple cloud-based Transport Data
               Hub) that is part of a longer-term roadmap towards a more technically complex service
               (open data sharing platform) was considered more immediately achievable. Such an
               approach may be relevant in other similar contexts where in-house ICT skills are limited.

              Determining Transport Data Hub requirements
3.8           Through the project team’s dialogue with DTCA colleagues on their transport data and ICT
              capacity and needs, it became clear that establishing a simple form of Transport Data Hub
              that allowed for basic data sharing within the organisation, and with partner delivery
              agencies, was a key priority. This was implemented through this project, rather than the
              envisaged bus franchising database which was considered to duplicate an initiative being
              pursued by the Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC) and Korea International
              Cooperation Agency (KOICA). They are understood to be building a digital database of
              transport operators and bus vehicles in Dhaka.

               The process of presenting the project team’s independent analyses on transport data and
               ICT needs and capacities, and allowing them to guide informed decision-making by DTCA
               colleagues, helped to achieve buy-in from key stakeholders at DTCA. It also ensured the
               project outputs will meet the organisation’s jointly defined needs and priorities. This
               approach could be readily adopted into other similar future projects, where there may
               previously have been a tendency for donor banks and international consultants to lead
               rather than support local stakeholder organisations.

3.9           Table 3-1 sets out the summary of options discussed with DTCA colleagues, which
              sparked considerable debate in relation to each option’s respective merits and affordability.

3.10          Cloud-based storage (Option 2) was selected by DTCA and jointly implemented through
              the course of the project. The main reasons for choosing this option were:
                  The lack of ICT and networking skills required to set-up and maintain this option.
                  The team is already familiar with Dropbox tools, but previously limited to 2GB capacity.
                  Password protected encryption and off-site security was reassuring.
                  Each major DTCA project generates between 5-10 gigabytes of data, so 1 terabyte of
                   storage was deemed sufficient capacity for the medium to long term.
                  Free alternatives to Dropbox either did not exist at the time of conducting this review
                   (Microsoft One Drive), or place file-size limitations that were considered too restrictive
                   for the largest GIS and imagery databases maintained by RAJUK (Google Drive).
3.11          The team’s only slight concern was over whether it can meet storage rental costs over the
              long-term, which is subject to sign-off from the Project Director (Anisur Rahman) and
              Project Executive. Of the other options considered, the first was discounted based on the
              lack of ICT capability within DTCA; while options 3, 4, and 5 are possible future initiatives.
              Aside from a general lack of enthusiasm for making data freely and publicly available, the
              identified technical capacity constraints within the DTCA mean it is currently unlikely that a
              public open data sharing platform could be sustained beyond the project-specific efforts of
              international donor banks and their consultants.

               To deliver a public open data sharing platform in the future, DTCA is likely to require:
                   Individuals who are passionate about opening-up data in Dhaka, with a specific remit
                    and resources to maintain any publicly released datasets.

                   An official mandate from central government ministers/senior DTCA officials.
                   Support from/collaboration with international agencies like Partnership for Open Data.
                   Initially, a website-developer who is capable of placing links to data files stored in the
                    Transport Data Hub from a page on the DTCA website.

                   Longer-term, data specialists and software programmers capable of taking
                    automatically updated datasets (e.g. BRT vehicle positions/speeds from Automatic
                    Vehicle Location - AVL - systems) and turning them into open data feeds that can be
                    released through a searchable public open data platform.


              Developing and implementing the Dhaka Transport Data Hub
3.12          Building on the transport data needs and local capacity assessment task, described above,
              the project team worked with colleagues at DTCA to establish a cloud-based Transport
              Data Hub for Dhaka in line with their jointly-defined priorities and requirements (Table 3-2
              and Figure 3-1 respectively).

3.13          The initial proposal for the structure of the Transport Data Hub (Figure 3-2) was expanded
              through discussion with the DTCA team. The Hub was subsequently designed to
              accommodate thematic datasets related to transport infrastructure (water/road/rail -ways,
              pedestrian routes, parking), freight, Non-Motorised Transport (NMT - walk, cycle, pedicab),
              and trip-generation arising from new land uses/developments. It was also structured so
              that datasets could be stored and retrieved both:
                 Temporally – in relation to the project or study through which they were collected.
                 Thematically – in relation to the topic the dataset covers.

3.14          Data collated from DTCA colleagues in relation the DHUTS (2010) and Strategic Transport
              Plan (2005) projects was used to build a first version of the Data Hub, which was shared
              via ITP’s Dropbox account for initial review and comment. The datasets collected for these
              projects included household travel survey data, cordon count data, traffic count data, trip
              generator locations, household income surveys, travel time and vehicle occupancy data,
              core GIS data on land-use and socio-demographic topics, and final report documents.
              DTCA Dropbox account
3.15          ITP set up a Dropbox Pro account (1Tb storage) on behalf of DTCA in order to store the
              Data Hub’s contents.
3.16          After logging-in a user lands on a home screen at which the 10 folders around which the
              Data Hub is structured can be viewed (see Table 3-3). These folders can be customised,
              as desired, by DTCA colleagues and are intended to provide the starting point for an
              evolving Dhaka Transport Data Hub. New datasets can be added to the existing folders, or
              into new folders, where appropriate.

              walking 10 members of the DTCA and RAJUK teams through the process of logging-in and
              using the tool. To accompany this training session, and follow-up discussion with the
              DTCA team, the project team produced the following resources; which have been
              appended to this report:

                  for file-sharing and database maintenance (Appendix D).
                 Thoughts on agency collaboration and data sharing that DTCA can use to draw-up
                  formal agreements (as needed) that define which datasets it will share with other
                  agencies, and what they will offer in return (Appendix E).

3.18          These user guides and supporting materials may be of use to colleagues at DTCA, and the
              World Bank when seeking to broaden the Transport Data Hub to other cities in
              Bangladesh, or for other similar future projects. The project team’s workflow for
              implementing the Dhaka Transport Data Hub is set out in Figure 3-3 and may also be
              useful.

               The Data Hub Dropbox will remain available to DTCA and RAJUK until July 2018, and
               provides a legacy from this project until such time as DTCA sets up an in-house server.

              GTFS Editor software set-up
              Compilation and validation of GTFS dataset for Dhaka
3.19          Prior to travelling to Dhaka for a first meeting with DTCA colleagues the project team set-
              up an instance of the open source GTFS Editor software tool, so that the draft GTFS
              dataset received from colleagues at the World Bank could be validated and finalised
              (screenshot at Figure 3-4). The software tool remains fit for purpose on a research basis,
              and has continued to evolve through successive open transport data and capacity building
              projects, some of which have been funded by the World Bank. The research instance of
              GTFS Editor established for this project was hosted by ITP on behalf of the DTCA team.

3.20          Creating the GTFS dataset for Dhaka required the project team to assimilate all GIS bus
              route data and import the .SHP files into GTFS Editor. The route datasets had already
              been labelled by the World Bank Task Team, and contained the main bus stop locations in
              Greater Dhaka that were identified through ALG’s report on bus network rationalisation.
3.21          The routes contained in the GTFS feed received by the project team are understood to
              represent the current public and private bus services operating in Dhaka. The feed
              included primary stop locations, but did not contain service schedules (which do not exist
              on the majority of routes) or operating headways (which are hugely affected by local traffic
              conditions at different times of day). To overcome these required fields the project team
              used the average headway data and operational speeds presented in ALG’s report to
              make the following assumptions:
                 Average speed of 8.75 Km/hr.
                 Average of 8 minute service frequency in each direction along bus routes.
3.22          These assumptions were applied globally to all current bus routes in Dhaka for which .SHP
              files were available from the ALG study.
              Creating GTFS Scenarios
3.23          Using this GTFS dataset as a baseline, subsequent scenarios were developed to cover the
              accessibility modelling parameters being explored through this project:
                 Current bus network + all proposed BRT lines (~2020-2025).
                 Current bus network + all proposed BRT & MRT lines (~2020-2035).
                 Variations of each scenario to reflect an informed estimate of current transport services
                  in Greater Dhaka that females are prepared to use.
3.24          The definitions for each of these scenarios are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4.

               In preparing the GTFS datasets for each scenario, the project team drew on the best-
               available baseline GTFS dataset relating to current bus routes that operate in Greater
               Dhaka and combined this with informed estimates of headway and operational speeds.
               The resulting GTFS feeds created through this project are sufficient as the basis for
               research and analysis, but would not be accurate enough to power online journey
               planners (the main application for GTFS in most cities).
               More detailed bus data collection in similar future projects, such as that conducted in
               Metro Manila in partnership with the University of the Philippines and Department of
               Transport and Communications, would enable city authorities to release a GTFS feed and
               set-up a basic public transport journey planning website as an additional output.


              Interactive training session to familiarise and train DTCA on GTFS Editor
3.25          As part of the process of constructing the GTFS datasets, described above, the project
              team led a half-day interactive group training session with 5 members of the team from
              DTCA and RAJUK. The training session took place at DTCA’s office and covered the
              following topics:
                 An introduction to all functions of the
                  GTFS Editor tool.
                 Detailed walk-through of the workflow for
                  creating an agency, adding new stops,
                  adding a new route, and schedule
                  information.
                 Hands-on demonstration of the export of
                  GTFS feeds for subsequent uses. This
                  prompted questions from colleagues at
                  DTCA and a useful follow-up discussion
                  about how this data could benefit
                  members of the public.
                 A demonstration of the GTFS Exchange portal, and explanation of how the GTFS feed
                  could be published there and on the DTCA website, so that software developers could
                  use it to build public digital journey planning apps/websites.
                 Individual practice (with project team Q&A) on using GTFS Editor to enter route, stop,
                  and service frequency data. This focused on Dhaka’s planned BRT and MRT routes
                  and informed the project team’s subsequent work to define these GTFS scenarios.
3.26          The training materials from this session can be found in Appendix B and C to this report.
              They comprise an introductory presentation to open transport data and GTFS (Appendix
              B), and the GTFS Editor user training guide (Appendix C).

               The training sessions in GTFs editor, and the research-quality GTFS feed provided
               represent the potential start of a process for building and maintaining a more accurate
               GTFS feed for the city of Dhaka. There is currently no set structure in place to maintain
               the GTFS feed, since this was not an objective of the project. The current GTFS feed is
               considered to be robust enough for high-level accessibility analyses, but not for the
               specifically detailed information that would be required to power journey planning apps.
               This would be a logical next step for DTCA to pursue (potentially with support from World
               Bank / other donor agencies)
               For comparison; in Manila, for which the GTFS-Editor tool was originally developed,
               nearly 200 staff across multiple agencies were trained on its use. National budget was
               allocated towards its maintenance, an official memorandum was signed between agency
               heads indicating their commitment to maintain the feeds, and the national government
               committed to hosting the feeds and the application (which, at the time of writing are
               understood to still be in use. Substantial media and outreach efforts were undertaken to
               ensure bottom-up demand for maintenance of the feed.
               It is clear that replicating this experience in Dhaka would require greater resources, and
               national government buy-in, than were available at the time of conducting this pilot study.
               Building this interest, through continued knowledge exchange and capacity building,
               would be a logical follow-up activity for donor bank Task Team Leaders working on major
               transport projects in Bangladesh.


              Using Transport Analyst software for accessibility analyses
3.28          The project team set-up an instance of the open source Transport Analyst software tool to
              perform scenario-based transport accessibility modelling using the GTFS datasets
              described earlier in this chapter as the input. Like GTFS Editor, the software tool remains
              fit for purpose on a research basis, and has continued to evolve through successive open
              transport data and capacity building projects (some of which have been funded by the
              World Bank). The research instance of Transport Analyst established for this project was
              hosted by ITP on behalf of the DTCA team.
3.29          The process of compiling the datasets needed to conduct accessibility analyses using
              Transport Analyst has been described in detail at the start of Chapter 4 of this report, but
              briefly involved:
                 Checking available OpenStreetMap data for Dhaka, to ensure sufficient coverage of
                  key local roads and footpaths for the Transport Analyst routing algorithm to build a
                  graph of all potential trip origins and destinations.
                 Cleaning and validating GTFS datasets using GTFS Editor for each of the scenarios
                  described earlier in this chapter, primarily to ensure local bus routes match with
                  OpenStreetMap (OSM) road network data and they each contain operating schedules
                  and calendars (required for a valid GTFS feed).

                 Associating population data for Dhaka wards to appropriate geospatial administrative
                  boundaries and, where necessary, disaggregating these datasets into smaller areas so
                  as to enable accessibility to be related to the places where Dhaka’s inhabitants live.
3.30          Having assembled these datasets for each scenario (as defined in Chapter 4), the project
              team was able to import and sequentially process them in turn using Transport Analyst’s
              Single Point Analysis tool. The resulting accessibility outputs and histograms have been
              reported in detail in Chapter 5, and include visualisations of the estimated inequality of
              public transport accessibility for females in Greater Dhaka. Exporting the underlying output
              data as .SHP GIS files permitted further quantitative analyses of the estimated numbers of
              people who will be able to access defined locations in Dhaka within 90 minutes travel time
              by public transport under each scenario.
3.31          Figure 3-5 represents a sample output from the project team’s analyses using Transport
              Analyst. It illustrates the considerable extent of improved travel times (blue shading) and
              increased coverage within 90 minutes of travel (pink shading) that will be delivered over the
              current bus system through the combined implementation of BRT and MRT routes being
              planned for Dhaka. This is reflected in the two histograms for the current situation
              (Scenario 1) and the proposed BRT + MRT future scenario (Scenario 2).

              Population data were not available for the geographic area to the south of the Buriganga river. Consequently
              the accessibility plot does not appear in this location, even though future BRT lines may serve this location.

               A demo instance of Transport Analyst has been made available to World Bank staff by
               Conveyal LLC at: http://wb-analyst.conveyal.com/login. The site includes a simple tutorial
               and demo data for Mexico City, and we understand a full version of the tool could be
               made available on a permanent basis to all World Bank technical staff (and their local
               counterparts/consultant teams if funding can be provided) if desired. Such an approach
               has the potential to mainstream the delivery of accessibility modelling from one-off
               research tasks (such as this project in Dhaka) so it can be applied to all sustainable urban
               transport planning projects funded by the World Bank.
               It is pertinent to note that Transport Analyst is a supply-driven tool, which doesn’t take into
               account such factors as demand, transit system capacity. Instead it provides a quick way
               of evaluating the potential impact of major transport infrastructure initiatives before more
               detailed (and more resource-intensive), demand-side analyses and travel demand models
               are developed to demonstrate the likely impacts on capacity and traffic levels. In this
               context tools like Transport Analyst can be used to reduce the overall cost of transport
               modelling activities, by ensuring such efforts are targeted at public transport proposals
               that have potential to transport the greatest numbers of people to/from specific locations.


              Transport Analyst training for the DTCA team
3.32          As part of the final project visit to Dhaka, the project team led a half-day interactive group
              training session with 8 members of the team from DTCA and RAJUK. The training session
              took place at DTCA’s office and covered the following topics:
                 An introduction to accessibility modelling covering:
                  theory, techniques, and the basics of Transport
                  Analyst; alongside some simple GIS data
                  presentation techniques.
                 Accessibility modelling in Dhaka, focusing on input
                  datasets and model scenarios used in this project.
                 Detailed instruction on how to use Transport Analyst,
                  covering: importing data from GTFS editor, importing
                  demographic data, producing accessibility maps and statistics, comparing scenarios.
                 Key findings from ITP's analyses derived from the Transport Analyst tool’s outputs,
                  including: current estimated accessibility inequalities experienced by females, the
                  impact of planned BRT and MRT lines on general accessibility, and the impact of BRT
                  and MRT on Dhaka females’ accessibility.
3.33          The training materials comprise a presentation outlining the key principles of transport
              accessibility modelling (Appendix H), and the Transport Analyst user training guide
              (Appendix I).

               This user guides and supporting presentation may be of use to colleagues at DTCA, and
               the World Bank when seeking to broaden the use of Transport Analyst to other cities in
               Bangladesh, or for other similar future projects.

4             IMPACT OF BRT AND MRT ON ACCESSIBILITY IN DHAKA
4.1           Predominantly conducted between project visits two and three, the following chapter
              outlines the accessibility modelling work that ITP undertook using Transport Analyst. This
              work focused on assessing transport accessibility in Greater Dhaka so as to make
              comparisons between accessibility for the general population and females.
4.2           The diagram below shows the data inputs and outputs to Transport Analyst, these will be
              described further and demonstrated in the results in this chapter.




              Datasets and assumptions used
              Map data
4.3           Transport Analyst uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) for all its base mapping. A brief review of
              the OSM data for Dhaka city was undertaken and it was deemed sufficiently complete and
              suitable for the intended application of accessibility modelling at a city-wide scale. We note
              that there is always scope for improvement to OSM and, where project budgets allow, we
              advocate that such improvements are investigated and undertaken with a team of local
              mappers who can carry this work forward in the future.
              Bus data for Dhaka
4.4           Basic GTFS data for all current bus routes in Dhaka was provided by the World Bank, and
              derived from ALG’s 2014 public transport reorganisation review.            This data was
              subsequently imported into GTFS Editor and cleaned, which allowed for routes to be
              corrected to follow the road network (not just straight lines between bus stops as per the
              GTFS default), checking bus stop ordering for anomalies, and setting route speeds to
              match the average operating speed (reported in ALG’s 2014 report) of 8.75 km/h.

4.5           To create a valid GTFS feed a timetable and calendar have to be included. These were
              included in the bus data. Bus frequency was set at 8 minutes (taken from ALG’s 2014
              report) in the absence of more specific data on a route-by-route basis, and all services
              were set to run on all weekdays between 6am and 10pm. In reality we recognise there is
              likely to be considerable variability of service headways and operating hours, but these
              assumptions were necessary to inform the subsequent accessibility modelling in the
              absence of more accurate data on a route-by-route basis.
4.6           The GTFS feed for Dhaka bus routes was exported from GTFS Editor and imported directly
              into Transport Analyst as a new scenario - called 'Base Scenario'.

               Unfortunately, a GTFS feed was not available for the proposed restructured bus network
               in Dhaka (to be prompted by the implementation of BRT and MRT lines). This has been
               outlined in ALG’s 2014 study report, but it was outside the scope of this study to encode
               the route proposals into GTFS. This represents a logical follow-up activity for DTCA from
               this project.

              BRT data
4.7           Data on the proposed route alignments, station locations, and operational headways for all
              planned BRT lines in Dhaka were derived from a combination of ALG’s report on public
              transport reorganisation (2014) and dialogue with colleagues at DTCA working to deliver
              the planned routes. Through the course of delivering the GTFS Editor training sessions,
              and ongoing dialogue with DTCA staff members who have been part of the BRT feasibility
              work, we established 25 km/h as a sound average operational speed for all of the planned
              BRT lines (including dwell times). A service frequency of 5 minutes was used, although as
              previously stated, the frequency once this high has no impact on accessibility calculations.
4.8           The BRT data were exported in a separate GTFS feed from GTFS Editor, which was then
              imported into Transport Analyst as additional services to the base bus network to create a
              new scenario titled 'Base + BRT'. All proposed BRT lines (Lines 1, 2, and 3) were included
              in the project scenarios in order to demonstrate the capacity and benefit of the analysis
              tool.
              MRT data
4.9           As part of the Data Hub data collection effort DTCA shared GIS shapefiles with ITP’s team
              which included detailed route alignment and stop locations for all the lines which make up
              the proposed MRT system for Dhaka (not just MRT line 6). This data was used to create
              the GTFS feed for MRT, with insight from DTCA informing the definition of an average
              operating speed of 36 km/h was used, with a 5 minute operating frequency.
4.10          The MRT dataset was exported as an independent GTFS feed from GTFS Editor, and was
              subsequently imported into Transport Analyst as additional services to the base bus
              network with BRT to create a new scenario - 'Base + BRT + MRT'. All proposed MRT lines
              (Lines 4, 5, and 6) were included in the project scenarios in order to demonstrate the
              capacity and benefit of the analysis tool.

4.11          For reference, the full extents of the BRT and MRT networks are illustrated in Figure 4-1.
              The green lines show the proposed BRT routes between the south and north of the city,
              whilst the double-red lines show the proposed MRT routes (MRT4, MRT5 and MRT6).
              BRT line 3 and MRT line 6 are at a more advanced stage of development than other lines.
4.12          Other proposed BRT and MRT lines have not been included, as data regarding their exact
              routes was not available, and population and land use data for the corresponding areas
              was incomplete. However the training component of this work has furnished the DTCA
              team with the tools and the skills to rapidly perform accessibility analysis similar to that
              reported above. When the necessary data becomes available these can be exploited to
              examine the impact of proposed new transit schemes.

              Population data
4.13          We obtained population data in MS Excel format for the Greater Dhaka metro area through
              discussions with BBS (supported by DTCA) on our team’s first project site visit. This
              spreadsheet data was then combined with GIS data of ward boundaries for Greater Dhaka,
              which was obtained from RAJUK.
4.14          Once combined, these files created the shapefile data needed by the Transport Analyst
              software tool. The highest level of resolution in which the population data for Greater
              Dhaka were available was Ward level, and this breaks the metro area down into 105
              wards. Transport Analyst works by creating centroids for such population areas/zones and
              calculating the travel time to/from these. Although this methodology did work with 105

              zones, the outputs generated often result in un-intuitive looking outputs in locations where
              larger Wards (zones) are given the same score across their full geospatial extent.
4.15          To solve this problem we broke the Ward areas down further using a grid pattern. This
              resulted in much smaller zones and produced more accurate map-based outputs. By
              applying this methodology we made the crude assumption that population is distributed
              evenly across each individual ward. Although in reality this is not the case, such an
              approach is necessary where more finely grained population data (e.g. associating
              individuals with accurately geo-coded home locations or smaller administrative areas) it
              was felt this assumption was acceptable in this circumstance. Consequently the total
              number of zones mapped and included in our analyses increased from 105 to 8,683.
4.16          No future year population estimates were available (or known to exist), therefore the base
              year population numbers were used for future year scenarios (no population growth is
              assumed in the future year analysis). This will mean any change trends of population
              accessible with public transport shown by the model are accurate, but precise numbers are
              likely to be below where they would actually be given the population of Dhaka is known to
              be increasing rapidly.
4.17          In future, other external datasets may be appropriate if local data is not available or not
              sufficiently detailed. For example, WorldPop1 makes available population estimates in
              100m x 100m grid cells for many Asian and African countries from UN data, which would
              be suitable for conversion to use in Transport Analyst and is of a high enough resolution to
              require no further disaggregation. For this work, however, we chose to use existing data
              from DTCA partners to emphasise the possibilities with locally-produced datasets.

4.19          The results of each scenario have been presented in the subsequent sections of this
              chapter, along with detailed descriptions of assumptions applied in relation to each tested
              scenario.
              Challenges and limitations
4.20          The process of obtaining the population data from BBS would have been far simpler if
              there were better lines of communication between DTCA and BBS. We believe BBS may
              hold data in a higher resolution, or that is associated with GIS shape data, given we saw
              maps in BBS publications that illustrate this dataset (suggesting it has been geocoded, but
              was not made available for this project). The disaggregation of data across a grid of zones
              is a good solution to the problem of high level data, but it is hard to replicate for someone
              without good GIS experience, and therefore can be a hard skill to pass on when compared
              to using tools such as GTFS Editor and Transport Analyst which are designed to be used
              by non-technical staff.
4.21          The population data we used relate to the 2011 Census and were not projected into the
              future for the MRT and BRT delivery scenarios, which is an identified limitation of the
              accessibility analyses delivered through this project. The future transport scenarios have,
              unavoidably, been compared against current population data; and therefore serve to
              demonstrate the impact of Dhaka’s BRT and MRT proposals against the population
              distribution from the 2011 Census. In sharing the findings from this study we advise that
              trends, rather than population data, are used as the basis for consideration.
4.22          We also attempted to obtain other census fields so that we could map the accessibility of
              these metrics (e.g. employment activity, people in full time education) using the Transport
              Analyst application, but datasets were not made available to our team by BBS.

               Another follow-up task to this study for colleagues at RAJUK and DTCA would be to use
               the latest available population datasets from BBS as the basis for the accessibility plots in
               Transport Analyst. These population datasets could be temporally related to both the
               current public transport situation (2011-15), as well as future population projections that
               align with the estimated timeframes of BRT and MRT network implementation (2020-2035
               respectively).

              Current transport accessibility in Dhaka
4.23          The following maps report on the accessibility levels in Dhaka for all scenarios. To do this
              in a static report we selected four example locations to give consistent results. By visiting
              the online instance of the Transport Analyst tool the maps and results can be obtained for
              anywhere in the modelled region. The location chosen for the majority of the reporting
              within this report was downtown (Motijheel) in Dhaka, with Farmgate, Shymoli Shumela
              Intersection and Teigaon used for further analysis.

                 Motijheel was chosen as it is understood to be a key trip attractor which, based on the
                  network of all transport options, is not overly biased towards one mode of travel over
                  another.
                 Farmgate was selected, because it represents an existing major transport hub in Dhaka
                  that demonstrates the best levels of current accessibility in Dhaka.
                 Shymoli Shumela Intersection is where Dhaka’s main hospitals are located, and
                  therefore represents an important location in respect of access to healthcare
                  treatments.
                 Tejgaon represents a major employment centre, with various factories and industries
                  located in this part of the city.
4.24          At the time of undertaking this work it was not possible for the Transport Analyst tool to
              reliably compile regional accessibility analyses. Selecting the four key locations described
              above was a practical approach to overcoming this limitation.
4.25          All model runs illustrated in this section show outputs for up to 90 minutes travel time by
              public transport and walking from this location. In basic outputs with no comparison the
              accessible areas are shown in yellow, with the darker colour representing a shorter travel
              time (left hand image below). For figures where a comparison is being presented, the
              yellow represents no change in accessibility, blue shows improved travel time, and pink
              depicts areas that couldn’t previously be reached within 90 minutes by public transport:




              Base Scenario (current bus-based accessibility)
4.26          The baseline scenario was established based on the following data:
                 Existing bus routes only
                 Network speed of 8.75 km/h
4.27          Figure 4-2 shows how the relatively slow speed of the current transport system only allows
              for a limited amount of accessibility within Greater Dhaka. In particular, northern and
              western parts of Greater Dhaka are outside a 90 minute journey from the Motijheel area.
              This includes a large section (almost half) of the city population, as shown by the graph
              alongside the accessibility map. A 90 minute journey (very light shading) is not sufficient to
              reach some areas in the far north and west.

              Population data were not available for the geographic area to the south of the Buriganga river. Consequently
              the accessibility plot does not appear in this location, even though bus services may operate to this location.

              Impact of BRT on transport accessibility
4.28          The BRT scenario represents an extension of the baseline by adding the city’s planned
              BRT network on top of the existing bus network. Key assumptions are:
                 Existing bus routes with an average speed of 8.75 km/h.
                 BRT network with an average operating speed of 25 km/h.
              The geographic extents of the routes used for the proposed BRT are shown towards the
              end of this chapter, in Figure 4-15.
4.29          Figure 4-3 shows the improvement BRT makes when it is added to the baseline scenario
              made up of the existing network of bus services. Heading north along the BRT corridors
              journey times are greatly improved, and new areas of the city (Gabtoli to the North West,
              and Gulshan and Badda to the North East) are now within a 90 minute public transport
              journey of downtown in Motijheel. Note in the associated graphs a far greater proportion of
              the city’s population are within 90 minutes of travel from the selected point.

4.30          Considering the proposed BRT in terms of different municipal services allows the
              examination of likely transport benefits for these services. The analysis was therefore
              repeated to estimate the increased accessibility from locations important to healthcare,
              existing transport, and industry. Figure 4-4 shows the extra accessibility provided by the
              BRT from a point at the transport hub in Farmgate. Substantive extra service within the 90
              minute threshold is provided in the far southeast and northeast of the city (around the
              airport), whilst improved journey times are available in the east of the city generally.

4.31          The added benefits to medical and hospital services of the BRT are illustrated below, in
              Figure 4-5. Due to the location of these services in the north of the city, less benefit is
              experienced from the BRT compared to other areas. However, there is some increased
              coverage or reduced journey time within the 90 minute threshold around the south and the
              Kalabagan area. In Figure 4-6, the significant extra benefit of the BRT to industry and
              employment can be seen, as Tejgaon is considerably more accessible within 90 minutes,
              in particular when travelling either north or south.

              Impact of BRT + MRT on transport accessibility
4.32          The BRT + MRT scenario builds iteratively on the BRT scenario, by adding in all the MRT
              lines that are proposed for development in Dhaka. Key assumptions for this scenario are:
                 Existing bus routes with an average speed of 8.75 km/h.
                 BRT network with an average operating speed of 25 km/h.
                 MRT network with an average operating speed of 36 km/h.
              The geography of the routes used for BRT and MRT are shown towards the end of this
              chapter, in Figure 4-1.
4.33          Figure 4-7 shows the improvement BRT+MRT makes when it is added to the ‘base + BRT’
              network. At the speeds noted above, it is clear that coverage is extended in the north of
              the city, and journey times are improved (blue patches) around MRT stations in the east,
              west, and south. New coverage is also available in the far north of the city in the proximity
              of the airport due to the new MRT line. Not shown by the accessibility plot is the extra
              capacity provided by MRT: by adding in the MRT network it is clear that not only will
              capacity be improved, but there will be significant improvements in terms of service
              coverage (pink shading) and travel time (blue shading).

4.34          The Motijeel origin point selected in the above examples is only indicative of accessibility
              from one point in the south of the city. Further analysis was undertaken to estimate the
              potential benefit of the proposed MRT to different services. As expected, considering
              accessibility from other points served by proposed MRT lines also shows greatly improved
              travel times (or expansion of accessible areas). Figure 4-8 shows an example with the
              origin point moved to the Farmgate area. Journeys from this point are quicker for almost all
              destinations, including parts of the north of the city such as the airport area and Mirpur.

4.35          The benefit of the proposed MRT to healthcare services (in particular, hospitals) is shown
              in Figure 4-9, using an origin point close to Shymoli Shumela Intersection. This shows
              greatly increased accessibility within the 90-minute threshold relative to the BRT scenario,
              with almost all of the city for which data is available having either new coverage or shorter
              journey time, including the far southeast of the city where there is substantive new public
              transit availability.
4.36          Finally, the extra accessibility around the industrial area at Tejgaon is shown in Figure
              4-10. Here one can see that many areas in the north and east of the city experience
              reduced journey times from Tejgaon, though (perhaps surprisingly) less benefit is seen in
              the southeast of the city. Closer investigation shows that this may be due to the geography
              of the proposed MRT lines around the east of the Motijeel area, requiring users from
              Tejgaon to either change lines or take a circuitous route.

              Summary
4.37          As would be expected given the relatively slow average speed of existing bus services,
              existing levels of public transport accessibility in Dhaka are poor. The addition of BRT and
              MRT lines with notably higher operational speeds will improve accessibility for a
              significantly larger proportion of the region’s population. Table 4-2 summarises the total
              population living within ninety minutes travel time of the downtown area of Motijheel, to
              which we measured comparative public transport accessibility. With the introduction of
              BRT lines the accessible population increases by 25% over the baseline scenario. With
              the introduction of both BRT and MRT the population that can access Motijheel within 90
              minutes travel time increases by 30% compared to the baseline.

              Impact on females’ transport accessibility in Dhaka
4.38          As identified by two previous World Bank studies2,3, women in Dhaka are less likely to use
              public transport due to overcrowding and harassment from men. Instead women choose to
              use private modes of transport such as private cars or rickshaw, while females on lower
              incomes have little option but to walk - often spending up to two hours travelling to and
              from work.
4.39          The situation in Dhaka reflects World Bank and academic evidence from work elsewhere.
              In a report on female accessibility in Buenos Aires, Argentina4, it was found that on
              average women must travel at significantly lower speeds due to the more limited transport
              options available to them. This is not just due to availability of suitable transport, but
              because women tend to have more complex travel needs that are influenced by their
              responsibilities for household tasks such as arranging childcare and running errands.
              Women with children, in particular, were also found to be more likely to make a greater
              number of trips in a day (‘trip rate’) than males (p3).
4.40          The travel time budget hypothesis, supported in the findings of the above work, is also
              pertinent to scenarios in Dhaka. Since the amount of time available for travel by individuals
              in a day is fixed, if only slower transport modes are available to females, then the
              geographic region that can be reached is smaller for that individual - greatly limiting access
              to employment, services and other opportunities.
4.41          Based on the information contained in the prior World Bank gender study reports, and
              through discussions with DTCA staff on project visits to Dhaka, we created a transport
              scenario for use in Transport Analyst for the purpose of modelling females’ transport
              accessibility in relation to their male counterparts. This scenario used the same network as
              the whole population scenario (base scenario) but, supported by work such as that
              referenced above, used a travel speed of half that of the ‘Base’ scenario to represent the
              disadvantage and reduced mobility that women travelling in Dhaka experience5.
4.42          When modelling BRT and MRT scenarios we assumed these new forms of transport will
              better cater for females needs, and will do so at an equal level to their male counterparts.
              Consequently we have used the same parameters as for the whole population, and are
              able to comment on the estimated changes in accessibility levels resulting from the
              introduction of these new public transport options in Greater Dhaka.

                 The Buenos Aires project found women more likely to use public transport than the general population. However, in Dhaka
              this is expected to be different due to the issues raised in paragraph 4.35. For more information, see (3) above.

              Current transport accessibility in Dhaka for females
4.43          Figure 4-11 shows a comparison between public transport accessibility for the whole
              population and that experienced by females in Greater Dhaka. As would be expected, due
              to the use of a travel speed of half that of the base scenario; the whole population has
              faster or greater access in all areas compared to females, except for the immediate area
              surrounding downtown Motijheel where walk speeds of males and females are assumed to
              be the same.

4.44          Figure 4-12 shows a comparison between public transport accessibility levels for the whole
              population and females’ accessibility after all of the planned BRT lines have been
              introduced in Greater Dhaka. The areas shaded yellow represent locations where public
              transport accessibility has been improved for females to the same extent as for the whole
              population. Areas shaded blue represent locations that females are now able to access
              within 90 minutes, but at a slower speed than the general population (resulting from
              documented reticence to use existing bus services). Areas shaded pink represent areas of
              Dhaka that females will be unable to access within 90 minutes travel time without using
              existing bus services.
4.45          The BRT corridors show up as two clear lines from the north of Motijheel (yellow shading),
              and represent the locations where accessibility between females and the whole population
              is expected to be equalised to the greatest extent.

4.46          Figure 4-13 presents a comparison of 90 minute public transport accessibility for the
              general population compared with that for females after all planned BRT and MRT routes
              have been introduced in Greater Dhaka. The effect of the additional introduction of the
              proposed MRT routes is that Mirpur and Kuril in the north of the city-region are anticipated
              to become equally accessible for females as they are for the general population. Blue and
              pink regions on this map (particularly around Motijeel and Tejgaon) denote areas that
              women are less likely to be able to access in the 90 minutes threshold time, resulting in
              poorer accessibility.

4.47          Despite this projected equalisation of accessibility, there remain areas of the city
              (particularly to the south of Motijheel) that will be less accessible for females when
              compared with that for the whole population. These areas may be considered to represent
              opportunities for future investment in more inclusive public transport options that better
              meet the needs of females.
4.48          As noted previously in this report, the estimated improvements in accessibility are also
              predicated on the assumption the proposed BRT and MRT lines address the issues
              females experience in respect of harassment and overcrowding, which currently act as
              barriers to using bus services in Greater Dhaka.

              ninety minutes’ public transport travel time of Motijheel is 34%. With the introduction of

4.50          The estimates of change in female population accessibility resulting from the
              implementation of BRT and MRT lines in Dhaka are derived from a different model
              methodology than the male values presented in the table above. As such they are not
              directly comparable, and the trends they reveal are considered a more reliable output than
              the absolute numbers. The estimates reported for ‘Whole Population’ in Table 4-3 are a
              summation of the values output by the two different accessibility models (male and female
              accessibility), and as such the estimated potential for improvement represents a more
              realistic assessment of the combined accessibility experienced by both females and males
              using public transit in Dhaka. This is also the reason why the Whole Population values
              presented in Table 4-2 (which are derived from a separate, whole population accessibility
              model) do not correspond with those calculated and presented in Table 4-3.


              Alternative approach to calculating accessibility impacts for females
4.51          An alternative approach was also used to approximate the benefit of proposed new transit
              lines, to provide a comparator for the estimated numbers of females living within 90
              minutes of central Dhaka. This was achieved by using a rough assumption that 50% of
              women within Dhaka are users of buses under the current situation. This approach also
              allows us to estimate the minimum number of females who are likely to benefit from the
              new BRT and MRT routes, given we can estimate the number of females who will not use
              the current bus network. The exact figure may be substantially higher, but nevertheless it
              helps to calculate a useful indicator of an approximate trend.
4.52          In the current situation, the number of females using buses can therefore be estimated as
              approximately:
                 (Whole population in base scenario * Proportion of population that is female) * 50%.

              From this, an estimate of the number of females likely to consider using existing bus
              services and BRT, after the implementation of BRT can be calculated as:
                      (Whole population using BRT and existing bus services * 44%) – (Females
                      currently not using buses)
              The total female population value from the Dhaka population data used in this study (as
              reported in Table 4-3) and the whole population accessibility model estimates reported in
              Table 4-2 were used as the basis for applying the calculations described above. The
              resulting values are reported in Table 4-4, and it is important to note that they reflect an
              underestimate of the degree of improved accessibility that will be received by females in
              Dhaka. This is because the estimation approach set out above assumes the same number
              of females that are currently estimated not to use public transport will continue to not use
              public transport in each of the future BRT and BRT+MRT scenarios.

               BRT + MRT:
4.53          The findings in this section of our report demonstrate that the introduction of BRT and MRT
              will have a significant impact on journey times, and therefore public transport accessibility,
              in Greater Dhaka. Assuming they are delivered with appropriate priority from road traffic,
              the operational speeds of these new public transport services will increase from low
              existing levels (8.75 Km/h) and provide more predictable journey times. The result is
              expected to be a more inclusive and robust public transport network that connects a wider
              area of the city region.
4.54          Assuming the BRT and MRT services are all delivered in an inclusive manner such that
              accessibility, safety and security are ensured for all travellers (but particularly females);
              their benefit is expected to have the greatest impact on Dhaka’s female population - whose
              average travel speeds we estimated to be roughly half their male counterparts as a result
              of females’ understandable reticence to travel in overcrowded vehicles where they risk
              harassment and abuse. Even without any related inclusivity improvements to the existing
              bus network (e.g. to complement the improvements delivered through BRT and MRT lines),
              the public transport accessibility levels for females are envisaged to be much closer to
              those enjoyed by the whole population7.

              Land Use and Accessibility
4.55          To better understand the potential benefit of the proposed BRT and MRT lines, an
              accessibility analysis was also performed with respect to the different types of land use in
              the city. Unfortunately, limited data was available regarding the exact types of land use,
              and much of the land in the south of the city is marked as mixed use, but some initial
              accessibility analysis is provided below. It should also be noted that for some areas in the
              north and east of the city, GIS data was available but it was not labelled sufficiently for use
              in this analysis.
              Educational land use
4.56          In order to estimate the different availability of educational and research facilities within the
              city with respect to the proposed transport network, the individual areas for different land
              parcels were calculated for use in accessibility analysis. Whilst this does not account for
              the exact type of educational institution or its capacity, it provides a useful indicator for the
              locations of services of different kinds and a basis for estimating capacity.
4.57          Figure 4-14 shows a comparative accessibility analysis by area for these facilities under
              both the existing transit network and under the BRT+MRT scenario (with all proposed
              changes having been implemented) from an origin at the Farmgate transport hub. Under
              the latter scenario, journey time is improved to all educational facilities except those closest
              to the origin point, with approximately 2 million square metres of ‘education and research’
              land use within a 20 minute travel time.




               and placed under significant operational stress. As such we note there is scope for the new BRT and MRT
               lines to become ‘victims of their own success’, as they are sequentially rolled out and unlock supressed
               demand for faster journey times. Consequently, the overcrowding they are being designed to help address
               (which creates many of the conditions in which females reported experiencing abuse or harassment), may be
               replicated on the new routes. Although it is impossible to model the consequences of future overcrowding of
               public transport investment in Dhaka, we assume the additional capacity created through delivery of the MRT
               and BRT lines will (over time) be matched with investment in existing local bus services. As such, it is
               reasonable to suggest that females will find it easier to travel around the city using both new and existing
               transport modes.

              the examination of housing availability with respect to transit provision. The same method
              as above, based upon the total areas of individual land parcels, was used to calculate this
              information. Unfortunately, more detailed data (such as the housing density in particular
              neighbourhoods or areas) was not available, but again this provides an estimate of the
              typical travel times between central parts of the city and residential areas of different sizes.

              Figure 4-15: Accessibility of residential areas




4.59          The analysis in Figure 4-15 shows the differences in accessibility to residential areas
              between the base and BRT+MRT scenarios. The analysis is based around an origin point
              close to the Farmgate transport hub. With the exception of a small area very close to the
              origin point, shorter travel times would be experienced to almost all areas with the
              proposed new lines, and a far greater proportion would be within 40 minutes’ travel from
              Farmgate. In addition, some residential areas to the north and east of the city would now
              be inside the 90 minute travel time threshold.
4.60          The potential changes in accessibility for areas with other types of land use could
              unfortunately not be investigated due to insufficient data or coverage. For example, whilst
              the general accessibility analysis earlier in this chapter considers the whole city and
              includes an analysis with the origin point in Tejgaon, much of the industrial area to the east
              of the city is not sufficiently labelled in land use data, limiting the type of analysis that can
              be performed. In future studies, types and locations of employment opportunities or
              industrial areas can be incorporated into accessibility analysis, to verify the exact value of
              proposed transit improvements (for example counting employment opportunities or factory
              size).

5             CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.1           Through this project assistance as provided to DTCA in order to help the organisation’s
              small transport planning team to build in-house capacity related to its new organizational
              responsibilities for transportation policy, regulation, coordination, planning and
              management across Greater Dhaka. The key objectives of the project were to:
                 Assist DTCA with data management and transport planning.
                 Provide technical tools and training to build capacity among colleagues at DTCA.
                 Deploy an accessibility-mapping tool for use in Dhaka.
5.2           The associated learning objectives for project capacity-building activities were fully met
              through the in-country training, research, and strategic data management advice delivered
              by the project team. This concluding chapter summarises the project outcomes in respect
              of each of the three objectives above, summarises lessons learned and identifies
              opportunities for future activities led by DTCA and RAJUK.
              Assisting DTCA with data management and transport planning
5.3           As a result of this project, colleagues at DTCA and RAJUK now manage access to their
              own 1Tb Dropbox repository that contains the reports and underpinning data generated by
              recent transport studies in Greater Dhaka. Based on discussions at the training session
              held in July 2015, DTCA is already sharing access to the Data Hub across its own team
              and with colleagues at RAJUK. It also has the option to extend access to other local
              partner agencies and consultants, or to share commonly requested data files more publicly
              via the DTCA website. The DTCA team plans to upload datasets from current projects,
              such as BRT3 and MRT6, into the Data Hub structure established through this project.
5.4           Following the six days of training sessions delivered in Dhaka, the DTCA team now has a
              much clearer understanding of the range of open data formats that are relevant to urban
              transport systems. As well as understanding how city authorities in other developed and
              emerging countries have benefitted from opening-up their transport datasets, the team
              gained specific knowledge about the GTFS standard and the way it can be managed and
              analysed using open source software tools. This new knowledge focuses particularly on
              the use of GTFS, Open Street Map, and Census-derived population data to perform
              accessibility modelling and mapping.

               The impact of this capacity building activity is that colleagues at DTCA and RAJUK now
               have a clearer understanding of the importance of data in underpinning strategic transport
               planning and network management. Through the Data Hub’s inception the DTCA team
               has catalogued all of the datasets it holds, so they can be readily searched and retrieved
               for use in future transport planning projects. Colleagues at DTCA and RAJUK are now
               better placed to take independent responsibility for transport data management in Dhaka,
               and support international donor bank efforts to improve the city’s transport networks.
               The Data Hub stored in Dropbox will remain available until June 2018 as a legacy of the
               project. At this point DTCA will have the option to renew the storage or transfer the files
               to an alternate location with no vendor lock-in, maintaining ownership of its data.

              Providing technical tools and training to build capacity among colleagues at DTCA
5.5           The research instances of the GTFS Editor and Transport Analyst software tools
              implemented through this project enable colleagues at DTCA and RAJUK to implement the
              knowledge gained through capacity building workshops. As a result of the training
              delivered in Dhaka, the local team is now able to manipulate GTFS datasets and use them
              in combination with GIS data files to model the accessibility impacts of different public
              transport scenarios. DTCA and RAJUK can use this new capability to forecast the impact
              of different public transport scenarios on access to different types of opportunity (jobs,
              healthcare and education facilities).
5.6           The techniques learned by colleagues at DTCA and RAJUK are also relevant to the
              development and maintenance of GTFS feed for the purpose of powering online journey
              planning tools. The team at DTCA highlighted this as a possible activity for follow-up work
              which would be valuable for both Dhaka residents and visitors alike. It will be particularly
              valuable if Dhaka’s bus network reorganisation proposals are implemented in-line with the
              recommendations from the ALG study published in 2014.
5.7           The software resources established though this project will remain available to the team at
              DTCA until September 2016, during which time the project team will monitor the extent
              they are being used. This usage insight will help inform any case for longer-term
              investment in hosted instances of the tools. At this point DTCA will need to determine
              whether the value of GTFS Editor and Transport Analyst is worth the estimated annual cost
              (~$10,000 per annum) required to host and maintain the cloud servers through which the
              tools are delivered.
5.8           If they elect not to continue using the tools there is no penalty for doing so. There is no
              vendor lock-in to the tools, so DTCA and RAJUK remain free to take the GTFS and GIS
              data files they own and manipulate them with different software tools. At the time of
              delivering this project, there were few other options available for open-source transport
              modelling and intelligence using GTFS. Since that time, operators such as Remix (formerly
              TransitMix), Conveyal, OpenTripPlanner and Trillium have all produced either new
              products or substantial improvements to existing offerings. Some of these are available at
              competitive prices, whilst some are free but require technical expertise to install and
              maintain.

               Applying this learning will enable DTCA’s team to rapidly prototype and model the
               accessibility impacts of larger numbers of potential new transport lines (or reorganised
               bus networks), prior to investing time and resources in more detailed travel demand
               modelling that informs prioritisation of transport network improvements. Immediate
               activities to model access to healthcare and education facilities, and employment
               opportunities represent logical follow-up tasks for DTCA to aid deeper understanding of
               proposed BRT and MRT proposals.
               It is recommended to determine whether there is value in maintaining the GTFS dataset,
               and cloud-based tools introduced through this project based on the extent to which they
               have been used since the completion of the current study.

              Deploying an accessibility mapping tool for use in Dhaka
5.9           The Transport Analyst tool deployed through this project has been used successfully by the
              project team, and colleagues at DTCA and RAJUK, to calculate the projected accessibility
              impacts of all BRT and MRT routes planned for implementation in Dhaka. As noted above,
              the web-based tool remains freely available for continued use by DTCA and RAJUK until
              September 2016. It offers scope for the local team to undertake more detailed accessibility
              modelling and mapping analyses in relation to local transport planning objectives.
5.10          The research using the current bus route and service frequency data available from the
              previous ALG study (2014), and evidence from prior World Banks studies on gender
              inequality in Dhaka, demonstrated that current public transport accessibility levels are very
              low. By virtue of their faster operating speeds, and dedicated running lanes, the proposed
              BRT and MRT lines are expected to significantly increase the levels of public transport
              accessibility in the city region.
5.11          On the basis of the latest available Census data, the total population of the Dhaka
              Metropolitan area was counted to be around 8.3 million people in 2011, 44% of whom are
              female. Table 5-1 suggests that, when completed, all of the planned BRT and MRT lines
              will increase by 20% the number of people living in this area who can access Motijheel in
              Dhaka within a 90 minute journey by public transport and walking. The introduction of all
              new modes of travel in Dhaka will mean that over 82% of the metro area’s population will
              live within a 90 minute walk and PT journey of Motijheel, compared with 63% currently.
              Table 5-1: Estimated impact of BRT and MRT on the number of people who will live
              within 90 minutes of Motijheel by public transport
                       Scenario                      Whole population
              Base scenario                                    5,226,461
              Base scenario + BRT                                 6,503,827
              Base scenario + BRT + MRT                           6,780,366
5.12          On the basis that all of the planned BRT and MRT lines will deliver public transport service
              conditions that are more acceptable for females (who currently seek to avoid overcrowded
              buses due to the threat of harassment and abuse), this population group is forecast to
              experience the greatest increases in public transport accessibility levels. Two different
              approaches to estimating the impacts on female accessibility were used, which reveal that:
                 Between 31% and 34% of the 4 million females who reside in Metro Dhaka are
                  currently able to access Motijheel within 90 minutes travel time by public transport +
                  walking.
                 This is projected to increase to between 49% and 77%, depending on methodology
                  used, of all females in Dhaka once all planned BRT and MRT routes are introduced.
5.13          These statistics suggest that the planned BRT and MRT lines will significantly narrow the
              current public transport accessibility gender inequality gap that exists in Dhaka. They will
              provide females with comparable levels of connectivity along the alignments of planned
              new routes – particularly in the direction of Mirpur, Kuril, Shymoli, and Gabtoli.

5.14          One design consideration for the BRT and MRT lines, and their respective carrying
              capacities, is the potential for these services to be overwhelmed by mode-switching and
              supressed demand for faster journey times as they are sequentially completed and
              become operational. This is pertinent if their operation is to avoid replicating the
              overcrowded conditions in which females report experiencing abuse or harassment.

               Transport Analyst represents a valuable tool for DTCA, RAJUK and other agencies in
               Dhaka. It may be used to explore the accessibility impacts of new public transport
               proposals, and forecast land-use changes in the future; as well as to better understand
               the areas of Dhaka that are currently poorly connected by public transport. The project
               team’s work to understand and visualise the challenges experienced by females when
               using public transport in Dhaka could also be further expanded. Surveys that explore the
               specific bus routes that females are able to use in comfort at different times of day, and
               those they avoid, could inform more finely-detailed accessibility analyses.


              Opportunities and potential next steps
5.15          A number of opportunities exist for colleagues at DTCA and RAJUK to apply the new
              capabilities developed through this project, which are documented in this sub-section.
              Improving the quality of GTFS data (DTCA)
5.16          The GTFS dataset created as a by-product of this project was established from data
              collected as part of ALG’s bus network reorganisation study (2014). The data are
              consequently ‘high level’ and rely on average bus operating speeds and headways which
              represent a best approximation of the way the bus network operates.
5.17          A logical next step would be to use the ongoing bus network reorganisation activities in
              Dhaka, which are likely to redesign the network to accommodate planned mass transit
              services, in order to update the GTFS dataset and ensure it is fit for public release to aid
              journey planning tools and updated bus network maps. Public information provided in
              Bangla/using images will be key to explaining how a re-organised bus network operates.
5.18          The user guides and supporting materials that document the workflow established through
              this project provide the basis for a localised approach to using GTFS Editor to facilitate this
              process.

               OPPORTUNITY           DTCA could use GTFS to record individual bus route data
               ACTIVITY              Detailed surveys of all bus routes, stop locations and journey times
               OUTCOME               More accurate accessibility modelling and online journey planning

              Opening up existing datasets to third parties (DTCA + RAJUK)
5.19          DTCA recognised there may be some value in opening-up selected transport datasets, and
              the project team provided a list of datasets that it recommended could be prioritised for
              release as public open data (See Appendix G, or here in the DTCA Data Hub). The only
              barrier to opening-up the data DTCA currently has is the website that would be used to

              promote its availability. This could take the form of a dedicated site (e.g. data.dtca.bd), or -
              most simply - a page on the existing DTCA website (e.g. www.dtcb.bd/data).
5.20          The project team prepared a list of key requirements for the development of an Open Data
              Webpage (option 3) so that DTCA can build these into any future Terms of Reference for
              website development. The implementation of the project team’s recommendations would
              be a logical next step towards maximising the value of the Data Hub, by:
                 Increasing transparency and public engagement in discussions about transport network
                  management and planning in Dhaka.
                 Making datasets like GTFS available for app developers and bus operators wishing to
                  create bus maps and journey planners for Dhaka public transport passengers.
                 Saving DTCA officers’ time when responding to common data requests from members
                  of the public, academics, donor banks, and consultants.
                 Raising the profile of the transport data collection and analysis activities of DTCA.
5.21          This project could be delivered by DTCA independently (with assistance from a local
              software developer), or as part of a larger public transport planning initiative such as the
              implementation of BRT and MRT.

               OPPORTUNITY           Use DTCA and RAJUK websites to openly share public datasets
               ACTIVITY              Link relevant Data Hub contents to existing government webpages
               OUTCOME               Increase transparency, encourage third party transport information
                                     provision, and reduce time spent handling data requests

              Merging data from the Transport Data Hub into DTCA’s forthcoming server (DTCA)
5.22          DTCA’s current project to establish a data server within its Nagar Bhaban office presents a
              near-term opportunity to build on the Transport Data Hub structure created through this
              project. Although the project team has limited insight into the purpose and content that will
              be stored on DTCA’s proposed server, we propose the following are likely to be logical next
              steps for integrating the Transport Data Hub within it:
                 Drawing on, and amending as necessary, the folder structure created through this
                  project as a means of storing strategic reports and their datasets for the team within
                  DTCA.
                 Continuing to use the Transport Data Hub for collaborative data sharing with external
                  partner agencies and consultants (e.g. serving data to the DTCA website or through
                  shared folders). The cloud-based nature of the existing Data Hub will avoid DTCA
                  having to share access to its own file-server with external agencies (adding security),
                  and bring redundancy in the form of off-site duplicate copies.
               OPPORTUNITY           Evolve Transport Data Hub to DTCA’s own server in the future
               ACTIVITY              Maintain folder structure and migrate to new server when ready
               OUTCOME               Support DTCA’s future ICT goals and accelerate use of new server

              Further accessibility analysis under different data themes
5.23          Due to limited data available to DTCA and the project team, the accessibility analysis
              undertaken was relatively limited compared to what is technically feasible using more
              precise or wider ranging data. In paragraphs 4.56 and 4.58 above, accessibility of

              BRT and MRT lines. Detailed data for other themes, in particular employment, can be used
              in a similar way. For example the number of jobs accessible from a particular city centre
              location can be estimated. This can use existing local data or that from international
              sources such as WorldPop (www.worldpop.org.uk).

              Additional training for DTCA through current and future projects (DTCA + donor agencies)
5.24          The project team’s dialogue with DTCA colleagues through the course of the project
              identified the following topics for additional training and support:
                 Real-world application of Transport Analyst accessibility modelling tool outputs in
                  common GIS software tools (e.g. QGIS), to specifically cover the following topics in a
                  learn-by-doing context:
                      Determining estimated numbers of people living within defined public transport
                       travel time isochrones of key locations in Dhaka.
                      Using Transport Analyst outputs to identify current areas of poor connectivity, to
                       complement the bus network reorganisation project, and determine where
                       additional public transport service coverage would complement planned BRT and
                       MRT lines for Dhaka.
                      Testing BRT and MRT line impacts on modelled changes to population distribution
                       and land-use in Greater Dhaka, to explore the effect these variables may have on
                       public transport accessibility levels.
                      Testing BRT and MRT forecast/actual passenger data in comparison with
                       accessibility modelling estimates of potential connectivity for people living within
                       areas around the new transport corridors.
                 Interrogating improved GTFS data to determine transport supply levels and capacities
                  at given times of day, for comparison with travel demand data (e.g. from household
                  surveys and cell phone datasets) to deepen understanding of how existing public
                  transport supply relates to demand.

                  improvement purposes.

               ACTIVITY             Further training framed around ‘live’ projects & research questions
               OUTCOME              Support further capability-building and independent application of
                                    strategic, data-driven, transport planning activities in Dhaka

              Transport Modelling in the wider Planning context
5.25          Integrating GTFS-based transport modelling with the wider urban planning needs of a city
              is an important step in building an efficient public transit network. The Transport Analyst
              tool supports the industry standard format for geographic information system data
              (‘shapefiles’) which can be used to understand the transport accessibility of specific urban
              developments.
5.26          Similarly, the tools presented can be used to model other types of transport to those
              already tested. The GTFS specification supports eight different transport modes, and
              additional local types of service can be added using the GTFS Editor software. This means
              that travel time across a city can be modelled using the Transport Analyst software, even
              for less common types of transport such as cable cars and water transport.
5.27          In Dhaka this may be particularly important since there is substantial provision of water-
              based transport to the general public. Frequent or high-capacity services can be recorded
              in GTFS using the Editor software, and assigned an appropriate frequency or timetable.
              The resulting feed data could not only be used for accessibility modelling, but in public-
              facing journey planners which are aware of water transport services.
5.28          Furthermore, it would be possible to use the tool to estimate accessibility to spatial areas
              covered by RAJUK’s master planning for the Dhaka Metropolitan Area. For example, the
              amount of employment land/forecast new dwellings that are within defined travel time
              boundaries of specific locations within the city could be estimated using tools like Transport
              Analyst. This would allow for comparative analysis of packages of spatial options in
              relation to different transport network scenarios (e.g. current, future with BRT & MRT) and
              better inform the master planning process when land is being formally allocated for
              development.

              Lessons for replicating support with open transport data & ICT in other locations
5.29          A number of lessons learned through the course of delivering this project will be relevant
              should World Bank or DTCA choose to replicate its outcomes in other locations. Table 5-2
              sets out these lessons learned, the context in which they may be relevant, and the
              agencies to which they are applicable.
5.30          A common theme running through the lessons learned relates to ensuring software tools
              such as GTFS Editor and Transport Analyst are deployed in contexts where there is:
                 A clear understanding of the local need for improved public transport data to power
                  strategic transport planning and public information tools.
                 A near-term strategic transport planning objective (in the case of Dhaka, planned BRT
                  and MRT lines) against which the significant up-front effort needed to collate and edit
                  public transport data can be aligned.
                 The willingness among local teams to take responsibility for maintaining, and exploiting
                  such datasets after the project is complete.
