         Key Water and Sanitation Sector Challenges
         X   Financing investments to upgrade the water and wastewater sector infrastructure. The
             second phase of the national Master Plan Implementation requires infrastructure investments
             for both water and sanitation in order to comply with EU directives by 2030. Those investments
             are estimated at around €640 million over the next 15 years, or nearly double the current level of
             investment.
         X   Improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of water utilities. Efficiency and performance
             of water utilities are a challenge that will require addressing issues such as overstaffing and
             excessive nonrevenue water levels.
         X   Implementing sound cost recovery principles. Water utilities do not generate sufficient revenues
             to ensure proper maintenance and sustainability of infrastructure. To reverse this trend and
             address this issue, tariffs may need to be reviewed according to sound cost recovery principles.

Economy. Montenegro has a developing economy with important regional disparities. Its 0.6M inhabitants
are mainly located in the central and southern parts of the country. The Montenegrin economy is characterized
by low labor productivity, import dependence, high unemployment, and undeveloped financial institutions and
capital markets. The average GDP per capita of US$14,318 PPP reflects this overall situation. Montenegro also
shows significant local disparities in level of development. The northern part of the country has a higher rate of
unemployment and a lower income per capita than the central and coastal areas (CIA 2015). Roma (1%) and
Egyptians (0.3%) are the most vulnerable marginalized minorities (Monstat 2011). Since December 2010, Montenegro
has been an official candidate for EU membership.

Governance. Public administration is organized at the national and municipal levels. Montenegro is a parliamentary
republic with 23 municipalities and no administrative regions. Local self-governments perform activities such as local
development planning and program implementation, and provision of local public utility services including water and
wastewater services (Gov. ME 2011).

Water resources. Montenegro has sufficient water resources, but they are unevenly distributed across the country.
Ninety-five percent of Montenegrin watercourses are formed within the country (i.e., both the sources and a major
part of the drainage basins occur within national boundaries). This minimizes cross-border impacts on Montenegrin
waters, but also engenders responsibility for the quality and distribution of water, which then flows into neighbouring
countries. Rainfall in Montenegro is characterized by high variability in both time and space. The country has good-
quality groundwater and surface water, but these resources are unevenly distributed throughout the country. Karst
areas in the central and western parts are arid, whereas the northern mountainous area is richer in raw water.
About half the country belongs to the Danube catchment and the other half to the Adriatic catchment. Flood water
potentially threatens 24,500 hectares of farmland and urban areas. Central and northern parts of the country were
hit by large floods in 1963, 1979, 1999, and 2000, causing power outages, landslides, and damage to water and
wastewater infrastructure, resulting in serious drinking water shortages (ICPDR 2010). Concerning long-term climate
variations, the yield of water sources will be reduced, and some springs will dry up or experience intermittent flow. As
a result, accumulations used for industrial and commercial purposes will decrease, as will hydropower generation,
resulting in an increase in electricity imports. The southern parts of the country are likely to be most vulnerable to
climate change (Gov. ME 2010). However, no specific strategies have been implemented to address this likelihood.

Water supply sources. Public water utilities use groundwater to produce drinking water. In 2012, 114Mm3 of water
were abstracted for public water supply, 90% of which came from groundwater. Industrial facilities use raw water,
approximately two-thirds of which comes from surface water and one-third from groundwater. Prevailing pollutants
are mainly the result of wastewater from point sources. Industrial wastewater treatment is performed in only a few
industrial plants, and there are only four municipal wastewater treatment plants for the whole country. In coastal
areas, wastewater is discharged directly into the sea (ICPDR 2010).

Service provision. Municipalities provide water and wastewater services to their population. Local governments
are responsible for water and wastewater services and provide them through 22 public utility companies. Fifteen
municipal utilities that provide only water and sanitation services cover urban areas representing 50% of the
population. Six municipal multi-utility companies supply mostly small municipalities (18% of the population) (Figure
1). One regional water company owned by the central state has been specifically created to supply water to coastal
municipalities (8% of the population). With an average population served of 21,466, the Montenegrin water sector
appears fragmented compared to other Danube countries.

Policy-making and sector institutions. The sector is controlled and regulated at the national level by several
ministries, with one clear line ministry. As shown in Figure 2, local water and wastewater service providers are
regulated and controlled by five national institutions:

Capacity and training. Staff capacity building and training remain an important issue in the water sector. Water services
management staff are appointed by municipal representatives with no specific qualification or experience requirements.
This results in significant turnover according to political cycles, and appointment of management personnel who lack
appropriate skills and competencies. Moreover, water utilities technical staff receive almost no training, which prevents
efficiency gains in technical operations and utilities management. As a consequence, there is considerable room for
improvement of staff training and for development of staff capacity in the water sector. Currently, the national water
association, which comprises the 21 directors of public water and wastewater utilities, is the main provider of training,
technical assistance, and knowledge exchange activities (workshops, conferences, journal) to water stakeholders.

Economic regulation. Water tariffs are set at the local level and water utilities financial statements are reviewed
annually by the Ministry of Finance. The water sector in Montenegro is regulated through a public self-regulated
model, since there is no national regulation agency and no official national benchmarking system. Tariffs are revised
upon request of utilities. Utility managers submit a new tariff proposal to the utility management board. If accepted,
a proposal of decree on tariff changes must then to be approved by the local municipality. Water and wastewater
utilities must submit their annual financial statement to the Tax Administration Head Office (under the Ministry of
Finance) for financial inspection (MIF 2015).

Ongoing or planned reforms. Administrative reforms are still at a preparatory stage. The Public Administration
Reform Strategy in Montenegro for 2011–2016 provides a comprehensive framework summarizing the main targets
and domains of the administration reform process at both the national and local levels. However, the objectives
stated in this document are still at a preparatory stage and will probably be implemented under the umbrella of EU
harmonization in the coming decade. The objectives applying to water and wastewater utilities are likely to focus
on (a) implementation of full production cost recovery to enhance utility sustainability, and (b) the regionalization of
service delivery to improve operation and capital efficiency via economies of scale (Gov. ME 2011).

Service coverage. Service coverage in urban areas is much better than in rural                         Montenegro Data

services (Figure 3). However, access to publicly provided services is much lower.                      Overall data availability
Approximately 76% of the Montenegrin population is connected to the public water                       could be improved,
supply and 43% to sewerage. Only 18% of all wastewater produced is effectively                         especially for information
treated, mostly below the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive standards, resulting                   on water sector funding
in significant environmental and public health hazards. However, the situation in urban                and spending. Moreover,
and rural areas is markedly disparate. In urban areas, more than 98% of the population                 some operational data are
has access to a public water supply and 71% has sewerage services. To improve                          available for only a limited
wastewater treatment, construction of 6 treatment plants (totaling 485,800 population                  number of years, which

Equity of access to services. Three-quarters of minority populations have access to piped water supply. Access to
piped water and flush toilets for the bottom 40% of the population is quite high at, respectively, 84% and 82%. For the
poorest share of the population (living on less than $2.50/day), these rates are 72% and 66%, respectively. According
to UNDP/World Bank/EC 2011, the vast majority of Roma, Ashkaelia, and Egyptian households (73.6%) have access
to a piped water supply into their accommodations, 0.4% have a well with pump, 0.7% have their own water supply
system, while 25.3% use some other source of drinking water. More than two-thirds of this population (68.4%) do
not have an indoor bathroom and use an outdoor WC (54.9%) or a common bathroom (38%). However, 7.1% of the
minority populations have neither a common bathroom nor an outdoor WC.

Service infrastructure. Wastewater treatment plant capacity should be significantly increased by 2016. Four
wastewater treatment plants—three built between 2003 and 2007 and one in 1978—are in operation in Montenegro,
all equipped with secondary treatment and, as mentioned, 6 more are planned to be built during 2014 to 2016. Those
investments will increase Montenegro’s wastewater treatment capacity eightfold.

Quality of service. There are important disparities in service continuity and water consumption. Service continuity is
24 hours a day in most water utilities, except during the summer, when continuity issues do arise. In a few municipalities,
there are still some longer interruptions, during which service continuity ranges from 4 to 12 hours per day. In 2012,
12,452 samples of drinking water from the public water supply were tested for microbiological or physical-chemical
compliance, 85.5% of which passed the tests. This compliance rate appears low compared with other countries in the
Danube region. In the coastal areas, noncompliance is due to saline water inflows during the summer months. Frequent
failures of worn-out distribution pipes are also causing microbiological noncompliance. Average water consumption per
capita is 237 liters per day (l/day), but varies from 494 l/day to 121 l/day. This very high average consumption compared
to Western European countries has been exacerbated by low and subsidized water prices.

Customer satisfaction. Population satisfaction with the service provided in their country (as per Gallup Poll) is
quite high, at 69%. This number comports with most countries in the region.

Overall efficiency. Considerable efficiency efforts are still required. Efficiency gains and utilities performance are
among the objectives assigned to local governments by the Strategy for Public Administration Reform (Gov. ME
2011). Efforts still need to be made, since overstaffing remains an important issue in most water utilities, with an
average staff productivity of 10.3 (minimum of 6.2 and maximum of 21.5) compared to international best practice
of 1 to 2. The average collection rate is 72%, with a minimum of 30% and a maximum of 96%, indicating that utilities
have significant difficulty recovering billed invoices and generating revenues. At 59%, nonrevenue water is higher than
the Danube regional average. This rate has increased in recent decades because of metering improvement, which
has led to a more accurate measurement of leakage and nonregistered connections. The increase is also due to
undermaintenance of the water network and underinvestment.

Recent trends. No real efficiency gains have been made. Over the last 10 years, the level of nonrevenue water has
increased by 80% (Figure 4), reflecting the lack of proper maintenance and asset renewal that has occurred over
several decades. Significant efforts are still needed to increase efficiency, as pointed out in the Strategy for Public
Administration Reform (Gov. ME 2011).

Investments. Half of current investments are funded by international loans. In 2005, Master Plan Strategies
for water and wastewater infrastructure upgrading and completion were adopted for a period of 25 years. The
Montenegrin Master Plans have estimated that €813 million (€560 million planned for wastewater and €253 million
planned for water supply) would be needed from 2005 to 2029 to reach full EU standards and the environmental
acquis. This overall investment target represents a yearly effort of 0.28% of GDP. During the first phase of the Master
Plans (2005–2009), €109 million was invested in water and wastewater infrastructure, the equivalent of 0.95% of GDP
and a yearly effort of 0.19% of GDP over the period. Half of the funding was provided by international loans, 45% by
national subsidies from the central government budget, and 5% by local governments. Until the end of the first phase
of the Master Plans, Montenegro followed the dynamics of financial investments projected in the strategic planning
documents. However, in subsequent years, the economic crisis resulted in a decrease of funding from the central
government budget and in a deceleration of investment trends (Figure 7).

Cost recovery. Low water tariffs hardly allow utilities to cover their operating costs. The average operating ratio
of public water utilities is 0.76. However, it ranges from 2.24 to 0.46, showing great disparities among utilities. Low
water tariffs do not allow water and wastewater services to cover the full cost of operation and maintenance, let alone
investment costs. Cross-financing between domestic and industrial sectors (with industrial tariffs being 2.5 times
higher than residential ones), and subsidies from national and local budgets, are necessary to cover both capital and
operational expenditure. An added factor is that local governments tend to think that the price of water should remain
low due to social and welfare concerns.

Tariffs. A significant increase in water tariffs is to be expected in the coming years. The average residential tariff is €0.67/m3
(Figure 8). The average industrial water tariff is 179% more expensive than the residential price, at €1.87/m3 (MRT 2012a).

Affordability. Affordability is not yet an issue for the majority of the population, since water is not expensive. Tariffs
are kept low by local governments since water is considered a “social service.” Nevertheless, the average annual water
bill potentially represents 1.6% of the average household income. The share of potential water and sanitation expenditure
would represent 2.4% for the bottom 40%. This situation may change since important investments will be made in the
future. However, these investments will be mainly funded by international loans. Hence, water tariff increases should
mostly correspond to increases in operational expenses rather than increases in capital expenses.

Water Sector Sustainability
and Main Challenges
In order to evaluate and reflect the sustainability of services in the region, an overall sector sustainability assessment has
been established taking into account four main dimensions: access to services, quality of services, efficiency of services,
and financing of services. Each of these dimensions is measured through three simple and objective indicators. For
each indicator, best practice values are established by looking at the best performers in the region, and countries closest
to those best performers are deemed to have a more mature sector. A more complete description of the methodology
to assess the sector sustainability is included in the Annex of the State of the Sector Regional Report from the Danube
Water Program. The outcomes of this assessment for the Montenegro water sector are displayed in Figure 9, which also
shows average and best practices in the Danube region. As a result, the Montenegro sector sustainability score is 59,
which is below the Danube average sustainability of 64, and is among the lower scores in the region. The assessment
shows that, on average, the country performs well in terms of access to piped water and flush toilet, continuity of
service and affordability. The main deficiencies of Montenegro’s water sector identified through the sector sustainability
assessment are the operating cost ratio, staffing level, and wastewater treatment coverage.

The main sector challenges are:

X   Financing investments to upgrade the water and wastewater                       Montenegro Waters
    sector infrastructure. The second phase of the national Master                  The company “Vodacom” has started
    Plan Implementation requires infrastructure investments for both                implementing a benchmarking project in the
    water and sanitation in order to achieve EU directives compliance               Coastal Municipalities of Montenegro. Information
    by 2030. Those investments are estimated at around €640 million                 about technical and financial indicators and about
    over the next 15 years, or twice the current level of investment.               service management and service quality is being
    Some EU-related funding (through the Instrument for Pre-accession               collected. For each water utility, the benchmarking
    Assistance, IPA) should be available to finance these investments.              approach will help identify specific indicators that
    Efforts will have to be made to improve both the quality of drinking            could be monitored in order to improve overall
    water delivered, since the compliance rate is only 85%, and the                 service quality and promote implementation of
    wastewater effective level of collection and treatment.                         best practices.

X   Improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of water utilities. As stated in the Strategy for Public
    Administration Reform, efficiency and performance of water utilities are a challenge. To achieve this objective,

    nonrevenue water levels have to be lowered by improving the quality of metering devices and reducing network
    leakage through sound maintenance and renewal of assets. Overstaffing has also been identified by the Strategy
    as an issue that needs to be addressed, since it results in high labor costs, thereby increasing utility operational
    expenses.

X   Implementing sound cost recovery principles. Water utilities do not generate sufficient revenues to ensure proper
    maintenance and sustainability of infrastructure. For many utilities, subsidies from central and local budgets are
    needed to cover routine operation and maintenance costs. This situation threatens the long-term sustainability
    and good performance of water and wastewater services. To reverse this trend, tariffs may need to be reviewed
    according to sound cost recovery principles, especially since the investments to upgrade the existing infrastructure
    will generate an increase in operational costs.
