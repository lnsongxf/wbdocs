A. Introduction
Conflict-induced forced displacement—defined as situations where people are forced to flee their homes
due to conflict, generalized violence and human rights violations—is gaining prominence as a topic of
discussion, both internationally and within the World Bank.2 This is partly due to the massive refugee flows
generated by the Syrian conflict, but also motivated by a growing consensus that forced displacement poses
a substantial threat to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially for
countries of origin and host countries of refugees and IDPs. Within the Bank, the adoption of the twin goals
of eliminating extreme poverty and enhancing shared prosperity requires increased attention to vulnerable
and disadvantaged communities, among whom the displaced rank highly. Support for a development
approach to displacement, which promotes durable solutions based on economic opportunity and self-
reliance is gaining ground.
Establishing an accurate picture of the scale and dynamics of conflict-induced forced displacement is
extremely challenging. Data are collected from a multiplicity of sources, employing different definitions and
methodologies, leading to variations in the comparability, quality and reliability of reported data within and
between countries. Numbers can change rapidly due to ongoing conflicts and monitoring can be challenging
due to the fluidity of population movements and lack of access to conflict-affected areas. In a number of
contexts, statistics may misrepresent the true scale of displacement due to practical difficulties associated
with data collection, political incentives to manipulate figures or methodological issues. Reported data may
be incomplete due to limited coverage of data collection activities, or because collected data are not fully
reflected in aggregated statistics due to poor coordination of data compilation activities. Significantly,
headline figures on forced displacement do not capture affected host communities and returnees who may
still face specific vulnerabilities associated with their displacement.
Despite these challenges, large amounts of data on forcibly displaced populations are collected and
disseminated each year and used to inform policy and programming. Substantial amounts of data are
gathered and published by national governments, international organizations, and national and international
NGOs. Lacking more credible statistics, these flawed and incomplete data are often used widely to inform
policy making and programming by humanitarian and development actors. While it may not be possible to
obtain comprehensive and reliable data in the short-term, it is important to understand the limitations of the
figures that are currently available and widely quoted.
Current data collection efforts focus on estimating the numbers of forcibly displaced and consequently there
are significant gaps in the data required for longer-term development planning. There is increasing interest
in identifying and addressing the gaps and deficiencies in the data on forced displacement in order to: (a)
underpin a policy dialogue with affected countries on the longer-term development impacts (both positive
and negative) of conflict-induced forced displacement on host countries, host communities and displaced
populations, and the advantages and disadvantages of various policy options; and (b) design evidence-
based policy responses and development assistance strategies to mitigate negative impacts and support
positive results. An expanded evidence base would support a more informed policy dialogue with country
counterparts, and would also provide more practical guidelines for development interventions.
Several initiatives are already underway to improve statistics on forced displacement, including work being
carried out by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC)3 with support of the International
Organization for Migration (IOM),4 the Joint IDP Profiling Service (JIPS),5 the Inter-Agency Standing

of this paper. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to forced displacement in this paper refer to conflict-induced
forced displacement.

displacement worldwide. See http://www.internal-displacement.org/.
4 IOM, established in 1951, is the leading inter-governmental organization in the field of migration, with 162 member
states and nine states holding observer status.
5JIPS is an inter-agency initiate overseen by UNHCR, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), OCHA,
Danish Refugee Council, IDMC and the UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of IDPs that supports international
and national actors in collecting data on displacement situations through collaborative data-collection exercises. JIPS
Committee (IASC) Information Management Working Group,6 as well as an initiative being led jointly by the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and Statistics Norway under the auspices of
the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSD).7 The latter is working on: (a) preparation of a handbook
for official statistics on refugees together with a refugee statistics compiler’s manual that would provide
practical guidance to improve the collection, analysis and dissemination of refugee statistics; and (b)
formation of a committee composed of experts from both national statistical agencies and international
organizations, which would lead the development of the handbook (UNSD 2016). Progress on this agenda
was discussed at the 47th session of UNSD held in New York in March 2016, where it was decided that the
expert group should also include IDPs in its scope of work (UNSD 2016).
The objective of this report is to review the various sources of data on conflict-induced forced displacement
and to assess how these can be improved to enable more effective analysis and assistance by development
actors. Specifically, the report: (a) reviews the various sources of data on refugees, asylum-seekers and
IDPs and provides a comprehensive overview of their coverage, timeliness and reliability; and (b) assesses
how the collection and compilation of data could be improved to enable more effective analysis of
displacement situations and assistance by development actors. This analysis has been carried out through
an examination of available data on refugees, asylum-seekers and IDPs, a desk review of relevant
literature, and technical inputs from key data collectors and compilers including UNHCR, United Nations
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), IDMC, JIPS and IOM. While
there are significant numbers of people displaced by natural and man-made disasters, as well as
development projects, the focus of this report is on conflict-induced displacement only. The circumscribed
focus of this paper recognizes the unique character of displacement emerging in fragile, conflict-affected
and violent settings, and the need to appropriately tailor development responses to these contexts and the
underlying drivers of conflict.
                                 Box 1: Terminology used in this Report
    Refugees: Individuals displaced outside their country of nationality or habitual residence as a
    consequence of generalized violence, conflict or a well-founded fear of persecution, and are therefore in
    need of protection.8
    Asylum-seekers: Individuals who are seeking international protection under the 1951 Convention
    Relating to the Status of Refugees (1951 Convention) but whose claims for refugee status have not yet
    been determined.9
    IDPs: Individuals who have been forced or obliged to leave their homes or places of habitual residence
    as a result of, or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence,
    violations of human rights, and who have not crossed an international border and therefore remain under
    the legal protection of their own government.10

 their displacement.11
 Affected host communities: Populations living in areas hosting refugees or IDPs and whose welfare is
 impacted positively or negatively by the presence of displaced populations.12

B. Legal, statistical and development perspectives on the global data on forced
displacement
Worldwide it is estimated that there were more than 65 million people displaced due to conflict, generalized
violence, persecution and violations of human rights at the end of 2015, including 40.8 million IDPs (IDMC
2016), 16.1 million refugees and 3.2 million asylum-seekers under UNHCR’s mandate (UNHCR 2016), and
5.2 million Palestinian refugees under UNRWA’s mandate (UNRWA 2016)—the highest total on record
since comprehensive statistics on global forced displacement started to be collected in the early 1990s (see
Figure 1). Significantly, these headline figures on forced displacement do not capture affected host
communities and returnees who have yet to achieve sustainable solutions.
                             Figure 1: Forced Displacement by Category end-2015




Sources: UNHCR, IDMC, UNRWA
Note: Palestine refugees only include those under UNRWA’s mandate. UNHCR data includes 97,973 refugees from
West Bank and Gaza, and IDMC data includes 221,425 IDPs in West Bank and Gaza at the end of 2015.

Data on forced displacement reflect diverse definitions of refugees, asylum-seekers and IDPs. In theory,
data on forced displacement should reflect the definitions of refugees, asylum-seekers and IDPs
established in international and regional agreements focused on securing protection and assistance for
those who flee violence and persecution. These agreements primarily emphasize legal rights, especially
the right to state protection, rather than socio-economic vulnerabilities. In reality, statistics on forced
displacement reflect diverse definitions employed by national governments and organizations responsible
for collecting and compiling data. These statistical definitions vary within and between countries depending
on the different objectives and methodologies of data collection efforts.
Political factors can determine how these definitions are crafted and applied in practice, contributing to the
substantial variation in data across displacement situations. Conflict-induced displacement is inherently

political. Asylum countries may inflate numbers of refugees to maximize international assistance, to tarnish
the reputation of countries of origin or to bolster their own. Alternatively, they may report artificially low
numbers to avoid antagonizing countries of origin (Crisp 1999). In some contexts, it may be politically
expedient to only recognize IDPs displaced by some parties to the conflict but not others or to only recognize
IDPs of particular ethnicities in order to influence the allocation of assistance. It may also be politically
expedient for governments to prolong IDP status in order to create leverage in negotiations. There may be
pressure not to officially recognize informal urban settlements where the majority of displaced people in
urban areas reside. For countries of origin, there may be pressure to inflate reported numbers of returnees
to demonstrate political success or to maximize assistance for reintegration efforts.
From a development perspective, evolving definitions of conflict-induced forced displacement reflect
consideration of the specific vulnerabilities of displaced populations distinct from their legal status or
statistical measurement, and also include a strong focus on returnees, host countries and affected host
communities. For development actors, forcibly displaced people are of particular concern because they
have specific socio-economic vulnerabilities linked to their displacement, which constrain their ability to take
advantage of economic opportunities and consequently leave them susceptible to poverty. Such specific
vulnerabilities typically include: a sudden and catastrophic loss of assets (including social capital), which
can have long-lasting consequences; trauma and psychological stress; a temporary legal status or loss of
rights (which can result in limited freedom of movement, legal restrictions on employment, decreased
access to education and health services, and vulnerability to abuse); an uncertain situation that makes it
difficult to plan or invest; and being “out of place” economically (residing in an environment where there is
no demand for their skills). It is because such vulnerabilities are unique to those who are displaced that
traditional poverty reduction efforts may not suffice and that special interventions may be needed. The
development response therefore aims to help mitigate or even eliminate these vulnerabilities, while also
addressing the impact of displacement on host countries and communities.13 The Bank has assisted several
countries to prepare and implement development operations focused on mitigating the impacts of forced
displacement, a selection of which are outlined in Box 4 below. In this sense, the “population of particular
focus” for development actors is distinct from that of humanitarian agencies, although there is likely to be
significant overlap.

Refugee status is defined by a well-developed body of international law (see Box 2). However, differences
between the definition of a refugee in the 1951 Convention (updated by the 1967 Protocol) and the
expanded definition of a refugee in the OAU Convention and the Cartagena Declaration, means that an
individual may be considered a refugee in one part of the world but not qualify for that status in another part
of the world. The 1951 Convention (Article 1C) also defines the conditions under which an individual’s
refugee status ends including: (a) voluntary repatriation to their country of origin; (b) naturalization in their



13 The arrival and inclusion of large numbers of refugees, IDPs or returnees in specific locations creates both risks and

opportunities for host countries and communities. The presence of large displaced populations can transform the
environment in which poverty reduction efforts are being designed and implemented by national and local authorities.
country of asylum; (c) resettlement in a third country; and (d) cessation of refugee status because there are
no longer compelling reasons for an individual to refuse to avail themselves of the protection of their country
of origin.
                                       Box 2: Legal Definition of Refugees
 The 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (1951 Convention), later amended by the 1967
 Protocol,14 defines refugees primarily in terms of their vulnerability due to the denial of state protection (Reid 2005)
 as “a person who is outside his or her country of nationality or habitual residence; has a well-founded fear of being
 persecuted because of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political
 opinion; and is unable or unwilling to avail him or herself of the protection of that country, or to return there, for fear
 of persecution.” Individuals who fulfill the definition of refugees are entitled to the rights and are bound by the duties
 set out in the 1951 Convention, most significantly the rights to non-discrimination, non-penalization and non-
 refoulement (which prohibits the return of a refugee to a territory where their life or freedom is threatened).
 In Africa, the 1969 Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa (OAU
 Convention)15 expands the definition of refugees to people who are forced to flee due to “external aggression,
 occupation, foreign domination or events seriously disturbing public order in either part or the whole of his country
 of origin or nationality.” It introduces objective criteria for determining refugee status that are based on the conditions
 prevailing in the country of origin (including situations beyond deliberate state action) and eliminates the requirement
 that a person establish an individual risk of persecution.
 In Latin America, the 1984 Cartagena Declaration on Refugees (Cartagena Declaration), which was heavily
 influenced by the OAU Convention, similarly expands the definition of refugees to include “persons who have fled
 their country because their lives, safety or freedom have been threatened by generalized violence, foreign
 aggression, internal conflicts, massive violations of human rights or other circumstances which have seriously
 disturbed public order.”


Statistics on refugees do not always conform to legal definitions. UNHCR leads global efforts to collect and
compile data on refugees, relying on individual registration or data provided by host governments. Data are
generally provided to UNHCR by host governments based on their own definitions and methods of data
collection, which tend to vary across countries and can lead to substantial variations in aggregate numbers.
For example, people of certain nationalities may be recognized as refugees by some host countries but not
by others and some countries consider the children of refugees to be refugees themselves, while other
countries accord them a different status.16 Moreover, countries do not methodically report statistics on
voluntary returns, naturalization and resettlement.




14 The 1967 Protocol expanded the application of the 1951 Convention beyond the protection of European refugees

following World War II.
15 Adopted by the Organization of African Unity, now the African Union (AU) on September 10, 1969, and entered into

force on June 20, 1974. There are 54 AU member states.
16In addition to persons recognized as refugees under the 1951 Convention, 1967 Protocol and OAU Convention,
UNHCR data also include persons recognized as refugees in accordance with the UNHCR Statute, persons granted a
complementary or subsidiary form of protection and those granted temporary protection. UNHCR statistics also include
people in refugee-like situations, i.e. individuals outside their country or territory of origin who face protection risks
similar to those of refugees, but for whom refugee status has, for practical or other reasons, not been ascertained, for
example 200,000 undocumented Rohingya in Bangladesh originating from Myanmar.
                                Box 3: Recognition of Refugee Status
 Refugee status determination procedures evaluate and verify a person’s claim for refugee status.17 The
 1951 Convention does not set out the procedures for the determination of refugee status, and host
 countries have developed their own procedures and standards. In general, these draw on responsibilities
 derived from the 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol, international human rights and humanitarian law,
 Executive Committee Conclusions,18 and national judicial and administrative legal standards.
 The 1951 Convention gives host countries the discretion to determine whether or not individuals meet
 the definition of refugees and to register asylum-seekers and refugees. Determination of refugee status
 requires establishing the facts and then applying the criteria in the 1951 Convention (or the OAU
 Convention or Cartagena Declaration as they may apply) to those facts. Recognition of an individual’s
 refugee status does not make that person a refugee but declares them to be one.19
 However policies, procedures and practices vary significantly between countries.20 Despite these
 differences, it is generally recognized that refugee status determination procedures include the following
 elements: (a) access to asylum procedures at the border or within the territory of the contracting state in
 accordance with the principle of non-refoulement and without the imposition of time limits; (b) access to
 information and guidance about asylum procedures; (c) access to an interpreter if needed and
 opportunity to contact a representative of UNHCR; (d) a clear authority with the requisite expertise to
 evaluate claims and make decisions; (e) access to information on outcome of asylum claims; (f) issuance
 of documentation for those granted refugee status; (f) access to appeals procedures; (g) permission to
 remain in the country pending a decision on initial applications or appeals; (h) confidentiality; and (i)
 guarantees for separated and unaccompanied children.
 UNHCR is mandated through its Statute of 1950 (together with other General Assembly resolutions) to
 lead and coordinate international action for the protection of refugees and the resolution of refugee
 problems, including assisting countries to establish procedures to determine whether or not a person is
 a refugee. Most countries provide for the involvement of UNHCR in an advisory capacity, but in some
 countries, UNHCR participates in the national asylum procedures including: “preparing a case for
 consideration by national eligibility authorities (e.g. registration, preliminary interview, file preparation,
 presentation to the national authority); voting on the asylum application or participating as an
 observer/advisor at the first instance stage; voting on the asylum application or participating as an
 observer/advisor at the appeal or review stage; and reviewing inadmissibility or rejection decisions of
 applicants who are due to be expelled.” If contracting states have not yet established refugee status
 determination procedures and the task of determining refugee status is left to UNHCR, it can only grant
 an applicant ‘mandate status’ rather than refugee status.
 In the case of mass displacement and large-scale influxes, refugee status may be granted on a prima
 facie basis (i.e. in the absence of evidence to the contrary), whereby the host country makes a
 determination for an entire group on the basis of readily apparent and objective conditions in the country
 of origin. Refugee status is presumptive and conclusive unless and until there is evidence that a person
 is wrongly recognized or subject to exclusion criteria.




17An individual is a refugee according to the 1951 Convention as soon as they meet the criteria established therein,
and this would occur before their refugee status is formally determined. Therefore, refugee status determination
procedures recognize someone as a refugee but do not make that person a refugee.
18See for instance Conclusion No. 8 (XXVIII) on the determination of refugee status (1977) and Conclusion No. 30
(XXXIV) on the problem of manifestly unfounded or abusive applications for refugee status or asylum (1983).
19Therefore, because of the declarative nature of refugee status, asylum-seekers are generally awarded a certain
protective status on the basis that they could be a refugee.
20In a number of countries, refugee status is determined under specific procedures established for this purpose, but in
other countries refugee status is determined within broader procedures of the admission of aliens, informal
arrangements, or ad hoc procedures for specific purposes, e.g. the issuance of travel documents (UNHCR 2011,
Ahmadi and Lakhani 2016).
The population of refugees reflected in the global statistics does not necessarily coincide precisely with the
population of particular focus for development actors. Of the 16.1 million refugees and people in refugee-
like situations under UNHCR’s mandate at the end of 2015, 2.4 million were living in high-income (OECD
and non-OECD) countries that do not qualify for assistance from development organizations.21 Additionally,
even within low and middle-income asylum countries, there may be pockets of refugees in protracted
displacement who may not have achieved a legal solution to their displacement (i.e. naturalization in the
host country, voluntary repatriation to their home country or resettlement in a third country) but who no
longer have specific economic and social vulnerabilities linked to their having been displaced. They may
no longer have protection or assistance needs, they may have achieved a high degree of economic and
social inclusion, they may enjoy most of the privileges of citizenship, and they may have achieved a
standard of living equal to that of nationals, e.g. over 300,000 ethnically Chinese refugees who fled from
Vietnam to China between 1979 and 1982 (UNHCR 2007). On the other hand, there may be refugees who
fall out of the global statistics when they are naturalized but who continue to be of interest to development
actors because they still face specific vulnerabilities linked to their displacement, e.g. Burundian refugees
newly naturalized in Tanzania.

The special case of Palestinian refugees
The legal definition of Palestinian refugees is unique and distinct from the definition of refugees in the 1951
Convention. Palestinian refugees fall within the mandate of UNRWA,22 which operates in Jordan, Lebanon,
the Syrian Arab Republic, Gaza and the West Bank. UNRWA defines “Palestine refugees” as individuals
and their patrilineal descendants whose normal place of residence was the British Mandate for Palestine
during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost their homes and livelihoods as a result of the
1948 conflict.23 Palestinian refugees living outside UNRWA’s five areas of operation fall under the
responsibility of UNHCR and are included in UNHCR statistics. There are other groups that are entitled to
receive UNRWA services but are not identified as refugees in UNRWA’s registration system including those
displaced by the 1967 and 1982 Arab-Israeli conflicts. Some Palestinian refugees may be also reflected in
IDP statistics, for example it is estimated that of 560,000 Palestinian refugees registered in Syria, 280,000
were internally displaced as of December 2015 (UNRWA 2016).
The number of registered Palestinian refugees has grown steadily from 0.9 million in 1952 to over 5.2 million
in 2015 (see Figure 2). This substantial growth in the numbers of Palestinian refugees is a consequence
of: (a) the uniqueness of Palestinian refugee status which, unlike refugee status granted under the 1951
Convention, is maintained even in the event of naturalization in a country of asylum (e.g. the granting of
citizenship to Palestinian refugees in Jordan) or resettlement in a third country (e.g. 200,000 Palestinian
refugees are thought to have left Lebanon but are still reflected in registration data); (b) registration of
descendants of male Palestinian refugees; (c) high fertility rates (Khawaja 2003); (d) a voluntary system of
registration and deregistration linked to the provision of UNRWA services creating an incentive to register
or maintain registration in areas of UNRWA operations; and (e) an imperfect process of verification and
updating of registration data which may not immediately reflect all deaths.



21 While refugees in high-income countries are beyond the reach of development assistance provided by development

actors, they may still have an impact on overall development assistance (e.g. some states report the costs of the first
year of hosting asylum-seekers as ODA), on countries of origin (e.g. through remittances), and on development
programs supporting return and reintegration of refugees.
22UNRWA was established by General Assembly resolution 302 (IV) of December 8, 1949 and began operation on
May 1, 1950, succeeding the United Nations Relief for Palestine Refugees, established in 1948. Palestinian refugees
registered with UNRWA are excluded from the 1951 Convention, 1967 Protocol and UNHCR Statute. The UN General
Assembly has repeatedly renewed UNRWA’s mandate, most recently extending it to June 30, 2017.
23 The UN General Assembly’s Resolution 181 of November 1947 proposing the partition of Mandatory Palestine into

independent Arab and Jewish states, led to armed clashes between Arabs and Jews. When the British Mandate for
Palestine expired on May 14, 1948, the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel was proclaimed.
Neighboring Arab states of the Arab Republic of Egypt, Transjordan, Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic invaded what
had been Mandatory Palestine, leading to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. At the end of the war, Israel controlled the area
that Resolution 181 had proposed for the Jewish state and almost 60 percent of the area proposed for the Arab state.
Transjordan annexed the remainder of the former British mandate and Egypt took control of the Gaza Strip.

A development perspective could focus on those Palestinian refugees that have yet to overcome the social
and economic vulnerabilities associated with their displacement, recognizing that the experience of
Palestinian refugees has varied significantly across asylum countries.
           (a)   In the West Bank, Palestinian refugees are effectively stateless and live under both
                 Palestinian Authority and Israeli military Civil Administration. The incomes of Palestinian
                 refugees in the West Bank, three quarters of whom are living outside of designated camps, is
                 similar to that of the non-refugee population (Bocco, et al. 2007).
           (b)   In Hamas-administered Gaza, Palestinian refugees are also stateless in the absence of an
                 independent Palestinian state. Palestinian refugees in Gaza, more than half of whom are
                 living outside of camps, have per capita incomes comparable to non-refugee residents
                 (Bocco, et al. 2007).
           (c)   In Lebanon, Palestinian refugees have limited freedom of movement, are barred from certain
                 professions, cannot own property, have no access to public services, and typically live in poor,
                 overcrowded camps, which are heavily dependent on UNRWA for assistance. They have
                 significantly lower per capita income than the host population (Bocco, et al. 2007).
                 Consequently, approximately 200,000 Palestinian refugees are thought to have left Lebanon,
                 and it is estimated that only around 250,000 Palestinian refugees remain in the country.
           (d)   In contrast, in Jordan the majority of Palestinian refugees were granted citizenship in the early
                 1950s and have equal rights to other Jordanian citizens (Palestine refugees represent
                 approximately 20 percent of Jordan’s population), however those refugees that remained in
                 the West Bank and came to Jordan after 1967 and those from Gaza can only acquire
                 temporary Jordanian passports; only one in six Palestinian refugees in Jordan are living in
                 camps, which have taken on the character of urban neighborhoods.
           (e)   In Syria, while Palestinian refugees did not have citizenship they enjoyed most of the same
                 rights and similar living conditions as those of the Syrian population. Of the 560,000
                 Palestinians refugees registered in Syria in 2015, it is estimated that 280,000 are internally
                 displaced and 110,000 have fled the country (UNRWA 2016),24 often facing harsher



24   UNRWA estimates that 42,000 Palestinian refugees have sought asylum in Lebanon and 18,000 in Jordan.
               restrictions on accessing asylum compared to other refugees (Morrison 2014). Ninety percent
               of those who remain in Syria are reliant on humanitarian assistance (Morrison 2014).
         (f)   An unknown number of registered Palestinian refugees have acquired the nationality of
               countries outside the Middle East.

Asylum-seekers
The 1951 Convention does not establish an individual right to asylum, and the right to receive or to be
granted asylum is left to the discretion of the host country, which has the primary responsibility for protecting
refugees including determining whether or not people meet the definition of refugees in the 1951
Convention.25 This requires that countries designate a central authority with the relevant knowledge and
expertise to assess applications, ensure procedural safeguards and permit appeals and reviews.
Consequently, statistics on asylum-seekers reflect differences between countries in the administrative rules
governing the asylum process, in particular the criteria for individuals to be granted access the asylum
procedure. The category of asylum-seekers excludes anyone immediately granted refugee status on a
prima-facie basis, including Syrian refugees granted Temporary Protection visas in Turkey.
Not all asylum-seekers included in the global statistics would necessarily be persons of particular focus for
development actors. Of the 3.2 million asylum-seekers at the end of 2015, 1.4 million are in high income
(OECD and non-OECD) countries that do not qualify for development assistance or concessional financing
from development organizations.

IDPs
There is no international legal framework for the protection, assistance or solutions for IDPs and these
remain first and foremost state responsibilities. Many national laws and regulations on internal displacement
do not include a definition of IDPs, however those that do most often reflect the definition in the United
Nation’s Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement (UN Guiding Principles) (Wyndham 2006).26 The UN
Guiding Principles define IDPs as “persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee
or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the
effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-
made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border.” The 2006 Great
Lakes Protocol on the Protection and Assistance of IDPs (Great Lakes Protocol) and the 2009 African Union
Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons In Africa (Kampala
Convention) explicitly extend the definition of IDPs to include those displaced by development projects.27
The UN Guiding Principles and the IASC Framework on Durable Solutions for IDPs identify three ways in
which internal displacement can end: (a) voluntary and sustainable reintegration at the place of origin
(return); (b) sustainable local integration in areas where IDPs take refuge (local integration); and (c)
voluntary and sustainable integration in another part of the country (settlement elsewhere in the country)
(IASC 2010).
This stocktaking exercise focuses on data on conflict-induced internal displacement. While the UN Guiding
Principles includes displacement due to natural or human-made disasters, and regional instruments such
as the Great Lakes Protocol and the Kampala Convention include displacement due to development
projects, this stocktaking report focuses on conflict-induced internal displacement only. Statistics on IDPs
protected or assisted by UNHCR only include IDPs (and people in IDP-like situations) who have been




25 In 1967, the UN General Assembly adopted a Declaration on Territorial Asylum which reasserts the right of everyone

“to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution” (Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights) while avoiding reference to the right to be granted asylum. Rather, the Declaration highlights the responsibility
of the country of asylum to evaluate an individual’s claim for asylum.
26The UN Guiding Principles are not binding but establish principles that are consistent with international human rights
and humanitarian law and analogous refugee law.
27 The UN Guiding Principles do acknowledge large-scale development projects as a cause of displacement, however

this is not reflected explicitly in the definition of IDPs.
displaced due to armed conflict, situations of generalized violence and violations of human rights.28 Data
on IDPs monitored by IDMC are disaggregated and currently published separately for conflict-induced
displacement and disaster-induced displacement.29 At the country level the IOM’s Displacement Tracking
Matrix (DTM)30 provides data on IDPs in both conflict and natural disaster settings (activated in all major
natural disaster contexts in recent years).
Global data on conflict-induced internal displacement reflect variations in how IDPs are defined across
situations. There is no consensus on how far a person must flee in order to be considered internally
displaced. The definition of internal displacement for nomadic populations, which account for a significant
share of IDPs in the Horn of Africa and increasingly in the Sahel, is open to controversy.31 Moreover, while
some countries register IDP children born in displacement (e.g. Azerbaijan, Cyprus and Georgia), other
countries do not (IDMC 2015). The crafting of a definition for IDPs and its application in a particular context
may be heavily influenced by local and national politics in conflict and post-conflict countries, as well as the
direct link between estimates of displaced populations and humanitarian assistance, which can lead to both
over- and under-reporting. Consequently, comparing or aggregating data across displacement situations
may be misleading.32
Additionally, there is no consensus on when internal displacement ends. There are likely to be IDPs in
protracted displacement who have no interest in returning to their original locations, are well integrated and
no longer have specific vulnerabilities linked to their displacement. In particular, large numbers of IDPs
have moved from rural to urban settings and their displacement is part of an urbanization process that in
many parts of the world is a mega-trend that is rarely reversed. The definition of an end to internal
displacement is hence complex, as it typically requires return (which may be unlikely, for example where
IDPs have moved from rural to urban settings or in situations where they have spent extended time in the
same place), integration (which is difficult to define) or settlement elsewhere in the country. IDPs can also
become refugees if they cross an international border. In countries such as Colombia, IDP status is not
attached to an individual but to a family, and is hence transmitted across generations (to facilitate the
provision of reparations and other entitlements), and there is an imperfect system for removing IDPs from
the register if they have achieved a durable solution or when they die. In other contexts, deregistration
signifies not the achievement of a durable solution but rather the end of state or international support (IDMC
2015).33 The absence of a clear and operational approach to defining the ‘end’ of internal displacement
may be one of the factors behind the continued overall increase in the global numbers of IDPs. Lack of
clarity around when displacement ends also leaves room for political manipulation. Governments may find
it politically expedient to artificially prolong IDP status by deterring returns or local integration, for example
in Azerbaijan and Georgia to promote claims over territory (Beau 2003). In other contexts, national




28 UNHCR’s IDP data focus only on internally displaced populations to which it extends protection or assistance. IDMC
coverage of IDP data is more expansive and in 2015 included additional data on: (a) 26 countries accounting for 4.5
million IDPs including some significant IDP hosting countries (Turkey, India, Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Kenya); and (b)
IDPs in countries where UNHCR is active who are not protected or assisted by the agency. In 2015, IDMC’s aggregate
figure for conflict-induced internal displacement was 3.3 million higher than UNHCR’s aggregate figure for IDPs
protected or assisted by the agency.
29 IDMC’s 2016 report presents both data sets alongside each other. In certain contexts, there can be significant

overlaps in these two groups; however data systems may be maintained separately for conflict-induced displacement
and natural disasters (e.g. in Afghanistan) leading to possible gaps or double counting if these categories are combined.
30 The IOM Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) is a system to track and monitor displacement and population mobility.

It is designed to regularly and systematically capture, process and disseminate information to provide a better
understanding of the movements and evolving needs of displaced populations, whether on site or en route. It has been
active in over 40 countries since its inception in 2004. See http://www.globaldtm.info/.
31   This is typically defined as nomads not having access to their traditional routes, but routes can vary.
32IDMC has recently adjusted their methodology to facilitate greater comparability across situations and improvements
are reflected in IDMC’s end-2015 data.
33 This is not necessarily a problem if the purpose of the registration system is to delineate entitlements to assistance

rather than to determine status.
governments may prematurely or arbitrarily impose an end to displacement to demonstrate that a conflict
has been resolved or to limit entitlements to assistance.
IDPs in acute conflict zones are beyond the reach of most development actors. There are significant
numbers of IDPs in acute conflict or war zones beyond the reach of development actors. Development
actors are also not equipped to intervene effectively in such environments, where their programs are
unlikely to have much impact. Despite the strong imperative for development organizations to involve
themselves in the planning of long-term responses to displacement in acute conflict zones, it is generally
only possible to provide development assistance once hostilities have ceased and access to beneficiaries
and potential project sites is secured. For this reason, it may be appropriate to note that 9.6 million IDPs
live in countries (Syria, Libya and Yemen) where development actors have no or only remote presence due
to the intensity of the ongoing conflict.34 Additionally, in countries engulfed in war and acute conflict, it may
not make sense to delineate IDPs from other war-affected people who are besieged in their own homes
(Crisp 1999).

Returnees
Voluntary return is recognized as one of three possible durable solutions for both refugees and IDPs.
Voluntary repatriation is recognized under the 1951 Convention as one of three durable solutions for
refugees, after which the previously displaced person reacquires protection of their country of origin. In
respect of IDPs, the IASC Framework on Durable Solutions for IDPs and UN Guiding Principles identify
voluntary and safe return to and reintegration in a person’s area of habitual residence as one of three ways
in which internal displacement can end.
For both IDPs and refugees, return to their area or country of origin (or settlement elsewhere) does not
necessarily mean that they find sustainable solutions to their displacement. The ‘voluntariness’ of return
programs may obscure the lack of choice for some returning refugees or IDPs.35 Additionally, returnees
may face continued insecurity as well as impediments towards the restitution of land and housing,
accessing services, reestablishing livelihoods, social reintegration, and accessing local governance. For
example, Afghan refugees who returned in large numbers from Pakistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran
(many of whom were deported due to lack of documentation or returned ‘spontaneously’ due to pressure
from security forces and local authorities) are exposed to violent conflict on their return and risk becoming
displaced internally,36 being recruited into violent extremist groups or criminal activities (Ahmadi and
Lakhani 2016).37 And in the Central African region, the vast majority of the more than 910,000 IDPs who
returned to their homes continue to face challenges associated with their displacement (IDMC 2015).
Ignoring the need to find sustainable solutions for returnees puts them at risk of poverty and can negatively
affect development since their continued marginalization may hinder economic and social progress.
Unsustainable returns can also contribute to renewed conflict and further displacement.
There is no consensus on the definition or measurement of a sustainable return.38 Drawing on the IASC
Framework on Durable Solutions for IDPs, a sustainable return at the individual level might encompass the
following elements: (a) long-term safety, security and freedom of movement; (b) an adequate standard of
living, including at a minimum access to adequate food, water, housing, health care and basic education;
(c) access to employment and livelihoods; (d) access to effective mechanisms that restore housing, land
and property or provide returnees with compensation; (e) access to and replacement of personal and other
documentation; (f) voluntary reunification with family members separated during displacement; (g)



34   Some conflict-affected countries permit development support to IDPs in relatively safe areas.
35
 Even within voluntary repatriation programs there may be different degrees of ‘voluntariness’, and ‘voluntary’ might
mean the absence of forced removal but the displaced person is given no choice at all (Black and Gent 2006).
36   Two-thirds of returnees to rural areas suffered secondary displacement (DACAAR/Samuel Hall 2015).
37   See also the 2015 Afghanistan Refugee and Return Overview.
38 For example, is the objective of reintegration efforts to restore the standard of living displaced people enjoyed prior
to their displacement, or to ensure that they are no worse off than they were in displacement, or to ensure that their
standard of living converges with surrounding communities (which may also be dealing with the impacts of conflict)
(Hammond 2014)?
participation in public affairs at all levels on an equal basis with the resident population; and (h) effective
remedies for displacement-related violations, including access to justice, reparations and information about
the causes of violation.39
Consequently, there are no global statistics on the success or sustainability of returns. Despite the
methodological challenges, it may be useful to attempt an extremely rough estimate of returnees who have
yet to achieve durable solutions in order to get a better sense of the likely order of magnitude of the problem.
Several studies have suggested that it can take two or more years for returnees to reestablish themselves
while others suggest that the process of ‘emplacement’ can take generations (Hammond 2014). A
reasonably conservative estimate of the number of returnees facing continued socio-economic challenges
might then be the cumulative number of returned IDPs and returned refugees over the last three years, i.e.
a total of 5.5 million returned IDPs and 0.7 million returned refugees.

Affected host communities
A definition of affected host communities is absent from international and regional agreements on forced
displacement. There are no references to the impact on host communities in several instruments pertaining
to conflict-induced displacement including the 1951 Convention, 1967 Protocol, OAU Convention,
Cartagena Declaration and UN Guiding Principles. The Great Lakes Protocol includes as an undertaking
of member states to extend protection and assistance to “communities residing in areas hosting internally
displaced persons” and the Kampala Convention highlights the importance of including an assessment of
the needs of host communities alongside those of internally displaced populations, reflecting these in
strategies and policies on internal displacement, and where appropriate extending humanitarian assistance
to local communities. However affected host communities are not defined in either instrument.
Estimates of the scale and character of the impact on host communities—both negative and positive—are
important from both a humanitarian and development perspective. In the event of large and sudden flows
of refugees and IDPs, the short-term impacts on host communities can be significant, and if they are not
well managed, the impacts can be long lasting. The humanitarian community includes host communities in
their plans for protection and assistance to displaced populations, however arriving at accurate figures can
be challenging, and agreement on the purpose of the statistics and how they should be calculated requires
an understanding of specific contexts. There are, however, some reasonably robust data on the physical
location of various refugee populations that might be linked to estimates of the local population, but there
are significant empirical challenges to overcome in order to estimate the scale of the impact.40 In particular,
the impacts of displaced people on host communities vary considerably across situations and over time,
making it difficult to apply uniform assumptions about when a host community becomes affected. A
forthcoming report by the Bank provides a very rough estimate of the number of people living in affected
host communities, including about 48 million people for refugees living in developing countries, and about
56 million for IDPs.

Box 4: Selected Bank-Assisted Development Responses to Conflict-Induced Forced Displacement



39 At the level of the home country or region, return may be considered sustainable if “socio-economic conditions and
levels of violence and persecution are not significantly worsened”, if returns reduce reliance on humanitarian and
development assistance, or if economic, social, and political systems are more or less vulnerable to shocks (Black and
Gent 2006).
40 To establish an estimate of affected host communities it would be necessary to establish broad assumptions for: (a)

the geographical area impacted by the displaced population, which in the case of a rural camp might only include the
local communities in the immediate vicinity of the camp, but in the case of displaced people dispersed in an urban
environment the impacts on the host society are likely to be more diffuse and hence more difficult to estimate; and (b)
whether the impacts on host communities (both positive and negative) are significant, and over what timeframe. In the
absence of comprehensive statistics on the impact of displacement on various economic and social measures of
wellbeing (e.g. income/poverty, employment/wages, prices in various markets, access to services etc.), a very rough
estimate might be based on the density of the refugee population within a particular locality, i.e. establish a threshold
beyond which a displaced population is sufficiently large to have a socio-economic impact on host communities, e.g.
when they account for 25 percent or more of the host population.

C. Historical trends and patterns of forced displacement: Insights from available
global data
This section provides an overview of the available global data on conflict-induced forced displacement,
drawing largely on UNHCR’s published data on asylum-seekers, refugees and IDPs.41 Data are presented
visually in a series of figures to highlight the scope and character of the current global forced displacement
crisis and identify historical trends and anomalies. These data largely focus on the scale and trends in
conflict-induced displacement (i.e. the numbers of forced displaced) with some coverage of other elements
such as demographics, location and accommodation.
Globally, there has been an unprecedented increase in the numbers of displaced people over the last
decade, largely explained by the expansion in the number of reported IDPs. Historical data show a
substantial increase in the numbers of forced displaced (see Figure 3), however the expanding
geographical scope and quality of displacement monitoring systems are likely to account for much of the
increase in forced displacement figures. The numbers of refugees under UNHCR’s mandate have recorded
a number of variations over time, peaking in the early 1990s (at a level 10 percent over 2015 numbers) with
the conflict and displacement associated with the end of the Cold War. The number of Palestinian refugees
steadily has increased steadily over time, largely as a result of natural growth. IDP numbers (for which the
underlying data are the least robust) have recorded the largest progression as a consequence of: (a) the
expanded scope of monitoring efforts (IDPs were not counted before 1989 and methodologies were




41   UNHCR’s data only include IDPs protected or assisted by the agency.
adjusted after 1993 to ‘capture’ larger numbers of IDPs); (b) natural population growth of displaced
populations (i.e. children born in displacement); and (c) a few significant conflicts.

Most refugee and asylum-seeker flows are a South-South phenomenon. The large majority of people
displaced by conflict do not have the resources or opportunities to flee beyond neighboring areas—they
remain internally displaced or cross borders to neighboring countries in the region. Consequently,
approximately 80 percent of combined refugee and asylum-seeker flows are between countries in the global
‘South’, defined as low- and middle-income countries, despite the high visibility of recent South-North flows
(see Figure 4). While the numbers of first-time asylum-seekers in Europe are substantial—estimated at
over 1.2 million in 2015 (Eurostat 2016)—nevertheless European asylum-seekers in 2015 accounted for
approximately 2 percent of global forced displaced and half a percent of the international migrant stock.

the Bank’s current income classification. Excludes Palestinian refugees under UNRWA’s mandate. 2015 data excludes
refugee situations with less than 1,000 people.

The story of global displacement can be explained largely by just a few significant historical conflicts. Data
on UNHCR’s population of concern42 show that 10 historical conflicts accounted for the majority of forcibly
displaced under the agency’s mandate: around 40 to 50 percent from 1991 to 1995, between 50 and 60
percent from 1996 to 2004, and over 65 percent since 2005 (see Figure 5).43 In South Asia and the Middle
East, these include the prolonged conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq and the more recent Syrian crisis. In
Africa, the persistent conflict and instability in Burundi, DRC, Somalia and Sudan. In Latin America, four
decades of internal armed conflict in Colombia. And in Europe and Central Asia, the wars in Azerbaijan and
the former Yugoslavia. By the end of 2015, the top 10 origin countries accounted for more than two-thirds
of IDPs, three-quarters of all refugees (including Palestine refugees) and more than 40 percent of all
asylum-seekers. The top 15 origin countries accounted for more than 80 percent of IDPs, more than 80
percent of all refugees (including Palestine refugees) and over half of all asylum-seekers (see Figure 6).

A small number of countries carry the burden of hosting the majority of refugees. Historically since 1991,
15 asylum countries, overwhelmingly in the developing world, have hosted more than 50 percent of
refugees and asylum-seekers (see Figure 7).44 By the end of 2015, while almost all countries in the world
were hosting refugees, the burden was unevenly shared (see Figure 8). Only seven countries hosted more



44 Major host countries are identified based on the cumulative number of refugees and asylum-seekers over the period

1991-2015.
than 500,000 refugees, together accounting for half of all refugees and people in refugee-like situations
(excluding Palestine refugees). Major refugee hosting countries are typically the neighbors of countries of
origin. For example, Syria’s neighbors (Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan) together accounted for 27 percent
of total refugee numbers; Afghanistan’s neighbors (Pakistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran) together
accounted for 16 percent; and Somalia’s and South Sudan’s neighbors (Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda)
together accounted for 11 percent. Some countries (Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey) are hosting a particularly
large share of refugees relative to their population (see Figure 10).45 However, in all other countries, the
number of refugees as a percentage of the population is 3 percent or lower, and most often below 1 percent.

The majority of displaced people are hosted by developing countries and almost half are in fragile and
conflict-affected situations. It is estimated that developing countries hosted 99 percent of all IDPs and 89
percent of all refugees (including Palestinian refugees) at the end of 2015 (see Figure 11). These statistics
highlight the significant imbalance in the burden of hosting refugees between developed and developing
countries, both in terms of absolute numbers and also in relation to GDP. Additionally, almost 60 percent
of IDPs and 30 percent of refugees (including Palestinian refugees) were in FCS at the end of 2015 (see
Figure 12). Of the IDPs living in non-FCS countries, most are either in situations of protracted displacement
in post-conflict countries such as Azerbaijan and Cyprus, or are displaced in countries such as Colombia,
Nigeria and Ukraine, where conflict is not widespread.

Forced displacement is increasingly an urban phenomenon—approximately half of the world’s displaced
people are known to be living in cities and towns (compared with a quarter in rural areas) (see Figure 13)
displaced from other urban areas or drawn to cities and towns by the prospect of security, anonymity, better
access to services and better opportunities to make a living (UNHCR 2015).46 However, this figure masks
substantial variation in the urbanization of forced displacement across regions—displaced populations are
typically living in urban areas in the Middle East and North Africa, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America
and the Caribbean, and North America, but they are still largely in rural settings in Sub-Saharan Africa (see
Figure 14 and Figure 15).47 Given the projected increase in urbanization globally, and the projected rapid
urbanization of Africa and Asia in particular,48 it is likely that in future increasing numbers of displaced
people will seek refuge in cities and towns. Returning refugees may also prefer to settle in urban areas,
having become accustomed to urban life in refuge, having lost access to their land, wishing to avoid ongoing
insecurity in rural areas, or in some cases, lacking the inclination or skills to farm.




46 This figure may underestimate the numbers of forcibly displaced living in urban areas due to the challenges

associated with identifying and estimating the numbers of displaced living outside of camp settings. In 2015, location
was not known for 27 percent of UNHCR’s Population of Concern.
47 Urbanization rates by region for displaced populations reflect urbanization rates for the general population (82 percent
in North America, 80 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean, 73 percent in Europe, 48 percent in Asia and 40
percent in Africa) (United Nations 2015).
48At the end of 2014, 54 percent of the world’s population lived in urban areas, and this is projected to rise to 66 percent
by 2050; Africa and Asia are urbanizing faster than the other regions and are projected to become 56 and 64 percent
urban, respectively, by 2050 (United Nations 2015).

Displaced people are overwhelmingly seeking accommodation outside of camp environments. At the end
of 2015, only 6 percent of UNHCR’s population of concern was known to be living in organized camps
(including collective centers, reception/transit centers and planned/managed camps), while 94 percent was
living in either self-settled camps (i.e. areas hosting a high concentration of displaced persons), individual
accommodation or their location was unknown (see Figure 16).49 At the end of 2015, the largest managed
camps for refugees included: Dadaab in Kenya (with almost 350,000 refugees, mainly from Somalia); Dollo
Ado, in Ethiopia (with about 200,000 refugees, mainly from Somalia); Kakuma in Kenya (with about 160,000

refugees, mainly from Somalia and South Sudan); and Zaatari in Jordan (with about 80,000 refugees,
mainly from Syria). There are also a relatively large number of smaller (managed) refugee camps in many
countries, which account for about 2.7 million people.

Over the last decade, women, youth and children have tended to account for at least two-thirds of displaced
people—but there is substantial variation across host countries.50 Demographics of displaced populations
have consequences for development in both countries of origin and asylum, affecting the availability of
skilled and unskilled workers to the labor market, the age structure of the population, and demand for
services (e.g. children requiring education services etc.). At the end of 2015, approximately 75 percent of
displaced people were women, youth and children, i.e. 24 percent adult women and 51 percent youth and
children below the age of 18 (UNHCR 2016).51 The gender profile of displaced populations is consistent
with that for the global population, but the available data suggests that displaced populations may be
younger on average than the global population.52 This apparent inconsistency is likely to reflect the
significant variation in the demographics of forced displacement across host countries. For example, in
Georgia just over a quarter of IDPs are under the age of 18 and in Germany just over a quarter of refugees
and asylum-seekers are under the age of 18, compared with host countries where almost 60 percent of the
displaced are youth and children, e.g. Afghanistan, DRC, Uganda and Tanzania (UNHCR 2016). There are
also significant variations in gender across countries, for example 65 percent of IDPs in Ukraine are women
and 60 percent of IDPs in CAR are women, while only 34 percent of refugees and asylum-seekers in
Germany are female (UNHCR 2016). Differences in the demographics of displaced populations across host
countries also reflect variations in the overall demographics in countries of origin, particularly age structure,
as well as the specific context for forced displacement.

52According to the United Nations, in 2015 49.6 percent of the global population was female (United Nations 2015) and
30.9 percent of the global population was under the age of 18 (United Nations 2015).
In the case of refugees, host countries rarely facilitate naturalization, only a minority of refugees ever gets
resettled in third countries and voluntary repatriation is frequently not a realistic option for several reasons.
International law provides for three possible durable solutions for refugees, including integration within the
area of displacement, repatriation to their home country or resettlement in a third country; refugee status
can also cease when there are no longer compelling reasons for an individual to refuse to avail themselves
of the protection of their country of origin. In 2015 only 119,265 refugees under UNHCR’s mandate were
either resettled, naturalized53 or ceased to be refugees; and there were only 201,415 voluntary returns,
mostly Afghanistan, Sudan, Somalia and CAR (see Figure 17). These statistics highlight the significant gap
between the unprecedented numbers of refugees and the capacity of the international community to provide
durable solutions. For the 85 percent of refugees hosted in developing countries, there are only minute
prospects for resettlement.
                       Figure 17: Durable Solutions Relative to Refugee Stock 2015




Source: UNHCR Global Trends 2015

Global statistics that show the low rate of refugee returns masks the variation in returns over historical
periods and across displacement crises—with significant voluntary returns for some countries. There are,
in fact, some countries that have experienced significant episodes of voluntary returns since 1991 (Figure
18). A significant portion of these return movements took place in the 1990s following the end of the Cold
War, during which hundreds of thousands of refugees returned to Afghanistan, Burundi, Iraq, Liberia,
Mozambique, Rwanda, Serbia and Kosovo, Somalia and Sudan. In the last decade, significant numbers of
refugees continued to return to Afghanistan, Burundi, DRC, Iraq and Sudan. Data on return movements
may conceal the temporary or permanent geographical dispersal of family members between exile and
return locations to maximize access to livelihoods or services in different locations at the same time, a
strategy pursued by many returning Afghan and South Sudanese refugees (World Bank 2015).
Estimates of IDP returns and other solutions are incomplete, since return movements are not adequately
monitored. Analogous to refugees, IDPs have the possibility to integrate within the area of their
displacement, return to their homes or resettle in another part of the country. They may also flee the country
becoming refugees. Impediments to return can include ongoing insecurity in areas of origin, the absence
of socio-economic support in return areas, growth in family size, loss of land and protracted displacement
(especially among second or third generations).




53 The most significant example of naturalization over the last decade is the granting of Tanzanian citizenship to 155,000

refugees from Burundi.

Note: Countries selected based on their cumulative returns of refugees over the period 1991-2015.

Return does not necessarily lead to the full reintegration of a person into their home country or area of
origin. In the absence of global data on the success of reintegration following return, data on returns appear
to be taken as indication of sustainable return. In reality, many returnees face impediments to reintegration
and continue to have specific economic and social vulnerabilities linked to their displacement. They may
not be able to reclaim land, access sufficient financial resources (e.g. accumulated during their
displacement) or reestablish social networks in areas of origin, which are critical factors for successful
reintegration (World Bank 2015). Sustainable refugee return is therefore not a one-off event but a process
that provides returnees with adequate safety, housing, livelihoods and services that address their specific
vulnerabilities and reduce the likelihood of secondary displacement (World Bank 2015).

Consequently, the average length of protracted refugee situations has increased over the past two decades
according to UNHCR estimates (see Table 2). UNHCR estimates that the average length of ongoing
protracted refugee situations was 26 years at the end of 2015, up from 9 years in 1993 and 17 years in
2013, where protracted refugee situations are crudely defined as those where 25,000 refugees or more
have been in exile for five years or more after their initial displacement (UNCHR ExCom, 2009). According
to this definition, at the end of 2015 there were 32 protracted refugee situations in 27 asylum countries,
accounting for 6.7 million refugees or 41 percent of the global refugee population.54 They comprise a range
of settings including camps and individual accommodation in both rural and urban environments. The
majority is in developing countries, several of which are also FCS.

Protracted displacement of IDPs is also a significant phenomenon. IDMC reported that people were living
in internal displacement for more than 10 years in 53 of 60 countries/territories that it monitored in 2014
(IDMC 2015). Countries experiencing conflict-related displacement have reported IDP figures for 23 years
on average, suggesting protracted IDP situations. At the end of 2014 at least 50 percent of IDPs had been
displaced for more than three years in countries monitored for conflict-induced displacement (Crawford, et
al. 2015).
There are several methodological issues associated with estimates of average duration of displacement
situations. First, there can be significant movements of people into and out of displacement situations and
therefore estimates of average duration of displacement situations overstate the average length of time that
an individual person is in displacement.55 Second, the choice of timeframe beyond which displacement is
considered protracted is an arbitrary one.56 Third, the list of protracted refugee situations includes situations
that do not present clear development challenges, e.g. the 300,000 Vietnamese refugees in China who are
well integrated, but excludes other protracted refugee situations that fall below the arbitrary threshold of
25,000 people. Fourth, some of the larger displacement crises can significantly skew the average duration
of protracted refugee situations. For example, the Afghan refugee crisis significantly lengthens the average
duration of displacement situations, while in 2016 the Syrian refugee crisis will become protracted according
to UNHCR’s definition and consequently it will substantially reduce the estimate of average duration. Fifth,
estimates of average duration exclude IDPs due to conceptual problems of defining an end to internal
displacement as well as data constraints. And finally, there are some discrepancies in the available
displacement data that further distort estimates of average duration, for example South Sudanese




54   Excludes Palestinian refugees under UNRWA’s mandate and refugees in high-income OECD countries.
55 Calculations are not based on individual data, which would provide a truer estimate of how long an average a person
is in displacement, but on ‘situations’ (i.e. refugee populations in host countries grouped by country of origin, e.g.
Ethiopia currently hosts refugees from Eritrea, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan and so has four refugee situations).
Calculations do not take into account fluctuations in refugee numbers if the size of the situation remains over 25,000
people. Moreover, since population estimates are annual snapshots, they cannot take into account increases and
decreases within years, which can also be substantial.
56 Arguing that few refugee crises are resolved quickly, a 2015 ODI report proposes broadening the definition of
protracted displacement to situations where refugees and/or IDPs have been in exile for three years or more, which
increases the number of refugees in protracted displacement situations in 2014 from UNHCR’s estimate of 6.4 million
people to 12.9 million people (two-thirds of all refugees) (Crawford, et al. 2015).
displacement is not considered to be protracted because disaggregated data on South Sudan is only
available from the country’s independence in 2011.
Addressing some of these methodological issues produces an estimate of average duration that is lower
than those published by UNHCR. A recent study by Devictor and Do, “How many years do refugees spend
in exile” (2016), estimates the average duration of all refugee situations in 2014 (excluding Palestinian
refugees) at 10.7 years, and the median duration at about 3 years, i.e. half of people who are currently
refugees have spent 4 years or more in exile.57 Since 1991, the average duration of all refugee situations
has fluctuated between about 8 years in 1991 and a peak of 15 years in 2006. The study also finds that
among current refugees, 5.3 million may have been displaced for five years or more (i.e. in protracted
situations). The number of refugees in protracted displacement has been remarkably stable since 1991, at
5 million to 7 million throughout most of the period. At the end of 2014, the average duration of protracted
refugee situations is estimated at 18 years.58

Nevertheless, estimates of average duration, however flawed, do provide insights into the extent of the
burden on host countries and communities and the impacts on the displaced themselves. The average
duration of forced displacement influences public perceptions of the likely burden on host countries and
communities. And as duration of displacement lengthens and people remain in limbo for longer, recovery
becomes more challenging. Figure 21 gives an indication of the historical and current distribution of refugee
situations by duration. Figure 22 shows the number of refugees in ongoing displacement situations by
duration. The most recent cohort of refugees who have been displaced for less than three years include
refugees from South Sudan, Pakistan, Ukraine, Syria and the Central African Republic (CAR). The
extremely large numbers of refugees displaced for three up to five years is largely accounted for by more
than 3.5 million people fleeing the Syrian conflict, as well as refugees from Sudan, South Sudan and Mali.
Another relatively large cohort of 1.8 million has been displaced for five years up to ten years and includes
significant numbers of refugees from Colombia, Somalia, Myanmar, CAR, DRC and Iraq. The next large
cohort of refugees has been displaced between 35 and 40 years and is largely accounted for by refugees
from Afghanistan and Vietnam.

57 These numbers are very sensitive to specific situations. For example, if Afghan refugees are excluded from the

calculation, the average duration of exile for current refugees drops to 5.3 years. If Syrian refugees are excluded, it
goes up to 14.5 years. Yet, if both Afghanistan and Syria (the large numbers on both ends of the spectrum) are taken
out, the average goes back to about 11.3 years, and the median to about 4 years.
58   This estimate is very sensitive to a specific situation: if Afghanistan is excluded the average drops to 10.5 years.

D. Data on asylum-seekers, refugees and IDPs: sources, applications and
credibility
In this section, a distinction is made between: (a) the collection of source data; and (b) the compilation of
data across sources (within a country or across countries). In general, there is a delineation of roles between
data collectors and data compilers, however there are organizations, such as UNHCR, IOM and the Office
for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat (OCHA),59 that are involved
in both data collection and compilation activities.

Data collection: Sources for refugees, asylum-seekers and IDPs60
Collection of primary data on forcibly displaced persons is generally undertaken by national governments
through their national statistical offices, line ministries or immigration agencies. However, where countries
lack the capacity to undertake this work, they may rely on international organizations as well as international
and local NGOs to collect data or undertake estimates.61 In general, governments tend to collect data on
refugees in developed countries, while UNHCR and NGOs tend to collect data on refugees in developing
countries. Humanitarian organizations such as UNHCR and OCHA as well as international organizations
such as IOM are also involved in the collection of data on IDPs, often involving international and local




59 OCHA is the part of the United Nations Secretariat responsible for bringing together humanitarian actors to ensure a

coherent response to emergencies. See http://www.unocha.org/.
60This section draws heavily on the “Report of Statistics Norway and the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees on statistics on refugees and IDPs” presented at the UNSD in March 2015.
61The number of countries where UNHCR exclusively collects data on refugees declined from 76 in 2010 to 72 in 2014,
while the proportion of countries where refugee data were exclusively provided by governments gradually increased
over the same period from 33 to 38 percent. In 2014, the proportion of countries where data were provided through
collection conducted jointly by governments and UNHCR was 15 percent, while in the remaining proportion (13
percent), refugee data were provided exclusively by NGOs and other organizations. In 2014, more than 173 countries
and territories provided data on refugees.
NGOs. Initiatives such as JIPS, a collaborative project of UN and NGO actors, have also been established
to support governments and operational organizations to design and implement data collection processes.
There are a variety of data sources for generating statistics on forced displacement, each of which has
strengths and weaknesses. Despite the significant challenges, large amounts of data are collected and
disseminated every year. The main data sources and methods for the generation of statistics on forcibly
displaced populations include: (a) registration of refugees and asylum-seekers; (b) registration of IDPs; (c)
profiling of IDPs; (d) population movement tracking systems; (e) national population censuses; (f) sample
surveys; (g) border crossings; (h) administrative records and registers; (i) general population registers; and
(j) a variety of estimation methods for producing statistics when adequate and reliable data on individuals
are unavailable (UNSD 2014).
Several of these data sources might be used together to triangulate estimates of stocks and flows for a
particular displacement situation. Some data sources (such as registration systems and population
censuses) are more appropriate for estimating stocks of asylum-seekers, refugees and IDPs at a particular
point in time, while other data sources (such as population tracking systems and border crossings) are
more appropriate for estimating flows over a specific period. In general, there is a lack of comprehensive
and up-to-date data available on all stocks and flows for a particular displacement situation (see Table 4).
Consequently, data on flows might be used to estimate stocks, for example in the absence of government
data, the stock of refugees in many industrialized countries is estimated by UNHCR based on 10 years of
individual asylum-seeker recognition. And, especially in the case of IDPs, changes in the total population
combined with some contextual analysis, may be used to deduce estimates of new internal displacement
or returns. However, these approximations are flawed unless data on all other flows (births, deaths,
repatriation etc.) are also available, which is not usually the case. Even a static figure for the stock of IDPs
in a particular location might obscure substantial flows including new displacement and returns. Moreover,
there are no common definitions of the various stocks and flows, and therefore the risk of double counting
or gaps cannot be discounted. For example, IDPs who subsequently cross international borders may be
counted as both IDPs and refugees (e.g. in the case of the Syrian displacement crisis).

Registration of refugees and asylum-seekers
Registration is the most common method of collecting data on refugees and asylum-seekers, accounting
for 77 percent of UNHCR’s data on refugees at the end of 2014.62 Asylum-seeker and refugee statistics are
generally based on government and/or UNHCR registration records (UNRWA maintains registration
records for Palestinian refugees).63 Individual registration of refugees and asylum-seekers is the first step
towards establishing a person’s identity, legal status and protection needs. Registration involves the
collection of information including, but not limited to, name, sex, date of birth, country of origin, marital
status, and place of displacement, and the issuance of documentation.64
Refugees living outside of camps, sometimes irregularly, are underrepresented in registration exercises.
While the majority of refugees in camps have been registered on an individual basis, refugees outside of
camp environments are difficult to identify and capture in registration activities. In fact, refugee registration
is used almost exclusively in camps established by or in collaboration with UNHCR (UNHCR 2015).
Moreover, some refugees may not register because they are unaware that they should, and others may be
reluctant to do so because they are skeptical of the integrity of the registration process (e.g. fair access to
entitlements or opportunities for durable solutions) or lack confidence in protection measures. Individuals
in irregular migration flows may also choose not to apply for asylum due to fear of declaring themselves to
the authorities.
A significant challenge with refugee registers is keeping them up to date. Individual registration can provide
a robust snapshot of the stock of refugees and asylum-seekers, but registers need to be updated regularly
to reflect flows, i.e. increases in refugee and asylum-seeker numbers (births, new arrivals) and decreases
(deaths, departures, durable solutions). In situations of sudden mass influxes, existing registration capacity
may not be adequate and the scope of registration data is then rationalized.65 Additionally, it may not be
possible to capture all demographic changes in the case of highly mobile populations. If registration is linked
to the provision of services or other entitlements, there may be strong incentives to register births and new
arrivals and weak incentives to deregister, leading to the inflation of the register over time or even instances
of fraud and abuse (e.g. multiple registration, “borrowing children” etc.) (UNHCR 2003). Consequently, data
from a refugee register may overestimate the number of refugees, requiring periodic corrective action
through the verification of records. For example, in 2014 a verification of registration records for Somali
refugees in the Dadaab camps in Kenya led to the deactivation of tens of thousands of records for
individuals that are believed to have returned spontaneously to Somalia (UNHCR 2015). Additional
problems with refugee registers include security concerns or inclement weather preventing refugees from
accessing registration sites (UNHCR 2003) and the application of data protection principles.

Registration of IDPs
Individual registration is not as common a method of estimating numbers of IDPs as it is for refugees. In
principle, individual registration of IDPs is not used to determine the ‘status’ of an IDP, since IDPs have the
same rights and entitlements as other citizens and do not need to apply or be granted a special legal
status.66 Rather, registration of IDPs can provide a basis for: (a) establishing the number, location, and key
demographic characteristics of displaced populations; (b) providing protection and assistance; (c) keeping
track of family relationships; (d) preventing fraudulent access to scarce humanitarian assistance; (e)
facilitating the issuance of temporary identity cards to replace lost personal documentation (Brookings
2008); and (f) providing social security benefits.67 Full IDP registration by international organizations is not



62 By the end of 2014, individual refugee registration was the source of about 77 percent of the data on refugees;
estimation accounted for 13 percent of data, combined estimation and registration for 5 percent and other sources for
5 percent (UNHCR 2016).
63   UNHCR may undertake registration activities when national governments do not have the capacity to do so.
64   Additional data can also be recorded such as education and occupation.
65   Insufficient budgetary resources, staff, training or materials.
66   Countries with national legislation that provides a legal status for IDPs are an exception to this international standard.
67The scope of data collected depends on the objectives of the registration exercise, for example in Kenya, registration
of individuals displaced by the 2007 and 2008 post-election violence excluded ‘integrated’ IDPs, i.e. those who had
the norm, and registration of IDPs is undertaken in most cases by national or local authorities,68 civil society
groups or by individual organizations, particularly UNHCR and IOM, although the World Food Programme
(WFP) might keep records of individuals and communities provided with food assistance.
Registration data for IDPs present an incomplete or misleading picture. While registration of IDPs can be
helpful in estimating the numbers of IDPs in camp and camp-like settings, such data presents an incomplete
picture since in many contexts the majority of IDPs reside in dispersed settings where they are not
registered or counted (UNSD 2014). IDPs may deliberately avoid registration activities to avoid drawing
attention to themselves due to security concerns and reluctance to provide personal information (especially
when the authorities are perceived as contributing to the causes of displacement) or because they are not
motivated to register (e.g. registration does not confer a special legal status, no assistance is given or
assistance is given in a discriminatory manner) (Brookings 2011). Additionally, IDPs might not be able to
physically reach the registration location because of insecurity, medical reasons, limited mobility, distance
and cost. When national or international actors provide assistance, there may be an incentive for people to
register in camps even if they are staying elsewhere, or to register in multiple locations (Brookings 2011).69
Furthermore, registration data provide only a snapshot of the stock of IDPs at a particular point in time and
may be out of date if registers are not maintained regularly.
Registration methodologies can vary across displacement situations. For example, families may be
registered rather than individuals and the population estimated based on an assumption of average family
size, which can differ among organizations (UNSD 2014). IDPs may be required to present documentation,
meet specific criteria or re-register periodically to maintain their benefits, which affects aggregate numbers
(IDMC 2015). For example, in Ukraine, pre-requisites for IDP registration (including valid documentation,
arrival from a recognized conflict zone and permanent residence registration in recognized conflict zone)
means that people displaced within a non-government controlled area, people displaced from a non-
recognized conflict zone in a government controlled area, unaccompanied children or people without
current/valid identification are not counted as IDPs (IDMC 2015). Furthermore, in some contexts,
registration as an IDP can expire after a prescribed timeframe without regard to whether the person
achieved a durable solution (e.g. after five years in Russia).
The accuracy of IDP registers is greatly impacted by political considerations, particularly a government’s
willingness to acknowledge internal displacement and to enable the humanitarian community to respond.
Some countries may be reluctant to acknowledge the presence of IDPs, or may be inclined to understate
numbers to demonstrate progress in military operations or limit assistance provided to IDPs. For example,
in Kenya, registration of individuals displaced by the 2007 and 2008 post-election violence excluded
‘integrated’ IDPs, i.e. those who had sought refuge with host communities or rented accommodation in
urban areas, as assistance was limited to registered IDPs. Alternatively, aggregate numbers of IDPs in
particular countries may be inflated to suggest a deterioration of the situation or to maximize humanitarian
assistance. Therefore, access to IDP areas and the willingness of IDPs to be counted may be largely
dependent on government policies. These political considerations can lead to disagreements on the data,
undermine cooperation and in some cases even lead to reduced humanitarian funding.

Profiling of IDP situations
Profiling of IDP situations is a collaborative process aimed at generating reliable data that can be broadly
agreed upon. As a collaborative process, it can be a crucial tool for generating agreement on persistent
questions such as who is recognized as internally displaced within a given context, what are the most
prevalent vulnerabilities caused by displacement, and how do IDPs fare compared to host populations. In




sought refuge with host communities or rented accommodation in urban areas, as assistance was limited to registered
IDPs.
68However, in many conflict-affected countries, governments lack the basic capacity to maintain Civil Registration and
Vital Statistics (CRVS) systems including the registration of births and deaths in non-displacement situations, let alone
the registration of IDPs displaced due to natural disasters or conflict.
69 IOM has introduced biometric registration systems in South Sudan, Sudan, DRC and Nigeria to circumvent these

problems.
this way, profiling of IDP situations aims to underpin advocacy, protection and assistance activities as well
as support the achievement of durable solutions by informing joint strategies between government,
humanitarian and development actors.
Profiling provides an overview of displacement-affected populations through the collection and analysis of
minimum core data (number of IDPs, disaggregated by location, age and sex) and where possible additional
quantitative and qualitative data (causes of displacement, patterns of displacement, protection concerns,
humanitarian needs, vulnerabilities, and aspirations and prospects for durable solutions). Profiling may
utilize data collection techniques at individual, household and community levels, often combining population
estimation methods, a review of secondary data, focus group discussions, household surveys and key
informant interviews targeted specifically at forcibly displaced populations (UNSD 2014).70 Profiling
methods focus on displacement situations, rather than only on displaced populations, and therefore
includes comparisons to conditions in the host population. IDMC estimates that humanitarian profiling data
forms the basis for 18 of their 60 country estimates and around 63 percent of their annual estimates (IDMC
2015), with the largest volume of data on conflict-induced internal displacement provided by OCHA followed
by IOM.
There are several practical challenges associated with IDP profiling exercises in displacement situations.
Insecurity or terrain may impede access to displaced populations in conflict-affected or hard to reach areas.
For example, profiling exercises in Pakistan do not cover all IDPs or areas affected by displacement due to
insecurity, and in Afghanistan profiling of IDPs by UNHCR underestimates the scale of the initial
displacement as IDPs are only interviewed once displacement sites are accessible, if they are profiled at
all (IDMC 2015). Additional challenges include unwillingness of IDPs to participate due to fear of
persecution, and mobile populations (IDMC 2008). There may also be political pressures to inflate or reduce
numbers.

Population movement tracking systems
In situations where the movement of displaced populations is fluid or continuous, a movement tracking
system can be a useful tool for providing rough estimates of population flows, including recurrent
displacements. Movement tracking systems are useful for monitoring fluid population movements (including
spontaneous and organized, internal and cross-border, and returns and resettlement) in remote or
inaccessible routes and locations (including displacement sites, places of origin, and places of return and
resettlement). UNHCR, IOM and other organizations have developed methods for tracking and monitoring
movements of IDPs in over 30 countries, particularly in cases of disaster-induced displacement, but also in
some cases of conflict-induced displacement (UNSD 2014). These systems employ a combination of data
collection techniques including key respondent interviews, focus group discussions, registration,
observations and physical counts, samplings and other statistical methodologies. For examples, UNHCR’s
population tracking systems identifies and trains local NGOs to monitor key locations such as IDP
settlements, bus stations and roads to report on movements.
The accuracy of data from movement tracking systems is subject to several caveats. These include: limited
access to locations and routes due to insecurity; vast geographical areas to monitor; mixed population flows
that include refugees, IDPs, pastoral and seasonal movements and economic migrants; massive population
flows that overwhelm monitoring capacity; disinclination of individuals to provide information when there is
no assistance being offered; pressures from communities to inflate figures to maximize future assistance;
and political pressures to suppress accurate reporting on IDP movements. Additionally, due to the fluid
nature of displacement in many contexts and the likelihood of recurring displacements, it is not possible to
use movement data to provide estimates of population stocks.

Population censuses
National population and housing censuses often provide the most comprehensive source of population data
and offer the potential for estimating numbers of forcibly displaced people. To estimate the size of displaced
populations a census would need to include questions on country (and/or place) or birth, year of (internal)

migration, and reason for movement including asylum/refugee protection (or conflict-induced internal
migration) (UNHCR 2016), or a specific question to identify IDPs or refugees. However, not all censuses
cover refugees and asylum-seekers (if foreigners are considered outside the scope of the census or
because they are considered a special category),71 nor is it common practice for national censuses to
include questions related to forced displacement.72 Nevertheless, there are several examples of national
censuses that have included relevant questions on forced displacement.73,74 In the case of protracted
internal displacement situations, IDPs are likely to be included in national censuses; however, census
instruments may be subject to manipulation for political purposes.
There are several drawbacks of population censuses including their cost, the significant training required
for enumerators to ensure consistent answers to questions on forced displacement, impediments to field
operations and data processing (such as weather conditions and technical problems), the relative
infrequency with which they are carried out, and the long processing time before data and statistics become
available, which have consequences for the timeliness of data. Moreover, often censuses are not conducted
in contested territory or conflict zones where many displaced persons reside, and this limits the
completeness of the data. Nevertheless, censuses are the only nation-wide source of population data for
potentially providing estimates of displaced populations, especially those in non-camp settings, and often
provide a basis for sampling frames for survey instruments (UNHCR 2016). Capturing displacement
situations in official statistics also increases their visibility.

Sample surveys
Sample surveys can potentially provide a rich source of data on forcibly displaced populations. Compared
with censuses and registers, sample surveys allow more detailed questions to be asked about the
characteristics and situations of households. If survey instruments identify displaced populations based on
individuals’ and households’ self-reported migration history (including patterns and causes) they can enable
the disaggregation of detailed data by displacement status (UNSD 2014).
There are opportunities to mainstream forced displacement into international survey instruments, but this
has only been done in a handful of cases. Several standardized international sample surveys have been
designed for special purposes including the Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS),75 Labor Force




71 The UN census recommendations for the 2010 World Population and Housing Census Programme stipulate that

refugees and IDPs living in camps should be counted and their numbers disaggregated in population statistics, however
there is no requirement to separately distinguish displaced people living outside of camps (UNHCR 2016). The United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe’s (UNECE) guidelines include a question on reason for migration, population
with a refugee-like background and IDPs as non-core topics/questions (UNHCR 2016).
72 While most countries include questions on country of birth and citizenship, only about 40 percent include a question
on year of migration, less than a quarter include a question on reason for international migration, and about a fifth
include a question on the reason for internal migration (UNHCR 2016).
73E.g. Kyrgyz Republic 1999 (refugee status), West Bank and Gaza 2007 (refugee status), Zambia 2000 and 2010
(purpose of stay), Germany 1970 (federal refugee identity card), Greece 2001 (reason for settling in Greece), Sudan
and South Sudan 2008 (type of household including IDP and refugee), Liberia 1990 (ever displaced by war since 1990),
Uganda 2014 (refugees).
74UNHCR is collaborating with the Statistics Norway on systematically embedding forcibly displaced peoples in national
statistics exercises and collaborates with national authorities and with UNFPA in various countries on the design of
census exercises that include refugees, IDPs, returnees and stateless persons.
75LSMS is a household survey program housed in the Bank's Development Research Group that provides technical
assistance to national statistical offices in the design and implementation of multi-topic household surveys covering
household behavior, welfare and interactions with government policies. All data gathered through the LSMS is
published online in the Bank’s Central Microdata Catalog.
Surveys,76 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS),77 and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS).78 The
advantage of these surveys is that they cover a wide range of countries and are conducted in a regular or
systematic manner (UNSD 2014). There are only a few cases where modules or questions on forced
displacement have been integrated into survey instruments (most notably in Somalia, Uganda, West Bank
and Gaza, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Ghana, as well as health surveys in Albania,
Ukraine and Moldova).
There are several challenges associated with ‘mainstreaming’ forced displacement into household surveys:
(a) there is huge demand for adding sector-specific or thematic modules to international surveys; (b) it is
relatively difficult to convince national statistical agencies to modify their county-specific surveys; (c)
disaggregating survey results by specific vulnerable groups (e.g. refugees, IDPs, migrant populations)
requires these distinctions to be integrated into the sampling frame and sometimes there is insufficient
information to do this or a lack of resources to expand the sample size; (d) lack of access to displacement-
affected areas; and (e) difficulties associated with integrating an inherently political topic into less
controversial surveys.

Border crossings
The registration of people crossing internationals borders is conducted in many countries, and in some
cases these data are used to estimate migration flows. Identifying refugees among people crossing borders
is a significant challenge, particularly if individuals decide not to apply for asylum or refugee status (UNSD
2014). Additional problems associated with the collection of data on border crossings include: (a) difficulties
distinguishing migrants from other people crossing a border, such as tourists, commuters, traders and truck
drivers; (b) lack of capacity of many border posts and officials to handle large migration flows; (c) less
scrutiny and diligence of emigration flows compared with immigration flow; and (d) lack of tight controls at
most borders and the high incidence of undocumented or irregular crossings (UNSD 2014).

Administrative records and registers
Many countries have administrative records or registers of immigrants that could generate statistics on
asylum-seekers and refugees. In particular, data on residence permits issued to refugees or asylum-
seekers could be used to generate statistics on both flows and stocks of refugees.79 For example, Eurostat
collects and disseminates data on residence permits granted to those with refugee status and subsidiary
protection (UNSD 2014).

General population registers
In a small but growing number of countries, information from the central population register is the main
source of migration statistics.80 While population registers may generate statistics on both internal and
international migration (if they record changes of residence, and international arrivals and departures) they
do not typically record reasons for movement. However, it may be possible to link data from the central
population register to those from immigration or border authorities to identify refugees and asylum-



76Using standard ILO definitions, Labor Force Surveys collect data on work-related issues and provide a basis for
measuring employment and unemployment indicators. They are typically conducted monthly in developed countries
and quarterly or annually in developing countries.
77 Supported by USAID and implemented by ICF International, the DHS Program has collected, analyzed and

disseminated data on population, health, HIV and nutrition through more than 300 surveys in over 90 countries.
78 MICS is an initiative of UNICEF that assists countries in collecting and analyzing health and education data in order
to fill data gaps for monitoring the situation of children and women.
79 Many refugee hosting countries issue a form of identification, either specific to refugees or based on national
identification documents or those issued to non-national residents. In many cases where such documents are not
issued, refugee identity cards are issued in collaboration with UNHCR.
80 A population register provides a mechanism for the continuous recording of selected data on the resident population

including a unique identification number, date of birth, sex, marital status, place of birth, place of residence, citizenship
and language and possibly also socio-economic data, such as occupation or education.
seekers.81 There are several challenges associated with using central population registers to estimate
refugee and asylum-seeker populations, including: consistency of the definition of refugees with the
definition in the 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol; difficulty and cost of establishing and maintaining a
population register (UNSD 2014); and confidentiality safeguards.

Compilation of statistics on forcibly displaced populations
Several international organizations are involved in the compilation, analysis and dissemination of statistics
on forced displacement including UNHCR,82 Eurostat, IDMC, OCHA, International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC),83 WFP84 and IOM. Each of these actors has their own thematic focus and specific objectives,
and applies their own methodologies.

Asylum-seekers and refugees
UNHCR is the principal organization responsible for the compilation, analysis and dissemination of data on
asylum-seekers and refugees. UNHCR maintains a publicly available statistical online database85 with data
for the period 1951-2014 on refugees (including people in refugee-like situations), asylum-seekers (pending
cases), returned refugees, IDPs protected or assisted by UNHCR, returned IDPs previously protected or
assisted by UNHCR, stateless persons and others of concern to UNHCR, disaggregated by country of
origin and asylum.86 Data are also provided on demographics, location, asylum-seekers (refugee status
determination and monthly data) and resettlement. UNHCR regularly publishes statistical reports, including
“Global Trends”, “Mid-Year Trends”, “Asylum Trends” and “Statistical Yearbook”. Additionally, UNHCR
hosts interagency information sharing portals for significant emergencies.87 These portals provide data on
populations of concern at regional and country levels, including time series data, demographics, location
and accommodation information.88
Eurostat compiles and publishes data on asylum (applications and decisions) and managed migration in
European Union member countries. Countries and national and international NGOs also publish these
statistics, based on sources of various completeness, quality and timeliness (UNSD 2014). There are
sometimes substantial inconsistencies between the numbers published by different organizations for the
same country, including high-income countries with good statistical systems, usually due to differences in
definitions, times and statistical methods, including the mixing of data on flows and stocks (UNSD 2014).
There are several challenges associated with the compilation of data on asylum-seekers and refugees.
Significant among these are: (a) the lack of capacity of national statistical agencies in many developing
countries to collect robust data on refugees; (b) weak or incomplete monitoring of refugees dispersed within
host communities; (c) lack of capacity to maintain up to date information on refugees (reflecting new arrivals,



81 General population registers may also provide opportunities for more elaborate analysis of the integration of refugees
in asylum countries, as the data could be linked to other administrative registers, for example on labor and education
(UNSD 2014).
82 UNHCR collects, compiles and publishes data on asylum-seekers, refugees and IDPs protected or assisted by

UNHCR, including populations in refugee-like or IDP-like situations.
83 Established in 1863, the ICRC’s mission is to ensure humanitarian protection and assistance for victims of armed
conflict and other situations of violence. ICRC’s work is based on the Geneva Conventions of 1949, their Additional
Protocols, its Statutes—and those of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement—and the resolutions
of the International Conferences of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.

populations can quickly become outdated; and (d) data protection and privacy issues.

IDPs
Data on IDPs are compiled, analyzed and disseminated by a number of organizations, including IDMC,
UNHCR,89 OCHA, ICRC, WFP, IOM, JIPS, as well as NGOs and research institutes. IDMC is the lead
organization responsible for aggregating sources and establishing estimates of new and cumulative
displacements that are as reliable as possible. IDMC relies on a wide range of secondary sources of
information, including national governments, international organizations, national and international NGOs,
human rights organizations, the media and IDPs themselves (IDMC 2015). It publishes estimates of internal
displacement caused by conflict, generalized violence, and human rights violations in over 60 countries.
IDMC candidly acknowledges the challenges associated with data compilation and the corresponding
limitations in terms of the completeness, quality, reliability and comparability of aggregate numbers. IDMC’s
aggregation and analysis is constrained by the scope and quality of its source data. Significant challenges
include:
           (a)   The lack of consistent definitions and methodologies (across locations and over time), in
                 particular the lack of consensus on when internal displacement ends (IDMC 2015).
                 Consequently, data may be aggregated across situations and countries even though the
                 source data were generated for different purposes and using different methodologies.
           (b)   Very few national governments collect or report up-to-date data on IDPs. Political will as well
                 as the resources and capacities to carry out effective and timely data collection vary across
                 countries. In 2015, only five governments responded to IDMC requests for data.90
                 Consequently, data on internal displacement is outdated in several countries and is at risk of
                 becoming outdated in others, including countries like Afghanistan with large IDP populations
                 (IDMC 2016).91 Problems of outdated and ‘decaying’ data are especially problematic in
                 protracted displacement situations—international organizations reallocate resources to more
                 visible or pressing displacement crises (IDMC 2016).
           (c)   Limited official standards and guidance on how to collect data on IDPs in the field. IDMC may
                 rely on more than one source in some countries (each gathering data for different purposes
                 and using different definitions and methodologies with little or no coordination) and so double
                 counting and gaps cannot be excluded (IDMC 2015). IDMC reported that changes in the way
                 their sources collect and analyze their data led to dramatic adjustments in 2014 figures, e.g.
                 in Côte d’Ivoire a profiling exercise led to a four-fold increase in IDMC’s estimate, and in
                 Nigeria improvements in the national capacity to collect information led to a 70 percent
                 decrease in IDMC’s estimate (IDMC 2015).
           (d)   The lack of complete data for most countries. The fluidity of population movements, insecurity
                 and other access restrictions (lack of transport infrastructure, high logistical costs and
                 government restrictions) make primary data collection almost impossible in many areas
                 (IDMC 2015). Consequently, data collectors often focus on IDPs in relatively stable, secure
                 and accessible places (e.g. camps) and estimations in the most difficult areas rely on ‘local
                 informers’ (e.g. local authorities, NGOs etc.) who may or may not have the capacity to provide
                 adequate numbers, or which leaves data collection and reporting subject to the influence of
                 parties to the conflict (IDMC 2016). Figures do not always capture ‘invisible’ IDPs that are
                 living in individual accommodation dispersed in host communities, and therefore figures are

in assisting or protecting IDPs.
90   Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Ireland and Mexico (IDMC 2016)
91IDMC notes that outdated or ‘decaying’ data are a problem in 12 of the 53 conflict- or violence-affected countries it
monitors (Armenia, Bangladesh, Congo, Cyprus, Guatemala, Macedonia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, Togo,
Turkey and Uganda), accounting for approximately 20 percent of IDPs worldwide (IDMC 2016).
                 likely to understate the true scale of internal displacement in some situations (e.g.
                 Afghanistan, Sudan) (IDMC 2015). On the other hand, in contexts with multiple
                 displacements, there may be people who are counted more than once, e.g. DRC. Additionally,
                 crises that are smaller or less visible tend to be underreported, e.g. displacement due to
                 criminal violence in Central America (IDMC 2015).
           (e)   Difficulties obtaining figures on IDP flows, i.e. new displacement, returns, integration,
                 settlement elsewhere, numbers who have fled across an international border (becoming
                 refugees) and those who have been born or who have died in displacement (IDMC 2015).
                 Data on flows may not be collected or sufficiently disaggregated. Often, less data on flows
                 are available once the initial emergency phase of a displacement crisis is over, especially if
                 there are no humanitarian agencies present (IDMC 2015). IDMC reports that of the 52
                 countries it monitored in 2015, it was only able to obtain data on new displacements in 20
                 countries,92 on returns in 20 countries, on integration in one country, on resettlement in two
                 countries, on children born in displacement in two countries and on deaths in one country; no
                 data was obtained for any county on cross-border flight in 2015 (IDMC 2016). Moreover,
                 existing systems for collecting data on refugees and asylum-seekers make it difficult to know
                 how many were formerly IDPs, and it is possible for some people to be simultaneously
                 counted in both categories, e.g. in the case of the Syrian displacement crisis (IDMC 2016). If
                 no data on returns are available, IDMC risks overstating the number of IDPs (IDMC 2015).
                 On the other hand, in many countries returns are subtracted from population estimates without
                 knowing if sustainable solutions have been achieved.
           (f)   The potential to manipulate data for political purposes, for example to show that a
                 humanitarian situation has been resolved and direct attention elsewhere (e.g. in Armenia, the
                 Russian Federation and Turkey) (Walicki 2009) or alternatively still requires attention and
                 resources.
           (g)   Aggregation of data from different locations/crises within a country makes it difficult to
                 estimate how long groups have been in displacement.

Disaggregated data on location, accommodation and demographics
Disaggregated data on location, accommodation and demographics are incomplete. UNHCR publishes
disaggregated data for 60-80 percent of refugees and people in refugee-like situations, however the
coverage is much lower for other populations of concern to UNHCR who are largely IDPs (see Table 5).
Disaggregated data on IDPs who are not protected or assisted by UNHCR are collected by other agencies,
including IOM, but data are not comprehensive and therefore not published in IDMC’s global reports.93 The
difficulties of collecting disaggregated data on locations of IDPs are compounded by the fluidity of IDP
movements—IDPs might suffer multiple displacements or they might resort to changing locations as a
coping strategy (e.g. moving between their homes and place of displacement or testing different locations
before deciding where to stay) (Brookings 2011). In recent years, efforts have been made to improve data
collection for IDPs living outside of camps by employing a range of techniques including: (a) profiling; (b)
household surveys; (c) collecting information on IDPs who come to camps to visit family members or collect
relief items; and (d) community outreach programs (Brookings 2013). However, there is no consensus or
agreed best practices on the use of these methods in different contexts or stages of displacement
(Brookings 2013).



92   The absence of data on new displacement may simply mean that no displacement has taken place (IDMC 2016).
93 IDMC reports that data, disaggregated by age and sex, were available for 15 of the 60 countries it monitored in 2014,
however these data were not comprehensive and are not published. Additionally, in some countries there are data
provided by IOM on IDP populations by location from which the urban or rural character of the population may be
inferred (e.g. if the camp is located in the capital), but data are not comprehensive and not published. While the majority
of humanitarian profile data does not typically cover IDPs living outside of camp or camp-like settings (the large majority
of IDPs), IOM’s DTM in countries such as Nigeria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya do include information about those residing
in host communities.

Overall robustness of current data
The robustness of data is difficult to estimate. A review of data collection and compilation methodologies
shows broad variations in terms of the accuracy and reliability of the global estimates of forced displacement
that are widely used. Headline figures on forced displacement are significant in shaping public opinion and
are critical for sound decision making, both to inform the allocation of resources and to design effective
humanitarian and development responses. However, the available estimates are potentially misleading and
should not be referred to without appropriate caveats and qualifiers. They may provide reasonably solid
insights on trends at the level of individual crises or countries, assuming no significant methodological
change over time, but in most cases, they provide an incomplete picture and are often not comparable
across displacement situations. Table 6 provides an estimate of methodological robustness using a simple
rating system that takes into account, among other factors, whether data are based on an actual counting
of persons (registration) by a national or international institution, whether some or all data are based on an
estimation, the coverage of data, and whether data are up to date.

   (lowest)               No information on large parts of the country;
                           or
                          Only outdated data are available
Note: Assessment of methodological robustness was based on a review of end-2014 data and associated
methodologies.

At an aggregate level, the headline statistic of 65 million forcibly displaced persons is an estimate, and the
data are the least robust for IDPs (who represent the bulk of the forcibly displaced and the largest part of
the recent growth in numbers). Based on existing data, it is not possible to assess how close it may be from
the actual situation on the ground, nor whether it provides an over- or an under-evaluation. In the absence
of accurate data, existing figures provide the only source to determine orders of magnitudes, relative
numbers, and trends. They may provide important insights into the forced displacement crisis, but they
ought to be taken with a great degree of caution. Data users should be aware of their limitations and of the
corresponding error margins.

E. Key data required for development policy and programming
Conflict-induced forced displacement is increasingly being recognized as a development issue by both
humanitarian and development actors. Forced displacement poses significant challenges to achieving the
SDGs and the Bank’s own goals of eradicating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Displaced
people are often (though not always) more likely to be poor than non-displaced people and they also have
unique vulnerabilities that are impediments to achieving higher incomes. Additionally, the burden of hosting
displaced populations is overwhelmingly carried by developing countries, which can undermine their efforts
to reduce poverty and promote development. In particular, sudden inflows of displaced people can create
short-term disequilibria across a number of markets (including the labor market), and place additional strain
on infrastructure and local services such as education, health, solid waste management, water services
and urban transport. The presence of displaced populations can also increase the risks of conflict diffusion,
instability, and further displacement.
Traditional responses that focus only on the immediate needs of the newly displaced or on durable solutions
are often inadequate. Given the protracted nature of many forced displacement situations and the limited
immediate prospects for durable solutions for most displaced people, short term humanitarian responses
are insufficient. Even the achievement of one of the three durable solutions does not automatically eliminate
the vulnerabilities associated with having been forcibly displacement. In particular, many returnees continue
to face impediments to their sustainable reintegration in countries/places of origin. There are also
significant, varied and long-term impacts of forced displacement (both positive and negative) on host
countries and communities that need to be understood and managed. A development engagement,
anchored in a medium to longer-term perspective, can therefore complement a humanitarian engagement
throughout the entire period of a forced displacement situation.
Currently, there is a very weak link between the collection of forced displacement statistics and the analysis
required to inform an effective development response.95 For development actors, several analytical
questions may be considered, such as:




95 A development response to forced displacement may encompass several elements including: (a) policy adjustments

to encourage greater inclusion of displaced populations within mainstream economic and social development
processes; (b) medium-term interventions to lessen the dependency of displaced populations on humanitarian
assistance and mitigate tensions between displaced people and their host communities; (c) support to mitigate the
potential negative socio-economic impacts of refugee and IDP populations on host communities and to maximize the
social-economic benefits; (d) support to mitigate any negative macroeconomic and financial impacts of forced
displacement on host countries and to enhance positive impacts on the economy over the longer term; (e) support to
         (a)   What are the scale (stocks, flows and locations) and nature of the socio-economic
               vulnerabilities, welfare and needs of displaced people (including those that are unique to
               displaced people as well as those shared with host communities), and how are these evolving
               over time?
         (b)   What are the scale (numbers and locations) and nature of impacts (both positive and
               negative) on host communities, e.g. in terms of service delivery, welfare, jobs and social
               cohesion, and how are these evolving over time?
         (c)   What are the fiscal and macroeconomic impacts on host countries, and how are these
               changing over time?
         (d)   What has been the scale of returns (numbers and locations), how successful have these
               returns been, and what are the impediments to sustainable reintegration including the socio-
               economic vulnerabilities, welfare and needs of returnees (both those that are unique to
               returnees as well as those shared with communities in return areas)?
         (e)   What have been the impacts of previous interventions in various contexts to address the
               development challenges posed by forced displacement, and what lessons can inform the
               design of future interventions?
These analytical questions require data collection efforts that go beyond the information requirements to
support humanitarian responses in the areas of protection and assistance. Very broadly, the additional data
requirements include: (a) estimates of the numbers of returnees that have yet to be successfully/sustainably
reintegrated and data on their locations; (b) estimates of the size of affected host populations and data on
the impact of displacement on host countries and communities; (c) data on the socio-economic
vulnerabilities, welfare and needs of displaced and returnee populations; and (d) rigorous impact
assessments of interventions in various contexts to address the development impacts of forced
displacement.

Returnees
Data on returns of refugees and IDPs are incomplete. UNHCR provides data on refugees who have
returned to their host countries (39 countries during 2015) and some data on returned IDPs (i.e. only former
IDPs that were protected or assisted by UNHCR) including both assisted and unassisted returns. IDMC
provides very rough estimates of returns of IDPs (in 20 of 52 countries it monitored in 2015). However,
there are significant challenges associated with obtaining figures on IDP returns and actual return figures
may be considerably higher (IDMC 2015). In practice, the quality of data is more solid for those who have
returned with assistance from UNHCR or other international agencies than for unassisted returns.
There is limited data on the success or sustainability96 of reintegration following return. In many situations
returns are not sustainable leading to onward migration or secondary displacement. Even when returnees
resettle permanently in their areas of origin, they may continue to face obstacles to their full reintegration.
However, publicly available data on returns do not extend to an assessment of the success or sustainability
of return and reintegration, making it difficult to assess the degree to which specific groups of returnees still
have vulnerabilities and needs linked to their displacement. A starting point for this kind of assessment may
be the eight criteria for sustainable returns set out in the IASC Framework on Durable Solutions for IDPs.97




conflict-affected countries to address some of the drivers of forced displacement and promote returns; and (f) support
to returnees and communities in return areas to facilitate successful and sustainable reintegration.
96 UNHCR conducts protection monitoring in return areas that informs programming, as well as communication with

refugees and IDPs about conditions so as to inform their decisions; this information should complement all statistics
about returns – both assisted and spontaneous.
97 JIPS, under the leadership of the Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of IDPs, is developing a methodology

and tools to apply the IASC Framework’s eight criteria for durable solutions (Beyani, Baal and Caterina 2016).
Host communities
There is currently no global estimate of affected host communities. Clearly defining and identifying affected
host communities is critical from a development perspective to provide them with the support they need to
absorb the shock caused by an influx of forcibly displaced persons. However, there is no agreed definition
of what constitutes an affected host community. And while there are some anecdotal estimates of host
populations for specific displacement situations at given times, there is no systematic aggregation. Yet, the
number of people living in host communities and affected by forced displacement (positively or negatively)
is likely to be large.
There are significant methodological issues in making such calculations. A very rough estimate may be
based on the density of the forcibly displaced population within a particular area. UNHCR has data on the
physical location of various groups of forcibly displaced persons that can be linked to estimates of the local
population to calculate such densities. Yet, such detailed estimates are difficult to collect accurately.
Furthermore, this approach requires some important assumptions on the threshold density above which a
community is considered affected, as well as on the area that is included in the calculation: in the case of
a rural refugee camp, the impact might be significant but geographically limited to the immediate vicinity
while for forcibly displaced people dispersed in an urban environment it may be more diffuse. Despite such
empirical challenges, identifying affected host communities is critical from a development perspective.
Estimating such numbers, however, is distinct from measuring the impact itself, which can be either positive
or negative, and in most cases, is a combination of positive and negative impacts that vary over time. In
the event of large and sudden flows of refugees and IDPs, the short-term impacts on host communities can
be significant, and if they are not well managed, the impacts can be long lasting. A central question is how
development organizations can support host countries to promote positive impacts and mitigate negative
ones. The welfare of host communities also plays a critical role in the political economy of asylum and
integration.

Socio-economic data on displaced populations, returnees and host communities
Data from socio-economic assessments of displacement crises can usefully inform the design of recovery
and development policies and associated assistance programs. However, currently there is little
comprehensive data available on the socio-economic vulnerabilities and needs of displaced populations or
on the social and economic impacts of displacement on host communities. Data on refugees are rarely
captured in poverty statistics, which rely on national household surveys usually covering the resident
population only, although there are some examples of displacement related questions on IDPs and migrant
populations being incorporated into household surveys. Rather, data on the socio-economic impacts of this
kind tend to be collected for specific displacement crises (see Box 5).
     Box 5: Bank-Supported Socio-Economic Surveys and Assessments of Displaced and Host
                                        Populations
         The “Socio-Economic Impact of the Crisis in North Mali on Displaced People” [completed in 2015] analyzes
          the impact of the 2012 crisis on IDPs in Bamako, refugees in camps in Mauritania and Niger, and returnees
          in the regional capitals of Gao, Timbuktu and Kidal, using data from a face-to-face household survey and
          follow-up interviews using mobile phones.
         In Kenya, a Bank study [ongoing] on the dynamics of the Kakuma refugee camp investigates price effects
          in food, labor, cattle and housing markets, relying on an original survey across Kakuma and another town98
          to collect data on household demographics, remittances, employment opportunities and trends, wages and
          prices.
         The Bank with UNHCR is undertaking a regional assessment of social, economic and environmental
          impacts of forced displacement in the Lake Chad Basin [ongoing] to consider the extent, causes, character
          and socio-economic impact of forced displacement in Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon and possibly
          CAR.




98Recognizing that there are other factors impacting on the welfare of host communities over the 20-year lifespan of
the Kakuma refugee camp, the analysis aims to construct a counterfactual to isolate the changes caused by the
presence of refugees.
         In Somalia, the Mogadishu Household Survey covered both residential areas and IDP camps, collecting
          data on expenditures, demographics and living conditions [survey completed; analysis forthcoming]. As
          part of the Somalia Knowledge for Operations and Political Economy (SKOPE) initiative, the Puntland
          Household Survey will also cover both residential and IDP populations [ongoing].
         An IDP study in South Sudan [ongoing] aims to assess the economic needs of IDPs and host communities
          in urban areas, covering livelihoods, water and sanitation, infrastructure as well as intentions and conditions
          to return. Basic information about education, employment and general health variables will also be
          collected.
         The Iraq Crisis Response Study [ongoing] will assess the impact of the Islamic State and oil price-related
          crises on IDPs and households left behind in IS controlled areas. The study will conduct an ex-ante micro-
          simulation using pre-crisis household data (IHSES 2012) and macroeconomic projections for 2014 to gauge
          the distributional impact of the crises across groups (e.g. individuals and/or households, sectors, IDPs and
          host communities) and space (e.g. urban/rural, governorates).
         The Economic and Social Impact Assessment for Kurdistan Region of Iraq [completed in 2015] provides
          an analysis of the impact of displaced people on access to and quality of service delivery across several
          sectors.
         The Lebanon Economic and Social Impact Assessment of the Syria Conflict [completed in 2013] provides
          an analysis of the impact of displaced people on access to and quality of service delivery across several
          sectors.
         The Bank and UNHCR undertook a welfare assessment of Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon
          [completed in 2016] focusing on welfare, poverty and vulnerability. The study: (i) compares the socio-
          economic profile of refugees with that of the Syrian population before the crisis and with the hosting
          populations of Jordan and Lebanon; (ii) provides a welfare and vulnerability assessment of Syrian refugees
          including a poverty profile, the socio-economic characteristics of higher poverty and where pockets of deep
          poverty are located; (iii) analyzes key drivers of welfare and poverty; and (iv) models monetary and non-
          monetary vulnerability.
         In Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, the Bank is leading an initiative to evaluate the socio-economic impact of
          the regional crises on the welfare of Syrian refugees and host communities in neighboring countries
          [ongoing]. Data on living conditions, access to services and economic opportunities, coping strategies and
          economic status are to be collected via a specialized household survey and a sub-component of the survey
          will be carried out on a semi-annual basis to continue to monitor and adapt support as needed.
         A recent Bank paper, “Turkey’s Response to the Syrian Refugee Crisis and the Road Ahead” [completed
          in 2015] assessed the impact of Syrian refugees on host areas in various sectors. It found that the presence
          of Syrian refugees is placing a strain on municipal services, housing rental markets, social relations, and
          education services for Turkish households. Impacts on the labor market are unclear; initial research
          suggests that there has been a supply shock to informal labor markets. This has had a large-scale impact
          on the employment of natives in the informal sector. At the same time, research suggests there has been
          a boost to formal employment for the Turks, but this has been uneven: the low educated and women
          experience net displacement from the labor market and, together with those in the informal sector, declining
          earning opportunities.
         The “Socio-economic Assessment of the Impact of Syrians under Temporary Protection (SuTPs) on
          Turkish Hosting Communities” [ongoing], to be undertaken in partnership with the Government of Turkey,
          will include a nationally representative household survey with SuTP and local Turkish households including
          camp and non-camp environments. The questionnaire will cover welfare (assets, income, expenditure),
          municipal services, labor and employment, education, social networks and quality of life.


F. Options to improve forced displacement statistics
Significant efforts are needed to enhance the reliability, comparability, quality and scope of the global data
on forced displacement. In particular, more robust estimates are needed of the scale (stocks, flows and
locations) and typology (demographics, location and accommodation) of forced displacement crises. This
requires substantial improvements in the rigor of data collection and compilation methodologies including:
         (a)   Harmonization of definitions and methodologies used in the collection and analysis of
               statistical data on forced displacement—covering stocks and flows of refugees, asylum-
               seekers and IDPs—to ensure comparability across regions and countries;
        (b)   Disaggregation and geo-mapping of data by location (current location and location of habitual
              residence; urban, peri-urban or rural location), accommodation (organized camp versus non-
              camp), and demographics (age and sex);
        (c)   Expanded coverage of data collection exercises to include all areas of affected countries
              (security permitting);
        (d)   Improved coverage and detailed data on displaced populations living outside of organized
              camps;
        (e)   Improved coverage of ‘flows’, i.e. new displacement, durable solutions (returns, integration,
              resettlement), births, deaths, and in the case of IDPs, the numbers that flee across
              international borders becoming refugees;
        (f)   Systematic data collection beginning from the earliest moment following displacement,
              following up as populations disperse, and continuing until sustainable/durable solutions have
              been achieved; and
        (g)   Better aggregation, analysis and presentation of forced displacement data currently compiled
              separately by UNHCR, IOM, IDMC and UNRWA.
Additional efforts are required to address the gaps in the data required for development policy and planning.
These data are critical for informing the design of development policies and assistance programs.
Specifically, additional data is required in the following areas:
        (a)   Data on the socio-economic welfare, specific vulnerabilities and needs of displaced
              populations (broadly consistent with data collected and analyzed for poverty work, i.e.
              demographics, income and expenditure data, prices, living standards, access to
              infrastructure, services and local governance etc.);
        (b)   Estimates of the size of affected host populations and data on the impact of displacement on
              host communities;
        (c)   Estimates of the numbers of returnees yet to overcome the socio-economic vulnerabilities
              associated with their displacement, as well as data on their socio-economic welfare (broadly
              consistent with data collected and analyzed for poverty work, i.e. demographics, income and
              expenditure data, prices, living standards, access to infrastructure, services and local
              governance etc.); and
        (d)   Rigorous impact assessments of interventions in various contexts to address the development
              impacts of forced displacement.
There is a significant opportunity to address some of these gaps by mainstreaming forced displacement
into household surveys, focusing on international survey instruments.99 Sample surveys can potentially
provide a rich source of data on displaced populations. Survey instruments enable detailed questions to be
asked about the characteristics and situations of households, and if they identify displaced populations
based on self-reported migration history (including patterns and causes) they can enable the disaggregation
of detailed data by displacement status.
Additionally, more innovative tools and technologies for data collection, analysis and compilation should be
explored and leveraged. For example, new methodologies (such as high resolution satellite imagery and
unmanned drones) may expand the coverage of data collection efforts in insecure or inaccessible areas.
Additionally, new techniques could be explored to improve the collection of robust data on flows of refugees
and IDPs. Organizations such as the World Bank, UNHCR, IOM and IDMC are already exploring and in
some cases are beginning to use more innovative data collection tools. These techniques include:



99 Several standardized international sample surveys have been designed for special purposes including Living
Standards Measurement Studies, Labor Force Surveys, Demographic and Health Surveys, and Multiple Indicator
Cluster Surveys. The advantage of these surveys is that they cover a wide range of countries and are conducted in a
regular or systematic manner
           (a)   High frequency sample surveys using smartphone and cellular technologies. For example, a
                 high-frequency survey initiative in Somalia employs a dynamic questionnaire loaded onto
                 smartphones, which enables data to be collected from household interviews in 60 minutes.
                 This approach was developed to overcome the challenges of insecurity, limited data gathering
                 capacity and budgetary constraints.
           (b)   The use of mobile phones to conduct surveys or follow up interviews following face-to-face
                 household surveys. For example, a Bank paper on the impact of the 2012 crisis in Mali on
                 IDPs, refugees and returnees used information from a face-to-face household survey as well
                 as follow-up interviews with its respondents via mobile phones. This combination provided a
                 mechanism to monitor the impact of conflict on hard-to-reach populations who at times live in
                 areas inaccessible to enumerators. And in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the Bank supported the
                 use of mobile phones to collect key socio-economic data on the effects of the Ebola virus.
           (c)   Crowdsourcing data on displacement. Platforms such as the Kenyan Ushahidi has crowd-
                 sourced data on displacement in Kenya and eastern DRC by encouraging IDPs and host
                 communities to report incidents using their mobile phones or the internet, including
                 information about living conditions. The platform references these reports geo-spatially.
           (d)   Geo-mapping of data on displaced populations and affected host communities. Geographic
                 Information Systems (GIS) and geospatial analysis can be used to map, monitor and analyze
                 data on forced displacement. Triangulation of this information with socio-economic and other
                 indicators can provide a rich source of data and enable insights into underlying patterns and
                 trends over time.
           (e)   Use of big data (mobile phone data, news scraping, social media). IDMC is pursuing big data
                 approaches to capturing displacement data in real time in order to report on displacement
                 situations as they are happening and to provide updates on how they are evolving (IDMC
                 2015). These data are not necessarily representative but can be used in conjunction with
                 other methods to triangulate trends. For example, the Swedish NGO, Flowminder, has
                 pioneered the use of de-identified data from mobile operators to track population
                 displacement caused by natural disasters such as earthquakes in Haiti in 2010 and Nepal in
                 2015, and these techniques may also have applications in conflict-induced displacement
                 crises.100
           (f)   High-resolution satellite imagery and unmanned drones. High resolutions satellite imagery
                 can be used to map physical structures in refugee and IDP camps including changes to the
                 number and type of these over time, support the remote detection of displaced populations in
                 hard to reach or insecure settings; and conduct rapid assessments during or immediately after
                 a mass displacement (Harvard Humanitarian Initiative 2014). In settings with clearly
                 distinguishable individual structures, these methods can also be reasonably accurate for the
                 purposes of rapid estimation of displaced population (Checchi, et al. 2013).101 The use of
                 unmanned drones is also becoming more popular as the cost of this technology falls. This
                 technique has been used by UNHCR to update its estimates of IDPs in Somalia’s Afgooye
                 corridor (IDMC 2015) and by IOM to monitor disaster-induced displacement in Haiti, including
                 the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in collaboration with UNOSAT.
           (g)   Open data initiatives. There are several initiatives to provide free and open data that enable
                 Internet users to independently mine and analyze data and generate customized summaries,
                 charts and visualizations. For example, the Bank has provided free, open access to its
                 development data since the launch of its Open Data Initiative in 2010, however there is little
                 open data on asylum-seekers, refugees and IDPs. JIPS has developed a web-based platform
                 that allows users to explore, analyze and visualize profiling data online, and IDMC has



100   See http://www.flowminder.org/.
101 These methods are not effective in settings with connected structures, a complex pattern of roofs or multi-level
buildings, as are prevalent in urban areas. Additionally, cloud cover and dense foliage can also obscure structures.
                 recently introduced the first version of their Global Internal Displacement Database (GIDD)
                 that allows users to explore, filter and sort IDMC’s data to produce graphs and tables, and
                 export underlying data.102 Such platforms need to incorporate safeguards to protect the
                 privacy and confidentiality of individuals’ data.
UNHCR and Statistics Norway are currently leading an initiative to improve forced displacement statistics
with the participation of national statistical agencies. This process began with the presentation of the
“Report on Statistics on Refugees and IDPs” at the 46th session of the UN Statistical Commission in March
2015,103 followed by an international conference in Turkey in October 2015.104 The conference set in motion
a process for national statistical agencies to collaborate to develop a set of recommendations that both
countries and international organizations can use to improve data collection, reporting, data disaggregation,
and overall quality, including the preparation of International Recommendations for Refugee Statistics
(IRRS). Progress on this agenda was discussed at the 47th session of UNSD held in New York in March
2016, where it was recommended that the expert group should also include IDPs in its scope of work (UNSD
2016).105
The current initiative is focused on refugees, asylum-seekers and IDPs but would ideally be extended to
host communities and returnees. Assistance might be directed to one or more of the following areas:
           (a)   Support for addressing the lack of data and statistics on affected host communities and
                 returnees.
           (b)   Support for improving the scope of data collection activities to include data requirements for
                 long-term development planning, in particular the mainstreaming of data on forced
                 displacement in household surveys; and
           (c)   Support to test and mainstream the use of more innovative mechanisms for data collection,
                 analysis and dissemination.
For such efforts to be successful and sustainable, it is important to ensure they are appropriately
institutionalized and that they reflect the expertise and comparative advantages of the organizations
involved. This can be achieved within the broader context of ongoing initiatives aimed at strengthening
statistical capacity at the country level, and enhancing cooperation across countries to ensure comparability
of data. Considering the number of actors involved in data collection and compilation, each with their own
objectives and agendas, coordination is crucial. This would also require engaging with host governments
(at national and local levels), international organizations (e.g. UNHCR, IDMC, IOM), international and local
NGOs, and research organizations, through awareness raising, capacity building and the
development/improvement of effective and timely data collection systems (Brookings 2013). Institutional
arrangements would need to delineate data collector and data compiler roles, as well as reflect the following
principles to ensure sustainability:
           (a)   Pursue additional activities within the overall framework of existing initiatives to ensure
                 coherence with the activities of other actors.
           (b)   Primary responsibility for data collection rests with national statistical agencies (with adequate
                 arrangements in the case of IDPs to mitigate political risks).
           (c)   Definitions and methodologies should be harmonized across countries, through a process
                 managed under the auspices of the UN Statistical Commission.
           (d)   Agencies such as UNHCR and IDMC can play a leading role in ensuring quality, providing
                 technical assistance as may be needed, and aggregating data for global analyses.

        (e)   The Bank could provide a link between data collection and analysis to
              enhance/inform/underpin operational design (i.e. what do we need to know about displaced
              populations, host communities and returnees to design effective development responses, and
              how can these requirements be mainstreamed into data collection systems).
As an initial step, interested parties could support the formation and facilitation of a working group of
technical experts including representatives of national statistical agencies, regional statistics committees
and international organizations (such as UNHCR, IDMC, IOM and the Bank), including annual meetings.
This technical working group would provide a forum for discussing and harmonizing the current patchwork
of existing initiatives across the spectrum of forced displacement statistics. Consistent with the principles
outlined above, it would be beneficial if the proposed technical working group were established as an
integral addition to, or an expanded version of, the committee of experts being led by UNHCR under the
auspices of UNSD. Assistance might then be offered to: (a) provide technical assistance for the
development/harmonization of statistical definitions and methodologies; (b) pilot data collection activities to
test/hone methodologies (either specific surveys or additional modules of existing surveys) including
training and technical assistance provided to national statistical agencies; and/or (c) the definition of a data
analysis framework and/or support to national statistical agencies to undertake their own data analysis.
