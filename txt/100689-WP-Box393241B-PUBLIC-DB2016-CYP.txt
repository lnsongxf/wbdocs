THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 1,153,058

by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 47

frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 60*
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

        Most of the applicants download the form on-line and apply in person
        since they can get a follow-up number. In the application, the customer
        needs to provide contact information, description of the location of the
        premise (land plot number), and provide a copy of the title deed or lease
   1    agreement. The customer will also need to explain the load requirements 50 calendar days                EUR 27,000
        and justify the need for the requested load. Finally, they have to provide
        an expected time of connection. Usually, the customer applies for the
        connection just before starting the construction of the building since the
        process can take some time.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

      File the contract at the Department of Lands and Surveys

      The deposition of the contract of sale with the Department of Lands and
      Surveys is mandatory under The Contract Law, Cap.149 as amended (Law
      no.99(I)/2013) and applies to all sales contracts that are signed from the
      date of the entering into force of the law, 9th of September 2013 and
      onwards. Furthermore, in pursuance with the Law No. 81 (I)/2011, the
      buyer is given 6 months from the date of signing the contract of sale to
      deposit it to the District Land Office of the district where the property is
      situated.



      The objective of this reform is to protect the parties interests, especially
      the buyer's in case of violation of the agreement. In particular, the             1 day          EUR 50

      deposit of contract serves the following objectives:

      1) It prevents the seller from selling the same property twice.

      2) If the seller does not perform his obligations ( i.e.he does not come to
      the land registry to transfer the property), the buyer can apply to the
      court which issues a decision requiring the Department of Lands and
      Surveys to transfer the property to the absence of the seller - what is
      called "specific performance" of the contract ( i.e. if the seller refuses or
      fails to comply with his contractual obligations) etc

        The declaration of registration is done after the evaluator at the Registry
        assesses the value of the property, based on the amount stated in the
        sale agreement. If the assessed price is higher than the paid amount
        stated in the purchase agreement, an inspection will be conducted by
        staff from the land registry. This valuation is required in order to prevent
        fraud (i.e. state in the sale agreement a lower amount in order to pay less
        transfer fees).

PAYING TAXES
Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes
faster, easier and less costly for businesses—such as by          have brought concrete results. Some economies
consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business

                   Cyprus made paying taxes more costly for companies by
                   increasing the special defense contribution rate on interest
                   income and introducing a private sector special contribution

                   and a fixed annual fee for companies registered in Cyprus. At
                   the same time, it simplified tax compliance by introducing
                   electronic filing for corporate income tax.

                   Cyprus made paying taxes easier for companies by reducing the

                   tax.
                   Cyprus made paying taxes easier for companies by facilitating
                   online payment of corporate income tax. At the same time,
                   Cyprus raised the contribution rate for social insurance paid by

                   employers, lowered the tax brackets for the social contribution

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
