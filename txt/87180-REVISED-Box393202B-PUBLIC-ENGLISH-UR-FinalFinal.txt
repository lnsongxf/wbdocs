    Preparation of the Turkey Urbanization Review was led by Stephen Karam (TTL and Sustainable
    Development Program Leader) and benefitted from the written contributions and inputs from
    a team comprised of Somik Lall, Lead Urban Economist, GSURR; Nancy Lozano Gracia, Sr.
    Urban Economist, GSURR; Jung Eun Oh, Sr. Urban Transport Economist, GTIDR; Mihaly Kopanyi,
    Consultant, GSURR; and Marcel Ionescu-Heroiu, Sr. Social Development Specialist, GSURR. Other
    World Bank staff and consultants who made important contributions were Basab Dasgupta,
    Henry Jewell, Elif Ayhan, Ken Gwilliam, William Wiseman, Esra Arıkan and Ayberk Yilmaz.
    The team is grateful to Bilgen Kahraman for formatting the report and to Ulker Karamullaoglu
    and Elif Yukseker for technical support and for arranging the Discussion Note workshops and
    team missions. TEPAV, the Turkish Economic Policy Research Foundation, provided substantial
    data collection and analysis as inputs to the report. In particular, the following individuals are
    acknowledged for their valuable contributions: Emin Dedeoğlu, Emre Koyuncu, Tunga Köroğlu,
    Selçuk Sertesen, Esen Çağlar, Ozan Acar, Ülker Şener, and Aslı Çakın.
    The report was prepared under the overall guidance of Sumila Gulyani (Practice Manager,
    GSURR) and benefitted greatly from the guidance and advice of Martin Raiser, Country Director
    for Turkey and Indermit Gill, ECA Chief Economist.
    The Turkey Urbanization Review also benefitted from the guidance received from and discussions
    at several levels with key stakeholders in Turkey, including a series of Discussion Note Workshops
    hosted by TEPAV in which preliminary findings were presented and discussed, and valuable
    insights that enabled the team to focus the findings and correct misunderstandings. The
    workshops and meetings of key stakeholders included governmental agencies that contributed
    substantially to the analysis and findings: Ministry of Development (Spatial and Urban
    Development Department and Environment and Sustainable Development Departments in
    particular) initiated the request for the focus on the five major thematic areas that comprise this
    report, namely city competitiveness, housing markets, urban transport, municipal finance, and
    inter-agency coordination; Ministry of Environment and Urbanization’s Spatial Planning General
    Directorate and Infrastructure and Urban Transformation Services General Directorate provided
    substantial feedback on interim reports, participated in field visits together with the World Bank
    team, conducted discussions sessions, particularly on planning issues and land development
    legislation and practices. The team also benefitted from inputs and commentary from Non-
    Governmental Organizations and Think Tanks. In that regard, the team would especially like to
    express appreciation to Mr. Yusuf Işık, who provided detailed written comments on early drafts
    of the report. The World Bank would like to thank the many contributors to these discussions
    and wishes to acknowledge their benefit.
    The report also benefitted from peer review comments at various stages of preparation from

    Pineura (Program Leader, EASFP), Angelica Nunez (Sr. Urban Specialist, GSURR), and Mediha
    Agar (Senior Economist, ECSP4) who provided valuable guidance to the team at the concept note
    and decision meeting stages. Funding support was generously provided by the Private-Public
    Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) and the Multidonor Trust Fund for Sustainable Urban
    Development without which this report could not have been produced.

2008 marked the advent of what some term “the urban century”, the historically significant
moment in which more than half of the world’s population resided in urban areas for the first
time. This milestone was perhaps even more significant for cities in developing countries, which
are expected to double in population from 2 to 4 billion people during the period 2000 to
2030. Indeed, in the coming decades many countries will transform into predominantly urban
economies as the process of urbanization takes hold around the globe.
Cities are often engines of growth and social progress, but rapid urbanization has not led to
improved living standards everywhere. Managing well the process of rapid urban growth for
many developing countries could mean the difference between improved livelihoods and
development outcomes and declining living conditions and human welfare. For these late
urbanizing countries, Turkey offers valuable lessons.
Rather than resisting urbanization, Turkey embraced it. Indeed, Turkey has been able to harness
the potential of urbanization by putting in place the public policies and regulatory elements
to allow markets to work, yielding measurable economic and social gains, increasing per
capita incomes, reducing poverty, scaling up the provision of housing, and achieving dramatic
improvements in municipal service coverage.
This book chronicles Turkey’s process of urbanization. It highlights critical policy measures and
interventions taken in response to a doubling of Turkey’s urban population in the last 30 years.
Prominent among these policy choices were the adoption of a metropolitan municipality regime
that enabled more efficient management of growing cities; scaling up housing supply through
state-brokered partnerships with the private sector; and the planning of human settlements and
connective infrastructure that facilitated trade and commercial exchange across Turkey’s large
land mass and with the rest of the world.
Looking ahead, as Turkey aspires to reach high income status in the coming years its cities will
undoubtedly need to play an important role. To do so, the report highlights critical challenges and
policy measures necessary to promote sustainable cities, including greater national-local urban
policy coordination, strengthened urban planning, investment in urban transport and mobility,
and the promotion of social cohesion. And to ensure that Turkey’s cities become magnets for
global talent and cauldrons of innovation, city planners and politicians will need to adjust to the
increasing complexity of the modern urban economy. Here, Turkey would do well to learn from
the experience of cities in the most advanced economies. As Jane Jacobs states in her book The
Death and Life of Great American Cities, “cities have the capability of providing something for
everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody”.

       Box 1. Advancing from Turkey’s first generation to second generation
                           urban development agenda
     In early or incipient stages of urbanization, usually before a country’s urban population crosses the 50
     percent threshold, the focus of Government urban policy should be on ensuring basic municipal infra-
     structure service coverage and access levels are adequate (internal roads, water and sanitation network
     access, solid waste collection), in addition to sufficient access to basic housing for incoming migrants. This
     is generally what may be referred to as the first generation urban development agenda.
     Having passed through this phase and now in an advanced stage of urbanization, Turkey now needs to
     embrace the second generation urban development agenda. Turkey today has 30 Metropolitan Munici-
     palities, all with populations of 1 million or more, 14 of which are newly established with significant
     additional responsibilities. The size and scale of these cities will require new, more sophisticated urban
     planning and management systems to deal with increasing traffic congestion, a larger environmental
     footprint, increasing infrastructure needs, as well as institutional capacities to prepare and implement
     statutory provincial territorial plans and sub-plans, establish new metropolitan water utilities, and fulfill
     other mandated responsibilities. In light of these emerging challenges, Turkey’s second generation urban
     development agenda should focus on the following core policy issues:
      •	    Targeting newly-established metropolitan municipalities with technical assistance, capacity
            building support, and financing to support their transition
      •	    Supporting metropolitan cities in preparing provincial level and sub-plan level territorial plans in
            accordance with international good practice
      •	    Investing in public transport systems promoting urban mobility and shifting more commute trips
            from personal vehicles and taxis to public transit options
      •	    Linking Metropolitan Municipality own-source revenue sources to their growing expenditure
            responsibilities
      •	    Enhancing Metropolitan Municipality credit-worthiness in order to increase access to market-
            based finance and PPP opportunities over time
      •	    Developing national and city-level information and data systems to support evidence-based
            policy making, coupled with inter-agency mechanisms to coordinate policy formulation and
            implementation, e.g. Urban Commission

  To appreciate the merits of Turkey’s urbanization experience, consider its precursors in the cities of Brit-
  ain and France. Not unlike Turkey, both Britain and France experienced an upsurge in urban population
  growth that coincided with their respective industrial revolutions in the early 19th century. Neither coun-
  try was prepared for the wave of new migrants to their cities. Britain’s experience was particularly brutal:
  cholera outbreaks in British cities were widespread. By 1841, the crude death rate in British cities was 5.6
  per thousand higher than in rural areas and infant mortality rates were 25-50 percent higher than in Brit-
  ain’s rural hinterland, earning them the unsavory title of “killer cities.” A major factor in Britain’s difficult
  urban transition was an under investment in infrastructure. According to Williamson (1990), in the midst
  of industrialization and urban growth, social overhead capital stocks in Britain actually declined over the
  70 years leading up to 1830. In France, the experience was no better. The population of Paris doubled
  over 50 years during the course of the 19th century with inadequate infrastructure and housing to accom-
  modate the new migrants, causing miserable living conditions for city residents. Three cholera epidemics
  plagued the city, the worst of which, in 1832, claimed the lives of 20,000 people, or nearly 3 percent of
  the city population. These two historical perspectives on urbanization underscore the needed emphasis
  on effective city planning and access to finance to invest in infrastructure necessary for an urban society.

spanned in its first phase a period of eight years
(2005-12). The main aim of this program was
to ensure broad-based access to water and
sanitation services across all of Turkey’s settle-
ments, particularly small villages in remote
rural areas. Other programs focused on towns
and small cities, include BELDES, the Municipal
Fund and, more recently, SUKAP, which was
established in 2011 and through Iller Bank has
reached millions of beneficiaries in a span of
only three years. Its target has been small mu-
nicipalities and involves a 50 percent subsidy
to municipalities to encourage them to borrow
from Iller Bank and invest in critical infrastruc-
ture service needs. As reflected in Figure 9, in-
vestment in water, sanitation and solid waste
infrastructure rose dramatically from 2003 to
2008, due in part to programs like SUKAP.
Programs supporting fiscally-constrained
municipalities with matching grant subsidies
helped dramatically expand water supply
and sanitation service coverage, particularly
over the past decade. These programs, taken

                 Box 3: A parametric analysis of the “metropolitan effect”
  In order to assess metropolitan effect, it is important to distinguish between firms located in proximity
  to a metropolitan municipality and those included within a metropolitan municipality administrative unit
  and benefitting from its regime advantages. Comparison of the average number of firms per district in
  metropolitan municipalities (260) and outside of metropolitan municipalities (29) shows that districts in
  metropolitan municipalities host almost 10 times more firms per district than non-metropolitan districts.
  This difference exists for population too, but metropolitan districts house on average only 5 times more
  inhabitants than non-metropolitan districts. Indeed, in a regression of the number of firms per district
  against the distance to the closest metropolitan core, proximity to a city center is statistically significant
  and it shows that, on average, districts have 0.85 less firms per km away from the city.
  There are 153 districts situated within 50km of a city center, but not included in the metropolitan city
  boundary. Regression analysis was carried out to test metropolitan effect by seeing whether distance to
  the city center can have a different effect inside and outside of the metropolitan municipality and test
  whether there is an extra-effect of being administratively part of a municipality. To do this, a variable
  representing the square of the distance to the center is included to allow for non-linear effects (such as
  suburbanization for example). The results indicate that distance to the closest metropolitan municipal-
  ity (as well as the square of that distance) does not matter at all for districts outside of the metropolitan
  municipality (the coefficients are not statistically different from 0), but there is a strong effect inside the
  metropolitan municipality and a significant non-linear component to it. Beyond these results, the most
  striking one is that the effect of being within the city limits not only persists (the coefficient is highly sig-
  nificant) after controlling for distance to the city center, but actually increases. Results from this regres-
  sion, presented in the following table, are used in the simulations.

                                        Box 4: Data and Level of Analysis
 Studies on localization and concentration of economic activity usually use data on real wages or produc-
 tivity. In the case of Turkey, computing real wages was not possible, as housing or transportation costs
 are very hard to derive. Similarly, city level data on productivity is not available. Different data sources
 are used in this study. First, population and education data come from the 2000 Census and the Address
 Based Population Registration System from TURKSTAT. Second, firm location, employment and branch of
 economic activity are obtained from the Union of Chambers and Economic Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB).
 This data consists of more than 60,000 observations representing all registered Turkish firms. It contains
 their economic activity, number of employees, employment classification, location, and, for most of
 them, their date of establishment. Therefore, the heart of the analysis is firm or job data.
 It is important to highlight that the firm level data contained in the dataset has been aggregated at the
 district level, when most previous work was done at the province level. Having access to a more granular
 level of data (there are 957 districts but only 81 provinces) allows for a more in-depth understanding of
 mechanisms and patterns of distribution of economic activity in Turkey, particularly at the city level. It is
 a significant contribution made by this report insofar as it allows for a deeper understanding of the dy-
 namics within and external to the metropolitan municipality regime. All of the first sixteen metropolitan
 municipalities are included within the scope of this report11 .

     Note: Using information on population and densities for over 1500 cities, local averages are estimated and depicted through the blue line. For any given
     population level the trend line indicates the average, or expected density. Cities above the trend line have densities above the international average for
     their population size, while cities below the line have densities below the international average.

        Box 5: Herfindahl-Hirschman Index - Measuring concentration of
                          construction firms in Turkey
 The Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) is a measure of industry concentration equal to the sum of the
 squared market shares of the firms in the industry. A commonly accepted measure of market concentra-
 tion. The HHI number can range from close to zero to 1 when shares are represented as fraction of the
 total equals 1. The HHI is expressed as:

                                   HHI = (s1)2 + (s2)2 +( s3)2 + ... +( sn)2
 Where, sn is the market share of the nth firm. The value of HHI tends to 1 as the market gets closer
 to monopoly.We construct the HHI to find out the concentration of construction firms in TOKI housing
 projects across metro municipalities in Turkey. The following table presents the Herfindahl-Hirschman
 index of construction firms across metro municipalities. We used each firm’s share in total (i) housing
 and (ii) worth across metropolitan municipalities separately. The sum of ‘squares of share of each con-
 tractor’ for each metro provides us the HHI/metro.
 As per the thumb rule that any value larger than 0.1 (10percent) indicates concentration, the follow-
 ing HHI across shows that construction companies are highly concentrated across cities other than the
 larger cities such as Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. Using a similar approach to find nationwide concentra-
 tion however, there does not appear to be evidence of concentration of the market in the hands of a
 few construction firms. The results suggest that construction companies are only locally (rather than
 nationally) concentrated in Turkey.

      Box 6: Highlights of the new Law on the Transformation of Areas at
                             Risk of Natural Hazards
 Under this new law, MOEU is authorized to give a lead time to the owners of buildings for them to de-
 termine whether their structures are considered risky or not. However, if such identification is not done
 within the lead-time given, it will be undertaken by the MOEU or municipalities and special provincial
 administrations. Owners of buildings will be able to file objections to such identification decisions within
 15 days. The owners of structures found to be risky will be given a minimum 60-day notice for the demoli-
 tion of these buildings. If the building is not demolished by the owner during such course of time, they
 will be notified that the building will be demolished by “administrative authorities”, and some additional
 time to vacate will be provided.
 Upon the request of the MOEU, the immovable properties allocated to public administrations in risky ar-
 eas owned by the Treasury and in reserve structure areas , including those covered by the Law on Military
 Prohibition Zones and Security Zones will be allocated to the MOEU through a Council of Ministers Decree
 in consultation with the Ministry of National Defense; those areas not allocated to public administrations
 will be allocated to MOEU or transferred to the Housing Development Administration (TOKI) or munici-
 palities.
 A key point stressed in this law is that both TOKI and the municipalities will be authorized to temporarily
 suspend all types of developments in risky areas, on immovable properties located on risky areas and in
 reserve structure areas. These immovable properties will not be sold, leased or allocated by the Ministry
 of Finance until the conclusion of transfer and allocation procedures.
 If requested by TOKI or municipalities, MOEU will not permit the provision of electricity, water and natural
 gas services for structures located on risky areas and risky structures, upon consulting right holders, and
 will stop provision of already provided services. Definition of regeneration areas will require an absolute
 majority of votes of all members of the provisional general of special provincial administrations and mu-
 nicipal council of municipalities. Decisions taken in respect of renovation areas will be submitted to the
 Council of Ministers through the proposal of MOEU.
 The law also amends the Decree-Law on the establishment of MOEU. The Law states MOEU will perform
 all survey, plan, design, cost calculation and construction works under its domain by creating a building
 supervision system, and will also perform the duties assigned thereto under the Building Supervision Law.
 MOEU will establish the principles and procedures to be followed by administrations in the rehabilitation,
 regeneration and transformation practices to be undertaken in urban and rural areas and settlements,
 including shanty houses, coastal areas and facilities, and areas excluded from forest areas and rangelands
 due to degradation.
 The MOEU will also carry out, outsource and approve surveys, maps, plans, subdivision plans and building
 designs of any scale, for special project areas that would enhance the brand value of cities and contribute
 to the improvement of cities, such as financial and commercial centers specified by the MOEU, fair and
 exhibition areas, recreational areas, and main gates of cities. MOEU will also conduct all these activities
 for any project under the Shanty settlement Law, as well as issue building occupancy permits and ensure
 establishment of apartment condominium rights in these areas. MOEU will facilitate expropriation, li-
 censing and construction processes, issue building occupancy permits and ensure the establishment of
 apartment condominium rights in these areas.

    Box 8. Other countries are thinking about urban transformation and
                              risk prevention
 Disasters are an increasing concern in developing countries. Between 1970 and 2010, disasters related to
 natural phenomena have caused more than 3.3 million deaths and US$2.3 trillion worth of material losses
 worldwide —slightly more than Brazil’s GDP in 2010.
 Colombia has not been immune to this. In the last forty years, the country has been hit by disasters, caus-
 ing US$7.1 billion in losses. The consequences of the La Niña phenomenon in 2010 and 2011 —heavy
 rains and floods throughout the country— reflect the complexity of the risk situation prevalent in Colom-
 bia and the deficiencies in terms of risk management. This is evident in the following figures: 3.5 million
 victims, 8 thousand homes destroyed and more than one million hectares of agricultural land affected.
 A Comprehensive Vision
 Colombia has positioned itself as a Latin American leader in terms of developing a more comprehensive
 vision with regards Disaster Risk Management. The government strategy seeks to reduce damages and
 losses, paying particular attention to prevention and risk-reduction efforts, as well as controlling the fiscal
 volatility —the impact on public finances— resulting from these events.
 Efforts towards disaster risk management started in Colombia with the formulation of the National Plan
 for Prevention and Relief in 1989 (following the devastating Popayan earthquake of 1983). Further, the
 last four National Development Plans (1998 to 2014) have included DRM as an important topic. Efforts
 have also been made on improving the monitoring of natural hazards, the enforcement of building codes
 (since 1984), and organizing local disaster response capacity.
 The work undertaken in Colombia has resulted in a relative drop in loss of life; however, damage to prop-
 erty, infrastructure and livelihoods continues to increase, proving that disasters are not natural events
 per se, but rather the result of inappropriate development models. This means that efforts have not been
 sufficiently effective due to increasing vulnerability. This has led to a success in reducing the loss of lives.
 However, the damages and losses to property and livelihoods due to natural hazards are still growing ev-
 ery year. The dramatic increase in the number of disaster-related damages reported in Colombia over the
 past decade is not due to a change in the hazard patterns. It is a result of inadequate land use planning
 and urban population growth.
 Since 1997, Colombia has put its efforts in this direction by giving priority to strengthening the incorpora-
 tion of DRM into municipal land use plans (POTs) and developing associated risk management strategies.
 This process has advanced rapidly in some larger cities, which are among the leaders in DRM in Latin
 America. However, approximately 95percent (1,050) of Colombian municipalities have had significant dif-
 ficulties in making any progress on disaster risk management due to low technical capacities and a lack of
 investment. The World Bank and GFDRR are supporting a technical assistance processes using an open-
 source risk assessment platform to integrate probabilistic risk modeling into specific policy-making pro-
 cesses. This is done through the Probabilistic Risk Assessment Initiative (CAPRA) first developed in Central
 America is now being implemented in Colombia among other South American countries. CAPRA provides
 a risk calculation platform that integrates exposure databases and physical vulnerability functions under
 a probabilistic approach. CAPRA uses a multi-hazard risk approach to evaluate risks in terms of physical
 damages and estimates direct economic and human loses.

                           Box 9. Updating the Cadaster in Bogotá, Colombia
      Bogotá has been considered a pioneer in land valuation in many ways. Between 2008 and 2010, the city
      successfully updated its cadastral database, revaluing the 2.1 million urban properties in the city. This
      updating process implied a 30percent increase in property tax revenue and 171 million dollars of addi-
      tional revenue in FY2009 and FY2010 (Ruiz and Vallejo, 2011). Uribe (2010) summarizes the key elements
      behind the successful update of cadastral values as follows: improved management of human resources,
      introduction of information technologies, mitigation of the project’s impact on the property tax, engage-
      ment of stakeholders and career civil servants, openness to review the project’s results, and improved
      massive assessment techniques.
      Improvements to the massive assessment techniques included incorporating the use of spatial informa-
      tion collected using GIS systems into the econometric techniques used for the estimation of property
      values. Distance to key sites and amenities were used as important determinants in the estimation of
      property values. Given that no market information was available for the city, initial price data used in this
      process was collected using a team of expert appraisers that applied a combination of market, cost, and
      income valuation approaches to arrive at the best possible appraisal value. Further, close interaction be-
      tween assessors and econometric modeling teams, helped ensure that sensible values were obtained for
      all areas of the city. Today, this data is made available for research purposes under confidentiality agree-
      ments. The information collected is also shared among government institution to enhance the quality of
      the planning process across different agencies and sectors.
      Because there was a considerable lag in the cadastral values, a significant increase in the base for prop-
      erty taxes was expected after the updating process was completed. To maintain the progressiveness of
      property taxes and minimize resistance from property owners the city put forward a new legislation to
      introduce an increase ceiling on property tax. Under the assumption that property values are strongly cor-
      related to ability to pay, the maximum increase in property tax was set to augment proportionally to the
      logarithm of the property’s value (differentiated ceilings were also set for residential and non-residential
      uses). These ceilings partially separated the property value from the increase in taxes and gave property
      owners additional certainty on the tax increase (Ruiz and Vallejo, 2011).

  Box 10. Finland - clear and transparent institutions for land valuation
 The land registry and cadaster information of Finland is recorded by the National Land Survey of Finland
 (NLS). The Institution with the headquarters situated in the capital city of Helsinki, conducts similar tasks
 to those of the General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadaster in Turkey. 12 regional units and 35 local
 offices throughout the country are affiliated with the General Directorate.
 Real estate information in Finland is recorded using a GIS enabling system called “JAKO System” which
 bears resemblances to Turkey’s Land Registry and Cadaster Information System (TAKBIS) and Cadaster
 Data Consolidation (KVK). However, as opposed to TAKBIS, all real estate information is available on the
 internet for public access.
 Public availability of regularly collected and standardized data enables systematic and accurate valua-
 tions. In fact, mass valuations are conducted every five years by the Finland Technical Research Center
 and used for taxation purposes. Private valuation companies are left out for public valuation processes
 where the land registry and cadaster organization plays a key role. But there are situations where the
 companies are asked for their opinions and studies when necessary. The valuation companies carry out
 the valuation studies in accordance with International Valuation Standards and RICS Valuation Standards.

     tries (Ruprah and Marcano, 2007). One of the
     key points highlighted by this evaluation is
     the fact that as cheap land for public housing
     became scarce, public housing started being
     built in isolated areas. Public housing projects
     moved farther away from the city center and
     resulted in residential segregation (Sabatini
     2001, 2003). Seeking lower costs, both gov-
     ernment and private sector provided solutions
     that are only in areas disconnected from the
     city center and where in many cases, the poor
     were already located. As a result of the hous-
     ing programs the poor have been segregated
     to the periphery of the city and are now facing
     reduced income opportunities. Other studies
     have also confirmed that housing subsidies led
     to residential segregation in Santiago (Vargas,
     2006).

          Box 11. Evaluating health costs of air pollution and road accidents
      For both air pollution and traffic accidents, expressing the impacts in monetary terms requires some
      evaluation of both morbidity and mortality impacts. Morbidity effects are usually addressed by separately
      evaluating (1) the value of the work time lost due to the illness; (2) the medical costs of treating the ill-
      ness; (3) the amount the sufferer would pay to avoid the pain and suffering associated with the illness;
      and (4) the value of the leisure time lost due to the illness. Lost work time is valued at the wage rate and
      medical costs are imputed based on the full social costs of providing the care. The cost of pain and suffer-
      ing avoided and the value of leisure time gained are usually estimated by contingent valuation method
      (CVM) or stated preference methods. Mortality effects are usually addressed through the calculation of
      a value of a statistical life through willingness to pay or stated preference studies. This issue was specifi-
      cally addressed for the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) by Miller (2000) He found that the VSL averages at
      least 120 times the per capita income of the country and that income elasticity of the VSL varied between
      0.85 and 1.00 in country level regressions, so that income level adjusted values can be obtained for any
      particular country.

 	 •	 Promote and coordinate the national strategy to prepare, analyze and implement transport
 		 master plans at the metropolitan and municipal levels.
 	   •	 Manage the Federal Government’s shareholding interests in companies linked to urban transport
 	 •	 Manage the Urban Transport Development Fund (which was defined by the Law that
 		 established EBTU)
 	 •	 Issue opinions on the priority and the technical and economic feasibility of proposed
 		 urban transport projects
 	 •	 Assist in implementing a national urban transport planning process. Aim for compatibility
 		 between the metropolitan and local transport policies with integrated development planning of
 		 metropolitan regions, as well as National Transport and Urban Development policies.
 	   •	 Promote and carry out the development of urban transport technology.
 EBTU was then abolished in 1991, when it was viewed that the capacity of municipalities has improved to
 the level at which active federal leadership was no longer necessary.

     Box 13: Leveraging Private Sector Participation for Municipal Solid
                              Waste Services
 ITC-Ankara was established in 2002 as a branch office of a Swiss originating company -- Invest Trading and Con-
 sulting AG – which specializes in construction of infrastructure and superstructure projects, including recycling
 plants. Its ability to bring financing, assume commercial risk, and apply innovative solutions to landfill manage-
 ment provided a perfect opportunity for Ankara Metropolitan Municipality to partner with this private sector
 firm in addressing its solid waste disposal needs with a growing urban population now exceeding 4.5 million.
 Structured as a 49 year concession, Ankara’s partnership with ITC was initiated through a competitive selection
 process. ITC was selected as the preferred bidder to redevelop the Mamak landfill starting in 2005 with a com-
 mitment to realize a total investment by the private operator of US$260 million in return for operating rights.
 A classic win-win initiative, the partnership features multiple benefits for Ankara’s residents, the municipality,
 the private sector concessionaire and the environment. For residents, sanitary conditions and land values in the
 vicinity of landfill have substantially improved in the years since the private sector operator took over. The pic-
 ture below shows the plant operating across the street from a high-end shopping mall with IKEA as the anchor
 tenant, and the landfill provides hot water and heating for the mall through the biogas operation. Through
 the project, the municipality was able to shift the initial US$29 million and all subsequent capital investment
 costs to ITC. It also saved on the landfill operating costs and tipping fees. For the operator, the project offered
 the opportunity to earn a profit while entering a market in which it now has operations in seven Turkish cities
 (see map below).
 The partnership also had substantial co-benefits for the environment. Methane gas, which is generated by the
 decomposition of solid waste, is 25 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. The facility
 design features a methane gas capture technology that dramatically reduces methane gas emissions. The facil-
 ity then harnesses this gas to produce electricity, generating revenue streams for the firm, while providing an
 alternative renewable energy source for Turkey, an energy dependent country. The anaerobic digestion system
 processes organic waste to compost in addition to generating methane gas. The energy plant linked to the
 operation generates 135 million kWh of renewable energy annually with total installed power of 25.4 MW. The
 facility also features a waste sorting plant to recycle plastic, glass and other materials.

            Note on the new Metropolitan Municipality Law (#6360)
 After the most recent local elections in Turkey, which took place in March 2014, an extended system of
 metropolitan governance was put into effect. The main objective of Act No. 6360 was to improve public
 service quality at the local level by expanding the number and geographical coverage of metropolitan
 municipality administrative area to the provincial boundaries. The Act was intended to take advantage
 of economies of scale and to increase efficiency of service provision. The Law increased the number of
 metropolitan municipalities from 16 to 30, expanding total population served by the 30 metropolitan mu-
 nicipalities from 34.8 million to 57.2 million citizens. In terms of spatial coverage, the Law increased the
 metropolitan municipality service coverage area to 395,000 square kilometers, approximately 51 percent
 of Turkey’s land area. The Law eliminated the need for Special Provincial Administrations in the 30 met-
 ropolitan municipalities, and eliminated 16,500 village administrations within the 30 provinces, as well as
 some 1,000 municipalities across the country that had populations of less than 2,000.
 The expansion of metropolitan municipality boundaries to the provincial limit was based on prior ob-
 served efficient delivery of services in Istanbul and Kocaeli, both of which feature built urban form that
 extends to the provincial boundaries. However, the new metropolitan municipality law extends this pro-
 vision to some provinces that have a very different built environment, such as Konya, Sanliurfa, Ankara
 and Erzurum, where extensive rural areas are now incorporated into the metropolitan municipality ad-
 ministrative area. Going forward, there will likely be risks associated with this new configuration that
 should be carefully monitored, such as the need to prepare differentiated service standards within the
 metropolitan municipality area in accordance with land use function, density, urban/rural character, etc.,
 as the cost of applying a dense urban area service standard to a rural area within the new Metropolitan
 Municipality jurisdiction would be uneconomic and in appropriate. This definition of differentiated ser-
 vice standards should be addressed at the policy level in order to ensure that the policy framework is clear
 for city-specific planning. A further question that arises is whether procedures have or will be altered in
 converting rural to urban land as cities grow over time. Where such an issue might have involved mul-
 tiple agencies in reviewing and confirming the appropriateness of such conversion in the past, there is
 less clarity with both urban and rural lands now under a single metropolitan municipality regime. Here
 again, city-specific planning will take on greater importance so that master development plans can resolve
 land conversion issues a priori in a coordinated manner rather than incrementally, as has been the case
 in Turkey from many years.

                  Box A1 Cluster Analysis using Population and Density of Cities
       Cluster analysis is one of the many multivariate techniques that is used to classify observations into
       natural underlying groups. The goal of the clustering is to have observations in the same cluster be
       more alike than observations in other clusters. Unlike other types of multivariate analysis, e.g., factor
       analysis that works on variables, cluster analysis works on observations, finding underlying factors that
       each subset of variables appear to have in common.
       We cluster more than 1500 cities across different countries including 13 Turkish cities. We used popula-
       tion size and density of each city as the selection criteria. Table C2 presents the clusters with Turkish
       cities and similar cities around the world. Between two iterative algorithms— Kmeans and Kmedian
       (based on mean and median), we used “Kmedians” for our clustering analysis. The algorithm is an itera-
       tive procedure that partitions the data into k groups or clusters. We used 10,000 iteration with initial
       seed as 999.
       One drawback of the k-means/median approach, however, is that the number of groups is specified in
       advance, rather than let the procedure find the optimal number of groups. Cluster-analysis stopping
       rules are used to determine the optimal number of clusters. A stopping-rule value (also called an index)
       is computed for each cluster solution. Larger values indicate more distinct clustering. Between two
       stopping rules, (i) the Calinski and Harabasz (C&H, 1974) pseudo-F index and (ii) the Duda and Hart
       (D&H, 1973) index, we used the former one because the latter one goes with hierarchical data. Given
       this rule, we find that going with 200 groups is optimal for our analysis.

 Box A2: Granger causality to test the lagged response of housing start
                      to housing need in Turkey
Granger causality tests are most useful in situations where one is willing to consider two-dimensional sys-
tems. If the data are reasonably well described by a two-dimensional system then the Granger causality
concept is most straightforward to think about and also to test.
“Granger causality” tests are statistical tests of “causality” in the sense of determining whether lagged
observations of one variable have incremental forecasting power when added to a univariate autoregres-
sive representation of another variable. A variable, xt, is said to Granger cause another variable, say, yt
in period t if the variance of the optimal linear predictor of yt+h , based on a certain information set, has
smaller variance than the optimal linear predictor of yt+h for any h. The test itself is just an F-test (or, as
above, a chi-squared test) of the joint significance of the other variable(s) in a regression that includes
lags of the dependent variable.
The first step for a Granger causality is to use a vector auto regressive (VAR)-model with stationary data.
We used a series of unit-root test, such as the Dickey Fuller test and the Philips Perron test with second
difference operator, to test unit root. With first difference operator we did not find stationerity in the data
so we used second difference operator. Dickey Fuller performs the augmented Dickey-Fuller test that a
variable follows a unit-root process. The null hypothesis is that the variable contains a unit root, and the
alternative is that the variable was generated by a stationary process. The Phillips–Perron test (named
after Peter C. B. Phillips and Pierre Perron) is also a unit root test. That is, it is used in time series analysis
to test the null hypothesis that a time series is integrated of order 1. It builds on the Dickey–Fuller test of
the null hypothesis in D1 (D2), where D1 (D2) is the first (second) difference operator. Like the augment-
ed Dickey–Fuller test, the Phillips–Perron test addresses the issue that the process generating data that
might have a higher order of autocorrelation than is admitted in the test equation - making endogenous
and thus invalidating the Dickey–Fuller t-test. While the augmented Dickey–Fuller test addresses this
issue by introducing lags of h as regressors in the test equation, the Phillips–Perron test makes a non-
parametric correction to the t-test statistic. The test is robust with respect to unspecified autocorrelation
and heteroscedasticity in the disturbance process of the test equation. We also used Schwert’s rule of
thumb to start with 15 lags to find out proper lag length. A Wald test in VAR model is commonly used to
test for Granger causality. The null hypothesis in a Wald test assumes that –“H0: the coefficients on the
lags of the predetermined variable (in the “excluded” column) are zero’ in the equation for (variable in
the “equation” column). For example, the small p-value (in 9th row and beyond in the last column) is evi-
dence that the coefficients on the lags of housing need are not jointly zero in the equation for log permit
with 9 to 15 years lags, indicating that the evidence favors the alternative hypothesis that ‘housing need’
Granger causes housing permits with at least 9 years lags.
