What does this mean for disaster and climate risk
management?
The WDR 2012 defines gender as                                           Figure 1. Conceptual Framework
the social, behavioral and cultural
attributes, expectations, and norms
associated with being male or
female. The conceptual framework
for analyzing gender focuses on
three domains of gender equality:
endowments, particularly health,
education, and social protection;
economic opportunity, defined as
participation in economic activities
and access to productive assets; and
voice and agency, understood as
freedom from violence, and the ability
to participate in decision-making
and influence political processes and
governance mechanisms.

This note outlines a proposed monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) approach to
track the progress of implementation
of GFDRR’s Gender Action Plan (GAP).
The GAP was discussed and endorsed
at the 17th Consultative Group Meeting
held in Washington DC on April 27-28,
2016. It seeks to ensure that Disaster
Risk Management (DRM) investments
go beyond limited “gender screening”

Theory of Change
The GAP M&E approach is based upon the following longer-term theory of change:




                              Gender & DRM awareness and capacity of GFDRR is built, while GFDRR
                              simultaneously invests in initiatives to demonstrate the key role of gender equality
                              and women’s empowerment in strengthening community resilience.



                              GFDRR plays facilitation role and creates an enabling environment for integration of
                              gender equality and women’s empowerment into investments




                              Gender & DRM capacity and commitment of communities, governments and other
                              grant recipients is built
