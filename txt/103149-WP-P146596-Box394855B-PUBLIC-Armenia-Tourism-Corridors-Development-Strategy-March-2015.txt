A. Executive Summary
Travel and tourism is an important key for accelerating and expanding economic development,
investment and employment in Armenia with visitor numbers increasing year-on-year, growing
private and public investment, and broad consumer satisfaction. The Government of Armenia
(GoA) is keen to leverage this growth to increase overall spending per visitor, attract greater
numbers of visitors, and secure meaningful local economic development in the regions. The
GoA has committed to a path of responsible tourism development and is especially committed
to ensuring that the benefits of tourism are sustained and maximized to develop and protect the
country’s natural and cultural heritage.


    Responsible Tourism
    Responsible tourism seeks to maximize the positive impacts of tourism and minimize
    negative ones. It combines the sustainable and responsible tourism approaches of multiple
    organizations, including the UNWTO, World Travel & Tourism Council and the Earth Council.
    In following this approach, tourism development can be pursued according to a triple
    bottom line of maximizing social, economic and environmental benefits, thus always with
    the objective of ‘creating better places for people to live in, and better places for people to
    visit.’ (Cape Town Declaration, 2002). This approach is directly in-line with global demand
    trends and the main market segment that the Government is keen to target.

Furthermore, according to Armenia’s National Development Strategy 2014-2025, tourism is one
of five priority sectors for job creation. The strategy indicates that incoming tourism should retain
its role as the second main export sector and will account for around 20 percent of exports. It is
estimated that the number of directly tourism‐related jobs will increase and account for 3.3
percent of non‐agricultural jobs by 2025.
This report focuses on the South Corridor, which has the natural and cultural assets to help
drive growth in the sector, particularly at the local economic level. Since 2011, extensive
analysis has been conducted for this Corridor by the USAID EDMC and CAPS projects, AECOM for
the National Competitiveness Foundation of Armenia and the Armenian Monuments Awareness
Project. Their work provided important references for this report and many of their
recommendations are included. The Government has identified the Southern Corridor as a key
development area to spur economic growth through diversification of tourism product offers.
In early October 2014, the GoA committed to establishing a new Development Foundation of
Armenia. A Development Foundation of Armenia is urgently needed in order to move forward
with full implementation of strategies both at the national and South Corridor levels.
Given the cultural and nature-based tourism attractions along the South Corridor, the main
strategic recommendation of this strategy is to strengthen the cultural and nature-based
tourism value chain through actions to improve or build on each of the critical value
components of infrastructure, products and marketing, human resources and investment.

                  Armenia: South Corridor Tourism Development Strategy




These actions should be undertaken through work with tour operators, government agencies
at the national, marz and municipal levels and investors.
Figure 1: Map of South Corridor




1. Methodology & Structure of the Strategy
Both value chain and SWOT analysis have been used to analyze the tourism assets of the Corridor.
A hub and spoke approach has been used in which three sets of hub destinations would be a
central and/or overnight stop and short excursions could be conducted from the hub to spoke
destinations. Visitor and tourism supplier data for the South Corridor, however, is almost
completely lacking, thus limiting the extent to which the analysis could be conducted. In
addition, given that a national tourism organization was just launched and no local level
organizations exist for tourism development marketing, this strategy has emphasized
institutional capacity building for development and implementation.

    ChallengesVisionObjectivesValue Chain Components AnalysisActions based on
    components

In this strategy, the challenges and performance targets for overcoming the challenges, and a
strategic vision and objectives are specified. Then, global and Armenian tourism trends are
presented followed by the value chain analysis and detailed review of each main “value chain
link.”
The strategy is structured based on the following key topics and value chain “links.” The final
chapter lays out the strategic direction for tourism development in the South Corridor, together
with a proposed action plan.
Note: The following are not in order of priority. All areas are important and interdependent.

2. Key Challenges & Targets
One of the main challenges for Armenian tourism is that while international arrivals have been
increasing dramatically – more than tripling from 319,000 in 2005 to 957,000 in 20131, average
receipts earned per visitor have steadily declined from US$699 per visitor in 2005 to US$479
per visitor in 2013.2 This could mean that visitors are not finding additional opportunities for
spending -- activities, experiences and souvenir items.
The decline does not tell the whole story though since selected groups of visitors, such as
Russians, French, Germans, Polish and Americans spend comparatively more in Armenia than
other nationalities.3 To ensure that overall spending per visitor increases, and that the benefits
of tourism are sustained and maximized as a way to develop and protect the country’s natural
and cultural heritage, the Government and industry have launched a new strategic planning and
development process for responsible tourism with the cooperation of the World Bank, USAID,
the Asian Development Bank, IDEA Foundation and other stakeholders. The process, which is

proposed as a Regional Development Program, focuses on responsible tourism as a catalyst for
broad economic development, especially in selected regional corridors.
For the South Corridor, the below challenges and targets could be addressed and achieved
through the below mentioned vision, objectives, and actions to leverage the strengths and
opportunities and overcome the weaknesses and threats to the various value chain components
of Armenian tourism. However, given the lack of visitor and Corridor destination data, these
targets are only estimates.

The underlying vision of the South Corridor tourism development is to establish a new
responsible tourism destination that offers rich, authentic cultural and nature-based Armenian
experiences by 2025.

4. Objectives of Corridor Tourism Development
As emphasized in the Government’s National Development Strategy (2014-2025), it is a priority
objective of the Government to “ensure quality economic growth” for “balanced development
of the regions.”7 Development of the South Corridor intends to increase tourism arrivals and
spending along this route and thus stimulate more business and employment growth, and
protect cultural and natural heritage.
The tourism objectives stimulated by South Corridor growth, which are in line with Armenia’s
National Development Strategy, are:
1) Grow responsible higher spending tourism arrivals from approximately 957,240 in 2013 to 2.7
million and employing 28,300 by 20258 for the entire country with at least 10 percent visiting
the SC each year (270,000) and 21509 jobs resulting from SC growth.
2) Diversify tourism product/experience offers that attract increased international tour operators
and independent travelers resulting in increased value for money, local jobs, improvement in
skills, and SME opportunities in SC destinations with at least 10 new operators adding at least
120 tours that go as far as Areni/Noravank on day trips and Goris/Tatev for overnight trips from
2016 to 2025.
3) Increase overnights and thus spending from targeted segments of international and domestic
tourists with at least 10 percent growth by 2025 due to SC growth, thus an average of 84,300
more room nights and US$4.6 mn in spending each year above the 2012 national total of 8.4 mn
room nights and US$460 mn in tourism receipts (spending in Armenia).
4) Increase “incoming tourism expenses” (spending) from US$513 mn in 2011 to US$2.4 bn in
2025.10

5. Market Demand Analysis
This strategy reviewed the demand of international and domestic visitors – at the national and,
to the extent possible, corridor level. The Ministry of Economy, which is the main government
entity collecting tourism statistics, does not collect visitor data for the South Corridor, which
restricts the analysis.

5a. Visitors to Armenia and the South Corridor
5a1. International Visitors
International tourist arrivals have been growing steadily in Armenia well above the world
average. From 2010 to 2013, the number of international tourists increased from 687,000 to
957,000, increases of more than 10% each year – more than double the average global tourism
growth rate of 4%. Similarly impressive growth occurred with international tourist receipts more
than doubling from US$220 mn in 2005 to US$408 mn in 2010, but then slowed in the following
years. With the decline in receipts, the spending per visitor also declined.
Based on UNWTO’s 2012 statistics for Armenia – the most recent available via UNWTO -- the top
generating markets, accounting for approximately 71% of total international arrivals, include CIS
(41.5%), Iran (18.4%), USA (8.2%), Argentina (3%), France (3%), Lebanon (3%), Germany (2.7%),
Greece (1.5%), UK and Italy (1%). Of these visitors, 287,000, thus 34%, came through organized
tours.11 Note: UNWTO includes Georgia and Ukraine arrivals as part of the CIS total.
For the South Corridor, the Ministry of Economy provided the World Bank team with visitor
statistics based on an “International Tourism Survey” conducted in 2013 for the Syunik Marz. Also
in 2013, the USAID EDMC project conducted a visitor survey for all of Armenia. Both surveys focus
on percentages of total visitors, but for EDMC, these would be percentages of the total number
of visitors surveyed, which were 23,658 with a “valid tourist sample size” of 10,448.12 The sample
error and validity rates were not reported though. For the MOE survey, no sample size was
reported with the data. Consequently, visitor totals for the South Corridor are unclear.
Of the total visitors surveyed by EDMC, they reported that 4.6% visited Vayots Dzor, 5.3% visited
Syunik and 5.8% visited Ararat, which amounted to 1088, 1253 and 1372. And also among the
total surveyed, the main source markets were Russia (41.6%), Georgia (33.7%), Iran (6.6%),
Ukraine (2.4%), Germany (1.6%) and the USA (1.4%).
When the data is available, one indicator that might provide further insight into the number of
visitors along the South Corridor is the increase in the number of new hotels and beds over the
past years. From the total number of available bed-nights and available occupancy rates, the total
numbers of overnight visitors could be extrapolated. However, this data was unavailable from
the Ministry of Economy.13

5a2. Domestic Visitors
In their 2011 Armenia South Corridor Tourism Strategy, AECOM reported an estimated 450,000
domestic overnight tourist visits in 2009-2010, much of which would be generated from
Yerevan.14 In part, AECOM explained, this estimate was derived from the Tourism Development
Concept Paper developed by the USAID CAPS Project and adopted by the Government in
February 2008.15
In the Tourism Development Concept Paper, the number of “internal” (domestic) tourism visits
was estimated at 308,000 for 2006, growing to 500,000 by 2010, 1 million by 2020 and 1.5 million
by 2030.16
To estimate the number of domestic visitors for the South Corridor, AECOM referred to a 2007
Tourist Visitor Survey17, which “assumed that 15 percent of [all] tourist arrivals visit the South
Corridor” and that by 2030 this rate would increase to 20 percent. 18 Based on this, AECOM
forecast approximately 900,000 tourists by 2030 for the South Corridor with 300,000 generated
by domestic tourists.19 More precise data is needed for the South Corridor; the accuracy of this
estimate is unknown.

5b. International and Armenian Tour Operator Surveys
Armenian tour operators are important to the success and further development of the sector.
The World Bank tourism team conducted primary data collection consisting of a survey
conducted in September-October 2014, three workshops with tour operators and a review of the
circuits of more than 50 Armenian operators. (See: Table 8) The survey was sent to 85 operators;
17 responded. For most of them, Russia was a principal source market and all marzes were
popular destinations, including the marzes of the South Corridor. They reported that their best-
selling circuits were South Corridor destinations: 1. Yerevan-Khor Virap-Noravank-Tatev and 2.
Yerevan-Garni-Geghard. The operators also reported that Tatev was the most popular attraction
for their clients.
To reinforce what was mentioned above, the operators indicated that the most appealing
aspects of visiting Armenia for their clients were hospitality, food, nature, cultural heritage and
quality of service. And the least appealing aspects and main sources of complaints were the
road conditions, poor visitor infrastructure, lack and poor state of toilets, lack of information
centers and signage/panels, abundant waste both on sites and roads in general. The operators
also considered a decrease of airfares and improvements in human resources, education and
training as high priorities.

The AECOM Corridor study also projected purposes of travel among South Corridor domestic and
international arrivals, again based on the 2007 Tourist Visitor Survey, for 2015, 2020 and 2030.
For international visitors, holidays and leisure would continually be the dominant purpose of visit
for 45 percent of visitors followed by 28 percent for visits with friends and relatives (VFR), 7
percent each for health and wellness and business/conferences. For domestic arrivals, the
purposes of visit differed significantly from international visitors. Their purpose of visit would be
continually dominated by VFR at 64 percent for 2015, 60 percent for 2020 and then declining to
56 percent by 2030.
According to the USAID EDMC 2013 International Visitor Survey, of the visitors surveyed, the
Russian market alone accounted for 46.3 percent of all international arrivals, followed by Georgia
at 27 percent, Iran seven percent, Ukraine 2.4 percent, Germany two percent, which means that
84 percent of 2013 arrivals came from just five markets. 20 Among all international arrivals,
“Diaspora” visitors, thus those with Armenian ancestry, comprised 66 percent.
Average length of stay is 17.4 days, but the average varies from 6.2 days for a hotel stay vs 39
days for rented apartment, 12. 5 days in a B&B and 20 days with friends and relatives.21
Data is not known specifically for the corridor.

6. Summary of the Strengths and Weaknesses of the South Corridor
Armenia offers an attractive range of cultural and nature-based attractions on the South Corridor,
as well as the unique built attraction of the Tatev Tramway. These attractions have stimulated
tourism demand – as shown by an increased number of hotels and tramway ticket sales.
However, due to serious institutional weaknesses – a lack of national and corridor level
organizations that collect visitor and industry supplier data, facilitate development and conduct
marketing – it is difficult for Government to fully develop and implement the necessary plans for
the South Corridor to leverage the Corridor’s strengths and address the weaknesses.

   According to the 2011 AECOM Report on the Southern Corridor, the Corridor received approximately 500,000
domestic visitors and 600,000 international visitors. This data, in turn, was extrapolated from estimates in the
2008 Tourism Development Concept Paper.

                   Armenia: South Corridor Tourism Development Strategy




7. Tourism Product Offers
The South Corridor offers extensive cultural and nature-based experiences that include national
parks and protected areas, a UNESCO World Heritage Site (Geghard Monastery), three properties
on the UNESCO Tentative List (Dvin, Noravank, and Tatev), archaeological sites (i.e. Karahunge),
and wine tourism opportunities (Areni), among many others. Many of these assets, particularly
along the South Corridor, lack the necessary infrastructure to receive visitors.
Based on the analysis and past donor reports, discussions with stakeholders and site visits, the
report team concludes that three sets of hub and spoke destinations are priorities for
development and/or improvements with the fourth set – ending in Meghri – the lowest priority
due to poor access and a lack of accommodations.
All of the destinations listed below require similar interventions of varying degrees – site
management plans with the architectural design of a tourism facility (visitor and information
center) that includes the establishment of or improvement of public parking, public toilets,
souvenir areas, and/or a café/restaurant area.
The first two sets – Yerevan and Areni – are feasible in day trips from Yerevan, which are offered
by multiple Yerevan-based tour operators. The third set – Goris – is also feasible in a day trip
from Yerevan, but operators appear to offer it only as part of an overnight circuit and itinerary.
The fourth set – Meghri -- At this point, given the poor road conditions, the three-four hour travel
time between Goris and Meghri, and lack of accommodations in Meghri, this fourth set of the
Corridor has not yet generated interest among the 50+ Armenian tour operators reviewed for
this report.

7a.1 Spoke Destinations from Yerevan
The first part of the South Corridor is comprised of destinations that are easily accessible for day
visits from Yerevan:
       o Currently popular destinations
            o Khor Virap Monastery – One of the most popular tourist destinations, this
                 appears on many tour operators’ circuits.
            o Garni and Geghard are already well established cultural heritage sites and
                 considered “must-sees” by tour operators.
       o Less visited destinations
            o Dvin -- Archeological site of Dvin town.
            o Khosrov Reserve – A protected area comprised of desert/semi-desert,
                 mountain steppe, woodlands, and alpine meadows.

7a.2 Areni Hub Destination and Spokes
The second hub destination is Areni with spoke destinations of Noravank Monastery,
Yeghegnadzor, Yeghegis and Jermuk:
       o Currently popular destinations
            o Areni 1 Cave (Bird Cave) – restricted visits

17
                   Armenia: South Corridor Tourism Development Strategy




                o Areni Community, including the wineries and vineyards .
             o Noravank Monastery
             o Yeghegis -- Known for recent archaeological discoveries of a medieval Jewish
                  community that once resided there.
        o Less visited destinations (especially for tour operators)
                o Mozrov Cave – not open for visitors yet.
                o Jermuk
                o Yeghegnadzor town

7a.3 Goris Hub Destination and Spokes
The Goris Hub offers multiple sites and attractions, some of which can be experienced in a day
trip from Yerevan, but a very long day. Overnight stops for Corridor visits are usually in Goris.
Key destinations are:
    Currently popular destinations
        o Karahunge – Ancient archaeological site.
        o Hin Khndzoresk -- Historical site of cave dwellings.
        o Goris -- Known for the unique architecture of its houses and tall cone-like rock
             formations.
        o Tatev -- The Tatev Monastery is considered jewel of medieval Armenian
             architecture. And the “Wings of Tatev” cableway – the longest reversible aerial
             tramway in the world --connects the monastery to Halidzor village. Plans to develop
             nearby villages were also created by the Tatev Foundation.
    Less visited destinations
        o Sisian – Access to Karahunge – the Stonehenge of Armenia and the less accessible
             site of Ughtasar where there is an ancient Petroglyph Field.
        o Shaki Waterfall – A legendary 18 meter waterfall three kms northwest of Sisian.

7a.4 Meghri Hub Destination and Spokes
Meghri is 154 kms and requires three to four hours from Goris along an unimproved road,
which limits access for visitors, especially tour groups. In addition, there are no hotels in
Meghri. For Meghri to be marketable, the road between Goris and Meghri would have to be
improved and more accommodations developed.

7b. Opportunities
Addressing the above issues, especially the infrastructure and human resource constraints, will
help unlock product opportunities for investors, entrepreneurs, tour operators and visitors.
These include:
    Events
        o International sporting events perhaps competitions such as for mountain biking,
            running marathons, and bicycle races.
        o Cultural events related to wine and agriculture, similar to the Areni Wine Festival.

18
                   Armenia: South Corridor Tourism Development Strategy




    Experiences
        o Agro-tourism and culinary experience based on local products; linking nature and
            culture products.
        o Expanded adventure travel, such as hiking and trekking.
    Accommodations
        o More international class accommodations to attract more overnights from tour
            operators.

8. Tourism Infrastructure
Infrastructure is the foundation of the tourism value chain, thus of all tourism development
initiatives, especially well-paved roads, signage and visitor facilities such as clean public toilets.
The South Corridor lacks both, which constrains the expansion of tourism offers, especially by
tour operators. In the World Bank survey of Armenian tour operators, these infrastructure
concerns were cited as some of the main constraints to offering more of the South Corridor.

9. Human Resources/Workforce Development
An essential link in the tourism value chain for Armenia is human resources and workforce
development. Without the necessary trained human resources, it is difficult, if not impossible, to
develop tourism along the South Corridor. The absence of hospitality education and training
programs in the towns of the South Corridor is a constraint. The IDeA Foundation is launching
capacity building initiatives in the Tatev area, which could be models for replication.

10. Private Investment and Public-Private Dialogue (PPD)
According to UNWTO, the number of accommodation facilities in Armenia has increased
dramatically in only six years from 792 to 1,405 hotels and similar establishments (UNWTO
Compendium of Tourism Statistics 2007-2011 and 2008-2012), a positive indicator for private
tourism investment in Armenia. Within the corridor, as of 2013, there were 50 local
accommodation establishments, thus 3.5 percent of total accommodations in the country.
One of the largest recent investments was the “Wings of Tatev” tramway and Tatev Revival
Project – a US$22mn investment, which is a public-private partnership that is being implemented
by the National Competitiveness Foundation (and in 2015 by its successor). The Tatev Revival
Project is also intended to have a broader impact on the region by further developing tourism
attractions in the surrounding villages.

11. Policy & Investment Climate
In general, there do not seem to be serious constraints for tourism investment. In fact, the
American Bar Association and KPMG stated in a 2009 report that “the legal framework for foreign




19
                    Armenia: South Corridor Tourism Development Strategy




investors is viewed as being one of the most liberal and successful among emerging market
economies.”24
From 2011 to 2013, Armenia improved its ranking on the World Economic Forum’s Travel &
Tourism Competitiveness Index (WEF TTCI) from 90th to 79th. The Index summarized the country’s
tourism competitiveness as more positive than negative.
Armenia’s National Development Strategy 2014-2025 highlights tourism as one of five priority
sectors for job creation and exports. The main sector policy directions are the improvement of
relevant infrastructure through Public-Private Partnerships, particularly policies to reduce high
transport costs related to entry to and exit from Armenia. With the country’s new open skies
policy, air transport was already beginning to progress as of October 2014.

12. Benefit Sharing with Local Communities
Focusing on tourism opportunities for “shared prosperity” along the Corridors supports the
Government’s Armenia Development Strategy (ADS), which aims to triple per capita income to
$10,000, lift 800,000 people out of poverty by 2025. The World Bank’s Country Partnership
Strategy for 2014-2017 supports this focus by emphasizing the near-term needs of sharing
prosperity and reducing poverty through accelerated economic growth and job creation. To
maximize potential benefit sharing in local communities, additional data about local needs and
priorities is recommended to ensure sustainability. It will be necessary to conduct validation
workshops and consultations with local residents to determine how acceptable levels of tourism
development and how the tourism economy can best serve their development needs.

13. Corridor Development Next Steps
Through this report, specific destinations and attractions along the corridor have been
highlighted for potential interventions by the World Bank, the Armenian Government, the future
Development Foundation of Armenia, communities, civil society and businesses. The World Bank
collaborated closely with USAID to build on the past work of Enterprise Development & Market
Competitiveness (EDMC) and the Armenia Private Sector Project (CAPS).
Development of the South Corridor should proceed in coordination with national level efforts
through a new Development Foundation of Armenia and national tourism strategy. The new
organization and strategy need to establish a national level framework into which the strategic
recommendations for the South Corridor should fit. It does not make sense for the South Corridor
strategic recommendations to proceed ahead of a national level strategy, unless it is considered
an integral component of the national strategy. With this coordination, the underlying strategic
vision of establishing the South Corridor as a new responsible tourism destination can become
attainable.
In terms of tourism assets, as described above, the South Corridor has a lot to offer, but
challenges especially in regards to infrastructure, product development and marketing, human

resources and implementing institutions are serious constraints. These constraints also limit the
market, especially for tour operators. While over 50 Armenian operators offer the South Corridor,
their offers are limited, particularly in regards to overnight visits (See: Table 7). Improving the
accommodations situation is critical to further developing tourism along the Corridor. However,
in order to stimulate more accommodations investment, more infrastructure (roads), product
development and human resource training are needed. All value chain “links” are
interdependent and “linked.”
Based on product development and marketing potential, infrastructure needs, and marz
employment levels, the destination hubs with the greatest potential to be catalysts for tourism
development along the Corridor are: Yerevan-Garni-Geghard, Areni and Goris.
And in these destinations, the priorities are:
  Small hotels and perhaps some B&Bs, which means offering training to local owners. Note:
   this is less relevant for Garni-Geghard because most tourists are day visitors from Yerevan.
 Improved visitor facilities at attractions.
 Hospitality training.
The “Strategic Action Plan” addresses each key value chain link in a national context:
 Infrastructure
 Product and Marketing
 Human Resources
 Policy & Investment, including Institutional Development
The national level Strategic Action Plan is extracted from the USAID EDMC Tourism
Development Strategy – A Roadmap 2014-2019 (statements in italics are added by consultant).

Chapter 1: Introduction to the Armenian Tourism Sector and South Corridor


1.1 Introduction
Travel and tourism is an important key for accelerating and expanding economic development,
investment and employment in Armenia. The Ministry of Economic Development, the main
government agency responsible for growing the sector has made good progress over the last
decade, with visitor numbers increasing year-on-year, growing levels of private and public
investment, and broad levels of consumer satisfaction. The Government of Armenia, however,
is keen to leverage this growth to increase overall spending per visitor, attract greater numbers
of visitors, and secure meaningful local economic development in the regions. The GoA has
committed to a path of responsible tourism development and is especially committed to ensuring
that the benefits of tourism are sustained and maximized to develop and protect the country’s
natural and cultural heritage.
The Government’s positive tourism policy directions can be traced, in part, to the Tourism
Development Concept Paper, 2008-2012 developed by the USAID Competitive Armenian Private
Sector (CAPS) project. Although the paper has not been formally updated since 2012, it is still an

21
                    Armenia: South Corridor Tourism Development Strategy




important resource and valid for the development of the South Corridor. The paper is
summarized in section 7.2.1.
The GoA recognizes the trends, opportunities and challenges facing the tourism industry and thus
has launched a new strategic planning and development exercise for responsible tourism,
together with the private sector, local communities, local government, World Bank, USAID, the
Asian Development Bank, IDEA Foundation and other stakeholders. In addition, a new
“foundation” for investment promotion, export promotion and tourism was created in late 2014;
the tourism section will serve as the country’s new national tourism organization.
This strategy supports that process with a focus on the country’s South Tourism Corridor for the
period 2015 – 2020. It focuses on the South Corridor (See maps below) because the Corridor has
the natural and cultural assets to help drive growth in the sector, particularly at the local
economic level. Since 2011, extensive analysis has been conducted for this route by the USAID
EDMC project (Syunik Guidebook and the Armenia Southern Tourism Corridor - Legal and
Institutional Framework), AECOM for the National Competitiveness Foundation of Armenia
(Armenia Southern Corridor Tourism Framework) and the Armenian Monuments Awareness
Project (Southern Corridor Strategy). All three sources were important references for this
strategy and many of their recommendations are included.
This chapter is structured as follows:
     1)   Methodology and Structure of the Strategy
     2)   Description of the key challenges and targets for South Corridor tourism development
     3)   Vision for tourism development on the South Corridor
     4)   Objectives of Corridor Tourism Development
     5)   Global tourism trends and tourism demand in Armenia.

                                        Responsible Tourism
 According to the Cape Town 2002 Declaration on Responsible Tourism in Destinations,
 responsible tourism seeks to maximize the positive impacts of tourism and minimize negative
 ones. It combines the sustainable and responsible tourism approaches of multiple
 organizations, including the UNWTO, World Travel & Tourism Council and the Earth Council.
 In following this approach, tourism development can be pursued according to a triple bottom
 line of maximizing social, economic and environmental benefits, thus always with the
 objective of ‘creating better places for people to live in, and better places for people to visit.’
 This approach is directly in-line with global demand trends and the main market segment the
 Government is keen to target.
 A Responsible Tourism Approach:
 • minimizes negative economic, environmental, and social impacts;
 • generates greater economic benefits for local people and enhances the well-being of host
 communities, improves working conditions and access to the industry;
 • involves local people in decisions that affect their lives and life chances;
 • makes positive contributions to the conservation of natural and cultural heritage, to the maintenance
 of the world's diversity;
 • provides more enjoyable experiences for tourists through more meaningful connections with local
 people, and a greater understanding of local cultural, social and environmental issues;
 • provides access for physically challenged people; and
 • is culturally sensitive, engenders respect between tourists and hosts, and builds local pride and
 confidence.

Given the cultural and nature-based tourism attractions along the South Corridor, the main
strategic recommendation of this strategy is to strengthen the cultural and nature-based
tourism value chain through actions to improve or build on each of the critical value
components of infrastructure, products and marketing, human resources and investment.
These actions should be undertaken through work with tour operators, government agencies
at the national, marz and municipal levels and investors.

1.1.1 Methodology & Structure of the Strategy


 ChallengesVisionObjectivesValue Chain Components AnalysisActions based on
 components

Each of these components is elaborated below. First, the challenges facing Armenian tourism and
the South Corridor are briefly described in this chapter and later more extensively in the strategy.
Second, a strategic vision and objectives are specified for overcoming the challenges. Third,
global and Armenian tourism trends are presented.
And then, to realize the vision and achieve the objectives, Chapter 2 presents a value chain
analysis based on the key components of infrastructure, products and marketing, human
resources and investment.
Chapter 3 presents an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of Corridor products based
clustering of four key sets of “hub and spoke” destinations.
Chapter 4 provides a description of infrastructure challenges and solutions along the South
Corridor.
Chapter 5 provides a description of the human resources component followed by Chapter 6
which focuses on private investment and public-private dialogue, Chapter 7 covering the policy
and investment climate, Chapter 8 covering benefit sharing.
A draft action plan is then proposed in Chapter 9 with actions specified for each value chain
component.

1.1.2 Key Challenges & Targets
One of the main challenges for Armenian tourism is that while international arrivals have been
increasing dramatically – more than tripling from 319,000 in 2005 to 957,000 in 201325, average
receipts earned per visitor have steadily declined from US$699 per visitor in 2005 to US$479
per visitor in 2013.26 This means that visitors are finding fewer activities, experiences and items
to spend money on in Armenia.
The decline does not tell the whole story though since selected groups of visitors, such as
Russians, French, Germans, Polish and Americans spend comparatively more in Armenia than
other nationalities.27 To ensure that overall spending per visitor increases, and that the benefits
of tourism are sustained and maximized as a way to develop and protect the country’s natural
and cultural heritage, the Government and industry have launched a new strategic planning and
development process for responsible tourism with the cooperation of the World Bank, USAID,
the Asian Development Bank, IDEA Foundation and other stakeholders. The process, which is
proposed as a Regional Development Program, focuses on responsible tourism as a catalyst for
broad economic development, especially in selected regional corridors.
For Armenia overall and the South Corridor, the below challenges and targets could be addressed
and achieved through the below mentioned vision, objectives, and actions to leverage the
strengths and opportunities and overcome the weaknesses and threats to the various value chain
components of Armenian tourism.
Note: As mentioned previously, baseline data from the South Corridor is not collected, so the
following values are based on national figures with 10 percent growth estimates; tourism
arrivals and receipts grew at least 10 percent from 2012 to 2013 and 2010 to 2012 respectively.

                                                  shoulder seasons. Each tour would have an
                                                  estimated 15 clients, thus totaling 18000
                                                  more clients by 2025.

1.1.4 Objectives of National and South Corridor Tourism Development
As emphasized in the Government’s National Development Strategy (2014-2025), it is a priority
objective of the Government to “ensure quality economic growth” for “balanced development
of the regions.”31 Development of the South Corridor intends to increase tourism arrivals and
spending along this route and thus stimulate more business and employment growth, and
protect cultural and natural heritage.
The tourism objectives, which are in line with Armenia’s National Development Strategy, are:
1) Grow responsible higher spending tourism arrivals from approximately 957,240 in 2013 to 2.7
million and employing 28,300 by 202532 for the entire country with at least 10 percent visiting
the SC each year (270,000) and 215033 jobs resulting from SC growth.
2) Diversify tourism product/experience offers that attract increased international tour operators
and independent travelers resulting in increased value for money, local jobs, improvement in
skills, and SME opportunities in SC destinations with at least 10 new operators adding at least
120 tours that go as far as Areni/Noravank on day trips and Goris/Tatev for overnight trips from
2016 to 2025.
3) Increase overnights and thus spending from targeted segments of international and domestic
tourists with at least 10 percent growth by 2025 due to SC growth, thus an average of 84,300
more room nights and US$4.6 mn in spending each year above the 2012 national total of 8.4 mn
room nights and US$460 mn in tourism receipts (spending in Armenia).
4) Increase “incoming tourism expenses” (spending) from US$513 mn in 2011 to US$2.4 bn in
2025.34


1.2 Global Trends
Tourism is one of the largest and fastest-growing service industries globally. In 2013, tourism
amounted to nearly US$7 trillion, which is approximately 9.5% of world GDP. The sector
employed over 265 million people worldwide, about 8.9% of global employment. The Travel and
tourism industry is expected to grow by an average of 4% annually, reaching 10% of global GDP
or US$10 trillion in a decade. The number of international arrivals increased by 5% in 2013 and
reached the record number of over 1.087 billion. UNWTO expects growth to maintain its steady
rate at about 3.3% until 2030.35
Although the world economy still remains challenging, WTTC research suggests that as incomes
grow, not only in large emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India and China), but also in the rest

of Southeast Asia and Latin America, travel and tourism will also grow. With increasing
international trade, especially from emerging markets, business travel demand will also
increase.36

                                                        Armenia: South Corridor Tourism Development Strategy




1.3 Armenia Trends
1.3.1 Visitors to Armenia and the South Corridor
1.3.1.1 International Visitors
International tourist arrivals have been growing steadily in Armenia well above the world
average. As
Figure 12 shows, from 2010 to 2013, the number of international tourists increased from 687,000
to 957,000, increases of more than 10% each year – more than double the average global
tourism growth rate of 4%. Similarly impressive growth occurred with international tourist
receipts more than doubling from US$220 mn in 2005 to US$408 mn in 2010, but then slowed in
the following years. With the decline in receipts, the spending per visitor also declined.

Based on UNWTO’s 2012 statistics for Armenia – the most recent available via UNWTO -- the top
generating markets, accounting for approximately 71% of total international arrivals, include CIS
(41.5%), Iran (18.4%), USA (8.2%), Argentina (3%), France (3%), Lebanon (3%), Germany (2.7%),

Greece (1.5%), UK and Italy (1%). Of these visitors, 287,000, thus 34%, came through organized
tours.41 Note: UNWTO includes Georgia and Ukraine arrivals as part of the CIS total.
For the South Corridor, the Ministry of Economy provided the World Bank team with visitor
statistics based on an “International Tourism Survey” conducted in 2013 for the Syunik Marz. Also
in 2013, the USAID EDMC project conducted a visitor survey for all of Armenia. Both surveys focus
on percentages of total visitors, but for EDMC, these would be percentages of the total number
of visitors surveyed, which were 23,658 with a “valid tourist sample size” of 10,448.42 The sample
error and validity rates were not reported though. For the MOE survey, no sample size was
reported with the data. Consequently, visitor totals for the South Corridor are unclear.
Of the total visitors surveyed by EDMC, they reported that 4.6% visited Vayots Dzor, 5.3% visited
Syunik and 5.8% visited Ararat, which amounted to 1088, 1253 and 1372. And also among the
total surveyed, the main source markets were Russia (41.6%), Georgia (33.7%), Iran (6.6%),
Ukraine (2.4%), Germany (1.6%) and the USA (1.4%).
When the data is available, one indicator that might provide further insight into the number of
visitors along the South Corridor is the increase in the number of new hotels and beds over the
past years. From the total number of available bed-nights and available occupancy rates, the total
numbers of overnight visitors could be extrapolated. However, this data was unavailable from
the Ministry of Economy.43

1.3.1.2 Domestic Visitors
Since the Ministry of Economy does not collect visitor statistics for the South Corridor, it is not
possible to accurately determine the number of international and domestic visitors. In their 2011
Armenia South Corridor Tourism Strategy, AECOM reported an estimated 450,000 domestic
overnight tourist visits in 2009-2010, much of which would be generated from Yerevan.44 In part,
AECOM explained, this estimate was derived from the Tourism Development Concept Paper
developed by the USAID CAPS Project and adopted by the Government in February 2008.45
In the Tourism Development Concept Paper, the number of “internal” (domestic) tourism visits
was estimated at 308,000 for 2006, growing to 500,000 by 2010, 1 million by 2020 and 1.5 million
by 2030.46
To estimate the number of domestic visitors for the South Corridor, AECOM referred to a 2007
Tourist Visitor Survey47, which “assumed that 15 percent of [all] tourist arrivals visit the South
Corridor” and that by 2030 this rate would increase to 20 percent. 48 Based on this, AECOM

forecast approximately 900,000 tourists by 2030 for the South Corridor with 300,000 generated
by domestic tourists.49 More precise data is needed for the South Corridor; the accuracy of this
estimate is unknown.

1.3.2 International and Armenian Tour Operator Surveys
1.3.2.1 Armenia Tour Operator Survey
Armenian tour operators are important to the success and further development of the sector. To
gauge their current and future plans and demand for South Corridor destinations, the World Bank
tourism team conducted primary data collection consisting of a survey conducted in September-
October 2014, three workshops with tour operators and a review of the circuits of more than 50
Armenian operators. (See: Table 8) The survey was sent to 85 operators; 17 responded. They
reported that their best-selling circuits were South Corridor destinations: 1. Yerevan-Khor Virap-
Noravank-Tatev and 2. Yerevan-Garni-Geghard. The operators also reported that Tatev was the
most popular attraction for their clients.
To reinforce what was mentioned above, the operators indicated that the most appealing
aspects of visiting Armenia for their clients were hospitality, food, nature, cultural heritage and
quality of service. And the least appealing aspects and main sources of complaints were the
road conditions, poor visitor infrastructure, lack and poor state of toilets, lack of information
centers and signage/panels, abundant waste both on sites and roads in general. The operators
also considered a decrease of airfares and improvements in human resources, education and
training as high priorities. Below is a detailed ranking of gaps, which operators identified as
priorities to be addressed from highest to lowest (from 1st to 8th in priority or importance):
Table 4: Tour Operator Ranking of Gaps

 Availability of guides                                 4.7

 signs
As mentioned elsewhere in this strategy, when the new Development Foundation of Armenia
launches having Tourism Armenia department, the adaptation and updating of previous tourism
marketing plans developed by the EDMC project should be a priority. As these plans are

                   Armenia: South Corridor Tourism Development Strategy




implemented, the tour operators’ concern about marketing and publicity and events calendar –
should be addressed.
Addressing the infrastructure and signage issues will require coordination between the DFA and
other Government agencies. The guide issue was beginning to be addressed through an
association with the World Federation of Tourist Guide Associations, but as the IDeA
Foundation’s Tatev Resource Center launches, guide training would be a useful activity to include
with the Center’s programs. The Center’s programs will also help address the hospitality services
issue.
The hotel/entertainment/nightlife issues are product development issues that will require
private sector initiative and investment. However, the new DFA will be able to play an important
role in providing the necessary market research and visitor data to assist investors with deciding
investments in these areas.


Among the 17 operators surveyed, the following activities and destinations are being or will be
offered over the next three years in the South Corridor marzes:
Ararat Marz:
    Khor Virap
    Khosrov Reserve
    Urtsadzor Eco-Training Center
    Mountain climbing
    Visits to harvest sites
Vayots Dzor:
    Caves
    Noravank
    Animal watching
    Alpinism
Syunik:
    Tatev
    Sisian-Ukhtasar
    Tatev
    Vorotan Canyon
    Kapan
    Shikahogh
    Khustup
Judging from their plans, a few of these operators are gradually offering more adventurous
options such as the nature-based activities listed above. Again, all of this bodes well for the
development of the South Corridor.

As the chart above shows, cultural heritage tours are the most popular among the operators who
were surveyed. And among the types of cultural tourism activities, the below chart shows from
the most to least popular activities.

Judging from these results, itineraries that include more interaction with local communities and
their heritage would be popular. As the review of 50 tour operators’ Southern Corridor itineraries
show, some operators have begun to add activities such as meals with local families

Among the respondents’ clients, most came for leisure followed by visiting friends and relatives
and business:

For most of them, Russia was a principal source market and all marzes were popular destinations,
including the marzes of the South Corridor. Other fast growing markets included Israel, China,
Japan, Poland and Hungary. Some operators are also targeting the USA and Middle East. It is
difficult to discern a trend on targeting markets since operators may specialize in one or more
markets because no one else is doing so.

Generally, the top three generating countries for these tour operators are:
     1) Russian Federation
     2) Germany
     3) France

1.3.2.2 International Tour Operator Survey
In 2010, the USAID CAPS project published a comprehensive survey of 311 international tour
operators from 31 countries. The purpose of the survey was to determine levels of interest
among operators that were already offering Armenia tours, stopped offering tours or were not
offering tours.
Over 70 percent, thus 220 operators, were not offering or had stopped offering Armenia tours.
Their main reasons were:
        87 operators cited a lack of information.
        61 cited insufficient promotion in international media.
        71 said they had no contacts with regional/local operators.
        115 operators that they would be interested in establishing tours to Armenia.
Among those offering Armenia:
        29 operators had been selling Armenia prior to 2005 with another 17 starting in 2008.
        23 had repeat clients for visits to Armenia.
        32 offered Armenia-only tours with 19 offering Armenia in combination with one or more
         countries.
        31 (of 47) were pleased with local Armenian ground operators.
        18 (of 37) rated accommodations as expensive for the quality and somewhat limited.
        28 (of 46) recognized the cultural value of the attractions, but said improvements were
         needed, i.e. visitor information, toilets and food services.)
        28 (of 47) considered Armenia overpriced for the quality of facilities and services.
        33 operators cited the culture as the country’s unique selling prop osition.
Overall, the results of their survey were positive and boded well for increased tours to Armenia.
For both groups of operators – those offering and those not offering Armenia – the main
attractions of Armenia were history, heritage, culture and people. The South Corridor should
appeal to these operators and their clients. And with over 50 Armenian operators already
offering tours to the Corridor, there are many prospective local partners for the foreign
operators. (See: Table 8)

1.3.2.3 Purpose of Visit
The AECOM study also projected purposes of travel among South Corridor domestic and
international arrivals, again based on the 2007 Tourist Visitor Survey, for 2015, 2020 and 2030.
For international visitors, holidays and leisure would continually be the dominant purpose of visit
for 45 percent of visitors followed by 28 percent for visits with friends and relatives, 7 percent
each for health and wellness and business/conferences. The remaining purposes of visits –

employment, education, sport and cultural events and miscellaneous – comprised less than five
percent each. By 2020 and 2030, VFR is expected to decline to 25 percent and 20 percent,
business/conferences to rise to eight percent and nine percent, and health/wellness eight and
10 percent respectively.50
In the September/October 2014 local tour operator survey conducted by the World Bank team,
operators reported that 69 percent of their tours were for leisure purposes. And among these
visitors, the best-selling activities in order of popularity were: 1) Visits to cultural sights, heritage
villages, churches, monasteries and religious sights, 2) Historical and political sights, 3)
Gastronomy and wine, 4) Adventure, 5) Events and 6) Nature-based activities. The first three
activities could all be considered cultural tourism and heritage-based activities. All of this bodes
well for the South Corridor, which has strong existing and potential cultural tourism attractions.
For domestic arrivals, the purposes of visit differed significantly from international visitors. Their
purpose of visit would be continually dominated by VFR at 64 percent for 2015, 60 percent for
2020 and then declining to 56 percent by 2030. The next popular purposes –
business/conferences and holidays/leisure – trail substantially at eight percent followed by
health and wellness at 6 percent and other segments at less than five percent. Both
business/conferences and holidays/leisure are forecast to grow to nine percent by 2020 and ten
percent by 2030 for business and 11 percent for holidays. So, by 2020 and 2030, some small
incremental increases in business and holiday travel are expected for domestic visitors.51

1.3.2.4 Visitor Profile
According to UNWTO 2012 generating market data – the most recent available for Armenia –
over 40 percent of Armenia’s international visitors come from CIS countries, which include
Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, and
Uzbekistan.52 UNWTO statistics do not differentiate between these generating markets, although
most CIS visitors to Armenia are believed to come from Russia and Georgia.
According to the USAID EDMC 2013 International Visitor Survey, of the visitors surveyed, the
Russian market alone accounted for 46.3 percent of all international arrivals, followed by Georgia
at 27 percent, Iran seven percent, Ukraine 2.4 percent, Germany two percent, which means that
84 percent of 2013 arrivals came from just five markets. 53 Among all international arrivals,
“Diaspora” visitors, thus those with Armenian ancestry, comprised 66 percent. Among the top
five generating markets for Armenia, Diaspora visitors also dominated: 76 percent of Russian
tourists, 84 percent of Georgians, 50 percent of Ukrainians, 64 percent of Americans, 16 percent
of Iranians and 16 percent of Germans.

          Target Markets
               o Leisure visitors should be the priority because they spend more than Diaspora
                   visitors.
               o Russian market for leisure also a priority, although it is small, it is growing.
               o Attempt to increase product offers for Diaspora visitors.
          Demographics
               o Male visitors accounted for nearly 58 percent of total visitors.
               o Nearly 58 percent of all Russian visitors, 50 percent of Georgians, 75 percent of
                   Iranians, 67 percent of Ukrainians, 54 percent of Americans and 60 percent of
                   Germans were male.
               o More than 34 percent were 18-35, over 60 percent were 36-63 and only 4.6
                   percent were 64 and above.
          Satisfaction rate
               o 98 percent of visitors surveyed want to return.
               o 96 percent of visitors surveyed will recommend Armenia.
               o Nearly universal dissatisfaction with the quality of roads and lack of clean toilets.

1.2.1.4 Length of Stay
Average length of stay is 17.4 days, but the average varies from 6.2 days for a hotel stay vs 39
days for rented apartment, 12. 5 days in a B&B and 20 days with friends and relatives.54
Data is not known specifically for the corridor. However, as the data above and results from the
USAID EDMC 2013 International Visitor Survey show, most of the longer stay visitors are staying
with friends and family, and thus not spending less than leisure visitors.

1.2.1.5 Spending Patterns of Visitors to Armenia
International tourism receipts in Armenia increased reaching approximately US$458mn in 2013,
a respectable 12% increase over 2010, but as mentioned previously, receipts per visitor have
declined over 19% in the same period. The declining amount of spending per visitor suggests that
the available tourism offers are somewhat static and not improving in quality and variety. It also
suggests that marketing efforts are not being directed and/or not succeeding in capturing higher
spending visitors. Lower spending static tourism markets run the risk of being less competitive
and thus less able to sustain increased earnings. The focus on corridor development could be a
key solution for diversifying Armenia’s tourism product offers, increasing quality and thus
spending.
However, as data from the USAID EDMC International Visitor Survey 2013 shows below in
Table 5, estimated spending for each of the top 10 markets for Armenia varies substantially for
each market. Some highlights worth noting from this table are:
           Among visitors surveyed by EDMC, Americans spent the most per visit ($2231), but Polish
            visitors spent the most per day ($109).55
           Americans traveling via tour packages spend much more per trip than other markets:
            US$2960 vs the next highest being French who spent US$1755.
           The same is true for independent travelers, although UAE visitors spend more than French
            travelers and the amounts spent by each market are less than package travel – except for
            independent travelers from Russia and the UAE.

1.3.3 Armenia and Competitors
The following charts compare Armenian arrivals, receipts and receipts per visitor with the
countries of Nepal, Montenegro, Georgia and Romania. All of these countries are marketing and
promoting tourism offers similar to Armenia’s – history, culture, food, wine, and adventure.
As Figure 20 shows, all five countries have experienced steady increases in international
arrivals since 2010. However, as
Figure 21 shows, growth in receipts appears to be slowing in Montenegro, Romania and Armenia.
When comparing performance based on receipts per visitor, as Figure 22 shows, only Georgia
shows strong growth since 2010.

Trends regarding the performance of key competitors follow:
                             Georgia grew over 15 percent in terms of arrivals in 2013 (to over 2 million arrivals), and
                              matched this with strong growth in receipts to over US$1.7 billion (UNWTO, 2014).
                              Georgia has a similar product offering to Armenia in terms of natural and cultural heritage
                              (and shares a border). Georgia continues to promote itself as an authentic, experiential
                              destination and is investing strategically in infrastructure, cultural heritage restoration,
                              promotion and product development.
                             Nepal’s international arrivals and receipts increased by 42% and 26.7% respectively from
                              2010 to 2013, but as with Armenia receipts per visitor declined during the same period.
                              Some of the arrivals growth has been propelled by an increased push for tourism to the
                              Buddhist circuit, which is attracting more visitors for religious purposes who tend to be
                              lower spending. (UNWTO 2014). Nepal also experienced the tragic loss of 26 trekkers and
                              three farmers in mid-October, 2014 may negatively impact arrivals though.57
                             Montenegro’s international arrivals and receipts increased by 21.6% and 20.7%
                              respectively from 2010 to 2013, but also as with Armenia receipts per visitor declined
                              during the same period, despite a continual international marketing push via CNN
                              International. The depressed earnings per visitor are a possible indicator that the

         country’s marketing of its “Wild Beauty” beyond the coastline has not yet attracted
         increased spending. (UNWTO 2014)
        Romania’s international arrivals and receipts increased by 27.7% and 26% respectively
         from 2010 to 2013, but also as with Armenia, receipts per visitor declined during the same
         period. As an EU member, Romania should be benefiting from comparatively easier
         access, but the depressed earnings again signal a challenge of attracting higher spending
         from visitors. (UNWTO 2014)

While all of these countries have been pushing to develop additional products, these efforts have
not been resulting in increased spending per visitor, except in Georgia where receipts per visitor
increased by 34.7% from 2010 to 2013. (UNWTO 2014)

Chapter 2: Value Chain Analysis of the Armenian Tourism Sector and South Corridor

2.1 The Tourism Value Chain, Armenian Tourism and the South
Corridor
The concept of a “Value Chain” was first elaborated by Michael Porter in the 1980s. In his book,
The Competitive Advantage of Nations, he summarized the Value Chain as follows:
“The activities performed in competing in a particular industry can grouped into categories as
shown in [Figure 23] in what I call the value chain. All the activities in the value chain contribute
to buyer value.”58
The concept can be useful for analyzing tourism development in countries as an adaptation and
not as it was originally intended, which is depicted in Figure 23. The latter was intended for an
individual company or firm. Elements of his approach are relevant, especially the division into
primary and support activities, although for tourism development both infrastructure and human
resources are essential and could perhaps be considered more than “support.”

An adaptation of the concept applies well to tourism and serves as the basis for the analysis of
tourism on the South Corridor. In their September 2013 “Master Plan for Developing a PPP
Framework for Tatev,” the USAID EDMC project provided a useful summary of the value chain as
it relates to tourism (Figure 24) and development of the South Corridor.

                                             Tour operators


2.1.1 Planning and Booking the Trip – The Marketing Value Chain “Link”
The first links of the value chain for a visitor involve planning and booking the trip, thus the
availability of information is critical, which is usually the result of traditional, online and word-of-
mouth marketing. Marketing is a function of the available products, thus the objects of marketing
efforts. Chapter 2 of this report analyzes the available tourism product offers and marketing
efforts. At the time of writing in December 2014, a new Development Foundation of Armenia
was due to be launched in early 2015, which was also expected to begin building a new national
tourism strategy and marketing plan. The lack of an organization, strategy and marketing plan
weakened this first link of the value chain at least in terms of providing a cohesive and
coordinated approach to tourism development nationally and along the South Corridor. Travel
information and booking options for Armenia have been available through several websites
maintained by Armenian and international tour operators and agencies, as well as TripAdvisor,
Booking.com and others.
As mentioned later in this report, the circuits of over 50 Armenian tour operators were reviewed
and all of them offer tours that include the South Corridor (See: Table 8). However, it is difficult,
if not impossible, to communicate an overall image of Armenia and the South Corridor as
destinations from multiple individual information sources.
In a foreign tour operator survey conducted by the USAID CAPS project in 2009, 311 operators
from 31 countries were asked about their interest in Armenia as a destination. Of the operators
surveyed, 220 were not offering Armenia as a destination. Their main reasons were: over 26
percent cited a lack of destination information, 18.4 percent cited insufficient promotion of
Armenia in international media, and 21.5 percent cited no contact with regional/local tour
operators – thus the first link of the value chain.

2.1.2 Value Chain Travel & Internal Transfer Links
For the “Travel” link, the “Open Skies” policy initiative is making the country more accessible to
international airlines, which should eventually lead to lower fares and more frequent flights.

50
                    Armenia: South Corridor Tourism Development Strategy




For the “Internal Transfer” link, infrastructure challenges are covered in Chapter 4. Road quality
is often cited by tour operators as a constraint on expanded tours, particularly on the South
Corridor. It is also a main reason that none of the 50 Armenian tour operators whose circuits
were reviewed offers South Corridor destinations beyond Tatev (See: Table 8Table 8: Sample
Armenian Tour Operators Offering Circuits on the ).

2.1.3 Value Chain Lodging, Eating, Enjoying & Post Sale Links
For the “Lodging, Eating and Enjoying” links, it is not surprising that these form half of the value
chain -- product offers and experiences are critical to the overall visitor experience. A lack of
international standard hotels and diverse product offers are often cited by tour operators as key
constraints. The lack of accommodations is also a reason that most of the 50 operators reviewed
offer only day trips to Garni and Geghard on the South Corridor (See: Section 3.2.2.2 Insufficient
International Standard Accommodations). These “links” are discussed in Chapter 3, which
focuses on product offers.
For the Post Sale link, the lack of a Development Foundation of Armenia that implements a
tourism marketing plan, which should include the South Corridor, has hindered implementation
of post-trip follow-up with tour operators and visitors.

2.1.4 Value Chain Support Activities of Planning and Human Resources
For the entire value chain, the “support activities” of planning, human resources, and technology
are important to the success of the primary activities. With the establishment of the
Development Foundation of Armenia, tourism planning should become more synchronized with
product opportunities, human resources and investment. At the marz and municipal levels,
“there is extensive legislation for every level of planning, down to detailed site planning, [but]
evidence on the ground suggests that local planning control is often poor and as a consequence
the character and amenity of many key tourism resources is being degraded.”59 According to the
July 2014 USAID EDMC Tourism Development Strategy Review, “the local planning framework is
very weak, or even non-existent”60 at the municipal level.
Human resources for tourism and hospitality is also lacking at the national and South Corridor
levels. As the Roadmap explains, “the sector faces a skilled labor shortage, paradoxically in a high
unemployment environment. Preliminary investigations have also revealed that current training
programs may be producing insufficient graduates and that international training standards
require to be adopted to meet the modern needs of the indust ry.”61 Currently, the only two
educational institutions with hospitality training are the Armenian Institute for Tourism and the
Armenian Greek College. The AIT has only seven academic staff and the College is a high school
that provides vocational training. No formal ongoing training is available along the South
Corridor.

2.1.5 Representative Sample of Core Recommended Actions
Given the cultural and nature-based tourism attractions along the South Corridor, the main
strategic recommendation of this strategy is to strengthen the cultural and nature-based
tourism value chain through actions to improve or build on each of the critical value chain
components of infrastructure, products and marketing, human resources and investment.
These actions should be undertaken through work with tour operators, government agencies
at the national, marz and municipal levels and investors.


Note: The below list is a sampling of the recommendations contained in this strategy. It is not
intended to be a final definitive list. That should be developed based on the resources that will
become available, especially via the new Development Foundation of Armenia, and for further
development and implementation of the strategy.

2.1.5.1 Ensuring market demand (Product & Marketing Component)
One of the most important factors for developing the South Corridor is ensuring that market
demand, especially from local and international tour operators, can be stimulated through
improvements in the tourism value chain.
    A. This means persuading operators to extend their existing circuits to include at least one
        overnight on the Corridor – which means helping to create more reasons, thus products,
        for visitors to spend more time and money at destinations.
        Longer term, the goal would be to entice operators into adding even more overnights. So,
        as the proposed improvements to hub and spoke destinations mentioned below are tested
        with local and international tour operators, demand could be ensured. Creating products
        also means increased investments across a range of possibilities from micro-enterprises
        such as market vendors and tour guiding services to boutique hotels and restaurants.
     B. In reviewing the circuits of more than 50 Armenian tour operators, all are offering South
        Corridor circuits, but most are offering the same sights and activities – relatively few
        experiences that directly involve local communities are offered. (See: Table 7 and Table
        8) These experiences could be further developed in cooperation with local communities.
        The Tatev Revival Project has been pursuing this type of development since 2010 and thus
        offers some valuable best practices and lessons learned for sharing the benefits of
        tourism with the communities along the South Corridor.

2.1.5.2 Local community support (Human resources component)
As the Tatev Revival Project has demonstrated and this strategy emphasizes, local community
support is important to development success and sustainability. The Principles of Responsible
Tourism mentioned above provide some guidance, which includes recommending that local
communities in each set of destinations be consulted about proposed tourism developments to
ensure that these developments are acceptable to them.
    A. Community engagement needs to be an ongoing, long term participatory process that
        begins with community meetings conducted by Government to discuss the strategic
        recommendations and proposed actions for implementation. Included in this should be
        addressing needs such as creating local employment opportunities especially for youth to

52
                    Armenia: South Corridor Tourism Development Strategy




        reduce their migration to cities. Actually, until community “buy-in” occurs, strategic
        recommendations cannot be responsibly implemented. This process will need to be
        conducted by the new Development Foundation of Armenia.
     B. Again, the Tatev Revival Project, which has been working on this process in the villages
        near Tatev, could serve as a useful model. This could include collaboration with the IDeA
        Foundation to launch the Tatev Resource Development Center as a pilot center for
        capacity building, especially in regards to general job skills, hospitality industry skills and
        basic business management. And then replicate the pilot center in Jermuk, Yeghegnadzor
        and Areni.

2.1.5.3 Institutional support (Investment & Policy Component)
    A. As the new Development Foundation of Armenia launches, it will need support in
        coordinating and developing partnerships with the 50+ Armenian tour operators who
        currently offer tours with South Corridor destinations (See Table 8: Sample Armenian
        Tour Operators Offering Circuits on the ) on the following:
        o Encourage those operators who do not offer overnight circuits to include an overnight
            in Goris, Sisian or Yeghegnadzor.
        o Encourage those operators who do offer overnight circuits to extend their stays by at
            least one night.
    B. By assisting both sets of operators with identifying and developing additional product
        opportunities among South Corridor destinations, including more cultural experiences
        especially with local families, events such as the sheep shearing festival in Tatev and the
        wine festival in Areni, development and packaging of local agriculture goods and
        handicrafts for visitor sales. (See: Table 7: Sample of Special Experiences offered by
        Armenian Tour Operators).
    C. Assist investors and municipalities with increased investment in the principal
        destinations, especially Areni and Tatev for hotel and restaurant developments. The
        Tufenkian Group has plans to develop a hotel and other facilities in Areni. Their plans
        could contribute significantly to the economic and tourism development of the region.


2.1.5.4 Infrastructure support
        A. Assist with finalizing master plans and site management plans according to
        international standards, especially for the principal destinations of Khor Virap, Areni,
        Noravank, Yeghegnadzor, Karahunge, Goris and Tatev, in order to specifically identify
        infrastructure needs in each destination.

2.2 Summary of the Strengths and Weaknesses of the South Corridor
In Chapters 3 to 6, the strengths and weaknesses of each main value chain “link” or component
– products and marketing, tourism infrastructure, human resources, and the policy/investment
climate are reviewed in detail. For now, below is a summary of the main strengths and
weaknesses that apply to the entire South Corridor:

2.2.1 Products and Marketing
    Strengths
       o Iconic historical monuments and cultural heritage attracting tour groups, domestic
          and independent travelers, especially Diaspora visitors.
       o Strong potential for increased domestic visitors.62
       o Good potential for attracting more visitors to natural attractions.
       o Tatev Tramway is a unique attraction for the country and region.
       o Strong agro-tourism and culinary potential for expanded experiences, especially with
          cheese, fruit, wine and spirits.
       o Visitor information is available online through several commercial sights, but
          objective information provided via Government is limited.
    Weaknesses
        o Potential and existing attractions and activities require further development,
          investment and/or training to make accessible, attractive and marketable.
        o Country brand is not iconic for international market and corridor brand is not yet
          discernible.
        o Diversifying markets beyond Diaspora visitors is a challenge that is limited by
          insufficient product development, human resources and organizational resources.
        o Potential agro-tourism and other cultural experiences are not easily discovered.
        o Incomplete implementation of a national tourism marketing plan due to lack of
          organizational resources.
        o Lack of tourist class and international standard/branded hotels limit tour operator
          interest to expand overnights.
        o Insufficient distribution of objective visitor information, especially online.
        o Data collection about visitors is lacking at both the national and corridor levels, thus
          limiting development, investment and marketing.
        o The lack of local “Destination Management Organizations” (DMO) or more proactive
          local organizations with well-trained staff and sufficient budgets also hinder
          marketing and promotion efforts, as well as the collection of local visitor data.




62
  According to the 2011 AECOM Report on the Southern Corridor, the Corridor received approximately 500,000
domestic visitors and 600,000 international visitors. This data, in turn, was extrapolated from estimates in the
2008 Tourism Development Concept Paper.

2.2.2 Infrastructure
      Strengths
         o Major Corridor sights such as Garni, Geghard, Khor Virap and Noravank are
            accessible to tour groups.
         o Some limited services offered to visitors – visitor information, cafes, gift shops, and
            toilets – available to visitors.
         o Tourist class accommodations available in or near South Corridor hub destinations.
         o AMAP has already conducted extensive analysis on the infrastructure needs for most
            of the Corridor destinations.
         o North-South highway under construction should improve access to South Corridor.
      Weaknesses
           o Site management plans for major sights are not being applied to manage visitor
             flows and provide services according to international standards.
           o Services are insufficient for visitors at main sights and sometimes non-existent, i.e.
             lack of information, signage, and toilets.
           o Tourist class accommodations are too limited for high seasons.
           o Main road and secondary roads require repair and/or paving and thus limit the time
             that visitors, especially tour groups, can spend on the Corridor.

2.2.3 Human Resources
      Strengths
           o Traditional Armenian hospitality leads 98 percent of international visitors to want
              return visits.63
           o EDMC has realized several training programs, but these have not resulted in
              sustainable solutions yet.
           o The Armenian Institute for Tourism in Yerevan is a branch of the Russian
              International Academy for Tourism and provides management level training.
      Weaknesses
           o A systematic institutional approach to hospitality education and training is missing at
              the national and Corridor levels.
           o A lack of vocational training for waiters, cooks, front-desk workers, as well as top-
              management for the hotel business. This training is nearly non-existent along the
              Corridor.
           o Migration of youth to Yerevan and beyond is depopulating South Corridor centers.

2.2.4 Policy and Investment Climate
 Strengths
o Legal framework for investors praised by the American Bar Association and KPMG.
o Number of hotels increased from 792 in 2008 to 1405 in 2013.

o Competitive rankings on several indicators on the World Economic Forum’s 2013 Travel 7
  Tourism Competitiveness Index: policy rules (46th), red tape (33rd), cost to start a business
  (38th) and visa requirements (35th).
o TATEV investments have spurred additional hotel investment in the region.
 Weaknesses
o Additional public and private sector investment needed in destinations beyond Goris and
  Jermuk.
o Tourism-related infrastructure ranked low on the WEF TTCI (94th)
o Road quality ranked low (79th) perhaps due to slow policy implementation
o Also low rankings on the following impact investment climate: property rights protection64,
  enforcement of contracts65, judicial independence66, bureaucratic costs67, and control of
  corruption.68

                   Armenia: South Corridor Tourism Development Strategy




Chapter 3: Tourism Product Offers
The South Corridor offers extensive cultural and nature-based experiences that include national
parks and protected areas, a UNESCO World Heritage Site (Geghard Monastery), three properties
on the UNESCO Tentative List (Dvin, Noravank, and Tatev), archaeological sites (i.e. Karahunge),
and wine tourism opportunities (Areni), among many others. Many of these assets, particularly
along the South Corridor, lack the necessary infrastructure to receive visitors. For example, well-
paved roads, tourist class accommodations, visitor centers and public toilets are currently far too
limited for the South Corridor to receive larger numbers of visitors. With improvements in all of
these areas, the South Corridor’s attractions could become more popular and accessible, as well
as more attractive to investors and local businesses.

3.1 Key Product Offers and Hub and Spoke Destinations
Based on the analysis and past donor reports, discussions with stakeholders and site visits, the
report team concludes that three sets of hub and spoke destinations listed below are priorities
for development and/or improvements with the fourth set – ending in Meghri – the lowest
priority because it is less accessible and lacks international standard accommodations.
All of the destinations listed below require similar interventions of varying degrees – site
management plans with the architectural design of a tourism facility (visitor and information
center) that includes the establishment of or improvement of public parking, public toilets,
souvenir areas, and/or a café/restaurant area.
While domestic tour operators were surveyed about the South Corridor destinations in advance
of a September 29-October 3, 2014 World Bank mission to Yerevan and then during a workshop
on October 3rd, only ten tour operators responded. Further testing of the proposed interventions
is recommended with selected domestic tour operators to better determine prospective visitor
interest.

3.1.1 Hub and Spoke Destinations
Below are four sets of hubs with spoke destinations. The first two sets – Yerevan and Areni – are
feasible in day trips from Yerevan, which are offered by multiple Yerevan-based tour operators.
For example, the operator Hyur Services offers a five hour tour that includes Garni and Geghard,
an 11 hour tour that includes Khor Virap, Noravank, Jermuk and Areni and a 13 hour tour that
includes Areni, Tatev and Khndzoresk.
The third set – Goris – is also feasible in a day trip from Yerevan. For example, Hyur and Levon
Travel, another major Yerevan-based operator, offer it only as part of an overnight circuit. And
judging from their circuits, both operators are using Goris only as an overnight stop. No
attractions are listed by both operators for Goris.
The fourth set – Meghri -- At this point, given the poor road conditions, three to four hours travel
time between Goris and Meghri, and lack of accommodations in Meghri, this fourth set of the
Corridor has not yet generated much interest among tour operators. While this segment could
offer substantial natural and cultural attractions, particularly in combination with Kapan, it is not
realistic in the short term to expect most tour operators to add at least one and half days of



57
                       Armenia: South Corridor Tourism Development Strategy




transit time to their circuits for Meghri plus there are no tourist class accommodations in Meghri.
69 Kapan, which is 71 kms north of Meghri, offers three hotels, according to Hotels.am.


3.1.1.1 Spoke Destinations from Yerevan
The first part of the South Corridor offers a diverse range of product and activity types from
Yerevan to Garni and Geghard, the Khor Virap Monastery and eco-tourism opportunities in the
Khosrov Reserve. From Yerevan, these destinations are easily accessible for day visits, so
accommodations are not a critical factor for visitors since they will stay overnight in Yerevan.
Along this first section of the corridor, the Ministry of Economy indicated in a December 2013
letter the following sites as priorities for development:
     o Dvin -- Restoration of archeological site of Dvin town, including the development of
       necessary infrastructure for developing the site to meet international tourism standards.
       Considered one of the country's most important historic cities, Dvin was one of its twelve
       capitals with almost 1000 years of history. There is also strong bird-watching potential in
       the area.

  Hotels.am, Travel.am and TripAdvisor do not list any hotels for Meghri. Lonely Planet lists two Bed & Breakfast
establishments, one with two rooms and the other with four rooms.

                          Armenia: South Corridor Tourism Development Strategy




     o Khor Virap Monastery – One of the most popular tourist destinations, this appears on
       many tour operators’ circuits. The surrounding countryside could be a beautiful site for
       a boutique hotel and restaurant.
Figure 26: Photos of Khor Virap Monastery




Photos by: Ahmed Eiweida, Khor Virap Monastery, in the Valley of Ararat Mountain, Ararat marz

     o Garni and Geghard are already well established cultural heritage sites and considered
       “must-sees” by tour operators. Nothing more is needed to attract more visitors. Product
       enhancements will occur through enhanced infrastructure, especially through the
       development and implementation of international standard site management plans,
       which should include recommendations for increased and improved visitor services, as
       described below in the infrastructure chapter.

       o Khosrov Reserve – The Reserve is a protected area with a diverse landscape of
         desert/semi-desert, mountain steppe, woodlands, and alpine meadows. It is especially
         noted for having more than 1800 plant species, including 156 rare species.70 A visit to the
         Park could be combined with visits to Garni and Geghard. A few Yerevan-based tour
         operators, such as SunChild Eco-Tours offer tours to the Reserve. SunChild, for example,
         includes experiences such as visits with local families for herbal tea and honey tastings
         and bird-watching and a visit to Garni by horseback.71

3.1.1.2 Areni Hub Destination and Spokes
The second hub destination is Areni with spoke destinations of Noravank Monastery,
Yeghegnadzor, Yeghegis and Jermuk. The region is well known for its ancient wine-making
industry, which was exporting wine to Egypt, Greece and an emerging Roman Empire during the
Hellenistic Era. Along this section of the corridor, the Ministry of Economy indicated in a
December 2013 letter the following sites as priorities for development:
      o Equipping Areni 1 Cave (Bird Cave) with the necessary infrastructure for meeting
        international tourism standards. A fragile archaeological site where the world’s oldest
        leather shoe (estimated 5500 years old) and wine production “facility” (6100 years
        old72) were discovered – an internationally significant discovery. The cave itself is too
        fragile for tourist visits.

                                The world’s oldest leather show, found in Areni 1 Cave in 2008 in excellent condition

      o Equipping Mozrov Cave with the necessary infrastructure for meeting international
        tourism standards. One of best caves in the country for viewing stalactites and
        stalagmites, but it does not have any visitor infrastructure to protect it and enable visits.

     o Ensure implementation of the Jermuk town development program in line with the
       revised master plan, particularly development of a tourism management model,
       program management according to the model (including development of investment
       programs and attraction of investors) and development of the necessary infrastructure
       (roads, communications) to stimulate an inflow of investments.
The Areni community has the potential of being developed into a tourism village and making it
the center of an Armenian Wine Tourism Route. The Areni area is home to one of the widest
varieties of native grape types in the world. And in Areni Cave, both the world’s oldest shoe and
wine production site were discovered.
The family-owned Areni Wines Factory offers tastings, tours of the facilities, and sells to the
public. An annual wine festival is an attraction that could probably be further expanded.
Within Areni, there are potential product opportunities, in cooperation with the IDeA Foundation
and the Tufenkian Group, for the development of a wine museum, a year-round events calendar
for Areni and the region, and a Tufenkian hotel.
For the purposes of potential World Bank interventions and support, the focus should be on Areni
as a key hub along the South Corridor with possible “spoke” destinations as an Areni 1 Cave visitor
center/exhibit, Mozrov Cave and Yeghegis.
Areni and nearby attractions of Areni Cave, Mozrov and Noravank Monastery are accessible in a
day visit from Yerevan and being offered as such by Yerevan-based operators. Both Areni Cave


62
                         Armenia: South Corridor Tourism Development Strategy




and Mozrov are not ready for visitors, so at this stage, these are potential attractions – if the
necessary site management plans and visitor infrastructure can be in place.
Several wineries along this part of the Corridor welcome visitors. Hotels and restaurants, as well
as local tour operations and activity providers, however, are limited and currently a constraint
on development.
Both Noravank and Yeghegnadzor are important sites near Areni.
     o Noravank -- Deep in the “Grand Canyon” of Armenia, the Noravank “New Monastery”
       overlooks the Darachai River and is often considered one of the most beautiful attractions
       along the South Corridor. A small museum and restaurant are adjacent.
Figure 32: Photos of Noravank

     o Yeghegnadzor -- Historically, a Silk Road trading center, the town does not appear often
       on tour operators’ circuits. Some recent product-related developments could attract
       more visitors, including:
          •         Outdoor cafes;
          •         Summer art festivals in the town's main park;
          •         Art museum;
          •         Concerts, symphonies, recitals, musicals, etc., at recently renovated culture
                    house theater;
          •         Newly renovated outdoor amphitheater - summer festivals;
          •         Annual food festival;
          •         Vayots Dzor Diocese - Armenian holidays and church celebrations.
          •         A local resident’s wine tasting house and small restaurant (Arman’s House).
     o Yeghegis -- Known for recent archaeological discoveries of a medieval Jewish community
       that once resided there. At least 40 tour groups from Israel were scheduled to visit in
       summer 2014.

While Jermuk is a priority for the Government, it is a well-developed spa destination and ski
center and thus not considered a priority for World Bank interventions. And as the USAID EDMC
2013 International Visitor Survey shows, market demand for wellness offers is limited to an
estimated seven percent of international visitors.73

3.1.1.3 Goris Hub Destination and Spokes
The Goris Hub offers multiple sites and attractions, some of which can be experienced in a day
trip from Yerevan, but a very long day. Yerevan-based Hyur Services offers a 13 hour tour to
Areni, Tatev and Khndzoresk. Overnight stops for Corridor visits are usually in Goris at one of the
13 hotels listed on Hotels.am. The 19 room Hotel Mirhav is rated as best on TripAdvisor and the
22 room Mina Hotel is given a four star rating by Hotels.am.
This part of the Corridor extends from the potential hub of Jermuk into the Syunik Marz through
Sisian, Shaki waterfall, Vorotnavank Monastery, Karahunge (Stonehenge), Khot, Shinuhayr,
Tatev, Halidzor, Tandzatap, Goris, Old Goris, and Khndzoresk.
Along this part of the Corridor, the Ministry of Economy indicated in the aforementioned
December 2013 letter, the following sites priorities for development:
        Development of the necessary visitor infrastructure at Zorats Karer (Karahunge), 42 kms
         north of Sisian. Known as Armenia's Stonehenge, one of Syunik's main attractions. It is a
         prehistoric astronomical observatory comprised of 204 basalt stones that may date back
         7000 years, thus older than Stonehenge by about 2000 years.
        Restoration of the historical site of Hin Khndzoresk, including visitor infrastructure, 13
         kms east of Goris. Especially known for the cave complex, which has been inhabited since
         the Bronze Age.
These sites are already on some tour operators’ itineraries, so their prioritizing these for
improvements make sense.
Goris -- Known for the unique architecture of its houses and long tree-lined avenues. It is also
known for the tall cone-like rock formations (some of which host cave dwellings) on the hills
surrounding the town.


66
                          Armenia: South Corridor Tourism Development Strategy




Goris is also known for the Goris Women’s Development Resource Center, which was founded in
2009 with OSCE support to assist with the development of entrepreneurial and professional skills.
They produce a wide variety of crochet items, which are sold locally and exported overseas, and
thus provide continual employment for over 80 women. A visit to their workshop is a worthwhile
stop for both individual and group visitors.
Goris is a popular overnight stop for individual visitors and tour groups since it offers the main
tourist class accommodations and restaurants closest to Tatev.
Figure 38: Photos of Goris

Tatev -- The Tatev Monastery is considered jewel of medieval Armenian architecture. On the
road to the monastery along the Vorotan River is Devil's Bridge, a natural stone formation that
attracts visitors. To improve access the Monastery, the “Wings of Tatev” cableway was
developed, which connects the monastery to Halidzor village. It is the world’s longest reversible
aerial tramway (5.7 km) built in one section. According to the World Bank’s September-October
tour operator survey, most of the operators surveyed prefer to take their guests up the road to
the Monastery instead of on the cableway. The visitor center and restaurant at the cableway are
helpful product additions. A hotel is planned near the cableway, which will also help boost
tourism to the region. Plans to develop nearby villages were also created by the Tatev
Foundation, which would further extend tourism experiences.

Sisian – The Armeniapedia describes Sisian as a “rather bleak town,” but does mention its small
history museum with an outdoor collection of animal-shaped petroglyphs, access to Karahunge
– the Stonehenge of Armenia and the less accessible site of Ughtasar. The latter is the site of an
ancient Petroglyph Field, but it can be reached only by four wheel drive vehicles. More than
2,000 rocks carved with different designs, dating to between 12,000 and 4000 BC, are scattered
around the site.

Shaki Waterfall – This 18 meter waterfall is three kms northwest of Sisian and, aside from being
a beautiful site, it is a place with a legend. According to the legend, 93 beautiful women from the
village of Gegharkuni were kidnapped and asked to stop at the waterfall to bathe. They jumped
into the water, sank and disappeared – except for one whose name was Shake and thus the name
of the waterfall. At least one local tour operator, Barev Armenia, includes this on one of their
tours. 74

3.1.1.4 Meghri Hub Destination and Spokes
Meghri is 154 kms and up to six hours from Goris along an unimproved road, which limits access
for visitors, especially tour groups. In addition, there are no hotels in Meghri. For Meghri to be
marketable to more than Iranians crossing the border, however, the road between Goris and
Meghri would have to be improved and more accommodations developed. Otherwise, this is a
difficult sell for tour operators.
This part of the corridor extends from Tatev through Artsvanik, Yeritsvank, Kapan, Vachagan, to
Baghaberd-Kajaran-Meghri. In November 2013, an OSCE Syunik tourism investment forum
emphasized that the region also offers substantial ecotourism opportunities. While the following
sites offer potential, the lack of adequate roads and accommodations deter visitors, especially

69
                          Armenia: South Corridor Tourism Development Strategy




tour groups. Since not all destinations along the Corridor can be assisted at this time and market
demand is concentrated in the second and third sets (Areni and Goris), this fourth set of
destinations should remain a lower priority. The key attraction highlights are:
     o Kapan -- Kapan symbolizes the history of the entire region. Accommodations are limited
       mainly to three small basic hotels, none of which appears appropriate for tour groups.
     o Shikahogh State Reserve -- Hiking and horseback riding trails are available. Horses can be
       rented from adjacent communities, thus providing an additional source for income.
     o Plane Grove Sanctuary -- The Plane Grove Sanctuary (12,137 ha) is the biggest natural
       grove of the oriental plane tree in the Caucasus.
     o Zangzeur State Reserve -- A mountainous protected area with narrow and deep canyons,
       plateaus, jagged ridges, streams, waterfalls, lakes, springs, and caves. Fauna in Zangezur
       includes about 200 species of vertebrates and 1500 species of plants.
     o Arevik National Park, including the Boghakar Reserve
Meghri -- An ancient town located about 6 km from the Armenian-Iranian border that typifies
the region’s ancient traditions and folklore. With more than 65 historic-cultural monuments, this
Silk Road town is a historically important destination. Houses in Meghri include historic quarters,
such as Pokr Tagh (Old City), many of which still preserve the local traditional architectural style.

Given the existing and potential cultural and natural attractions, as well as proximity to the
Iranian market, the area does seem to have substantial untapped tourism assets. However, to
maximize the economic potential and power of tourism to protect and preserve natural and
cultural assets requires more accommodations. Here is the message one sees on TripAdvisor
when searching for accommodations in Meghri:




70
                  Armenia: South Corridor Tourism Development Strategy




Figure 45: Trip Advisor entry on Meghri




The three bed and breakfast houses that are available in Meghri apparently do not appear on
TripAdvisor. While developing attractions such as Poqr Tagh, a parallel effort to generate more
tourism investment, especially in accommodations is also needed. The Areviq needs list focuses
on the conversion of houses into guest accommodations, but hotel-style accommodations will
also be needed if the community wishes to attract groups.
Despite all of the past work and future plans, though, Meghri is not yet attracting international
tour operators. Even well-established Levon Travel, which offers one of the broadest ranges of
Armenia and Caucasus tours, does not offer circuits that include Meghri. In short, tour
operators have not found this set of destinations compelling enough to include in their circuits.

3.2 Key Strengths, Weaknesses and Opportunities of South Corridor
Product Offers
3.2.1 Strengths - What is strongest about the South Corridor product
offers?
The South Corridor offers a range of attractions, including festival visits, culinary tours, historic
monuments, several of which are being offered regularly by Yerevan-based tour operators such
as Hyur Services, Sati Tour, Go Travel and Levon Travel. Their product offers include:
a) The Tatev Monastery and Tramway.
b) Visits to historic and archaeological sites, including Khor Virap, Garni, the World Heritage site
of the Geghard Monastery, the Armenian “Stonehenge” of Karahunge, and Noravank Monastery.
c) Wine tasting tours and festivals in the Areni region.
d) Adventure – Hiking, Trekking, and Mountain Biking in the Khosrov Reserve and Yeghegnadzor
region.
e) Culinary visits, including visits with producers of cheese, dried fruits, pomegranates and
berries, meals with local families and an introduction to experiences such as cheese-making.
g) Spirits tasting (especially of fruit and berry vodkas).

3.2.2 Weaknesses – What is weakest about the South Corridor
product offers and marketing?
There are three key sets of weaknesses in regards to the product offers of the South Corridor: 1)
Lack of a fully implemented tourism marketing plan and insufficient organizational resources, 2)
Insufficient international standard accommodations, and
3) Underdeveloped and undeveloped attractions.

3.2.2.1 Lack of Fully Implemented Tourism Marketing Plan and Organizational
Resources
A tourism marketing strategy and action plan was developed for Armenian tourism by the USAID
EDMC project in 2013, but the organizational resources – human and financial – have been
insufficient for implementation. The national tourism marketing office has been a three person
function of the quasi-Governmental National Competitiveness Foundation and was extremely
limited by an annual budget of $50,000 from the Government and up to $500,000 from donors.
These resources are insufficient for developing Armenia into an internationally competitive
tourism destination. A new Development Foundation of Armenia was proposed to Government
in 2014, which was moving toward an early 2015 launch. A draft organizational chart reviewed
in early October 2014 suggested a more extensive tourism marketing organization, thus enabling
implementation of the EDMC marketing strategy.
With a limited tourism marketing office, data collection and market research have been severely
lacking, which in turn has been a serious constraint for any targeted marketing efforts and
investment mobilization program.
Until the new organization is established with sufficient human and financial resources and
begins implementing the EDMC and/or other tourism marketing action plans, it will be difficult
74
                     Armenia: South Corridor Tourism Development Strategy




to competitively improve the marketing of Armenian tourism in general and specifically the South
Corridor destinations and attractions. As the organization advances and the plans are
implemented, product offers will improve and expand as investors and entrepreneurs become
more confident about the Corridor’s tourism potential.
Another weakness is an over-dependence on Diaspora visitors. According to the USAID EDMC
2013 International Visitor Survey, Diaspora visitors comprise the largest group (65 per cent) and
are responsible for 74 per cent of total tourism expenditures. However, the report recommends
an increased focus on leisure tourists, who comprise only 14 percent of total international
visitors, because:
        “They are growing in their share of arrivals to Armenia (from 11.6% in 2007 to 14.4% in
        2013) and they are more profitable: they have the greatest daily expenditure average
        (94 USD), the expenditure per person is 47% higher than Diaspora, they account for
        almost half (47%) of the hotel business and they travel more around the country (3.4
        regions in average) than any other type of tourist.
        They are more reactive to marketing actions than Diaspora tourists, who visit when
        family or friends require so.”75
Related to a lack of organizational resources is a lack of local “Destination Management
Organizations” (DMO) or other effective local organizations with well-trained staff and sufficient
budgets to develop and manage local tourism. Not having effective local level tourism
organization hinders marketing and promotion efforts, as well as the collection of local visitor
data. So, for example, while the USAID EDMC project and others have produced reports and plans
for Tatev, Noravank Gorge, Areni, and other South Corridor destinations, local level management
capacity is insufficient and national level management capacity is unclear until the new
Development Foundation of Armenia is operational. 76
Without local and national level organizational resources and capacity, nobody will have the
financial and managerial authority to implement the plans. In short, there is currently no one
with the resources to be in charge of implementing any of the multiple plans and strategies,
including this one. Building this capacity is an immediate priority and prerequisite for moving
forward.

3.2.2.2 Insufficient International Standard Accommodations
Aside from the Hyatt Place Hotel that is opening in Jermuk in 2015, there are no international
brand hotels in South Corridor destinations. Hotel shortages, especially during the May-June and
September-November high seasons are common. According to the Ministry of Economy, there
are 50 hotel-type facilities, apart from Bed & Breakfast establishments, in South Corridor
destinations that provide 1,435 rooms with 2,754 beds. Assuming a maximum of two guests per
room, this means that total guest capacity per night for South Corridor destinations is

approximately 2870, thus 86,100 per month at 100 percent occupancy. However, using
TripAdvisor and Hotels.am as approximate benchmarks, not all 50 of the hotels are considered
“tourist class” by visitors. For example, although the Ministry’s data shows 22 hotels for Vayots
Dzor, only 12 hotels are listed on TripAdvisor and 14 are on Hotels.am. For Syunik, 16 hotels are
listed on TripAdvisor, 20 on Hotels.am while the Ministry indicates 27 hotels. And for Ararat, no
hotels are listed on either TripAdvisor or Hotels.am. So, of the Ministry total of 50, 28 South
Corridor hotels are listed on TripAdvisor and 34 on Hotels.am, which means that the
accommodations currently most used by visitors are relatively limited.

3.2.2.3 Attractions
Attractions along the Corridor are not yet fully developed, marketed and promoted
internationally, certainly not as widely as their potential suggests. Tour operators are pursuing
some limited product development individually, as mentioned above, but very few examples
could be found among a review of the circuits on the websites of over 50 operators; these
operators were listed on Travel.am, a comprehensive Armenian travel website. The following
examples are very limited.

Although there were more visitors in 2013 than in 2012, they are each spending less on average.
While some tour operators are developing and offering additional experiences and thus
opportunities in each hub destination, aside from Meghri, to spend money, their offers would
benefit from diversification and the necessary training, increased international and domestic
marketing conducted via the implementation of a well-researched tourism marketing strategy
and plan. The plan should include an inventory of existing experiences, souvenirs and activities
already being offered along the South Corridor by tour operators, as well as potential activities.
It could also highlight additional opportunities in each destination such as the crochet products

created by the Goris Women’s Development Resource Center, a visit that could be added to

3.2.3 Opportunities – What are some possible product opportunities
offered by the South Corridor for investors, entrepreneurs, tour
operators and visitors?
Addressing the above issues, especially the infrastructure and human resource constraints, will
help unlock product opportunities for investors, entrepreneurs, tour operators and visitors.
These include:
    Events
        o International sporting events, perhaps competitions such as for mountain biking,
            running marathons, and bicycle races.
        o Additional cultural events related to wine and agriculture, similar to the Areni Wine
            Festival.
    Experiences
        o Agro-tourism and culinary experience based on local products: cheese production,
            dried fruits, spirits tasting (fruit and berry vodka), pomegranate and other authentic
            fruits/berries.
        o Meals and cooking demonstrations with local families.
        o Linking nature and culture products, ideally cultural experiences in or near natural
            attractions.
        o Expanded adventure travel – hiking and trekking – from Yeghegnadzor.
    Accommodations
        o More international class accommodations to attract more overnights from tour
            operators, especially boutique-style accommodations, as exemplified by the
            Tufenkian Group, which is interested in establishing a hotel in Areni.77


In the Fall 2014 Armenian tour operator survey, the 17 operators who responded indicated that
their best-selling activities are cultural sights and villages, museums and galleries, churches and
monasteries, historical and political sights, events and nature/adventure. All of these results
bode well for the further development of South Corridor tours.

Chapter 4: Tourism Infrastructure
Infrastructure is the foundation of the tourism value chain, thus of all tourism development
initiatives, especially well-paved roads and visitor facilities such as clean public toilets. The South
Corridor lacks both, which constrains the expansion of tourism offers, especially by tour
operators.
In the USAID EDMC 2013 International Visitor Survey and among the tour operators surveyed by
the World Bank in October 2014, complaints about a lack of infrastructure dominated. The lack
of visitor infrastructure is a major constraint to increasing visitors and visitor spending to the
destinations of the South Corridor.
Rest stops, clean public toilets and tourism information centers are lacking in most destinations
along the Corridor between and within destinations. Constructing such tourism facilities near
major attractions could address this challenge and enhance tourism experiences, as well as the
attractiveness of destinations for investment.
Visitor centers in Yerevan and some of the main destinations existed until 2009, but when the
Armenia Tourism Development Agency, which was managing the centers, was dismantled, the
system disappeared. Visitor information centers are needed, especially in the regions at key
destinations along the Corridor to serve visitors and the local tourism industry as hubs for
distributing information about local attractions and services, as well as to serve as hubs for selling
crafts, guidebooks, souvenirs, drinks and snacks, and providing clean toilets.
Public-Private Partnerships could be established along the entire South Corridor for selected
infrastructure such as visitor centers with concessions, rest stops with concessions such as
restaurants, cafes and convenience stores.
Roads are under improvement, particularly along the South Corridor, which will be a boost to
accessing tourist destinations, particularly the southern destinations of Vayots Dzor
(Yeghegnadzor, Areni and Vaik), Syunik (Sisian, Goris, Tatev and Meghri). Currently, Meghri did
not appear on any of the circuits of the more than 50 Armenian tour operators whose websites
were reviewed for this report (See: Table 8). The lack of an improved road slows access and thus
adds too much time to the operators’ circuits.
AMAP conducted detailed infrastructure assessments of most of the South Corridor destinations.
The following summary and many of the recommended solutions are based on their work.

Meghri Infrastructure Needs
The team was unable to visit and evaluate Meghri and thus has relied on the reports from the
Areviq Foundation and AMAP in regards to Meghri. In a 2012 report, the Areviq Foundation
described 24 “stages” of needs in regards to developing the “Poqr Tagh” ne ighborhood of
Meghri. The Foundation envisions the conversion of “folk houses in “Poqr Tagh” [into] guest
houses, guest house-studios, workshops, halls for serving and tasting traditional dishes, wine
presses, souvenir salons/boutiques, [and] ethnic factories... turn[ing] the whole of Meghri into
an international center for cultural, ethnographic, and adventure tourism, as well as agro- and
ecotourism in the valley of the Araks River.”
The Ministry of Economy indicated in its December 2013 letter that restoration of Poqr Tagh is a
priority. The interest dates back to at least 2001 when the “Restoration of the Economy of the
Southernmost Region” project was proposed to UNESCO and followed by several reports and
projects. Judging from the list of 24 “stages” in the Areviq Foundation report, there is still quite
a lot to accomplish. And as indicated above, AMAP has also highlighted Poqr Tagh as a priority.

Chapter 5: Human Resources/Workforce Development
An essential link in the tourism value chain for Armenia is human resources and workforce
development. Without the necessary trained human resources, it is difficult, if not impossible, to
develop tourism along the South Corridor. Although there are now 50 hotels and other
accommodation establishments with 1435 rooms and 2754 beds, there are no hospitality
education and training programs in the towns of the South Corridor. To increase arrivals and
spending in the destinations of the South Corridor, local hospitality industry training and
education programs will be needed. This training should include programs for waiters, cooks,
front-desk workers, as well as top-management for the hotel business. It should also include tour
guides and community-based training initiatives. The IDeA Foundation is launching several
initiatives in the Tatev area based on carefully cultivated community buy-in, which the
Foundation hopes to extend to seven other villages in the region.
In addition, training programs will also be needed for the establishment and maintenance of local
“Destination Management Organizations” (DMO) or at least more proactive local organizations.
These organizations would, ideally, collect local visitor data and provide that to the new
Development Foundation of Armenia for use in national marketing and promotion programs, as
well as other critical other convening, planning and monitoring functions.
The USAID CAPS and EDMC programs conducted short term training from 2006 to 2013. These
programs helped improve middle level hotel management skills and tour guiding skills, which
could form the basis for longer term permanent or sustainable solutions.
One solution could be the establishment of hospitality training programs based on an expansion
of the American Hotel & Lodging Association’s Educational Institute programs, which were
introduced and conducted by the CAPS and EDMC projects. A longer term solution could be the
establishment of a faculty at the State University of Goris and/or a vocational college program.
According to WTTC’s 2014 Travel & Tourism Economic Report for Armenia, tourism accounts for
82,500 jobs directly and indirectly in Armenia.

5.1 IDeA Foundation & Local Resource Development Center
In 2014, the IDeA Foundation jointly with COAF (Children of Armenia Fund) began to establish a
Youth Center in Tatev, which CEO Artak Melkonyan explained would develop into a more
comprehensive Resource Development Center that will be located in a school building in Halidzor
village recently renovated by the Foundation. The intention is to help prepare local residents for
jobs in tourism and hospitality. As mentioned above, these hospitality training programs could
be based on an expansion of the American Hotel & Lodging Association’s Educational Institute
programs, which were introduced and conducted by the CAPS and EDMC projects.
Another initiative sponsored by the Foundation jointly with SME DNC and JIKA in 2014 is a
program that assumed advance training of Bed & Breakfast owners in sanitary, culinary and
service standards as well as other touristic services combined with financing made available at
reduced interest rates to further assist operating businesses.

He also said that the IDeA Foundation is planning on the establishment of a Destination
Management Organization for Tatev, which might be combined with the Resource Development
Center and thus become both a training and destination management center.78
The Resource Development Center could become an important solution for the human resource
challenges, not only for Tatev and the surrounding villages, but also for the Corridor as a whole.
The Center can be established as a pilot project with World Bank support that could be replicated
throughout the Corridor. Other hub destinations such as Areni and Goris could also host similar
centers.

Chapter 6: Activating the Value Chain: Private Investment and Public-Private Dialogue (PPD)

6.1 Private Investment
According to UNWTO, the number of accommodation facilities in Armenia has increased
dramatically in only six years from 792 to 1,405 hotels and similar establishments (UNWTO
Compendium of Tourism Statistics 2007-2011 and 2008-2012), a positive indicator for private
tourism investment in Armenia. Within the corridor, as of 2013, there were 50 accommodation
establishments, thus 3.5 percent of total accommodations in the country. According to Ministry
of Economy tourism official Meghak Apresyan, data on the number of hotels constructed before
2013 and hotels to be constructed is not collected.79
In 2013 according to WTTC, tourism investment in Armenia totaled AMD29.6 bn (US$72.3 mn
estimated), 2.8 percent of total investment and was forecasted to increase by 5.6 percent in 2014
and rise by 4.2 percent per annum over the next ten years to AMD47.1 bn (US$115 mn
estimated). Compared with the following countries, this is a modest amount of investment:
Montenegro – US$310 mm/28 percent of total investment, Nepal – US$160 mn/4.2 percent,
Georgia – US$120 mn/3.4 percent, and Slovenia – US$940 mn/12.8 percent.80

6.1.1 Tatev Revival Project
One of the largest recent investments, the “Wings of Tatev” tramway was constructed with an
investment of almost US$22 mn as part of the Tatev Revival Project, which is a public-private
partnership that is being implemented by the National Competitiveness Foundation of Armenia
(and in 2015 by its successor). The project also included a US$1 mn investment in a restaurant
and US$1.2 mn in infrastructure. Since opening in 2010, the souvenir sales at the Tatev center
amounted to US$46,00081, an amount which should increase as tourism grows in the region. The
Tatev Revival Project is also intended to have a broader impact on the region by further
developing tourism attractions, including a network of bed and breakfast establishments in the
surrounding villages. The Project is aiming to develop the following, but additional funding is
needed. The following are estimates from the Project, which may change as activities progress:

As of October 2014, no places to stay were listed on TripAdvisor, Travel.am, or Lonely Planet for
Tatev and the surrounding villages. To achieve these developments, an additional US$36 mn is
needed, as well as training for local accommodation providers, which for some accommodations
would probably be local families.
The Tatev Revival Project’s efforts to serve as a catalyst for further development in Halidzor and
near-by villages should be further studied. They have been attempting to jump-start community-
based tourism investment and initiatives in the eight villages of the area: Tatev, Halidzor,
Tandzatap, Svarants, Khot, Shinuhayr, Bardzravan and Aghvani. As their website states:
Historically, the villages and the monastery have had a symbiotic relationship. Today, when
viewing the region's potential as a destination for rural and community-based tourism, the same
principal applies. Visitors to the monastery will surely want to get a feel for village life, and with
the steady flow of tourists assured by the monastery, there lies great potential to develop and
promote tourism assets in the villages.82

6.1.2 Additional Investment Initiatives
The Tatev investments are believed to have been a catalyst for additional hotel development in
nearby Goris, but as previously mentioned, data is unavailable as to how many hotels were built
each year before 2013 and are now under construction. To date, judging from listings on
TripAdvisor, Travel.am and Lonely Planet, the largest hotel in Goris has 40 rooms; the city has a
total of 237 rooms.

Jersan LLC, an Armenian limited liability company established in 2007 to develop and own hotels
and engage in tourism activities, is the local investor for the project.
The Armenian Development Agency, the country’s investment promotion agency as of October
201483, was encouraging foreign direct investment on their website. They cited the following
reasons for investing in tourism and hotel construction sectors of the country84, which are
        E-Visa scheme at point of arrival
        Culture of hospitality
        Safe destination
        100% ownership by foreigners
        Positive attitude of Government towards tourism
        No overregulation
        No technical barriers
        Variety of accommodation
        Combination of ancient and modern
        High level of literacy with strong knowledge of foreign languages

83
   As of mid-October, this Agency was due to change and combine with a new Development Foundation of
Armenia.

        Increasing trend of hosting corporate events
        Growing demand against existing capacity
        Western style of doing business
Private investment, either on a public-private partnership basis or a concessions basis from the
Government, could be used to help solve the infrastructure issues, especially improved toilets
and roads. Private investors could be incentivized to invest in service centers with visitor
information, facilities, restaurants and souvenir shops.

6.2 Public-Private Dialogue
In the absence of a Development Foundation of Armenia, there is no entity in Government that
provides an ongoing forum for tourism businesses to advocate for their interests. The National
Competitiveness Foundation was serving as a quasi-tourism organization, but no formal advisory
committee or similar entity was established to facilitate public-private dialogue on a regular
basis. The new Development Foundation of Armenia may facilitate this dialogue, which is an
important element for the implementation of tourism strategies and plans.
For the private sector, none of the existing associations representing the tourism industry
appears to have generated sufficient industry support and resources to advocate sufficiently with
Government. Consequently, Government policy affecting tourism is not made based on industry
consensus, which limits the effectiveness of private sector efforts to develop and market tourism
for the country as a whole. Bringing tourism stakeholders at all levels into discussions and
information sharing would help the Government, the private sector, and civil society explore
complementary business and development opportunities for win-win solutions, and thus expand
the potential triple bottom line benefits of the industry. Focusing on the development of a
Corridor might offer a replicable basis for generating local tourism stakeholder consensus.

Chapter 7: Facilitating the Value Chain: Policy & Investment Climate


7.1 Investment Climate: World Economic Forum and World Bank
Rankings
In general, there do not seem to be serious constraints for tourism investment. In fact, the
American Bar Association and KPMG stated in a 2009 report that “the legal framework for foreign
investors is viewed as being one of the most liberal and successful among emerging market
economies.”85 As mentioned earlier, the number of hotels has increased dramatically in only five
years from 792 to 1405 hotels and similar establishments (UNWTO Compendium of Tourism
Statistics 2008-2012). From 2011 to 2013, Armenia improved its ranking on the World Economic
Forum’s Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index (WEF TTCI) from 90th to 79th. The Index
summarized the country’s tourism competitiveness as more positive than negative:
“Improvements have taken place across many areas measured by the Index, with the most
marked being registered in the areas of policy rules and regulations, human resources, and
safety and security (where the country ranks 46th, 44th and 37th respectively). In particular, red
tape (33rd) and the cost to start a business (38th) have been reduced significantly, and visa
requirements have become more open (35th). The country also benefits from a safe and secure
environment. ICT infrastructure (73rd) has improved notably, especially in terms of Internet
availability and usage. Infrastructure has also improved, benefitting from significant investment
in recent years. Notwithstanding the improvements, air transport, ground transport,
environmental protection/regulation and tourism infrastructures remain relatively
underdeveloped, ranking 85th, 94th, 100th/120th and 80th, respectively.”86

On the visa issue, TTCI noted that Armenia made 123 improvements in their visa procedures
between 2010 and 2012, thus positively impacting more than 20 countries. The country also
ranked well on transparency of government policymaking (16th), number of days to start a
business (33rd) and ease of hiring foreign labor (2nd).

On more general issues, the World Bank’s 2014 Doing Business report highlighted the following
positive developments for businesses:

        Established a one-stop shop in 2010 allowing electronic registration and merging
         procedures for reserving a business name, registering a business and issuing a tax
         identification number.

        In 2013, eliminated company registration fees.

        Merged or eliminated taxes other than profit tax.

        Armenia made paying taxes easier by merging the employee and employer social
         contributions and individual income tax into one unified income tax.

        Ranks 5th in the world on the ease of registering property.

        Ranks 6th in the world on the ease of starting a business.

        Ranks 22nd in the world for protecting investors.

All of these issues affect the country’s tourism competitiveness both as a destination for visitors
and investors. The positives generally outweigh the negatives, although the negative ratings for
tourism-related infrastructure (94th for ground transport and 85th for air transport on TTCI),
especially the road quality (79th), do not facilitate investment. Additional negatives include
property rights protection87, enforcement of contracts88, judicial independence89, bureaucratic
costs90, and control of corruption.91The negatives are a constraint on tourism growth in the South
Corridor.

7.2 Armenian Government Policy
According to Armenia’s National Development Strategy 2014-2025, tourism is one of five
priority sectors for job creation. In addition to various framework policies, sector specific policies
will be targeted to tourism and the other four sectors to boost growth.
The strategy indicates that incoming tourism should retain its role as the second main export
sector and will account for around 20 percent of exports. It is estimated that the number of
directly tourism‐related jobs will increase and account for 3.3 percent of non‐agricultural jobs by
2025.
More specifically, the strategy envisages that incoming and outgoing tourism will maintain the
earlier growth rates of 2008‐2012, i.e. 8.2% and 9% respectively, which aims for incoming tourists
reaching 1.2 million in 2017 and 2.3 million in 2025.
To achieve these goals, the main sector policy directions are the improvement of relevant
infrastructure through Public-Private Partnerships, particularly policies to reduce high transport
costs related to entry to and exit from Armenia. With the country’s new open skies policy, air
transport was already beginning to progress as of October 2014.

                       Armenia: South Corridor Tourism Development Strategy




The 'open sky' policy is beginning to involve low cost carriers, the “de-monopolization” of the
railway market, and ensuring the competitiveness, creation and upgrading of tourism
infrastructure outside of Yerevan, as well as promoting the involvement of international hotel
operators.
So, the infrastructure issues identified earlier are being addressed by Government policies. These
reforms will bode well for the further development of the South Corridor, which so far has been
seriously constrained by poor infrastructure.

7.2.1 Tourism Development Concept Paper 2008 – 2012
The Government’s positive tourism policy directions can be traced, in part, to the Tourism
Development Concept Paper, 2008-2012 developed by the USAID Competitive Armenian Private
Sector (CAPS) project. Although the paper has not been formally updated since 2012, it is still an
important resource and valid for the development of the South Corridor.
According to the paper, “the overall goal of state policy in Armenia’s tourism industry is to
increase its contribution to the national economy and ensure equal regional economic growth
while at the same time alleviating poverty. This will be achieved by sustaining high levels of
growth in the number of incoming and internal tourists, meanwhile increasing tourism generated
income through offering higher value products and services, and creating new job opportunities
in the sector.”92

7.2.1.1 Policy Principles
To achieve this goal, the Government emphasized policy principles and values that are still
relevant and in effect today. The principles emphasized in the Paper are:
1) Increased competitiveness.
2) Increased integration with international best practices.
3) Focus and specialization with targeted product development and promotion.
4) Common vision and cooperation among stakeholders.
5) Sustainable development emphasizing long term preservation and protection of natural and
cultural heritage and socio-economic and environmental benefits.
6) Tourism as a priority sector of the economy.
7) Nature and environmental protection.

7.2.1.2 Policy Values
And these principles are supported by and based on multiple values, which include:
1) Authenticity, choice, diversity and innovation in product development and offers.
2) Credibility, ethical business, respect for travelers, hospitality.
3) High value-low volume and value for money.
4) Regional cooperation with neighboring countries.

5) Quality services and facilities, safe transportation and accommodations.

7.2.2 Marz-level Regional Development Plans
According to the USAID EDMC report, Site Management Plans, management plans are not a
statutory requirement for the protection of cultural h eritage. UNESCO’s World Heritage
Commission does require, however, that the three World Heritage Sites in Armenia – the
Monastery of Geghard is the sole site considered with the South Corridor – an “appropriate
management structure” must be in place. Guidelines for this structure are specified by UNESCO
in the ‘Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention.’ These
Guidelines are an appropriate management framework for all cultural heritage sites along the
South Corridor, regardless of whether they are proposed as World Heritage sites.

7.2.3 Municipal Council Four Year Development Plans
Again according to the USAID EDMC report, Outline Site Management Plans, “the law requires
that municipal council generate four-year municipal development plans. In addition, this
document should be produced at any time when mayor has changed off-schedule for any reason.
The mayor submits the four year municipal development plan together with the annual budget
to the community council for approval. Unfortunately, the majority of municipalities in Armenia
do not consider this document as the basis for their operations, or that for compilation of their
annual budgets.”93

Chapter 8: Benefitting from the Value Chain: Benefit Sharing with Local Communities
Focusing on tourism opportunities for greater prosperity – “shared prosperity” -- along the
Corridors also supports the Government’s Armenia Development Strategy (ADS), which aims to
triple per capita income to $10,000, lift 800,000 people out of poverty by 2025. The World Bank’s
Country Partnership Strategy for 2014-2017 supports this focus by emphasizing the near-term
needs of sharing prosperity and reducing poverty through accelerated economic growth and job
creation.
With increased numbers of visitors and spending, the benefits to Armenia’s economy are also
growing. According to the WTTC, tourism directly generates 22,000 jobs (2% of total
employment) and including indirect jobs, tourism generates an additional 65,000 jobs, thus 7.3%
of total employment. The industry also accounts for almost 8.2% of GDP (directly and indirectly),
and nearly 17% of export earnings. However, one indicator that is cause for concern though is
the amount of spending per visitor; this has been declining, which suggests that the available
tourism offers are somewhat static and not improving in quality and variety. It also suggests that
marketing efforts are not being directed and/or not succeeding in capturing higher spending
visitors. Lower spending from static tourism markets runs the risk of being less competitive and
thus less able to sustain increased earnings.
According to a November 2013 OSCE tourism investment forum brief on Syunik, the region lacks
a “structured approach” to tourism development, despite the many attractions and individual
developments throughout the region. This gap mirrors a similar gap at the national level. Despite
the positive policy directions described above, the lack of a Development Foundation of Armenia
and lack of tourism strategy implementation affect the entire country, including the South
Corridor. In fact, a “structured approach” to the South Corridor is very challenging, if not
impossible without a national organization and strategy. So, the lack of structured approaches
and organization at both the national and South Corridor levels constrains the level of possible
benefit sharing with local communities. As mentioned previously, a new Development
Foundation of Armenia is supposed to be launched in 2015, which will help overcome these
constraints.
In the brief, the OSCE also emphasized that:
In 2014 the OSCE Programme Implementation Presence in Syunik region will provide capacity
building assistance to the regional administration of the Syunik marz that will include
development of computer-based economic model. The model will help to measure the output of
government investments in the marz in terms of jobs, income and taxes paid to the state budget.
The model will also be used to measure the impact of development efforts in tourism on socio-
economic situation in the marz. The model will be ready in 2014, and data collection will be
realized with the Ministries of Economy, Territorial Administration, and the National Statistics
Service and RA State Tax Administration. To fully deploy the model, the OSCE lacks financial
resources. The model is envisaged to be designed in a way that will be easily replicable for the
rest of the marz regions and the cost of maintenance and sustainability estimated to be
low/affordable for the Government.
So, the OSCE has created what sounds like a very useful model, but it cannot be implemented
due to a lack of financial resources.

101
                       Armenia: South Corridor Tourism Development Strategy




In the absence of structured approaches and organizations, some progress can still be achieved
with maximizing shared benefits of increased tourism with local communities. Since the Tatev
Revival Project has been working on multiple initiatives to achieve this, the Project should serve
as a model for ways to introduce tourism to local communities, obtain consensus on
developments and engage local people in concept development and eventual implementation.
As the USAID EDMC project demonstrated, local training and capacity building are essential to
achieve this progress.
From their field research, the USAID EDMC project described residents’ attitudes towards
tourism as follows: “Residents’ attitudes regarding rural and eco-tourism are quite positive, as
most of them understand the resultant expansion in the economic development of Syunik by
means of relieving unemployment, providing an income to communities and encouraging
investment in the local economy. Despite the positive approach to rural and eco-tourism, most
local people are unsure of their role in the process; they do not know what kind of services and
products they should offer, what kind of expectations tourists will have of them, and how to start
and manage a small business. The residents of the local communities are in need of training in
the fields of capacity building, business management, marketing and communication, foreign
languages (specifically English), and customer service. Locals will need some financial assistance
in making initial investments to improve their houses, business premises, and office/work
equipment, as well as to prepare basic informational and promotional materials.” 94
To maximize potential benefit sharing in local communities, additional data about local needs
and priorities is recommended to ensure sustainability. It will be necessary to conduct validation
workshops and consultations with local residents to determine how acceptable levels of tourism
development and the tourism economy can best serve their needs. The Tatev Foundation
conducted town hall meetings in the villages near Tatev and found that it was necessary to
conduct extensive consultations with local people in regards to development plans.
Implementation of the strategic recommendations of this report will require community
consultation sessions.
While Government statistical reports show unemployment, education and investment levels in
the destinations along the Corridor, no recent survey of local residents ’ priorities and needs
appears to have been conducted. In the EDMC’s Site Management Plans Report, the authors
emphasized that local data was insufficient and thus a critical issue that needs to be addressed
in future studies. While the authors focused on visitor-related data, the same could be said in
regards to understanding what and how much tourism development local communities want –
or even perhaps whether they want tourism at all. Presumably, given the extensive infrastructure
and product analysis that Government and donors have undertaken, this question has been
addressed. However, data on specific needs as identified by the communities themselves is
unclear.
Nevertheless, within each destination hub and spoke set, the unemployment levels have been
identified:

Set #1: 2013 unemployment data in Vayots Dzor marz shows 736 unemployed people out of a
total population of 33800; women account for 566 with most of the jobless among the 35-45
year olds (173) and youth (97).95
In addition, Vayots Dzor is lagging behind other regions on GDP growth per capita.96 Also, Vayots
Dzor has experienced a ten percent drop in population from 53,230 in 2001 to 47,659 in 2011.97
Note: Vayots Dzor marz includes: Jermuk, Vayk, Noravank, Areni, and Yeghegnadzor.


Set #2: Unemployment levels in Syunik marz according to 2013 statistical data show a total of
4012 unemployed out of a total population of 95300 with unemployed women numbering 2855,
again most of the jobless among the 35-45 age group (1159) and youth (305).98
As with Vayots Dzor marz, Syunik has also experienced a decline in population, actually larger by
percentage and volume: from 134,061 in 2001 to 119,873 in 2011.99 According to the European
Union’s Policy Paper, economically driven migration was a “significant factor” accounting for the
depopulation of both Vayots Dzor and Syunik marzes.100
Note: Syunik Marz includes: Goris, Tatev, Kajaran, Kapan, Sisian and Meghri.
The Tatev Revival Project seems to be the most comprehensive effort so far in the South Corridor
to generate employment and maximize benefit sharing. The “Wings of Tatev” Gateway tramway
employed 54 local people as of the third quarter of 2013.101 As the project grows, more local
employment is expected. Most of these employees are involved with the tramway and
restaurant, but as the Project expands, opportunities all along the local tourism value chain will
also expand. These opportunities will generate jobs and small business growth for local
communities and groups to sell directly to the market (tourists) -- crafts, excursions, experiences,
traditional cuisine, accommodations etc. -- or to the industry (hotels) -- goods and services
(organic food products, furnishings, woodcrafters, ironworkers, stone carvers, fruit dryers, etc.).

8.1 Summary
Unemployment is not as serious an issue for Vayots Dzor and Syunik provinces as for other
marzes, in part, due to declining populations and migration to Yerevan, especially by younger
people. With increased tourism development along the Corridor, the migration trend might be
reversed. However, the depopulation trend does raise an important issue for tourism
development along the Corridor – the lack of trained staff available to work in tourism, especially
in hospitality services. Tourism development along the Corridor must also include an emphasis
on hospitality training and education.

Chapter 9: Combining the Value Chain Links: Corridor Development Vision and Action Plan
The Government’s Armenia Development Strategy (ADS), aims to triple per capita income to
$10,000, lift 800,000 people out of poverty by 2025. The World Bank’s Country Partnership
Strategy for 2014-2017 supports this focus by emphasizing the near-term needs of sharing
prosperity and reducing poverty through accelerated economic growth and job creation.
As referenced throughout this strategy, extensive work has been done by several donors, non-
governmental organizations and governmental agencies on possible destination developments
at a national level and along the South Corridor. Rather than replicate this work, instead it is
better to leverage and build on their research and activities and focus on assisting those
destinations and attractions that could be the strongest possible catalysts for making the corridor
a world class tourist destination.
In July 2014, the USAID EDMC project produced a Tourism Development Strategy – A Roadmap
2014-2019 because as they stated, “no clear strategy and timeframe exists to guide the ongoing
development of the tourism sector.”102 This “Roadmap” is intended as an update and extension
of the “Tourism Development Concept Paper 2008-2012,” referenced earlier in this report. In the
July 2014 report, EDMC emphasized that the latter is a “strategic position paper” and not a “fully
integrated National Tourism Development Strategy.” They also emphasized that the Concept
Paper effort and other donor tourism development efforts were negatively impacted by the
dissolution of the Armenian National Tourism Development Agency in 2009, which “left the
sector leaderless and the efforts of aid donors without a client to whom they can transfer
knowledge and responsibility.” 103 Their Roadmap establishes a comprehensive base for the
future Development Foundation of Armenia and efforts to develop and implement a national
strategy and regional level plans. For the latter, they “provisionally identified” the following areas
as urgently requiring Detailed Tourism Zone Plans and are to be incorporated into the Action Plan
[of the Roadmap]” and “prepared with a 15 year horizon…be market led and take full account of
visitor arrival projections…”104:
 Yerevan
 Debed River Gorge
 Dilijan Cluster
 Southern Tourism Corridor
The Roadmap further emphasized that these plans should be based on international tourism zone
development standards and guidelines for accommodation, building design, public spaces and
landscaping, parking and access, and common visitor facilities. They should also include tourism
zone management plans. These “instruments” are all taken into account in the Roadmap action
plan and timeline for the further development and implementation of a new national tourism
strategy, including a focus on the South Corridor. Accordingly, actions for developing the South
Corridor should be integrated with actions at a national level. 105 In other words, the South

Corridor should be developed in close coordination with national level strategic planning and
implementation.

9.1 Recommended Next Steps
Through this report, specific destinations and attractions along the corridor have been
highlighted for potential interventions by the World Bank, the Armenian Government, the future
Development Foundation of Armenia, communities, civil society and businesses. The World Bank
collaborated closely with USAID to build on the past work of Enterprise Development & Market
Competitiveness (EDMC) and the Armenia Private Sector Project (CAPS).
As emphasized previously, development of the South Corridor should proceed in coordination
with national level efforts through a new Development Foundation of Armenia and national
tourism strategy. The new organization and strategy need to establish a national level framework
into which the strategic recommendations for the South Corridor should fit. It does not make
sense for the South Corridor strategic recommendations to proceed ahead of a national level
strategy, unless it is considered an integral component of the national strategy. With this
coordination, the underlying strategic vision of establishing the South Corridor as a new
responsible tourism destination can become attainable.
In terms of tourism assets, as described above, the South Corridor has a lot to offer, but
challenges especially in regards to infrastructure, product development and marketing, human
resources and implementing institutions are serious constraints. These constraints also limit the
market, especially for tour operators. While over 50 Armenian operators offer the South Corridor,
their offers are limited, particularly in regards to overnight visits (See: Table 8). Improving the
accommodations situation is critical to further developing tourism along the Corridor. However,
in order to stimulate more accommodations investment, more infrastructure (roads), product
development and human resource training are needed. All value chain “links” are
interdependent and “linked.”
Based on product development and marketing potential, infrastructure needs, and marz
employment levels, the destination hubs with the greatest potential to be catalysts for tourism
development along the Corridor are: Yerevan-Garni-Geghard, Areni and Goris.
And in these destinations, the priorities are:
   Small hotels and perhaps some B&Bs, which means offering training to local owners. Note:
    this is less relevant for Garni-Geghard because most tourists are day visitors from Yerevan.
   Improved visitor facilities at attractions
   Hospitality training
The “Strategic Action Plan” below addresses each of the key value chain needs in a national
context:
   Infrastructure
   Product and Marketing
   Human Resources
   Policy & Investment, including Institutional Development

9.1.1 Summary Action Plan for South Corridor
At the time of writing, as mentioned above, it was not yet specified who would be responsible
for each area of tourism development at the national level in the DFA, so the following “partners”
section should be considered general recommendations based on international practices. Ideally,
after the DFA is established, there will be officials responsible for South Corridor developments
both within the DFA Tourism Armenia department and the other agencies listed below.

9.2 Monitoring and Evaluation
As mentioned above, international arrivals have been increasing dramatically – more than tripling
from 319,000 in 2005 to 957,000 in 2013106, while international tourism receipts have been static
with relatively growth since 2010 and average receipts earned per visitor steadily declining from
US$699 per visitor in 2005 to US$479 per visitor in 2013.107 Specific data for the South Corridor
is unavailable. In order to track and monitor performance of tourism development efforts along
the South Corridor, the following indicators should be developed by the Ministry of Economy and
Development Foundation of Armenia and then monitored regularly:
Table 15: Priority Indicators for Monitoring Tourism Performance
 Priority Indicators                                  Sources
 International and domestic day trips to SC Tour    operators,              visited   attractions,
 destinations.                              municipalities.
 International and domestic overnight trips to Local police that receive hotel                 guest
 SC destinations                               registration cards from SC hotels.
 Visitor spending                                     Local surveys
 Number of persons locally employed in hotels, Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs
 restaurants and attractions
 Number of hotels, rooms and beds pre-2013            Municipalities and Ministry of Economy
 New hotel project details                            Municipalities and Ministry of Economy


As data collection and analysis improves via the DFA Research Team, it should become easier to
measure and monitor each “link” of the tourism value chain. And, in the process, this additional
data will help focus tourism planning, development, investment and marketing of the South
Corridor – as an integral component of the country’s overall national tourism development and
marketing plans. Additional important indicators are listed below in Table 16: Additional
Important Indicators for Monitoring Performance. Note: This is not a full listing of all possible
indicators; these are the ones considered most useful for developing and monitoring the South
Corridor. A full list and description of sustainable tourism development indicators can be found
in the 515 page Indicators of Sustainable Development for Tourism Destinations: A Guidebook
by Ted Manning, published by the UNWTO, 2004.
