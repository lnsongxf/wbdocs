 • If you do not know the person
   well, if you think he may re-
   spond with violence or hostil-
   ity, or if you think he will not
   be convinced by just one per-
   son, recruit other Living Peace

   the community to speak with
   him. Perhaps include someone

THINGS NOT TO DO:
 • Never react with violence
    or too much force or with
    screaming and anger. This
    fuels the anger and creates a
    more dangerous situation.
 • If you fear that the attack-
    er will use physical violence
    against you, as well, then do
    not intervene alone but imme-
    diately alert the police or ask
    others in the community to
    help also.
 • Your first concern is the health
    and safety of the person who
    has been attacked. If it is
    necessary in order to keep the
    victim safe, then let the man
    escape and leave the scene.

After each group presents their
role-play, discuss the interventions.

     men reported that their wife
     can be an obstacle to change
     when she doesn’t understand
     the lessons learned. Poverty and
     lack of means to sustain a family
     remained major concerns for men
     and women.

     Full acceptance of gender equality
     was most difficult in Burundi. Men
     felt that women cannot be equal
     to men, and should not have
     inheritance rights. Some women
     felt they could say no to sex, but
     many felt they could not.

     Additional positive side effects:
     •   Children profit from the posi-
         tive changes in partner re-
         lations. There were several
         accounts of children saying
         that they are so happy with
         having a father who is better
         now, and with having peace at
         home.
     •   Children—including girls—get
         better access to school when
         their father is willing to pay
         the school fees.
