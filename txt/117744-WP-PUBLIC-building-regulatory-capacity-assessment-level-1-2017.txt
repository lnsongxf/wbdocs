Overview
Urbanization is simultaneously a major driver of development, wealth creation and poverty reduction, as
well as one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century. Between 1990 and 2015, the urban extent
occupied by cities in less developed countries increased by a factor of 3.5.1 By 2050, up to 70 percent of people
will be living in cities. Urbanization can and should be embraced as an opportunity to reduce poverty. The
goal, however, can be realized only if current patterns are significantly transformed to guide urban growth in
developing countries towards a more sustainable trajectory.

The New Urban Agenda agreed upon in Quito in October 2016 conveys a sense of urgency by seeking to harness
the transformative force of urbanization and shape the future of cities. It focuses on four major priorities: national
urban policies; more effective municipal finance; territorial planning and design capacity; and laws, institutions
and systems of governance to enhance the rule of law. The Building Regulatory Capacity Assessment provides
an important contribution to help cities and project managers working with development agencies to
implement this last priority by offering a new resource to assess building and land use regulatory systems, and
facilitate the collection of critical information about the building regulatory framework in any given city or
country.

The Building Regulatory Capacity Assessment is comprised of the following “Level 1 - Initial Screening,” designed for
government officials and project managers undertaking rapid preliminary assessments. It provides an opportunity to
initiate conversations with clients and relevant parties on strategies for achieving relevant development objectives.
Level 1 is complemented by a “Level 2 - Detailed Exploration”, which provides a set of guidelines for team members
and contractors who are tasked with gathering and analyzing data and information about the building regulatory
capacity of the target country, region or municipality. Overall, the Assessment identifies critical gaps, it provides the
necessary information to develop a baseline for formulating technical assistance to clients, as well as drawing findings
that can be used to determine areas for improvement and investment.

As UN-Habitat points out in the World Cities Report2, effective regulatory frameworks based on accountability and
clear implementation mechanisms are key “development-enablers that provide a solid forward-looking framework
to guide urban development”, thus emphasizing the role of regulations as a means to integrate a wide range of
societal objectives ranging from building resilience to acute and chronic risks, climate change adaptation, promoting
accessibility in the built environment, reducing CO2 emissions, preserving cultural assets and attracting investment.

As part of the Building Regulation for Resilience Program supported by the Global Facility for Disaster
Reduction and Recovery,3 we hope that this assessment tool will offer an effective resource for interventions
within a wide range of urban development initiatives in cities of low and middle-income countries.

      4.1.1       What is the form of government: national / centralized,               In a national government, the enabling legislation for building
                  federation, or other?                                                 regulation will be at the national level. In a federation, the
                                                                                        enabling legislation may be at the state (territory, provincial)
                                                                                        level. However, even in a centralized system, it is important
                                                                                        to understand the level of decentralization that may render
                                                                                        national and sub-national laws and regulations at odds.


      4.1.2       Which acts, decrees, laws or similar enable the regulation of:        The first step in the assessment process is to identify whether
                  (a)	 the use or condition of land upon which a building can           the fundamental enabling legislation for such regulations is in
                      be constructed (i.e., planning or zoning), and whether            place. For disaster mitigation and related projects, land use,
                      disaster risk management elements are integrated into the         building design and construction, and fire safety regulation
                      legislation;                                                      is critical, so related enabling legislation must be in place.
                  (b)	 the design, construction and operation of buildings, and         A parallel condition exists for other areas where regulation
                      the strengthening or upgrading of existing buildings;             can be helpful (e.g., energy conservation, accessibility, etc.).
                  (c)	 fire prevention / control, and/or the fire service;              Obtaining text of the relevant legislation is needed for the
                  (d)	 resource / energy conservation;                                  assessment.
                  (e)	 accessibility / usability rights; and
                  (f)	 historic / cultural heritage preservation?


      4.1.3       Are there regulations18 for the following:                            Assuming the enabling legislation is in place, it is then
                  (a)	 land use planning/zoning;                                        important to understand what specific regulations are in place
                  (b)	 building design and construction, and retrofitting of            in each pertinent area. It will be necessary to obtain text of the
                      existing buildings;                                               pertinent regulations.
                  (c)	 fire prevention;
                  (d)	 resource / energy conservation;
                  (e)	 accessibility; and
                  (f)	 historic / cultural preservation?


      4.1.4       What entity has primary responsibility for the development of         The development and promulgation of regulations may not be
                  regulations for:                                                      by the same entity, so it is important to know what entity is
                  (a)	 the use or condition of land upon which a building can be        responsible for each function. For example, development may
                      constructed (i.e., planning or zoning);                           be by a private sector ‘model code’ development organization,
                  (b)	 the design, construction or operation of buildings;              but promulgation is typically the responsibility of government.
                  (c)	 fire prevention / control, and/or the fire service;              Here we need to know which entities are responsible for
                  (d)	 resource / energy conservation;                                  the development of the associated regulations. It will also be
                  (e)	 accessibility / usability rights; and                            helpful to know if influence peddling or corruption is of concern
                  (f) historic or cultural heritage preservation?                       in the client country, as it might influence development of
                                                                                        the regulation.


      4.1.5       What Ministry, Agency, Department or other entity has primary         The development and promulgation of regulations may not be
                  responsibility for promulgation of regulations for:                   by the same entity, so it is important to know what entity is
                  (a)	 the use or condition of land upon which a building can be        responsible for each function. For example, development may be
                      constructed (i.e., planning or zoning);                           by a private sector ‘model code’ development organization, but
                  (b)	 the design, construction or operation of buildings;              promulgation is typically the responsibility of government. Here
                  (c)	 fire prevention / control, and/or the fire service;              we need to know which entities are responsible for promulgating
                  (d)	 resource / energy conservation;                                  the associated regulations. It will also be helpful to know if

Potential Informants
First contact may be made with the head of the government
entity designated with primary responsibility for development
and maintenance of the building regulations. Within a unitary
(national) government system, this may be a unit of the
ministry concerned with construction, urban development or
other (e.g., Ministry of Construction, Public Works, Economic
Development, etc.). Regulation related to buildings may also
reside with the ministries of Health, Energy, Civil Defense or
Interior. Within a federal system, this may be the equivalent

              all areas of the country, region (state, territory, province), or      such regulations have been adopted into use throughout the

              of building projects – new construction, renovation, expansion,        building regulatory capacity is largely a function of how

     4.3.10   What is the number of staff in each Planning Department,            Similar to the above line of questioning, this question seeks
              Building Department and Fire Department (or equivalent), who        to understand the capacity, in numbers, of persons available
              are responsible for enforcing land use, zoning, building and        for enforcement activities. In this case, we focus largely on
              fire regulation compliance, in the country, region or city(ies)     post-occupancy enforcement, as improper use of permitted
              covered by the project, such as:                                    buildings, improper storage, etc. can lead to significant losses
              a)	 wetlands infringement;                                          in hazard events – much more so than in compliant buildings.
              b)	 improper building use;
              c)	 building modification, including increase in area, height,
                  change of use;
              d)	 improper storage of hazardous materials; and
              e)	 inadequate upkeep of required safety systems (e.g., fire
                  systems)?


     4.3.11   Identify the types and frequency of enforcement activities          As with 4.3.9 above, the number of enforcement activities
              undertaken by relevant Planning Departments, Building               which staff need to perform, and the target time allotted or
              Departments and Fire Departments (or equivalent), who               required to perform those tasks, is essential information for

              fire regulation compliance, in the country, region or city(ies)
              covered by the project, such as:
              a)	 site inspection;
              b)	 building inspection;
              c)	 stop work orders; and
              d)	 stop use of building orders.


     4.3.12   What actual, verifiable qualifications are held by staff of         As with question 4.3.9 above, the capacity assessment rests
              the Planning Departments, Building Departments and Fire             on the qualifications as well as the numbers of staff involved
              Departments (or equivalent), who are responsible for enforcing      in regulatory enforcement. Use of un- or ill-qualified persons
              land use, zoning, building and fire regulation compliance, in       might ‘make the numbers look good’ in terms of capacity, but
              the country, region or city(ies) covered by the project?            the outcomes can be dangerous, especially when it comes to
                                                                                  inspecting safety-related issues in operational buildings.


     4.3.13   To what extent are land use planning, building and fire             A well-functioning building regulatory framework needs
              regulations used in the education of professionals in the           suitably educated professionals and properly trained skilled
              country, region or city(ies) covered by the project? What are       craftspersons for building regulation to work effectively.
              the different types of trainings and capacity-building programs
              available for building officials (course titles, content) and are
              they carried out by the government, associations of engineers/
              architects, or other training institutions, and what level of
              expertise do they have in the topic areas?”


     4.3.14   To what extent are land use planning, building and fire             It is essential to socialize the benefits of the building

                 country); (c) municipal (city level).


       1.2       The project type is: (a) disaster risk / vulnerability reduction; (b) disaster recovery;             
                 (c) rapid urbanization; (d) climate change adaptation; (e) resource / energy management;

     Section 4.1 Legal and Administrative provides a quick snapshot of the extent of regulatory capacity-building that may be needed with
     respect to enabling legislation. Quite simply, the more enabling legislation in place, the less resources will be needed to build capacity.
     All ‘yes’ responses likely means a good legislative infrastructure is in place, and investment needs are comparatively low. All ‘no’
     responses might suggest significant investment and time are needed.

                 pertinent to the project (i.e., land use, building design and construction, fire prevention,
                 energy conservation, accessibility, or preservation of cultural heritage)?


       2.2       Are there formal regulations (codes / standards) for those areas pertinent to the project?                          



       2.3       Are there acts, decrees, laws or similar that enable the regulation / licensing /                                   
                 certification of: architects / planners; engineers; builders (carpenters, masons, …);
                 trades (plumbers, electricians, …); contractors / installers; building officials; fire officials?


       2.4       Are there acts, decrees, laws or similar that enable the regulation / certification / testing

     Much like above, Section 4.2 Development and Maintenance provides a quick snapshot of the extent of regulatory capacity building
     that may be needed around specific regulations (e.g., planning and zoning, building, fire, etc.). As with the above, the more formal
     regulatory components in place the less capacity-building resources will be required. All ‘yes’ responses likely means a good regulatory
     infrastructure is in place, and investment needs comparatively low. All ‘no’ responses might suggest significant investment is need.

  3.1         If formal land use planning / zoning regulations exist, do they incorporate: (a) hazard                            
              maps or related means that identify areas in which building is not permitted due to
              natural hazards; (b) hazard maps or related means that identify minimum separation
              between residential and hazardous occupancies; (c) maps or related means that
              identify areas in which building is not permitted in relation to natural resources; and (d)
              requirements for infrastructure associated with building density, population or related
              factors?


  3.2         If formal building regulations (codes, standards) exist, do they have specific provisions                          
              for, or is there a separate building code, for indigenous buildings, “non-engineered” and/
              or “informal” construction? By ‘formal’ we mean adopted by law and are enforceable, not
              used simply as guidance.


  3.3         If building regulations (codes, standards) exist, do they have: (a) Hazard maps identifying                        
              expected natural hazard loads by region; (b) Requirements for structural resistance to
              expected hazard loads; (c) Requirements for moisture resistance to expected hazard
              loads; (d) Requirements for fire separation from other buildings, wildland interfaces, etc.?


  3.4         If formal building and fire regulations exist, do they require, by reference, the use of                           
              nationally or internationally recognized consensus standards that specify required
              material properties and performance (e.g., strength, durability, fire resistance, …), the
              tests to confirm performance, and requirements for design, installation, testing and
              maintenance of building and safety products, components, systems and assemblies? If
              so, what standards are referenced?



Section 4.3 Implementation is a more detailed assessment to determine to what extent the systems, documents and appropriately
educated and trained people are in place to facilitate the regulatory framework. The rating here may require somewhat detailed
information, especially with respect to percentage coverage of ‘formal’ building code, and numbers and training of regulatory and
enforcement personnel. In particular, having a solid ‘formal’ framework in place is all well and good, so long as it applies to a significant
portion of the country. If not, and the ‘informal’ sector is dominant, that much work and resource may be needed to achieve set
objectives.
