Introduction

T
    he government of Argentina and the World Bank desire to improve the efficiency and results of the
    environmental and social outcomes of jointly financed development projects. As part of a workshop
    in November 2010 attended by officials of the Ministry of Economy and Public Finance of Argentina,
World Bank staff, and representatives of implementing units of projects being cofinanced by the Bank,
several issues with regard to the implementation of the World Bank safeguard policies and the existing
Argentine environmental and social management regulatory frameworks were identified. The workshop
agreed to conduct a technical study of the regulatory consistency between the Bank safeguard policies and
Argentina’s environmental and social legislation to serve as a vehicle for dialogue between the Bank and
the government of Argentina in order to strengthen joint strategies that address environmental and social
issues in development projects.
     The technical study involved the following (and the corresponding report section):

•	 Comparison between the principles of eight1 of the World Bank safeguard Operational Policies (OPs)
   and the national and provincial regulatory frameworks in force, using the framework for equivalence
   analysis contained in Bank OP 4.02 as a guideline for the assessment (section 2);
•	 Identification of some representative key issues or lessons learned related to the operational principles
   of Bank safeguard policies in Argentine projects based on the experience of the Argentine implement-
   ing units and the Bank (section 3);
•	 Development of strategies to move forward more effectively and efficiently in Bank-financed proj-
   ects in Argentina related to environmental and social management and more broadly to non-Bank-fi-
   nanced projects and also projects in other countries (section 4);
•	 Synthesis or conclusions on opportunities to promote more effective and efficient environmental and
   social management in development projects (section 5).

    The results of the study were presented in a workshop jointly run by the National Directorate of Projects
with International Credit Organizations (Dirección Nacional de Proyectos con Organismos Internacionales
de Crédito, DNPOIC) and the World Bank and attended by 94 participants, most of them environmental
and social specialists from the implementing units of World Bank-funded projects. Input and comments
were used to help identify lessons learned and assist the proposed strategies to move forward.

Argentine Environmental and
Social Legislation

W
         ithin Argentina, as in other countries, environmental and social legislation is a fundamental
         tenet to provide a safe environment for the country’s population while allowing for the necessary
         sustainable economic development. This legislation can also serve as the basis for determining the
environmental and social acceptability and sustainability of a World Bank-financed project. The following
two sections present a brief overview of the Argentine environmental and social regulatory framework in
relation to the typical types of projects being financed by the World Bank (section 2.1) and a comparison
of this regulatory framework with eight of the World Bank environmental and social safeguard operational
policies (section 2.2).


2.1  Argentine Environmental and Social Regulatory Framework

Argentina has a complex legal and institutional architecture related to environmental and social assess-
ment and protection. Argentina has adopted a representative, republican form of government and a feder-
al organization of the State. There are three levels of government: national, provincial, and municipal. The
federal government coexists with 23 provinces and an autonomous city, Buenos Aires, which is the capi-
tal of the country.3 The National Constitution divides authority between the federal and provincial gov-
ernments. The provinces reserve to themselves all the powers not delegated to the federal government, as
well as those powers expressly reserved to themselves by special pacts at the time of their incorporation.
Municipalities enjoy the autonomy assigned by the province they are part of. In this regard, the National
Constitution provides that each province enacts its own constitution ensuring “municipal autonomy and
ruling its scope and content regarding the institutional, political, administrative, economic, and financial
aspects.”
     The federal governmental legislative branch is responsible for enacting the general laws of the na-
tion (civil, commercial, criminal, mining, labor, and social security codes as well as others within the pur-

       Protection Management

      Environmental assessment
      •	 Design measures to improve implementation of environmental impact assessment consultation to involve, as a minimum, the potentially
         affected groups and NGOs in two consultations for complex projects and one consultation for less conflictive projects, in particular the
         provinces where this mechanism is not regulated.
      •	 Generate guidelines for the implementation of regional or sectoral environmental assessments, to be applied in the evaluation of plans,
         programs, and projects, with strategic implications for the respective jurisdictions.
      •	 Provinces presently lacking regulations regarding the organization and minimum contents of environmental and social impact assessments
         (ESIAs) could generate the corresponding guidelines to develop them, contemplating at least two levels of analysis (scope and depth), in
         order to contribute to the systematization and transparency of the process. In line with this, institutional capacity of the provincial authorities
         and their respective councils could be strengthened.
      Natural habitats
      •	 Actions to promote an integrated land use planning process in the provincial territories.
      •	 Actions to establish conservation incentive schemes, beyond that existing for native forests.
      •	 Actions to optimize the use of the financial resources available in investment projects to promote effective protection of habitats, and make
         financial provisions to offset any habitat depletion that does occur.
      •	 Actions to strengthen the Federal System of Protected Areas (Sistema Federal de Áreas Protegidas, SIFAP), through updating and improving
         the legal framework; designing financing mechanisms; developing work programs; conducting studies to establish regional conservation
         priorities; designing and implementing a training policy for the staff responsible for the management of protected areas, at all levels; and
         conducting information dissemination campaigns. During the formulation of development projects, the existence of nature conservation
         areas in the area involved could be verified, and funds budgeted to strengthen them.
      Forests
      •	 Develop guidelines and criteria to assist with restoration projects that aim to protect ecosystem biodiversity and functionality.
      •	 Develop a system of zoning (or related) by province or ecoregion to determine areas where it is feasible to develop forestry projects, subject
         to sustainability criteria.
      Pesticide management
      •	 Use of good agricultural practices and integrated pest management.
      •	 Dissemination of good agricultural practices across the various productive systems could be increased through training provided by the
         National Agrifood Health and Quality Service (Servicio Nacional de Sanidad y Calidad Agroalimentaria, SENASA) and the extension service
         of the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria, INTA).
      •	 The National Sanitary Registry of Agricultural Producers (Registro Nacional Sanitario de Productores Agropecuarios, RENSPA) could be
         properly maintained and updated.
      •	 Keep an updated National Argentine System of Pest Monitoring and Surveillance (Sistema Nacional Argentino de Vigilancia y Monitoreo de
         Plagas, SINAVIMO), and also enter into agreements with other agencies and institutions at the provincial level and with farmer associations.
      •	 To monitor the distribution and use of pesticides, at least for the agricultural sector, a traceability system could be put in place, to be
         implemented with farmer organizations and with the Chamber of Agricultural Health and Fertilizers (Cámara de Sanidad Agropecuaria y
         Fertilizantes, CASAFE).
                                                                                                                                       (continued on next page)

 Protection Management (continued)

Physical cultural resources
•	 Provide more resources (economic, administrative, and specialized technical and human resources) and strengthen the existing management
   and control instruments.
•	 Develop improved minimum standards setting the framework for the management and protection of the cultural and natural heritage.
•	 Establish integrated policies and help operationalize management and assessment instruments in a coordinated manner to resolve
   fragmentation of cultural heritage, and the parallelism and coexistence of various legislation and rules.
Indigenous peoples
•	 Augment the existing information on the indigenous population in different parts of the country. The census data could be updated regularly
   using sources such as the National Social Security Administration (Administración Nacional de Seguridad Social, ANSES) (whose forms
   include a question on indigenous status) and programs such as the Essential Public Health Functions Program (Programa de Funciones
   Esenciales de Salud Pública, FESP) and Plan Nacer. The number of indigenous communities that have obtained legal status could be updated
   annually.
•	 To encourage compliance with the provisions of International Labour Organization (ILO) Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989
   (No. 169), provincial and national officials could be trained on the convention and its scope, as well as on interculturality. The projects
   could explicitly include a budget line for this purpose and provide compensation for the time dedicated by the community members to
   the consultation process, including its planning. In general, it has been agreed that the official representative is empowered to validate a
   consultation; however, the records of consultations are signed by all the participants.
Involuntary resettlement
•	 An evaluation of viable project alternatives that help reduce the resettlement scale could be included as a requirement for the approval of
   EIAs or environmental management plans.
•	 To improve the assessment of the adverse impacts caused by land acquisition for projects, the EIA or environmental management plan could
   be required to identify in a precise manner the people and property affected.
•	 To improve the quality and effectiveness of the consultations with displaced people, it is advisable that they be carried out early and in
   an ongoing manner, so that the results can be taken into account in the design and execution of the resettlement program. In the case of
   collective resettlements, the consultation could also comprise the host communities. When the contractors have obligations within the
   consultation process, these could be included in the bidding documents.

                                                    OP 4.01: Environmental Assessment. The Bank requires environmental assessment of projects proposed for Bank financing to help ensure that they are environmentally sound and sustainable, and thus to improve decision
                                                    making. Environmental assessment is a process whose breadth, depth, and type of analysis depend on the nature, scale, and potential environmental impact of the proposed project. Environmental assessment evaluates a project’s
                                                    potential environmental risks and impacts in its area of influence; examines project alternatives; identifies ways of improving project selection, siting, planning, design, and implementation by preventing, minimizing, mitigating,
                                                    or compensating for adverse environmental impacts and enhancing positive impacts; and includes the process of mitigating and managing adverse environmental impacts throughout project implementation. The Bank favors
                                                    preventive measures over mitigatory or compensatory measures, whenever feasible.
                                                    In the federal environmental framework, the relevant authorities (provinces, sectors) are required to       No regulations or law at the federal level on minimum standards for environmental assessments that could               A.1

                                                    Sectors: The road sector stands out for its high levels of consistency.                                     Sectors: Major gaps in water and water resources, agriculture and the rural sector, and fisheries. With the

                                                    OP 4.04: Natural Habitats. The conservation of natural habitats, like other measures that protect and enhance the environment, is essential for long-term sustainable development. The Bank therefore supports the protection,
                                                    maintenance, and rehabilitation of natural habitats and their functions in its economic and sector work, project financing, and policy dialogue. The Bank supports, and expects borrowers to apply, a precautionary approach to natural
                                                    resource management to ensure opportunities for environmentally sustainable development.
                                                    There is agreement on a preventive approach that promotes a positive balance for habitats, including        For noncritical habitats, there is a lack of requirement to search for alternatives to conversion or to include        A.3

                                                    OP 4.36: Forests. The objective of this policy is to assist borrowers to harness the potential of forests to reduce poverty in a sustainable manner, integrate forests effectively into sustainable economic development, and protect the
                                                    vital local and global environmental services and values of forests.

Experience in the Application of
Safeguards

S
     ignificant experience in applying and implementing World Bank environmental and social safeguard
     policies to projects in Argentina has been developed. Some key lessons have been learned or issues
     identified based on the experience of various Argentine project implementing units (PIUs), Bank
safeguard specialists, and other technical specialists. The issues, which should be viewed as opportunities
for improving environmental and social management, have been grouped into the following categories:

•	   Screening and scoping;
•	   Quality;
•	   Team consolidation in PIUs and in the World Bank;
•	   Social management plans;
•	   Institutional strengthening;
•	   Integration of environmental and social issues in project design;
•	   Application and usefulness of public consultation.

    These were not identified based upon a systematic review of all past Bank-financed projects in
Argentina, and thus should not be viewed as necessarily a comprehensive list.


3.1  Screening and Scoping

Experience has shown that there have been problems with the screening and scoping of the environmental
and social impacts and risks of projects. This could be due to lack of capacity or experience, different in-
terpretations of environmental classification criteria, or different interpretations of when certain environ-
mental or social instruments should be applied. In some cases, the political and institutional time pressures
arising from the need to implement a project rapidly may also have been a factor.
     These cases of inadequate screening and scoping have led in some cases to deficiencies in the prepara-
tion of environmental and social impact studies and management plans (including plans for resettlement

Moving Forward

A
     key objective of this report is to serve as a vehicle for dialogue between the government of Argentina
     and the Bank in order to develop and strengthen strategies to address environmental and social
     issues in development projects. Thus, the question is how to move forward with the study results to
promote more effective and efficient development and implementation of environmentally and socially
sustainable Bank-financed projects in Argentina. Two groups of strategies or suggestions are proposed:

•	 Approaches to utilize the results of the Argentine environmental and social regulatory review, specifi-
   cally the synthesis of relevant legislation and gap analysis results (see section 4.1 for details);
•	 How to improve environmental and social management in Bank-financed projects, specifically
   through establishing common goals, government of Argentina understanding and acting upon key
   traits, Bank undertaking actions to help meet the commonly established goals, jointly implementing
   some specific actions, and improving institutional capacity (see section 4.2 for details).

     These suggestions can also be applied to other non-Bank-financed projects in Argentina. More broad-
ly, the strategies in section 4.2 can be applied to projects in other countries financed by the Bank or by
other international financial institutions.


4.1  Utilizing Information and Knowledge from Analysis

The synthesis of the selected Argentine environmental and social legislation developed in this study is a
rich knowledge product that can be useful a tool in various ways. For example, it can:

•	 Act as a database of environmental and social laws and regulations;
•	 Improve the knowledge of Bank staff and others on Argentine environmental and social legislation;
•	 Serve as a basis (background) for new Bank-financed investment lending projects, as well as develop-
   ment policy lending and program for results lending;
•	 Serve as a basis for developing project model documents, such as portions (sections) of environmen-
   tal management frameworks, environmental management plans, and environmental and social im-
   pact assessments.

Conclusions

A
      rgentina has enacted a wide range of legislation at the federal and provincial levels regarding
      environmental and social protection. In general, the regulatory framework at both the federal and
      provincial levels is consistent with and promotes the central objectives of the Bank safeguard policies
related to the identification and mitigation of the potential project environmental and social impacts.
This legislation can serve as the baseline for determining the environmental and social acceptability and
sustainability of a World Bank-financed project, with any potential limitations or gaps related to Bank
safeguard policies conceptually addressed within the framework of developing and implemented project-
specific environmental and social impact and risk management instruments that adequately mitigate all
project-specific impacts and risks based upon good practice.
     Some important lessons learned have been identified based on the experience in applying and imple-
menting Bank environmental and social safeguard policies to projects in Argentina. While they were not
identified based upon a systematic review of all past Bank-financed projects, they clearly can be used to sig-
nificantly improve efficiency and effectiveness of project environmental and social management. Specific
opportunities for improvement are identified for screening and scoping; quality; team consolidation in
PIUs and in the Bank; social management plans; institutional strengthening; integration of environmen-
tal and social issues in project design; and application and usefulness of public consultation.
     There are clearly ways to promote more effective and efficient development and implementation of
environmentally and socially sustainable Bank-financed projects in Argentina. The strategies presented are
also applicable to non-Bank-financed projects in Argentina, and in many cases, more broadly, to projects
in other countries financed by the Bank or by other international financial institutions.
     One set of strategies developed relates to utilizing the results of the Argentine environmental and so-
cial regulatory review, specifically the synthesis of relevant legislation and gap analysis results. For exam-
ple, the synthesis of the selected Argentine environmental and social legislation is a rich knowledge prod-
uct that can be used as a database of legislation; to improve the knowledge of Bank staff and others; and to
serve as background for new Bank-financed lending projects and development of standard or model proj-
ect documents. The comparison of Argentine legislation and Bank safeguard policies can help in planning
and programming between the government of Argentina and the Bank (for example in identifying proj-
ects, sectors, or provinces that offer opportunities or issues) and establishing Bank-financeable projects in
a more cost-effective and time-efficient manner, while providing the opportunity to focus on specific issues
(including gaps); define priorities for government and Bank supervision based upon projects; and iden-
tify specific topics for project stakeholder training (or more broadly, sector- or ministry-level training).

Gap Analysis Summary

A.1  Environmental Assessment

Consistencies and Gaps

The main coincidences in the environmental management frameworks occur in the use of impact evalu-
ation instruments and mitigation plans. The use of EIA as an instrument for the evaluation and mitiga-
tion of environmental impacts is common to the national regulations and those of most of the provinc-
es, with several of these laws including the concept of public hearings or consultations for projects with
potential negative and significant impacts. However, regarding the contents of the environmental assess-
ments, some omissions and differences can be seen when comparing provinces as a whole. In the case of
the sectors at the national level, the road sector stands out because of its good consistency and coincidence
with the guidelines of the OP.
     It is also important to underline that the regulations at the national level include the requirement of
holding a public hearing or consultation and citizen participation for the permitting of activities with neg-
ative and significant effects. This stipulation is also included in three of the sectors reviewed (thermoelec-
tric power plants, gas transmission and distribution, and mining).
     The main gaps in the environmental assessment framework were identified as categorization, min-
imum contents of EIAs, technical impartiality, and public consultation. With regard to categorization,
there is a limited use of filters to prioritize and differentiate the type and depth of EIA work in accordance
with the level of risk.
     Regarding the minimum contents of the EIAs, they are not specified by all regulatory frameworks.
In the cases where they are, there are differences across provinces, and in turn discrepancies with the pro-
visions of OP 4.01 (mainly in the detailed definition of the area of influence, in the consideration of the
legal and institutional framework, and in the identification of feasible alternatives and their systematic
comparison). There is also inconsistency in the inclusion of indirect or cumulative impacts that would be
evaluated through a regional or sectorwide EIA.
     Another gap that was found relates to technical impartiality in the development of an EIA, since with
the exception of the framework in force for road works and mining, neither independent experts nor in-
ternationally recognized ones are required for high-risk projects.
     Finally, gaps related to public consultation were identified, as there is provision only for a single con-
sultation once the EIA studies have been completed, normally in the form of a public hearing, and in

Study Workshop

O
     n December 6, 2011, a draft version of the study outlined in this executive summary was presented
     in the City of Buenos Aires. The presentation was made jointly by the National Directorate of
     Projects with International Credit Organizations (Dirección Nacional de Proyectos con Organismos
Internacionales de Crédito, DNPOIC) and the World Bank and was attended by 94 participants, most of
them environmental and social specialists from the implementing units of World Bank-funded projects.
     During the event, the methodology used in the study and the main findings regarding social and en-
vironmental issues were discussed.


Participants’ Comments

After the presentations a plenary was held, where participants expressed the following views:

•	 The study was found to be interesting and, regarding the rules on indigenous peoples, there were no
   significant gaps with the Bank’s operational principles. It was also suggested that work was required
   on the following actions: institutional strengthening, as currently there was no coordination area at
   the provincial level responsible for articulating the indigenous peoples safeguards across different proj-
   ects; human resources training (at the provincial and national level); increased capacity to respond to
   safeguard issues in the World Bank’s team; highlighting the weight of the indigenous peoples issue in
   Bank-funded projects.
•	 The study presented during the day was found to be an excellent opportunity to establish a threshold
   serving as a basis for the application of the operational principles and thus knowing what is the start-
   ing point of the discussion when beginning project design and planning; the initiative was welcomed
   and supported as a first step for successful operations. It was also considered that active and perma-
   nent participation of SAyDS and INAI was required; additionally there was a suggestion to conduct
   a review of information systems.
•	 The analysis of OP 4.09 was considered to be interesting. It was also suggested that discussion should
   start on environmental health, a concept that brings together health and the environment. Mention
   was also made of the importance of mapping environment-related health issues, including environ-
   mental risks and polluted sites.
