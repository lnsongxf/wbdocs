This chapter can be situated after chapter 4 “b” – Strategic Infrastructure Projects National Company).
In case a new stated owned company is created to manage the E-vignette and Toll system the new chapter and
provision may follow the structure of the preceding chapter regarding the Strategic Infrastructure Project National
Company.
In addition the provisions should include: financing of the company may and the essential terms of the contract
between Toll Charger and Toll Operator. The essential terms may be part of the ordinance under art. 10 and only a
reference to be made to that provision.
While the collection of fees shall be made by the state company, including via the toll operators, the imposition
and collection of fines can be left to the RIA or the SPE. In view of the above the current legal framework as to the
control, imposition and collection of sanctions will not require substantive amendments (except for the amendments
related to the electronic control and imposition of sanctions, as mentioned below in the third section of this working
document).

• Consequently everyone was aware knew that the system would be launched and
when. This is contrast with Ecotaxe in France, where the government didn’t want to
start any communications whilst there was uncertainty over the start date.
• Emphasis was also placed in communications on the relationship between the
kilometer-based charge and users’ actual use of the network. This resulted in
users’ perception that the charge would be fairer than the previous time based

D Document Maintenance
This document will be reviewed and updated as
needed, as the project proceeds through each
phase. Lessons learned as a result of continuing staff
management efforts will be captured at the end of
each project phase and used to improve the project.


E Relationship between this Master
Project Management Plan (MPP) and the
Contractor’s Project Management Plan (PMP)
The MPP is developed and controlled by the project
management team and is the highest-level project
management document. The MPP is for the project
management team to manage the entire process of
system implementation, bringing the system into
operation, and continuing operations.
