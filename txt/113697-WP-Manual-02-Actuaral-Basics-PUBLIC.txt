4             ACTUARIAL BASICS
Preface and Acknowledgements
Five manuals were prepared by IFC for the development of agri-insurance markets where the public and
private sectors work together in a partnership (PPP). The manuals are designed to strengthen the capacity
of the government and market players to effectively design agri-insurance products, both traditional
indemnity and index, introduce them to the market, and build sales. The manuals are designed to be
succinct yet at the same time sufficient to create the technical and administrative foundation for a modern
agri-insurance system, and to allow programs in early stages of development to properly plan the required
system. Finally the manuals are designed to train practitioners, to build local capacity for skills that are
required to start the program, and to enable the program to grow over time.

The principle author of the manuals is Professor Myles Watts, University Professor, Lead Actuary at Watts
& Associates, Member of the Board at the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, and 5th Generation
Montana Farmer. Watts and Associates designed and launched numerable agri-insurance products in
North America, frequently consults for the major reinsurers, and supports insurance programs around the
world. They have established their own index insurance company, eWeatherRisk. The manuals incorporate
practical lessons learned over the past 40 years.

The development of the manuals was a joint activity of the Ukraine Agri-Insurance Project (2007-2015),
IFC’s Global Agri-Finance Team, and the Global Index Insurance Facility (GIIF) (2009 to present). Dr. Gary
Reusche led the Ukrainian project, served as a technical specialist on the global agri-ﬁnance team, and as
a member of the GIIF technical committee and core management team. Agri-insurance development is
closely linked to agricultural ﬁnance and value chains and they are effectively developed in unison.

The manuals result from training workshops developed by the agri-insurance project in Ukraine and globally
by GIIF technical experts. The entire agri-insurance team in Ukraine made practical contributions to the
manuals, with special recognition due to Victoria Yakubovich for collecting, organizing and preparing the
initial drafts and Andrey Zaripov a member of the GIIF team for helping to develop the reinsurance and cash
ﬂow models. The project team included experts from the Alberta (Canada) provincial agri-insurance program,
in particular Richard McConnell, who contributed his experience and expertise to the training activities.

Peer review and Spanish language translations of the manual resulted from IBRD consultants in Central and
South America, especially Pablo R. Valdivia Zelaya and Roberto Dario Bacchini.

The team is grateful to Professor Gary Brester for his practical contributions and editing of the manuals
and Olesya Zhuchenko for coordinating the publication of the manuals, working with designers to plan the
layout, and printing.

Finally support for the manuals was provided by the Canadian government, and the Global Index Insurance
Facility (GIIF) lead by Gilles Jacques Galludec (Program Manager) funded by the European Union, Japan and
the Netherlands.

6        ACTUARIAL BASICS
1.0.       Introduction
This manual presents theoretical concepts and applied methods
commonly used for actuarial processes in agriculture insurance. Actuarial
processes refer to the activities that establish insurance premium rates
and related quantitative analyses. Key considerations for designing
agriculture insurance programs are presented. In addition, the inﬂuence
of program design on data requirements and the use of statistical
methods for establishing insurance premiums are illustrated.

The presentation presumes that readers have a solid understanding of
basic statistics principles. The level of knowledge would be equivalent to
material contained in an introductory university-level statistics textbook.
Readers are encouraged to familiarize themselves with basic statistical
principles, including descriptive statistics, hypothesis tests, sampling,
regression analysis, and distribution theory.

Although most of this document is devoted to actuarial issues, program
design features are noted throughout. For conciseness, the manual
will discuss actuarial processes associated with a speciﬁc agricultural
insurance product: yield insurance. The principles and methods presented
are, in general, applicable to other crop insurance products, but every
insurance product has unique features that further complicate actuarial
processes.

1.1.       Stakeholder Interest
The major stakeholder groups associated with agriculture insurance
are agricultural producers, insurance ﬁrms, and governments. Each has
different, and sometimes opposing, interests.

Agricultural Producers want to generate net income, recover production
costs, gain access to credit, improve expected proﬁtability, and reduce risk.

Insurance Firms want to generate proﬁ t for shareholders, diversify risk
portfolios, and avoid losses. This sector includes both issuing agencies
(those ﬁrms that market and often service insurance contracts) and
reinsurers (ﬁrms that accept most of the risk acquired by issuing agencies
in exchange for fees).

Governments often seek to stabilize rural incomes, stabilize and expand
agricultural output, and provide disaster relief. Government roles can
range from providing all aspects of an agricultural insurance program to
providing regulatory oversight and legal structures.

2.0.        Crop Insurance Basics
Crop insurance shares many elements associated with other forms of
insurance. The purchaser of an insurance contract pays a premium to an
issuing agency to transfer undesirable outcome risks. Actuarially sound
premiums are established such that expected indemnities (payouts in
the case of insured events) and costs of providing insurance are offset by
premium collections. An issuing agency often pays a reinsurer to accept
much of the risk that has been acquired through the sale of insurance
contracts.

2.1.       Deﬁnitions
Indemnity Payments represent a transfer of funds from an insurer to an
insured party in order to partially or fully compensate for insured losses.

Deductibles are the portions of a claim that are not off set by an
insurance product in the case of a loss. An insurance purchaser must
absorb the deductible before an insurer will provide an indemnity
payment.

Coverage Level is one minus the deductible:

                       Coverage Level = 1 – Deductible
Expected Yield is the weighted (usually by probability of occurrence)
average of all possible yields. Often, it is estimated by the simple average
of historical yields.

Trigger Yield: A yield below the trigger yield justiﬁes an indemnity
payment.

                  Trigger Yield = Expected Yield x Coverage
Liability represents the maximum possible indemnity payment. This
occurs if the insured experiences a complete loss (i.e., the harvested yield
is zero):

          Liability = Expected Yield x Coverage x Commodity Price
Liability increases as deductibles decline (i.e., as coverage levels increase).

Pure Risk Premium is the expected indemnity. The expected indemnity
is the weighted (usually by probability of occurrence) average of all
possible indemnity payments.

Pure Risk Premium Rate is calculated by dividing the Pure Risk Premium
by the Liability:

           Pure Risk Premium Rate = Pure Risk Premium/Liability
Load is the cost of servicing an insurance contract.

Load Rate is calculated by dividing the Load by the Liability.

                          Load Rate =Load/Liability
Total Premium represents the price that an insured pays for insurance
contract and is the sum of the pure risk premium and the load.

                Total Premium = Pure Risk Premium + Load



8       ACTUARIAL BASICS
Total Premium Rates are often stated as a proportion of liability.

                                   Total Premium Rate = Total Premium/Liability
A Subsidy is the proportion of a total premium rate that is paid by a government or an entity other than the
insured party.

Subsidy Rate is calculated as a proportion of the total premium.

                                       Subsidy Rate = Subsidy/Total Premium
Producer Premiums are calculated as the total premium less any applicable subsidies. It represents a
producer’s cost of insurance:

                             Producer Premium = (1 – Subsidy Rate) x (Total Premium)
2.1.1. Yield Insurance Example: Suppose that a producer wants to insure a wheat crop against potential
weather-related perils. Assume the following values:

                                                  Deductible = 40%
                                            Pure Risk Premium Rate = 6%
                                                   Load Rate = 3%
                                                 Subsidy Rate = 25%
                                            Price of Output (wheat) = 1.0
                                                  1 hectare is insured
Liability is based on average yields. Suppose that the producer has the following production history:



                                     Year      Historical Yield (tons per hectare)

                                       1                         2.7
                                       2                         3.6
                                       3                         2.4
                                       4                         3.3




                                      Expected (or average) yield = 3.0 tons/ha
                           Liability = (Expected Yield) x (Coverage) x (Price) x (Area) =
                                (3 tons / ha) x (1 – 0.4) x ( $1 / ton) x (1.0 ha) = $1.80
                 Total Premium Rate = (Load Rate + Pure Risk Premium Rate) = (3% + 6%) = 9%
                    Total Premium = (Liability x Total Premium Rate) = ( $1.80) x (0.09) = $0.162
                     Subsidy = (Subsidy Rate) x (Total Premium) = (0.25) x ( $0.162) = $0.0405
             Producer Premium = (1 – Subsidy Rate) x (Total Premium) = (1-0.25) x ( $0.162) = $0.1215
                Trigger Yield = (Coverage) x (Expected Yield) = (1 – 0.4) x (3 tons/ha) = 1.8 tons/ha
If actual yield is greater than the indemnity trigger, no indemnity is paid. For example, if the actual yield is 2
tons/ha, then an indemnity is not generated. If actual yield is less than the indemnity trigger, however, then an
indemnity is due. If the actual harvest yield totals 1 ton/ha, then the indemnity payment is calculated as:

                     Indemnity payment = (Trigger Yield – Yield Outcome) x (Price) x (Area) =
                               (1.8 tons/ha – 1 tons/ha) x ( $1/ton) x (1.0 ha) = $0.80

                                                                                                    MANUAL 2         9
3.0.       Data
Insurance premium rates are generally established using statistical
estimation methods applied to historical data. That is, the probability
of the occurrence of an insured event is determined by the historical
frequency of its occurrence. Consequently, appropriate estimation
methods must be used to accurately forecast the probability of future
occurrence. In addition, the quality and quantity of historical data
greatly inﬂuence the accuracy of premium rating. Data must be carefully
reviewed and analyzed. These reviews can range from simple graphs
and plots to complex statistical analyses. If possible, data should be
cross-referenced with other sources, evaluated by well-informed market
participants, and compared to other variables that are correlated over
time. Data collection and sampling techniques must be scrutinized.
Finally, data generation and analyses must be documented so that future
analysis, reinsurance, and updating can be conducted appropriately.

3.1.       Data Quality
Data quality depends on sampling, availability, collection, entry, and
accuracy. Analysts must recognize that data quality varies for many
reasons. Hence, it is important that data be evaluated for accuracy and
relevancy. Special care must be taken to identify systematic anomalies.
For example, if missing farm-level yield data occur most frequently when
regional yields or growing season participation were low, then missing
yields may signal a systematic problem. Systematic problems must be
addressed prior to developing premium rates. The determination of such
systematic problems often requires actuarial expertise.

3.1.1. Data Cleaning refers to the practice of identifying and managing
outlier observations and other irregularities that result from collection,
transcription, coding, entry, or other errors. For example, a producer’s
yield data could contain an observation several times greater than the
mean of the observations obtained by a group of producers from the
same region (e.g., an observation of 30 tons/hectare when the mean of
the data is 3.0 tons/hectare). After careful review of all internal data
management processes, several options exist to manage such anomalies
including: (1) deleting the outlier observation, (2) replacing the outlier
observation with a more “reasonable” estimate, or (3) revisiting the initial
reporting and coding activities of individuals.

The last option is often prohibitively expensive because of temporal,
spatial, and volume considerations. Consequently, average regional yields
are often used as replacements for outliers in the case of individual yield
data. Nonetheless, insurance indemnities are triggered by low yields.
While the preceding example of a 30 ton/hectare yield is implausible, a
very small yield (e.g., 0.30 tons/hectare) is a possibility. Plausible high
yields are also important for insurance rating because premiums and
indemnity payments are based on expected yields.

When using relatively small data sets, graphs often help identify outliers,
missing observations, and other anomalies. For larger data sets, software
must often be used to uncover such anomalies. After review, certain
observations may need to be deleted from a data set so that the rating
process remains unbiased.




10      ACTUARIAL BASICS
Often, judgment must be used when cleaning data. Consequently, the process is somewhat subjective.
Therefore, it is important to include experienced personnel throughout the process. The removal or
replacement of speciﬁc data points can have a substantial inﬂuence on the rating process.

3.1.2. Missing Data points result from a variety of causes. In some cases, a data point may not have been
created because a crop was not produced. In other cases, records may not be available. In addition, simple data
entry errors can occur.

A missing data point creates two problems. First, information about the actual value of that observation (if any)
is lost, causing problems for rating the process.

A second problem is created because electronic databases often require that a data entry point exist, even if it is
unavailable. For example, if a zero is entered for a data point that was actually missing, then the rating process
assumes that the yield for that year was actually zero. In fact, only seldom do we encounter situations that
result in an actual zero yields. Some data management software considers a blank to be a missing observation.
If a value must be entered, one needs to enter an implausible number as an indicator of a missing observation.
For example, a missing observation may be indicated by entering a number such as -999.

Every reasonable effort should be made to obtain correct values for missing data. If the missing values cannot
be obtained, then analyses may be necessary to evaluate whether the missing data is systematic, which usually
requires sophisticated techniques. For example, if farm data appear to be more frequently missing when
regional yields or precipitation has been low, then further investigation is warranted. If missing data are deemed
to be highly systematic, then the data may have to be abandoned.

4.0.        Actuarial Methods
Actuarial rating methods include activities used to determine liability,
liability triggers, pure risk premiums, and loads.

4.1.       Determining Liability and Indemnity Triggers
A variety of methods can be used to determine liability and indemnity
triggers, including average yields, indexing, regional yields, and transition
yields.

4.1.1. Farmer Average Yield. The most common way to determine a
Yield Indemnity Trigger is to multiply an individual farmer’s historical
average (expected yield) by a selected coverage level:
                                           ,
where is the indemnity trigger, is the coverage level, and         is a
farmer’s historical arithmetic mean or average yield. This approach is
easily understandable and commonly used. However, if the sample used
to determine     is relatively small, then the variance of the expected yield
may be large. For example, let       be the variance of yield, X. Then, the
variance of the average yield is:

                                               .

As n declines, the estimated variability of        increases.

4.1.2. Indexing procedures determine liability by comparing individual
farm yields to other information (such as regional yields) to ascertain if
abnormally high or low individual yields were consistent with regional
experiences. This approach may also be used to account for changes in
technology causing yields to trend upwards over time.

4.1.3. Regional Yields. It is also possible to use regional expected
yields as a proxy for individual expected yields. This method is simple
and, because it does not require individual farm-level data, is less data
intensive. Nonetheless, this approach masks actual differences in yields
among farms. Consequently, the approach often increases problems
related to adverse selection.

4.1.4. Transition Yields. If farm-level data are used to establish
liability, provisions may be necessary for those farmers who have no
historical data but wish to purchase crop insurance. Usually, regional
yields (or a proportion thereof) may be used for this purpose. Actual farm
yields are substituted for transition yields as data become available.

4.2.       Commodity Pricing
Establishing a commodity price for each insured agricultural product is
necessary for calculating liability, premiums, and indemnity payments.
For yield insurance, a single price is stipulated in insurance contracts prior
to purchase. This price is used to calculate the value of yield losses should
an indemnity be triggered. The price is also a component of calculating
liability and premiums.

In the above yield insurance example, a commodity price was needed to
calculate liability. In turn, the selected price affects premium and subsidy
calculations as well as indemnity payments.



12      ACTUARIAL BASICS
Expected commodity prices used in insurance contracts can be estimated in a variety of ways including:
      • Historical average prices;
      • Price forecasts from experts;
      • Costs of production;
      • Futures markets.
Where such markets exist, using futures markets is the most common approach. In cases where domestic
futures markets do not exist, foreign futures contract prices may need to be adjusted by exchange rates.
However, such processes may increase the price basis embedded in insurance contracts.

If actual commodity prices are lower than the previously agreed upon insured price, farmers have an incentive
to seek indemnity payments rather than market their production. To avoid the associated moral hazard,
commodity price selections for indemnity calculations should be sufficiently low to encourage crop stewardship
and harvesting rather than the pursuit of indemnity payments.

4.3.         Farm-Level Actuarial Processes
Farm-level actuarial processes begin with estimates of pure risk premium rates. Rating is conducted using an
empirical process, a parametric process, or a combination of the two. Empirical rating methods use historical
data to calculate premiums directly. Parametric rating methods use speciﬁc probability distributions to
establish premium rates. Distributions are selected based on their similarity to the believed (although unknown)
underlying yield generating function. A selected distribution’s parameters are usually estimated from historical
data. Parametric rating methods are often used in cases where historical data are not of sufficient quantity or
quality to allow the use of empirical rating methods. The most common probability distributions used to rate
insurance products include normal, triangular, uniform, log-normal, beta, and extreme value distributions. In
general, the quantity and quality of historical data dictate the choice of rating method.

4.3.1.    Pure Risk Premium Rate Calculation. Assume that:

(1)      is the indemnity payment associated with a random event;

(2)       is a random variable that quantiﬁes the outcome of a random event. This could be crop yields (for yield
       insurance), or precipitation (for weather index insurance products);

(3)      is an indemnity trigger (calculated by multiplying the coverage level by the expected yield).

(4)    Price is equal to 1 for simplicity of exposition (hence, it does not appear in the following calculations).




                                                                                                     MANUAL 2        13
Indemnity payments are calculated as:

                                                            if X < t
                                                    I = 0 if X ≥ t
Let       be the probability density function of    . Then, the expected indemnity is:




Because yields are truncated at zero and indemnities are likewise zero at levels above , integration only needs to
occur for values of X between 0 and such that:




where F(t) is the cumulative density of X at t.

The term                    is the expected indemnity when an indemnity is paid. This term represents the
severity of indemnity payments . The term       is the probability that an indemnity payment will be paid and is
called the frequency of indemnity payments.

Insurance companies need to understand both the severity and frequency of indemnity payments to determine
the level of required ﬁnancial reserves and servicing costs. For example, loss adjusting is heavily dependent on
frequency of losses while necessary ﬁnancial reserves are dependent on both frequency and severity of losses.

The expected indemnity is: E(I) = Severity x Frequency

The Pure Risk Premium Rate (w) is equal to the expected indemnity payment divided by the liability (or trigger):




Notice the liability and trigger are equal because price has been set equal to 1. Even if price is not equal to 1, the
pure risk premium rate is unaffected by price because price would appear in both the numerator and denominator
of the pure risk premium rate. However, premiums (as opposed to the premium rate) and indemnity payments
are affected by price.

For a discrete case:

                                                                                       ,

where     is ordered so that the ﬁrst    values are those below the indemnity trigger . Then,




4.3.2. Empirical Rating Processes involve calculating the size of an indemnity payment each time it would
have been triggered within an historical set of data or using actual loss histories from an existing insurance
program. The frequency of occurrence is calculated by dividing the number of indemnity occurrences by the
total number of observations in the data set. Severity is calculated by summing the total value of indemnity
payments over the data set and dividing it by the number of indemnity occurrences.

Multiplying frequency by severity provides the expected indemnity payment.

                                                 Acreage = 1 hectare
                                                Price = 1 UAH per ton
                                                  Deductible = 40%
In addition, the producer has the following yield history, for which the indemnity trigger and payments are:

Therefore,

                                          Expected Yield = Mean Yield = 3.0
and,

                                         Coverage = (1 – deductible) = 60% .
The Indemnity Trigger yield for this example is calculated as:

                                                 Indemnity Trigger
                              = (Coverage) x (Expected Yield) = (0.60)x(3) = 1.8 tons/ha.
An indemnity is paid in any year in which actual yield outcome is less than 1.8 tons/ha. The actual yield outcome
is lower than the indemnity trigger in years 2 and 7. Indemnity payments are calculated as:

                                               Indemnity Payment year 2
                                 = (Indemnity Trigger – Yield Outcomeyear 2) x (Price)
                                         = (1.80 – 1.72)x(1) = 0.08 UAH/ha

                                               Indemnity Payment year 7
                                 = (Indemnity Trigger – Yield Outcomeyear 7) x (Price)
                                         = (1.80 – 0.32)(1) = 1.48 UAH/ha.
The severity is:
                                          Severity = (0.08 + 1.48) / 2 = 0.78.
The frequency is:
                                               Frequency = 2/10 = 0.20.




                                                                                                      MANUAL 2              15
The expected indemnity is:

                                    E(I) = severity x frequency = (0.78)(0.20) = 0.156.
The expected indemnity payment can also be calculated as:




In this case, the liability is calculated as:

                                           Liability = Indemnity Trigger x Price.
                                                  Given that Price = 1.0,
                                                   Liability = 1.8 x 1.0.
The pure risk rate is calculated as the quotient of the expected indemnity payment and the liability:




Assuming a load of 3%, the total premium rate is 11.87% or (0.1187). The total premium is 0.1187 times the liability
of 1.8, or 0.2136 UAH/ha. This example is presented for illustration purposes only. Ten observations are not
sufficient for actuarially sound rating processes. In addition, the price of a commodity greatly inﬂuences total
liability.

4.3.3. Parametric Rating. A variety of parametric rating approaches can be used. The most common
distributions used for this purpose are the uniform, triangular, normal, log-normal, beta, and extreme value
functions. The general approach is to estimate or assume a speciﬁc distribution of yields and then calculate pure
risk rates, premiums, and indemnities based on the selected distribution. The parameters of the distribution
may be calculated from historical data or may be based on agronomic or other information.

4.3.3.1. The Uniform Distribution is the simplest to use and provides an upper bound for premium rates.
The uniform distribution is bounded by a minimum and a maximum, and every outcome between the two is
presumed to have equal probability of occurrence. The uniform distribution has two parameters – a minimum
value (a) and maximum value (b).

The Cumulative Distribution Function (cdf) for the uniform distribution (ﬁgure 4.1) is:

Pros and Cons of using the Uniform Distribution:

Pros:
     1.   The uniform distribution is simple and easily understood. If a=0, then the premium rate is the coverage
          level divided by 4 which can be quickly calculated.
     2. The process results in conservative estimates of premium rates (upper bounds) relative to more realistic
        distributions.
     3. If empirical premium rates obtained from actual loss histories are larger than those obtained from
        a uniform distribution, then the underlying data set may reﬂect problems such as substantial fraud
        inﬂuences.

Cons:
     1.   Most yield distributions are unimodal and the mode does not exist for the uniform distribution.
     2. Premium rates are often higher than those obtained from more realistic distributions.
     3. The uniform distribution is very inﬂexible. One can obtain unrealistic values for the a and b parameters
        even if reasonable estimates of mean and variance are used.

  Note: When a distribution for a random yield is unknown, there is some justiﬁ cation from statistical theory for using a
  “diffuse prior,” such as a uniform distribution.

Furthermore, if the median is less than the mean, then the mode, d, must be less than b/2. For example, if the
median = 0.866 and mean =1, then d < b/2 so the second set of equations is used to ﬁnd b = 2.366 and d=0.634.

Pros and Cons of Using the Triangular Distribution:

Pros:
  1.    It is simple and often provides reasonable approximations to other unimodal distributions.
  2. Usually, rates obtained from the triangular distribution are close (although slightly larger) than those
     obtained from a normal distribution if the data are symmetric. But, the rates obtained from the triangular
     distribution are easier to calculate.

Cons:
  1.    In some situations, the triangular distribution may be too restrictive. For example, selected standard
        deviations and means (perhaps obtained from empirical data) may result in unrealistic values for the
        parameters a, b, and d. For example, assume that a is believed to be equal to 0. The smallest variance
        that can be modeled with the triangular distribution is where


                                                                 ,

                                since,                    then                           .


Or where d=b/2 (symmetry) is the value of d that yields the smallest variance. Therefore, the smallest possible
variance is


                                          and                                        .


Assuming that a=0, the largest variance is where d=0 or where b=d since                      . Both result in


                                                             .


Therefore, the triangular distribution, when a=0, must meet the requirement that


                                                                         .

Note that all of the change in variance when a=0 occurs because of changes in d or skewness. The variance is
not affected by changes in kurtosis since it is a constant. Thus, a drawback of this distribution is that the range
of variance is limited and kurtosis is predetermined.

Because of the simplicity of the triangular distribution, it is commonly used to rate insurance products.
However, practitioners need to be aware of its limits. In particular, the kurtosis in the data should be compared
to -3/5 and the yield variance needs to be in the required range.

4.3.3.3. The Normal Distribution (ﬁgure 4.5) is the most widely used distribution in statistical analyses and
has many desirable properties. However, it is complex and has no closed-formed solution for its cumulative
distribution function.

The normal distribution has several interesting properties, including:
     1.   Any linear transformation of normally distributed variables is also normally distributed.
     2. The Central Limit Theorem states that the mean of a sufficiently large number of independent random
        variables, each with ﬁnite mean and variance, will be approximately normally distributed.

Pros and Cons of Using the Normal Distribution:

Pros:
  1.    The normal distribution depends upon two parameters for which we have the most conﬁdence in
        estimating – mean and variance.
  2. Experience has shown that the normal distribution is widely applicable to many situations. For example,
     consider the distribution of yields on each hectare of a given ﬁeld. That distribution can be further
     separated into yields distributed across each square meter within each hectare. Hence, producing an
     average yield for a ﬁeld is a process of aggregating averages upon averages. Thus, the central limit
     theorem suggests that the yield of a given ﬁeld should be close to normally distributed.

Cons:
  1.    The normal distribution encompasses unrealistic negative values for yields. Methods that account for
        truncations at zero yields are available, but usually result in ad hoc assumptions and must be used carefully.
  2. Depending upon the Central Limit Theorem to justify the normal distribution is problematic because it
     is premised on individual observations being independently distributed. Weather generally causes yields
     to be spatially correlated even within relatively expansive regions. Hence, this violates the tenets of the
     central limit theorem.
  3. The normal distribution is symmetric and does not allow for skewness. This restricts the distribution’s
     ﬂexibility for many yield outcomes.
  4. The normal distribution’s kurtosis is also predetermined so that the distribution may not be sufficiently
     ﬂexible to be used in certain situations.

Even with these shortcomings, the normal distribution is widely used for rating many insurance products.

Properties:
  (1) The           is normally distributed;
  (2) Distribution is skewed to the right with long tail;
  (3)                .

The log-normal distribution is used for speciﬁc modeling procedures. Substantial research supports the
premise that prices are distributed log-normally. Although yields are not usually well-represented by log
normal distributions, revenue distributions (            ) may be approximated reasonably well by log-normal
distributions.




26       ACTUARIAL BASICS
4.3.3.5. The Beta Distribution is characterized by a highly ﬂexible
functional form with a ﬁnite range. It is complicated because it contains
the Beta function. Although widely used for statistical and research
purposes, its use in rating processes has been less frequent. It is ﬂexible
to the point of being highly sensitive to outliers. However, efforts to
reﬁne its use may result in greater future applications.
4.3.3.6. Extreme Value Functions are a combination of functions rather
than a single unique function. Usually, it is a collection of exponential
functions which often includes the normal function. After estimating the
distributions for each of these functions, the one with the thickest tail to
the left is often selected. It has been widely applied in South American
areas that are prone to ﬂooding. The Gumbel function is a member of the
extreme value function and is probably the most widely used. Extreme
value functions are often used when insured events occur infrequently (low
frequency) but generate high indemnities (high severity). Rates are usually
high relative to “true,” but unknown, expected indemnities.
4.3.4. Choice of Distribution. Rates obtained from parametric
distributions are often compared to those obtained from empirical rating
processes. The choice of distribution function is often a matter of
judgment. A variety of tests can be used to provide guidance in this
process. However, such tests are weak and inconclusive. Mean and
standard deviation estimates calculated from available data are usually

used as parameters in selected distribution functions. The standard

deviation of skewness and kurtosis are approximately        and     , where



n is sample size. A simple test for skewness and kurtosisis illustrated using
the following estimated statistics.
Skewness = 0.30
Kurtosis = 0.20
n = 64

Recall that the normal distribution has zero skewness and a kurtosis of
3. Therefore, tests for normality are conducted based on the following
t-tests:

Skewness:           = 0.40.



Kurtosis:           =         = -0.93.

Neither test provides evidence of non-normality. Even so, practitioners
should not be lulled into using any distribution without substantial
analyses. More sophisticated tests are available. However, these tests
often provide little added insight. Analyses should not only include
statistical tests, but also graphical approaches, histograms, and other
more elementary efforts.

4.4. Regional Level Actuarial Methods
Farm-level data are often less than desirable in terms of quality, quantity, and historical length for rating
processes. In such cases, regional data are often used to complement limited farm-level data. However, the use
of regional data requires speciﬁc actuarial procedures.
4.4.1. Deﬁciencies of Long Term Farm Data. Sufficiently long time series data at the farm-level are often
not available. However, regional data (for example, at the country or district level) may be available for as many
as 35-50 years. Regional data are not as variable as farm-level data because the former are developed from
averages of the latter. In addition, farm-level data may only be available for a relatively short period of time (say,
6-10 years) across multiple farms. The challenge is to adopt an appropriate yield distribution using both farm-
level and regional data that represents the true underlying variability of farm-level data. Both empirical and
parametric approaches are used to extract such information. However, the logic used in both methods is similar.
In general, regional yield variance is identiﬁed. Any remaining variability is allocated to the farm-level. This
process is similar to variance decompositions, analysis of variance, and bootstrapping approaches.
4.4.2. Variance Decomposition Approaches. Variance decompositions are used to combine longer term
regional data with shorter term farm-level data. This allows for the variability of farm-level data to be projected
over a longer time period through its relationship to regional level data.
Farm-level variance is decomposed into regional variance and farm-level residual variance. We ﬁrst review the
statistical notion of the variance of a sum before discussing this decomposition.

4.4.2.1. Variance of the Sum of Variables. Let              and     be two random variables that are paired so that
and     occur simultaneously and     . Then:


                                        , where df is the degrees of freedom.


Note that                     and deﬁning                  and




                                      where,       is the correlation between x and z

If   and    are linearly independent, then                and, consequently,                    .

4.4.2.2. Variance Decomposition. For simplicity, assume that farm-level mean yields are equal within a
region. For those years in which farm-level data are available, regional yields are subtracted from farm-level
yields. The difference is referred to as the farm residual or farm deviation. Because in each year the regional
yield is the average of farm yields, the farm residuals across farms for each year sum to zero. Because each farm-
level average yield is equal to the regional average yield by assumption, the sum of the farm residuals over time
for each farm will also equal zero. Mathematically, this process is:

Let Rt = regional yield in year t=1,T, and Xi,t = farm i’s yield in year t, i=1, n; t=k,T. So, there are T years of regional
yields, and n farms with T-K+1 years of yields.

Then, the farm residuals are vi,t = Xi,t -Rt   i=1, n and t = K,T

As mentioned above,                                 and


It follows that:                  .

The vi,t ’s are farm-level yields and will be used directly in the empirical rating process. For parametric rating
processes, the standard deviation of vi,t is used.

28       ACTUARIAL BASICS
An interesting property is that farm residuals and regional yields are linearly independent. To illustrate, let
regional average yield over years K to T and the covariance between the regional yields and farm residuals is:




because the sum of the vi,t ’s equals 0. Therefore, the regional variance plus the farm-level residual variance is
equal to total farm-level variance.

For purposes of rating accuracy, it is important to use as much information as possible. In this case, the
information from long term regional data is combined with short term farm-level data (residuals). The
information about regional variability uses all T years. The most information about the residual farm variability
is incorporated by including all of the v ’s over n farms from T-K+1 years.

At least 5-6 years of observations for at least 35 representative farmers are necessary to apply the above
procedure. There should also be a balance between the number of years and the number of farms. For example,
it would be acceptable to have 10 years of observations for 20 representative farms rather than 5 years of data
for 40 representative farms.

4.4.3. Rating. The previously developed decomposition of farm-level variability can be used either for
empirical or parametric rating.

4.4.3.1. Empirical Rating. The challenge is to develop a sufficiently large data set that captures farm-level
variability and other characteristics representative of farm-level yields. The data can be generated by randomly
choosing an Rt and a vi,t to generate a simulated farm yield or Y = Rt + vi,t . This process is repeated to generate
as large a data set of Y ’s as desired.

An alternative approach is to generate a sample of Y ’s by using all possible combinations of Rt and vi,t . If 50 years
of regional data and 6 years of farm-level data from 80 farms are available, then all combinations generate (50)
(6)(80) = 24,000 values for Y. This sample can then be used for rating as discussed earlier. This approach is
similar to bootstrapping methods.

4.4.3.2. Parametric Rating requires that certain parameters of a selected distribution be estimated. For
example, the triangular distribution with a=0 and the normal distribution each require that two parameters
be estimated – the mean and variance. Calculating means and variances directly from empirical data is
straightforward. Given certain assumptions, the best estimate available for the regional yield variance is the
variance calculated from all T years of regional data, and the best estimate of the farm residual variance is the
variance of the v’s. Because the v’s and R ’s are linearly independent, the best estimate of the farm-level variance
is            .

This approach combines information contained in longer term regional data and shorter term farm-level data.
The calculated farm-level variance is then used to calculate rates as discussed above.

4.4.3.3. Correlations between Regional and Farm Yields. The correlation between regional yields and
individual producer yields is often useful in rating processes. The correlation between and is:

                                                                 ;




                                                                             ;



                                                                             .

Recall that by assumption:          , so


                                                                                   ;




                                                                         .

Since             ,             .



So,                     .



Furthermore,                .

Research often indicates that         . In such cases,          . So, farm-level yield variance is about twice
regional yield variances.

4.4.3.4. Farm Yield Difference. The previous discussion of combining long term regional data with short term
farm data can easily be modiﬁed to include situations in which farm average yields are not equal. Prior to using the
v’s for rating, they can be adjusted by         for each i farm. After this adjustment, the rating proceeds as before.

Variance is implicitly assumed to be independent of average yields. This assumption often holds in practice,
but the data need to be analyzed to determine if the variance is homogenous across farms. If the data are
heterogenous, techniques are available to make the appropriate adjustments (discussed below).

Rates can easily be calculated for different expected yields. Again, the variance of yields is often similar across
expected yields. Therefore, by changing expected yields and using the same variance, desired rates can be calculated.

4.5.       Problems Associated with Rating Processes
An ideal data set would include many producers with farm-level records extending over a long period of time.
The data would have been carefully and thoroughly collected and would be absent of anomalies, trends, missing
observations, and structural change. Data related to health and life insurance tends to approximate the ideal
situation, but this seldom occurs when rating crop insurance. In general, one can expect to obtain only a limited
number of years of individual farm-level data. In addition, technological change and other trends occur, and we
often ﬁnd substantial differences in productivity across farms. We need to identify and address these challenges.

4.5.1. Trend. In many cases, yields appear to exhibit a systematic change that does not appear to be random.
These changes may be abrupt or gradual. It is important to determine whether yields have been increasing over
time (i.e., trend). Yield trends represent a structural change that could be caused by changes in technology,
education, internal policies, or external policies.


  Example. In the United States, the importation of avocados was prohibited for many years. Because of recent trade
  liberalization agreements with Mexico, imports of avocados into the United States have increased, lowering avocado
  prices. Avocado production is input-intensive and a single avocado tree can generate as much as $1,500 of revenue per
  year. Historically, avocado producers intensely managed avocado trees. For example, they often fertilized, watered, and
  monitored each tree. Increased imports and lower avocado prices have rendered these practices cost-prohibitive. As
  managers reduce the use of inputs, yields decline. As a result, avocado insurance programs need to be reviewed because
  of lower expected yields, given increased foreign competition.


Some crop yields are relatively price-sensitive, while others are less so. Price sensitive crop yields need to be
reviewed frequently. Input availability (especially irrigation water) must be considered during rating processes.

Furthermore, technological changes cause crop yields to trend upward over time. Trends are usually calculated
at the regional level and then projected to farm levels. In the case of Ukraine, historical regional yield data
across all rayons could be regressed onto time to test whether the time trend slope coefficient is statistically
different from zero. A map of Ukraine with color coding relative to the level of those regression coefficients
would provide a visual illustration of yield trends. Such information should be compared across regions.

Assume that yield trends have occurred over time. To adjust for those changes, one can ﬁt a regression line such as:

                                                                       ,
where is year with            . To determine if a statistically signiﬁcant trend exists, we test the hypothesis:

                                                           :       .

We estimate a regression equation to obtain estimates of the parameters:

                                                                       .

Consequently,

                                                                           .

The next step is to calculate the expected yield for the last year in the sample. If the last year of the sample is
2007, we use the regression equation to predict the expected yield for 2007:

                                       . In general:              , where                               .

It is recommended that one does not use such regression to forecast trends beyond the sample data. Using the
last year of data to anchor yield distributions to the insurable year is preferable.




                                                                                                      MANUAL 2              31
Detrended yields are constructed using             . For small samples (less than 30 observations), then et should
be adjusted for the degrees of freedom lost in the estimation process. In small samples, the errors
underestimate the true variability because of the estimation of                    . The degrees of freedom are used to
adjust the residuals as:


                                                                               .


The correction factor may also be used to generate the trend adjusted sample as:

                                                                          .

As         becomes large, the term                      monotonically declines to 1.

A regression of                    reduces the variability of the error term as much as possible. Hence, using
regression equations to detrend yield data should only be done if there is compelling evidence of a trend. If no
trend actually exists in the data, this procedure will result in underrating premiums.

It is also possible that non-linear trends exist in the data. Non-linearities may take the form of a polynomial
trend or may be caused by structural breaks in the data. The most complicated case occurs when a trend is
non-linear in the parameters.


  Warning: Do not over-ﬁt the data! For example, the regression ﬁt of a data set with 20 observations modeled with a 19
  degree polynomial will be perfect, but will not allow for any residual variance.


Trend adjusted regional yields are used in the usual manner for rating.

4.5.2. Heteroskedasticity. Data analysis may reveal the existence of heteroskedasticity, which is the
technical term for systematic changes in data variability. Heteroskedasticity is often revealed by graphical
analyses. Explicit statistical tests also exist to identify heteroskedasticity.

Two different regressions can be used to test for the existence of heteroskedasticity:
     (1)                , or
     (2)                ,

where is time (year). Each regression can be used to test the null hypothesis that:
                                                               :      .
If the estimate of β is statistically different from zero, then one can reject the null hypothesis of no
heteroskedasticity. The ﬁrst method has an intuitive interpretation for the parameter β – namely, that the
absolute value of the deviations increases by β in each period.

The presence of heteroskedasticity requires the use of sophisticated rating methodologies. Heteroskedasticity
is a complex problem that needs to be addressed by an experienced and trained actuary. If present, several
approaches can be used to mitigate its impact (such as Generalized Least Squares). Even small values of β can
cause large changes in generated samples (or in standard deviations of yield). Therefore, premium rates are
quite sensitive to the presence of heteroskedasticity.

If heteroskedasticity is present in the data, the regression errors, et , should be transformed using:

                                     , a and b are the estimated values for alpha and beta in (1) above

The         are used in the rating process as before.

4.5.3. Autocorrelation occurs when subsequent year yield observations are correlated.


  Example. Autocorrelation can occur in wheat yields that are accompanied by the production of heavy straw that is
  left in a ﬁeld. Soil nitrogen decomposes straw during a year and reduces soil fertility. Unless supplemental nitrogen is
  added, the following year’s wheat yield may be reduced.


Autocorrelation is important because farmers may adversely select to purchase crop insurance after a good year
because an indemnity payment is more likely in the subsequent year. A possible solution is to increase rates
or reduce trigger yields after a high-yielding year. However, both of these adjustments reduce market appeal.
Producers do not appear to react strongly to mild autocorrelation. Therefore, much of the problem can be
addressed through load factors.

In the absence of trend, autocorrelation can be detected by either the correlation coefficient,                , or by the
following regression:



and testing to see if b is statistically different from zero.

If a trend is present, autocorrelation could be detected by the following regression
                                                                        ,
where et is the residual from the trend regression. A t-test is used to determine if          is statistically signiﬁcant.
Although the test is biased, it is generally sufficient for this purpose.

It is possible to have very low levels of autocorrelation that are statistically signiﬁcant (say an estimate for
   of 0.06-0.07 or 6-7%). In these situations, adverse selection problems will be minimal. However, when
autocorrelation reaches the 10-12% range, adverse selection can become problematic.

4.5.4. Moral Hazard and Adverse Selection are issues that exist within all insurance programs. Rating
problems, however, are created as moral hazard and adverse selection problems become prevalent.

4.5.4.1. Moral Hazard occurs when the purchase of insurance results in detrimental management practices
that increase the likelihood or level of indemnity payments. Moral hazard may be of two types: (1) ex ante,
when people behave in a more risky manner before loss becomes evident, and (2) ex post, when there is a failure
to mitigate losses. For example, an ex ante moral hazard is a failure to use high-quality seed because of an
insurance purchase. An ex post example occurs when a producer does a poor job of harvesting a crop because
the insurance price is greater than the market price.

Moral hazard often results from asymmetric information in which one party (a farmer) has more information
about production practices or market prices than a second party (an insurer). A farmer usually possesses more
information about his operation and practices than an insurance agent, in part, because it is expensive for
insurance providers to monitor farm inputs and management.

4.5.4.2. Adverse Selection is also caused by asymmetric information. Those farmers most likely to receive
indemnity payments are also more likely to purchase insurance. For example, inter-temporal yield variations
differ substantially by location. If all producers are charged the same premium rates, those with small amounts
of yield variation will choose not to insure and those with high variation will insure. If an insurer could identify
those with lower yield variability, those producers could be placed in a separate risk pool and rated accordingly.

If insurance rates are developed from a representative pool of producers, those producers who are more likely to
receive indemnity payments (riskier producers) will choose to participate in an insurance program. Because only
the high-risk producers are participating, the initial premium rates will be too low. Eventually, the rates will be
increased consistent with the risks incurred. As rates increase, the least risky of the high-risk group will cease
to participate leaving the highest risk producers in the program. This process will continue until participation
erodes to an unacceptable level. The process is called participation erosion.




                                                                                                         MANUAL 2            33
Participation erosion can be mitigated in a variety of ways:
     1.   Accurately pool similar risk producers and charge each pool premiums according to their risk levels;
     2. Subsidize premiums so insurance is desirable to all producers (including low-risk producers);
     3. Determine if a sufficient number of producers are highly risk-averse;
     4. Mandate participation by all producers;
     5. Use proxy variables (e.g., precipitation) as indemnity triggers.

4.5.5. Spatial Smoothing. Even with 25 or 30 years of data, we may not have observed every possible extreme
event. Failure to observe extreme outcomes will cause premium rates to be too low to provide actuarial
soundness. On the other hand, it is also possible that extreme events may have occurred more frequently when
using short time series data. In these cases, premium rates will be too high and much more data will be needed
to accurately estimate the probability of severe outcomes. However, rating is restricted to available data.
Consequently, the quantity of data may be increased through Spatial Smoothing .

In the United States, for example, spatial smoothing is conducted within states because a catastrophic
occurrence in one area of a state may reveal the probability of such an occurrence in another area. Spatially
smoothing rates can help account for data limitations.

There are two methods of spatial smoothing: Catastrophic Pooling and smoothing based upon Regional
Correlations.

4.5.5.1. Catastrophic Pooling places some portions of the worst outcomes into a central pool. Assume
that this portion is 20%. Then, a rate is calculated based on the remaining 80% of outcomes for each region.
Then, a rate for the 20% of worst outcomes aggregated across regions is established. Finally, premium rates
are calculated as a weighted average of 80% of the regional rate and 20% of the aggregate rate. In the United
States, this pooling process is called “20-80.”

The worst four outcomes in each region (a total of twelve) are allocated to the Catastrophic Pool and rates are
established for the average outcome. The remaining sixteen outcomes for each region are likewise averaged
and a rate is established.

Notice that the Catastrophic Pool has the same rate for each region. The weighted average regional pooled
rates are less variable across regions than the unpooled rates.

This method places all of the catastrophic events in one pool. This practice is widely used in crop insurance but
is an ad hoc approach. In certain areas of the United States, however, this method results in substantial rate
increases because the catastrophic component is relatively large. Because the catastrophic component may be
disproportionally generated from certain areas, resulting rate levels may cause low participation from low-risk
areas.

4.5.5.2. Regional Correlation. This approach smooths rates by considering the correlation of yields between
regions. The correlations among regions are used to develop weights to calculate weighted average rates.

Let:

                                             rate based only on a region’s data,

                                    correlation between yield history in regions and .

Let:

                                                            weighted rate,

Note that the smoothed rate for Region A is




The rate for Region A is lower than its individual rate, while the rate for Region B is almost identical. Region
C’s smoothed rate is higher than its individual rate. Hence, the differences in rates across regions have been
reduced. This process is generally consistent with the spatial statistics literature. A similar process can also be
used to smooth rates across crops.

4.5.6. Pooling. The process of pooling groups or individuals who face similar probabilities of losses for rating
purposes is called pooling. Pooling occurs for several reasons. If a group of farmers face substantially different
risks, then participation will depend on risks relative to rates. As discussed earlier, failure to account for risk
differences will result in participation erosion. Therefore, grouping farmers into similar risk pools is important
for long term program viability. Furthermore, farmers will perceive programs that do not account for risk
differences to be unfair.

Pools can be based on a variety of criteria. For example, risk pools may be established by region, crop, expected
yield, production practice (irrigated versus dry land), crop type (spring wheat versus winter wheat versus durum
wheat), or geography. Another important pooling decision involves coverage levels. Mature crop insurance
programs offer producers the opportunity to choose coverage levels, usually between 50% and 80%. Premium
rates are differentiated by coverage level, allowing producers to choose from a variety of insurance options.

The difference between rates across coverage levels is called Rate Spreading. Some countries have used
common rate spreads across regions and crops based on coverage levels. These efforts have generally been
unsuccessful in developing actuarially sound rates.

A common F-test can be used to compare the yield variability across pools. Such tests are used to determine if
pools can be combined for rating purposes.

4.6.          Rate Loading and Judgment
Pure risk rates are usually based on expected indemnity payments. In addition, other costs are incurred in
the provision of crop insurance. These costs are collectively referred to as loads. Loads differ based on each
insurance situation.

Loads are commonly used to off set costs associated with:
     1.   Conﬁdence in the rating method – loads are larger for those products that have more tenuous rating
          procedures.
     2. Insurance services (e.g., operations, loss adjustment, agents, returns on investment, etc.).
     3. Political, judicial, or other institutional risks.


36         ACTUARIAL BASICS
  4. Data quality and quantity – loads are larger for rates that are based on poor data quality and quantity.
  5. Market size – small insurance markets are more costly to service and are loaded more heavily.

Loads are sometimes determined by cost accounting/budgeting or historical performance of similar insurance
products. In addition, experience with similar products across regions or countries are used to determine loads.

The following is a hypothetical loading example for a multiple peril insurance product.


                                                 Rating                  10%
                                                 Service                 25%
                                               Data Volume               10%
                                                  Other                   5%
                                                  Total                  50%



Given these loads and a pure risk rate of 0.087, a total rate premium rate would be calculated as: (Pure Risk
Rate) x (1 + Load) = (0.087) x (1+0.50) = 0.1305. This is an example of a proportional loading process.

If the pure risk rate for a product is relatively low, then loads may be attached as “add ons” rather than
proportionally. Suppose the pure risk premium is only 0.03. Then, loads may be set in the following manner:


                                                 Rating                0.5%
                                                 Service               2.5%
                                               Data Volume             0.8%
                                                  Other                1.0%
                                                  Total                4.8%



The total rate would then be calculated as: (Pure Risk Rate) + (Load) = 0.03 + 0.048 = 0.078.

Loading for data volume and other concerns often becomes a matter of judgment. Loads are seldom less than
25% of the pure risk premium. In situations in which the pure risk premium is low and data volume and quality is
poor, loading may be 100% or more.

4.7.       Updating Premium Rates
Rating reviews are not only important for updating purposes, but can also uncover trends in underwriting
procedures. Updating involves reviewing and evaluating rates, underwriting, data management, and fraud/
illicit activity at all levels (farmer, agent, adjuster, issuing agency, regulator, and auditors). Premium rates should
be updated when possible with data from actual insurance histories. Program operational anomalies that are
included in actual insurance histories may not be reﬂected in the data used to initially rate the programs. Thus,
actual loss data from the operational insurance program need to be included in updating processes and combined
with recent insurance experience. All aspects of initial insurance programs should be designed to facilitate future
rating updates. Rate reviews should be conducted annually and intensive updates at least every three years.

Rates can be updated in several ways:
  1.   Use the original rating process and include recent yield data to recalculate rates.
  2. Use actual loss ratios incurred since the last rating process. Eventually, rates should be based on actual
     loss histories. In practice, the usual approach is to use a weighted average of recent loss ratios and
     those used in the initial rating process. For example, one might base 5% of the rate on the most recent
     year’s losses and 95% on the last rating procedure. However, it can be shown that this process places
     disproportionate inﬂuence on single year outcomes.

The following process avoids placing disproportionate weights on speciﬁc years. The loss experience of an
operating insurance program is expressed either as a Loss Cost Ratio (LCR) or Loss Ratio (LR) and deﬁned by
the following formulas:



                                                                                                  MANUAL 2           37
                                                                                ;



                                                                            .


Assume that three years of actual insurance experience are available that generate a loss cost ratio of 8% and
the original rating process generated a pure risk premium of 10%. Suppose that you want to eventually use only
actual experiences for rating processes once 40 years of data are accumulated. Consequently, every actual year
of experience represent 2.5% of the 40 year horizon. Updating rates after three years of experience would result
in (0.075)(0.08) + (0.925)(0.10) = 0.0985. If after another four years the rates are again updated and the loss
cost ratio for the ﬁrst seven years is 9%, a new rate is calculated as (0.175)(0.09) + (0.825)(0.10) = 0.09825.

After 40 years, the original rating will be phased out so that only actual actuarial experience is used. It is, of
course, important to consider yield trends when using lengthy data sets.

5.0.        Proxy Index Insurance
Two of the major issues associated with yield insurance programs are
monitoring/servicing costs and moral hazard. These problems can be
severe enough to cause crop insurance programs to fail. Proxy index
insurance products may reduce monitoring/servicing costs and problems
created by moral hazard. Such products use metrics to trigger indemnity
payments that obviate some of the problems associated with the use of
individual yield triggers such as individual ﬁeld loss adjusting.

Proxy insurance is also useful for providing risk management for
specialty crop production. Developing individual insurance programs
for small volume, specialty crop is often prohibitively expensive
because of small crop volumes, yield data deﬁciencies, and harvest
windows. For example, strawberries are continuously harvested over
many months. Consequently, loss adjusting is prohibitively expensive.
Furthermore, proxy index insurance can be used to insure multiple crops
simultaneously. However, the acquisition and management of weather
data for proxy index insurance products is often more expensive than
anticipated. In addition, weather stations do not exist in many regions
and the development and maintenance of such stations is expensive.

Proxy index triggers may be based on weather, regional yields, satellite
imagery, or other factors. This section focuses on weather-based proxies.

5.1.       Introduction
Insurance based on weather outcomes is similar to insurance obtained
through the use of weather derivatives. Weather derivatives are
becoming more common as a means for managing risk. Weather
derivatives are often used in non-agricultural applications. For example,
weather derivatives are used to insure against:
   • Unusual cold temperatures resulting in increased demands for and
       prices of heating oil or natural gas;
   • Rain events resulting in the cancellation of outdoor concerts or
       events;
   • Lack of snow at ski areas;
   • Cold temperatures that reduce consumer activity during prime
       shopping periods.

Weather derivatives could be used to insure against many agricultural
weather perils including:
   • Excess precipitation during harvest or planting;
   • Freezing during apple blossom;
   • Excess precipitation and cold temperatures on orchard crops;
   • Excess heat effects on canola;
   • Lack of heating degree-days during the growing season;
   • Drought.




                                                                            MANUAL 2   39
5.2.       Proxy Weather Indices
Various forms of weather proxies are used in crop insurance programs. Weather index products base
indemnities on “All or Nothing” or Prorated approaches. In addition, dual triggers are frequently used, as are
methods for partitioning liability and the use of survival coverage.

5.2.1. Indemnity Payments may be calculated in a variety of ways when using proxy insurance products. Two
common methods are “All or nothing” or Prorated approaches.

5.2.1.1. “All or Nothing” products refer to the payment of the entire insured liability as an indemnity when a proxy
trigger occurs. For example, assume that a temperature trigger of 0°C has been established. If temperatures are
colder than the trigger during the insured period, the entire insured liability is paid as an indemnity.

5.2.1.2. Prorated Products use dual triggers to calculate indemnity payments. For example, assume a
producer insures a crop against excessive precipitation at two trigger points, 3cm and 6cm. If the precipitation
outcome is greater than 6 cm, the entire liability is paid. If the precipitation is less than 3 cm, no liability is paid.
If the precipitation outcome is between 3cm and 6 cm, the indemnity is prorated based on a proportion of the
liability. For example, if the precipitation outcome is 4cm (one-third of the distance between 3cm and 6cm), then
one-third of the liability is paid as an indemnity.

5.2.2. Product Types. Single or multiple variable proxy indices can be used as indemnity triggers.

5.2.2.1. Single Variable proxy index products use a single weather variable such as precipitation or
temperature for triggering indemnities. The indemnity may be of an “All or Nothing” or Prorated form.

5.2.2.2. Multiple Variable proxy index products are also used in crop insurance programs. These products
may insure against more than one weather factor simultaneously. For example, multiple variable products have
been developed that insure against both temperature and precipitation outcomes. Alternatively, a multiple
variable product could insure against extreme temperature or precipitation events during different periods of
the year. Multiple variable products may calculate indemnities using “All or Nothing” or Prorated approaches.
Indemnities for Prorated products can be calculated using Liability Partitioning or Survival methods.

                                  Example 1: Liability Partitioning with Prorated Indemnity

Assume that a farmer insures an apple orchard against both cold temperatures and excess precipitation (multiple
perils). The dual temperature triggers are
-1°C and -5ºC, and the dual precipitation triggers are 3cm and 6cm. The farmer chooses to split his total liability
of 1,000UAH between excess precipitation and freezing temperatures on a 50-50 basis.

If the temperature outcome during the insured period is -2°C, then the indemnity (It) is:




If the temperature outcome is greater than -1°C, then It is zero. If the temperature outcome is less than -5°C,
then It equals 0.5 x 1,000 = 500UAH.

In addition, if the precipitation outcome is 5 cm, then the indemnity (Ip) is:




If precipitation is less than 3cm, then Ip is zero. If precipitation is greater than 6cm, then the indemnity equals 0.5
x 1,000 = 500UAH.

The total indemnity is I = It + Ip .

                                   Example 2: Survival Products and Prorated Indemnities




40       ACTUARIAL BASICS
Assume the above apple production example in which indemnities are calculated on a Survival basis rather
than with Liability Partitioning. A farmer insures an apple orchard against both cold temperatures and excessive
precipitation using dual triggers. The temperature triggers are -1ºC and -5ºC, and the precipitation triggers are
3cm and 6cm. The total liability is 1,000UAH.

Assume the actual temperature is T and actual precipitation is P. If T and P are between their trigger levels,
then the indemnity is calculated as:




where the term                     is a proxy for the proportion of the apple crop that survives the temperature


peril. The term,              , is a proxy for the proportion of the apple crop that survives the precipitation peril.

Therefore, the entire term in square brackets represents a proxy for the proportion of the apple crop that

survives both perils.

Assume that             and    , such that:




If the temperature is less than -5°C or precipitation is greater than 6cm, the entire liability is paid as an
indemnity. If the temperature is greater than -1°C, then T is set equal to -1 in the above equation. If
precipitation is less than 3cm, then P is set equal to 3. Table 5.1 presents indemnities for various combinations of
temperature (T ) and precipitation (P).

5.3.       Effectiveness of Weather Proxies for Yields
The effectiveness of proxy index products must be evaluated based upon correlations between proxy index
metrics and yields. Because proxy index measures and yields are not perfectly correlated, indemnities will not
always match the frequency and severity of low yields. Typical correlations between precipitation and yield
range from 0.45 to 0.65.

5.3.1. Simulations of Indemnity Probabilities. The importance of correlations between yields and weather
variables are illustrated with the following simulation. Assume that yields and precipitation are linearly related
and each has a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 0.4. In addition, an indemnity is paid if precipitation is
below 0.7cm. Deﬁne yields ( y) as very low if y<0.5, low if 0.5<y<0.7, and moderate or above average if y>0.7.
Such outcomes are possible regardless of precipitation levels unless yields and precipitation are perfectly
correlated. Indemnities are triggered by precipitation rather than yield. For this example, indemnities are
deﬁned as “large” if precipitation ( p) is below 0.5cm, “small” if precipitation is between 0.5cm and 0.7cm, and
“zero” if precipitation is above 0.7cm.

42      ACTUARIAL BASICS
If the correlation between precipitation and yield is only 0.20, the probability of receiving a zero indemnity
payment is 0.82 for moderate or above average yields. However, the probability of receiving a large indemnity
payment is 0.077.

5.3.2. “Misses” occur when indemnities generated by the proxy trigger do not match indemnities based on
actual crop yields. In each of the above tables, the situation in which a perfect match occurs between the proxy
and yield triggers only occur in the last row because the correlations between precipitation and yield is 1.0.
Misses can be reduced by increasing the correlation between proxy triggers and actual yields. This is usually
accomplished by combining various proxies. For example, combining temperature and precipitation proxies into
a single index may increase the correlation between yield and the composite index from 0.60 to 0.75. In some
case, larger increases in the correlation can be obtained by combining a weather index with satellite imagery.

5.3.3. Timing of Precipitation. Various studies have evaluated the relationships between yield and the
timing of precipitation (as opposed to precipitation levels). Approximately 60% of these studies do not show
statistically signiﬁcant improvement by including monthly speciﬁc precipitation rather than total growing
season or annual precipitation levels.

5.3.4. Nonlinearities. Economic theory suggests that the relationship between weather and yields must be
non-linear. Incorporating non-linear relationships between weather and yields can often increase correlations
between weather conditions and actual yields and result in fewer “misses”.

5.4.       Data
Most actuarial rating processes require substantial high-quality historical data. For rating weather proxy index
products, densities of weather stations are an important factor in determining correlations between weather
metrics and actual crop yields. In addition, the number of years for which data are available and the accuracy of
recording processes are critical for establishing premium rates and determining indemnity payments.

5.4.1. Data Sources. Two weather data repositories are currently being maintained: (1) Global Summary of
Day (GSOD), and (2) Global History Climate Network – Daily (GHCND). Terms of access to these data sources
are country-speciﬁc. Of course, some regions/countries have larger numbers of weather stations and weather
station densities than others.

The GSOD has the following features:
   • Data are free of charge to all non-commercial users;
   • Data are derived from global integrated surface data;
   • Over 9,000 stations are typically available for recent years;
   • Data for 1929 to present are available for a limited number of stations;
   • Many airport and some additional city locations are available;
   • Various daily summary elements such as temperature (mean, maximums, minimums), dew point, wind
       speed (mean, maximum, peak gust), air pressure, visibility, precipitation, snow depth, etc. are available;
   • Data are usually updated daily within 1-2 days after the date of each observation;
   • A substantial number of observations are often missing for many weather stations.
The GHCND has the following features:
   • Data are developed from numerous sources and subjected to quality assurance reviews;
   • Archives include daily maximum temperatures, daily minimum temperatures, precipitation (i.e., rainfall
       and snow water equivalents), snowfall, and snow depth;
   • A substantial number of observations are often missing for many weather stations.
By its nature, weather data represent large numbers of observations. For example, 50 years of weather data
translates into 18,000 observations for a single weather station. Therefore, electronic tools and processes are
particularly important for rating and quality control.

5.4.2. Data Uses. Weather data are needed for two purposes in developing and implementing weather proxy
products: (1) rating, and (2) indemnity calculations.


                                                                                                 MANUAL 2           43
5.4.2.1. Rating. Ideally, 50 years of high-quality historical data would be available for rating. The data would
include all daily observations during the portion of the year to be indemniﬁed. If less than 30 years of data
are available, then more sophisticated statistical analyses are likely required and resulting premium rates are
less reliable. Missing observations may occur because of recording or mechanical failures, human error, coding
errors, or other reasons. Unfortunately, missing observations are usually systematic. That is, it is more likely
that an observation is missing during unusually cold periods than when temperatures are more moderate.
Therefore, missing observations cannot be ignored and must be replaced with realistic values. Filling techniques
are technically complex and often use information gleaned from other, similar weather stations.

Updating weather proxy index rates requires the continuous maintenance of and access to weather station
data. Given the volume of data, automated electronic collection and storage system must be developed and
maintained. It is imperative that appropriate quality control systems be continuously employed.

5.4.2.2. Indemnities. Weather data are necessary to calculate indemnities for all weather proxy index
products. The data pipeline must be timely, dependable, and accurate, because contracts specify timeframes for
the payments of indemnities. The data pipeline must be able to support indemnity timeliness requirements. All
data pipelines eventually fail either in terms of unreported observations or timeliness. Hence, backup provisions
must be developed and maintained to support data pipelines and obviate problems created by failures.
Furthermore, insurance contracts and other legal documents must speciﬁcally address the potential for data
pipeline failures and specify appropriate alternatives for calculating indemnities if a failure occurs.

5.5.      Rating
Weather insurance products pose substantial rating challenges. These challenges are difficult to overcome if
large quantities of weather data are unavailable.

5.5.1. Autocorrelation and Truncation. Most statistical rating analyses assume that observations are
independently and identically distributed. This is not the case for weather data. Weather outcomes at
any point in time are likely highly correlated with nearby time periods (i.e., autocorrelated). Overcoming
these autocorrelation problems is complex and heavily dependent on data volume and statistical expertise.
Furthermore, precipitation is necessarily truncated at zero which creates additional statistical problems. These
problems are particular troublesome for data ﬁlling and rating processes. Failure to address autocorrelation and
truncation issues often results in biased premium rates and failed programs. In particular, biased rates invite
numerous problems associated with adverse selection.

5.5.2. Seasonality. Clearly, mean weather variables change with seasons. However, both the distributional
and distributional forms can vary across seasons. Therefore, the development of weather insurance contracts
often must consider changes in mean temperatures, variability, and distributional forms. Such problems are
particularly prevalent in products that insure precipitation or growing temperature days over a lengthy period.

5.5.3. Trend. The inﬂuence of climate change can be modelled as trends in weather variables. Yield trends
were discussed earlier in this manual. To the extent that weather trends exist, they can be treated in a similar
manner to yield trends. Statistical techniques need to be used to maintain actuarial soundness if such trends are
present.

5.5.4. Timing of Attachment. Timing of attachment refers to the time between when a contract is
purchased and when the insured period begins. As the interval between purchase and attachment declines,
purchasers are able to incorporate more accurate weather information into their purchase decisions because of
the autocorrelated nature of weather. If the rating process is based on historical weather conditions, shorter
attachment intervals can result in adverse selection. Therefore, the purchase/attachment interval must be
sufficiently long to minimize a purchaser’s ability to forecast future weather outcomes through observations
of current weather conditions and the predictions of others. An alternative is to include publically-available
weather forecasts into the rating process. However, these approaches have had only limited success. If
forecasts are not included in the rating process, then the purchase attachment interval should be no shorter
than 30 days.

5.5.5. Rating Illustration. Assume that we wish to create an “All or Nothing” insurance product triggered by
temperature below 0°C on September 15 and we have 50 years of data. During those 50 years, the temperature
had been below 0°C only four times on September 15.

without any loads. Suppose, however, that the historical temperature information surrounding September 15
results in the rates illustrated in Table 5.5.

Notice that the 8% probability on September 15 is lower than that occurring within ﬁ ve days on either side of the
insurance date. Therefore, the 8% rate is not a reasonable expectation of the future probability of temperatures
being below 0°C because of the expectation that temperature is autocorrelated. Insurance market speculators
are well aware of these types of rating errors and arbitrage these problems to their own advantage. Such
activity can cause insurance programs to fail.

5.6.       Multiple Weather Stations
Sometimes indemnities are triggered by a combination of weather station outcomes. For example, a producer
may have ﬁelds that spatially separated. Thus, indemnities could be triggered by more than one weather station
or a combination of weather stations. Multiple weather stations can be used to develop an index that is used as an
indemnity trigger. Such indexes are developed as a weighted average of relevant weather station measurements.

Purchasers of insurance contracts are often allowed to select speciﬁc weather stations for developing weather
triggers. Producers are generally allowed to choose weather outcomes as measured by up to six or seven
weather stations for determining a weather index. Historical data from selected stations are used rating
purposes. The weights for the selected stations are used both for rating purposes and for determining indemnity
payments.

In some cases, producers are allowed to select weights that are then applied to measurements from the relevant
weather stations. In other cases, distance weighted smoothing is used to calculate weights for each weather
station. Distance weighted smoothing requires the identiﬁcation of a geographic center, such as a ﬁeld, for
the insured production. Weather stations close to the center position are used to create a weather index. The
weights for each weather station are based upon the distance of each weather station from the center position.
The distance from the center position to weather station i (i=1,.., n) is deﬁned as di . For example, if i =1 and n=3,
then the weight for weather station 1 is:


                                                                        .

The weights for weather station 2 and 3 are calculated in a like fashion. Note that if weather station 1 is zero
distance away from the center position (i.e., the weather station itself is at the center position) then        and
      , w2 =w3 =0. Therefore, all of the weight is placed on weather station 1. Alternatively, if            , then
                     .

Note that the weights and distances are inversely proportional, i.e.,

Finally, a variety of alternative weighting methods exist, but those presented above are the most common.

6.0.       Reinsurance
Primary insurance companies or issuing agencies usually do not have
sufficient capital to absorb losses caused by extreme outcomes. Large
indemnities are more likely to occur in crop insurance than many other
types of insurance because crop insurance losses are often correlated
across farms. Adverse weather events are the primary cause of low yields.
In particular, drought is often a regional event that impacts the yields of
many neighboring farmers within an area. In addition, crop insurance
sales for any given company tend to occur within limited regions, and few
crop insurance companies operate on a global scale. Furthermore, crop
insurance issuing agencies are often not diversiﬁed into other forms of
insurance such as health, life, or property insurance. And, crop insurance
agreements are usually short-term and limited to annual contracts.
Therefore, primary crop insurance companies are not generally diversiﬁed
by space, time, or sector and often incur risks that are correlated within
their insurance portfolio. For these reasons, primary insurance companies
transfer risk to other companies who are better able to manage these
risks. The transfer involves paying fees to such companies.
Reinsurance refers to the ceding of risk from one insurance company
(such as an issuing agency or primary insurance company) to another (a
reinsurer) or to the government. Reinsurers are usually large companies
that are well-diversiﬁed across space, sectors, and insurance types.
Governments often provide reinsurance in terms of stop-loss agreements.
Crop insurance risk absorption in the United States (as measured by
indemnity payouts) has been approximately:

The United States has a special pool for high-risk farmers in which the
federal government assumes all the risk. Most of the insurance policies
placed in the Special Pool have associated risks that are not palatable to
the private insurance industry. However, private insurance companies
are limited in the number of policies that can be placed in the Special
Pool, about 15%. In addition, the government provides a stop-loss for
indemnities that exceed about 350% of premiums.
The private sector has absorbed most indemnity payments in recent years
because losses have been relatively low. Although government indemnity
outlays have not been triggered under the stop-loss agreement in recent
years, some outlays have occurred within the Special Pool.

6.1.      Forms of Reinsurance
Reinsurance agreements specify the method in which losses or
indemnity payments will be shared between risk bearers (e.g., between
a primary insurance company and a reinsurer). These reinsurance
relationships are often complex and not standardized across reinsurance
companies. The forms of reinsurance specify how losses across a
primary insurance companies’ entire portfolio (i.e., not on a policy-by-
policy basis) are to be shared.

6.1.1. Dollar One refers to an arrangement in which the reinsurer is responsible for all indemnity payments.
The primary insurance company is responsible for servicing the insurance program but bears none of the
indemnity risk.

6.1.2. Co-pays (Co-insurance, Percentage Participation) refer to the sharing of losses in mutually agreeable
proportions between a primary insurance provider (or issuing agency) and reinsurer(s). A 40-60 co-pay would
mean that a primary insurance company would pay 40% of indemnity costs and a reinsurer would pay 60%.

6.1.3. Reinsurance Deductible is the amount of loss the primary insurance provider or issuing agency
sustains prior to a reinsurer indemnifying losses. The deductible may be speciﬁed as a percentage of liability or
as a premium multiple. If the premium rate is 8% and the multiple is 1.5, then the primary insurer must absorb
12% of the liability before the reinsurer begins absorbing remaining indemnity payments.

6.1.4. Stop-Loss is the amount (or premium multiple) at which all remaining loss responsibility is transferred
to another entity. Stop-losses are similar to deductibles except that they are usually intended to protect against
catastrophic losses. Often, stop-losses are triggered less than 2-5% of the time. Stop-losses are often provided
by governments.

6.1.5. Tranched (Stacked, Layered) Approaches divide liability among primary issuing agencies, reinsurers,
and/or governments. Indemnity responsibilities are hierarchical in that those “lower” in the tranche make
indemnity payments only after those higher in the tranche have exceeded pre-speciﬁed limits. Consider the
following layered or tranched example for a $1 billion liability:

                                                          Table 6.2. Layered or Tranched Reinsurance Responsibility Example

                                                               Percentage             Amount

                           Lead (or Junior) Reinsurer              15%                  $150,000,000
                        Secondary (or Senior) Reinsurer            20%                  $200,000,000
                            Government Stop Loss                   60%                  $600,000,000




The Government stop-loss liability is the lowest level in the tranche and is only triggered after $400,000,000
of liability is paid by the primary insurance provider ($50,000,000), the lead reinsurer ($150,000,000), and the
secondary reinsurer ($200,000,000).

To illustrate payment responsibilities of different levels of total losses for a $1 billion liability, consider the
following table:

For example C, a total loss of $300,000,000 has occurred. This loss will be absorbed (or indemniﬁ ed) by the
primary insurer ($50,000,000), the lead reinsurer ($150,000,000), and the secondary reinsurer ($100,000,000).
The government’s stop-loss is not triggered in this case. Therefore, the Government would not be responsible
for any indemnity payments. However, in example D, the government’s stop-loss responsibility is triggered by
the $500,000,000 total loss and their indemnity payout would be $100,000,000.

6.2.      Rating or Costs of Reinsurance
As in the case of primary insurance, reinsurance premium rates are comprised of both a pure risk premium and a
load. The following discussion is intended to introduce reinsurance rating concepts. Actual reinsurance rating is
complex and the following discussion is only intended to provide an introduction to reinsurance rating.

6.2.1. Pure Risk Premiums are usually estimated from historical data. Ideally, historical data on indemnity
payments from an identically-designed insurance program are used. However, such data are often not
available and one must depend upon historical yield data. The rate estimation process depends on the speciﬁ c
reinsurance agreement, data availability, and a myriad of other factors. The process may involve parametric
distributions, empirical distributions, or a combination of the two.

For illustration purposes, the following simpliﬁed example is provided. Assume there are four farms in a
portfolio. The farm data is sufficiently short that it cannot be used directly for reinsurance rating. However the
summary yield statistics of farm means, standard deviations, and between-farm correlations can be estimated.
The underlying individual yield distribution is assumed to be normally distributed. Furthermore, assume that the
yield average, standard deviations, and correlations between farms are the same across all four farms. The
objective is to develop a long term individual farm yield data set that can be used for rating purposes. The
developed yield data set will have the same average, standard deviation, and correlations as estimated from
actual farm data. However, the developed data will be extend over a much longer period and will provide a
better approximation of events that are likely to result in indemnity payments. For illustration purposes, the
developed data set will have 40 observations (40 years of data) for the 4 farms.

The process begins by generating a series of numbers (zjt) for the j th farm in year t that are identically,
independently, and normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. In this example j=1,4 and
t=1,40. Random number generators (which are widely available in software programs such as Excel) are used to
generate the zjt ’s. Table 6.4 presents the zjt ’s for this example.

Table 6.7 presents the indemnity payments calculated from the Yj ’s for each farm for a primary insurance
coverage level of 0.75. The average indemnity is also calculated across all farms for each year. It is assumed that
a reinsurance deductible is used and that the reinsurer absorbs all indemnities exceeding 12% of liability (or, 9%
of expected yield). The table presents the indemnity payments from the primary insurance company and the
reinsurer.

Table 6.8 presents the expected indemnity payments (the mean of the annual average indemnity column in Table
6.7) and the pure risk premium rate which is calculated as the quotient of the expected indemnity and the liability.

The previous example is greatly simpliﬁed from actual reinsurance
rating. Usually, the generated data set contains several hundred annual
observations and the number of farms is often much larger than four.
However, if the several thousand farms are considered, then rates may be
calculated with sufficient accuracy by using a subsample of farms

6.2.2. Loads. Pure risk reinsurance rates are increased by a load that
compensates the reinsurer for a variety of costs that are not easily
quantiﬁed. Loads are usually determined more by judgment than
quantitative analyses. Considerations for developing loads include:
     • Reinsurer’s servicing costs;
     • Conﬁdence in the reinsurance rating including data quality and
       quantity;
     • Program design;
     • Program integrity or “tightness” of underwriting and loss adjusting;
     • Reinsurance form and level of risk (e.g., is there a government stop
       loss?);
     • Personnel competency;
     • Reputation of involved parties;
     • Cost of capital;
     • Transparency, monitoring, and auditing of insurance activity;
     • Political, judicial, and legal risk;
     • Regulations;
     • Taxes or government fees.
Furthermore, loads may differ within different tranche levels. Often, the
shallowest tranche (the tranche that makes the ﬁrst indemnity payments)
and the tranche that has the lowest payment probability (i.e., those that
are only triggered by severe losses) are loaded more heavily than middle
tranches. The shallowest tranches are loaded more heavily because of
higher per contract servicing costs; the deepest tranches are loaded more
heavily because of higher capital requirements, even though frequency
may be quite low.

7.0.       Summary
Actuarial processes include activities that establish insurance premium
rates and related quantitative analyses. The major stakeholder groups
associated with agriculture insurance are agricultural producers,
insurance ﬁrms, and governments. Each has different, and sometimes
opposing, interests.

Crop insurance shares many elements associated with other forms of
insurance. The purchaser of an insurance contract pays a premium to an
issuing agency to transfer undesirable outcome risks. Actuarial sound
premiums are established such that the expected indemnities (payouts in
the case of insured events) and costs of providing insurance are off set by
premium collections. An issuing agency often pays a reinsurer to accept
much of the risk that has been acquired through the sale of insurance
contracts.

All crop insurance contracts require that insured parties absorb a
deductible in the event of an insured outcome. The deductible helps
reduce moral hazard behavior. For crop insurance, coverage levels refer
to the difference between 100 percent coverage (zero deductible) and the
stated deductible. Indemnity payments represent a transfer of funds from
an insurer to an insured party to partially or fully compensate for insured
losses. Such payments are triggered by yield (or in many cases, revenue)
levels which are below expected yields less the deductible.

One of the major actuarial activities is developing premium rates that
are actuarially sound. That is, premium collections must be sufficient
to offset indemnity payments and the costs of providing insurance. The
rating process depends on the quality of data.

As with all insurance products, issues related to moral hazard and adverse
selection must be vigilantly examined. The use of index insurance as an
indemnity trigger mechanism reduces moral hazard and monitoring costs.
Index products have been developed around weather variables, area
yields, and satellite imagery. Such products are also highly data intensive.
Adverse selection issues are often managed by pooling producers into
appropriate risk categories and then rating each group according to their
level of risk.

Rating processes must not ignore issues important to reinsurers. Private
reinsurance companies have the diversiﬁcation and ﬁnancial reserves to
manage risks taken by issuing agencies. In general, issuing agencies pay
fees to reinsurance companies as a means for transferring risk to entities
that have the capacity to absorb it. In many cases, governments serve
as reinsurers to varying degrees. Actuarially sound rating processes help
reduce the costs of reinsurance.

Accuracy, transparency, careful data management, statistical expertise,
detailed written contracts, strong legal institutions, well-developed
contract law and property rights, and clearly identiﬁed government
roles are all important elements for developing actuarially sound rating
processes. Crop insurance programs will not be successful if any of these
elements are ignored or poorly realized.
