Gender Diversity in Jordan




Foreword

Increasing women’s participation on corporate boards and in senior management is among the crucial
requirements of companies all around the world. IFC is no exception. We have seen for ourselves the
positive results from greater diversity in corporate leadership.

Stated simply, gender balance is good for business. The participation of women in the labor market
has been a major driver of growth and competitiveness in economies. Yet, when it comes to corporate
leadership positions, there remains a huge gap between the numbers of men and women represented.

In Jordan this is no different. Men have assumed the highest positions of corporate leadership, even as
women represent a strong untapped asset for the country.

Until now, very little was known about Jordanian women in senior leadership positions, the types
of roles they play, or the sectors in which the under-representation was particularly notable. This
publication, Gender Diversity in Jordan – Research on the Impact of Gender Diversity on the Economic
Performance of Companies in Jordan, is the first step in addressing the knowledge gap. Among the
findings of the research are that out of nearly 1,200 publicly listed and private shareholding Jordanian
companies, women hold only 6 percent of board positions. The figures vary from industry to industry,
ranging from 10.7 percent representation in the health sector to 4 percent in financial services.

This publication reveals both the opportunities and challenges for Jordan in its effort to increase
women’s participation on boards. A holistic and multi-faceted approach that emphasizes the need for
broad-based education on the importance of board diversity is required. Gender diversity in boards
should also become a core ingredient of good corporate governance.

We know that the efforts will pay off, because the empowerment of women contributes to growth,
poverty reduction, and social welfare of families and communities.

Gender Diversity in Jordan




Preface

This document was prepared in good faith, based on information collected through primary and
secondary research. Much of the statistical data came from desk research of publicly available
information, including annual reports. Primary research consisted of focus group discussions, one-on-
one interviews, and an online questionnaire.


Disclaimer and limitations to the research

The information collected for this document was not verified independently, and no third-party
verification was carried out to confirm companies’ responses or input. Financial data for publicly listed
companies were collected online from the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) website (www.ase.com.jo).
Information for private shareholding companies and limited liability companies was also collected
online, from the Companies Controller’s Department’s (CCD) website (http://ccd.gov.jo). However,
no financial data are available online, and the CCD was not able to share such information with us.

There were some discrepancies between the financial data found online, especially regarding ROA
and ROE ratios published on the ASE website and those published at the Securities Depository Center
website. The authors elected to use financial data from ASE, since it is considered the most accountable
body for information related to publicly listed companies in Jordan. Financial information was collected
for 2012, since 2013 information was not yet available at the conclusion of the data-collection period.

Although the utmost care went into the preparation of this publication, the International Finance
Corporation and the Jordan Institute of Directors does not guarantee or warrant the accuracy or
reliability of the information herein, and it should not be relied on as a substitute for legal or corporate
advice. The views expressed in this report are an analysis of the data and respondents comments and
do not necessarily reflect the views of the authors.


Acknowledgments

     IFC
     IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is the largest global development institution focused on
     the private sector in emerging markets. Working with more than 2,000 businesses worldwide, we use
     our capital, expertise, and influence, to create opportunity where it’s needed most. In FY15, our long-
     term investments in developing countries rose to nearly $18 billion, helping the private sector play an
     essential role in the global effort to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity.

     IFC provides leadership in promoting good corporate governance practices in developing and emerging
     markets. Good corporate governance helps companies operate more efficiently, mitigate risk and
     safeguard against mismanagement, and improve access to capital that will fuel their growth. It makes
     companies more accountable and transparent to investors and gives them the tools to respond to
     stakeholder concerns, including implementation of good environmental and social practices.

     Corporate governance also contributes to development. Increased access to capital encourages new
     investments, boosts economic growth, and provides employment opportunities. Businesses that
     operate more efficiently tend to allocate and manage resources more sustainably. Better stakeholder
     relationships help companies address environmental protection, social, and labor issues.

     With strong donor support, IFC continues to strengthen corporate governance programs in underserved
     regions, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East and North Africa by
     closely integrating its investments and advice, and focusing on capacity building of intermediaries,
     resulting in improved operational efficiency.

Gender Diversity in Jordan




Executive Summary

Despite constituting a large portion of society in Jordan, women have a minor presence in boardrooms
and in senior decision-making positions. The research in this publication sets out to demonstrate:

	       he degree of involvement by women in boardrooms and senior decision-making positions in the
    1. t
       corporate world;

	       he value of their presence when they are involved in those positions (specifically whether there
    2. t
       is a correlation between women in the boardroom and the financial performance of companies);
       and

	      ome of the challenges that women face in reaching such decision-making positions. The
    3. s
       publication also includes some recommendations for ways to overcome those challenges.


Involvement in decision-making positions in the corporate world

As detailed in Chapter 1, below, women in Jordan represent a significant portion of the labor force
but only a tiny fraction of top-level positions. This is true for publicly listed companies as well as for
private shareholding companies.


Value of the presence of women in decision-making positions

Impact on corporate governance
From annual reports, an online survey, and focus group discussions, we ascertained that companies
with increased gender diversity have experienced, to a certain extent, more improvement in corporate
governance implementation than companies without gender diversity in the boardroom. Focus group
participants agreed that women on boards increase board effectiveness by contributing to better and
more constructive discussions, leading to a better decision-making process during board meetings.

Higher return on assets and equity for firms with higher gender diversity
This research publication is a mere representation of data and has not revealed a causation link
between financial performance of companies and gender diversity in the boardroom and in senior
decision-making positions. However, the data do appear to be supportive of some positive correlation
between gender diversity in these positions and the ‘return on assets’ ROA and ‘return on equity’ ROE.

In 2012, for example, the average ROA of publicly listed companies without female representation
was 0.99, and for companies with at least one woman in the boardroom it was 3.03. In other words,
the ROA for companies with female representation is higher than the average ROA and almost three-
times more than the ROA of companies without female representation. In 2011, 2010, and 2009 the
data showed similar results.

The average ROE in 2012 for publicly listed companies without female representation was 9.83, and
for companies with at least one woman in the boardroom it was 17.51. In other words, the ROE for
companies with female representation is higher than the average ROE and almost twice the ROE of
companies without female representation. In 2011, 2010, and 2009 the data showed similar results.

Sector analysis further broke down the investigation of publicly listed companies. Tables 0.1 and 0.2
show the results of a review of performance by sector for the years 2012 and 2011, respectively.




                                                                                                             11
     Challenges that women face to reach decision-making positions

     This publication enumerates many of the challenges that women face in reaching the boardroom and
     senior decision-making positions. It groups these challenges into four key areas: cultural, capacity,
     interpersonal, and appointment process.


     Recommendations

     Change is critical for the development of Jordan and the economy. Out of the research have come
     several key recommendations for expediting change to overcome the gender disparity in boardrooms
     and senior positions. The following are examples of these recommendations:

     	   •  Lobbying for a temporary voluntary quota for women on boards;

           Working with organizations to expand the female labor force and improve opportunities for
      	 •  
           women in middle management to grow into senior-level positions – for example, through tailored
           capacity-building programs and mentorships; and

           Encouraging better disclosure of gender statistics on board and senior-management positions,
      	 •  
           and increasing transparency in the appointment process.

1   Introduction

    The term corporate governance is generally defined as a system of rules, practices, and processes
    by which an organization is directed and controlled. It involves balancing the interests of the many
    stakeholders, including shareholders, management, customers, suppliers, financiers, government,
    and the community. Good corporate governance practices safeguard accountability, transparency,
    and trust.

    One of the key corporate governance challenges we observed in Jordan and the Middle East is that
    the composition of boards appears to be ad hoc, in that a variety of social, political, and cultural
    influences play a large part in determining board membership, when in fact greater emphasis should
    be placed on independence of directors and diversity in the boardroom. Most Jordanian companies
    are family businesses, so choosing board members is primarily based on personal relationships and not
    on the organization’s need or professionalism, and accordingly such businesses do not recognize the
    importance of separating ownership and management – until crises happen.

    The issue of independent directors has been a core focus of many regulators and institutions for years
    in the effort to transform the boardroom from a management vehicle to a strategic vision-driven body,
    and the lack of independence remains a challenge. On the other hand, diversity has not received the same
    level of attention. Although diversity covers a wide range of characteristics, such as age, experience,
    background, and so on, the focus of this publication is on diversity of gender in the boardroom.


    1.1 About corporate governance in Jordan

    As the system by which organizations are directed and controlled, corporate governance addresses the
    distribution of rights and responsibilities among the different participants in an organization – such
    as the board of directors, managers, shareholders, and other stakeholders – and lays down the rules
    and procedures for decision making. In Jordan, corporate governance is increasingly important if
    Jordanian organizations are to prosper in a competitive global marketplace (CCD no date). Although
    the importance and value of corporate governance is not the primary focus of this publication, some
    of its significant benefits are highlighted in Annex 1.

    Since 2002, more than 25 codes and guidelines have been issued in the Middle East and North Africa
    region. All codes are based on the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance but focus on different
    dimensions. In Jordan, four voluntary regulations and codes directly address corporate governance
    and require companies either to comply or to explain their implementation of corporate governance:

         Corporate Governance Code for Banks, by the Central Bank of Jordan;1
    	 •  

         Corporate Governance Code for Shareholding Companies, by the Amman Stock Exchange (also
    	 •  
         called the Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies);

         Corporate Governance Instructions from the Insurance Commission; and
    	 •  

         Corporate Governance Code for Privately Held Companies, by the Companies Controller
    	 •  
         Department.

    In addition to the corporate governance codes, other rules, regulations, and legislation also affect
    the implementation of corporate governance in Jordan – for example, Securities Law, Listing and
    Disclosure Rules for shareholding companies; Banking Law for banks; and so on. In addition, the
    Companies Law No. 22 for 1997 (as amended) creates a baseline for companies regarding corporate
    governance.

    It is notable that most of the codes were drafted primarily in Arabic, the official language of the country,
    and are nuanced with gender-biased language. Male terminology dominates all aspects of these codes.




       t the time of writing this report, the Central Bank of Jordan issued a new regulation on corporate
    1 A
      governance that required full compliance with some aspects of corporate governance.
                                                                                                                   15
                       1.2 Importance of gender diversity in the boardroom

                       There is value in having diversity – in age, skills, and experience – on the board. Such diversity can lead
                       to increased innovation (Post et al. 2009), more productivity (Page 2007), and better representation of
                       core groups for the business (Kline 2010). (See Box 1.1.)

                       Although there has been little research on gender diversity in the boardroom, there is evidence that
                       it has many advantages. For instance, gender diversity can open up access to an untapped pool of
                       resources (Martins and Parsons 2007), result in better problem solving (Woolley et al. 2010; Science
                       Daily 2010), increase diversity of thought (Ernst & Young 2009), and enhance employee satisfaction
                       (Catalyst 2010). Examples of such benefits are detailed in Annex 2.

                       The issues under discussion here are as relevant to improving business performance as they are to
                       promoting gender diversity in the boardroom. There is a clear business case for balanced boards.
                       If they are inclusive and diverse, boards are more likely to be effective and in a better position to
                       understand their customers and stakeholders and better manage risk. Gender diversity also brings fresh
                       perspectives and new ideas into the boardroom and in turn leads to better decision making. Research
                       by the Harvard Business Review about boardroom diversity surveyed 294 women and 104 men in U.S.
                       companies; 34 percent of women and 57 percent of men said that women bring fresh perspectives and
                       diversity of thought (Groysberg and Bell 2013).

                       Globally, a growing body of evidence backs the business case that there is a positive relationship
                       between gender diversity in boardrooms and companies’ financial performance. Companies with more
                       women on their boards were found to outperform their rivals with a 42 percent higher return in sales,
                       66 percent higher return on invested capital, and 53 percent higher return on equity (Joy et al. 2007).
                       Box 1.2 provides additional evidence.

Gender Diversity in Jordan




A study by Credit Suisse’s Research Institute looked at over 2,000 global companies. Its results
show that companies with female representation in the boardroom clearly outperform their peers in
performance and share price. Also, the study shows that companies with greater gender diversity in
their boardrooms tend to exhibit less share price volatility (Credit Suisse 2012).

Earlier research (McKinsey & Company 2007) also showed that companies perform best –
organizationally and financially – when women are most strongly represented on the board or at the
top management level. Companies with the most gender-diverse management teams outperformed the
industry average in the following financial measures:

     10 percent higher ROE (return on equity)
	 •  

     48 percent higher EBIT (earnings before interest and tax)
	 •  

     1.7x stock price growth
	 •  

Also, increasing gender diversity is becoming high on the global agenda, with a growing demand from
shareholders, consumers, and stakeholders. For example, pressure from shareholders drove Apple
to make changes to diversify its board. Other social-networking companies, such as Facebook and
Twitter, were also criticized for not having any female directors (Satariano 2014).

Blue-chip companies in London are also under scrutiny for their all-male boards, with pressure to bring
in female directors. The scrutiny and pressure came from key investors and shareholders, such as the
Local Authority Pension Fund. This resulted in companies such as Antofagasta and Glencore adding
women to their boards (Hume and Aglionby 2014). Other companies, such as American Apparel, also
are increasing the number of women on their boards to overcome various challenges (Duprey 2014).


1.3 Putting Jordan into perspective

In Jordan, women represent 15.60 percent of the labor force. Yet in publicly listed companies, where
the average board size is eight members, only 3.54 percent of board members are women, and women
hold only 21 percent of senior decision-making positions. Of the 237 publicly listed companies,
185 (78 percent) have no women on their boards.

In private shareholding companies, only 9.10 percent of board members are women, and women chair
2.56 percent of companies. Of the 930 companies, 717 (77 percent) have no women on their boards.
These statistics are some of the lowest in the world, even compared to other Middle Eastern countries.
By contrast, the percentage of females in top management positions in high-income countries is
23 percent and can be up to over 30 percent in countries such as the Philippines (World Bank
Group 2015).

2   Objective of this Publication

    This research aims to raise awareness on the representation of women in the boardroom and in
    senior decision-making positions in Jordan – and illustrate the potential importance and value of such
    diversity to companies.

    The scope of the research is to:

    	       apture the degree of female involvement in boardrooms and senior decision-making positions
        1. c
           in the corporate world;

    	       emonstrate the value of the presence women in the boardroom and senior decision-making
        2. d
           positions; and

    	   3. present some of the challenges that women face in reaching such decision-making positions.

    The focus of this research is to assess whether a correlation can be made between gender diversity
    in the boardroom and the financial performance of Jordanian companies. We believed that such a
    correlation does exist, and we tested that hypothesis by collecting and analyzing gender-disaggregated
    company and board information.

    There is some evidence that increased diversity (in all its forms) in the boardroom generally improves
    the performance of boards and in turn companies, as demonstrated earlier in Section 1.2. However,
    we were disappointed to discover that, for Jordan, there is insufficient annual data (quantitative or
    qualitative) reflecting the gender diversity of boardrooms in connection with the financial performance
    of companies. The latest data were from March 2006, at which time “… when the top 50 companies
    were ranked by size of their market capital … there was a correlation (p = 0.032) between size of
    market capital and the presence of women directors” (Singh 2006).

    The objective of this research is to improve the awareness and understanding of the current status of
    Jordanian companies regarding gender diversity; to explore the possible correlation of gender diversity
    with financial performance – and the potential benefits; and to identify challenges associated with
    gender diversity in the boardroom and in senior decision-making positions. This report also includes
    some recommendations to address circumstances that came to light from the research.

3   Research Methodology

    In undertaking this research, we used a variety of formats to collect information, namely the following:

    	     1. Desk research

     	 2. Review of annual reports

        	 3. Focus groups

     	 4. One-on-one interviews

     	 5. Online survey


    3.1 Desk research

    The desk research entailed the following:

          Identifying the total number of publicly listed companies, private shareholding companies, and
     	 •  
          limited liability companies that are still active in Jordan (Table 3.1);

           Discovering and quantifying those companies that have women on their boards;
     	 •  

           Collecting financial data from publicly available sources; and
     	 •  

          Analyzing the financial data for ROE and ROA.
     	 •  


    3.2 Review of annual reports

    This review focused on publicly listed companies and captured general information on each company’s
    compliance with corporate governance codes and degree of interest in diversity in the boardroom. We
    also collected information on the size of boards in certain sectors and the number of women on the
    boards per sector, focusing on such sectors as banking, insurance, health, and so on.

     3.3 Focus groups

     We held a total of six focus groups, each with a different target audience, as follows:

     	 1. Only female senior executives and board members;

     	 2. Senior executives and board members from family businesses;

     	 3. Senior executives and board members from listed companies;

     	 4. Senior executives and board members from not-for-profit organizations;

     	         enior executives and board members from companies and organizations based in a city outside
           5. S
              the capital, Amman; and

     	 6. Senior executives and board members from SMEs.

     We selected participants for each focus group based on their experience, position, interest in supporting
     this research, and gender. Each focus group worked with a set of discussion points designed to ascertain
     the importance and value of diversity in the boardroom as well as the challenges involved. Input from
     the participants is integrated into the report. The set of discussion points can be found in Annex 3.
     Table 3.2 summarizes the attendance at the focus groups.

3.4 One-on-one interviews

In addition to collective data, we captured the opinions of key influential leaders in Jordan through
individual interviews. A summary of those interviews can be found in Annex 4.


3.5 Online survey

To collect as much information as possible from a wider range of participants, JIoD administered
an online survey. We circulated it online to over 300 senior executives and directors in Jordan, and
34 people (roughly 11 percent) responded. Here is the breakdown of those who responded to the
online survey:

	 •  50 percent from publicly listed companies;

	 •  15 percent from not-for-profit companies; and

	 •  35 percent from private shareholding and limited liability companies.

Unfortunately, we were not able to break down the responses by sector. Where applicable, the relevant
responses are integrated into the report.

4   Benefits of Women on Boards and in Senior Positions

    Obviously, not all board members, whether women or men, have the same impact, and not all
    necessarily bring an added value to the boardroom. Contributions of board members can depend on
    such factors as personality, commitment, education, professionalism, and many other traits. However,
    the presence of these variables does not diminish the need for a better understanding of the benefits of
    gender diversity, particularly in view of the lack of gender balance in boardrooms and senior decision-
    making positions in Jordan.

    Participants from the focus groups agreed that women on boards add value. They noted, for example,
    that women are committed to work and prepare for meetings well; that they tend to be more detail
    oriented and more cautious than men, which can result in better performance; and that women often
    feel obliged to expend more effort, to prove themselves in front of male colleagues, which can drive
    them to improve their performance. On that last point, an article in the Harvard Business Review
    reports that 14 percent of men say women have to work harder to prove themselves (Groysberg and
    Bell 2013).

    			
       The presence of women also influences the language used in boardrooms
       and the quality of conversations that take place in board meetings. We
       asked one of our interviewees, Maha Al Ali: Do the dynamics change when
       there are women directors? Here is her response: “The dynamics certainly change.
       I feel that men on the board become more professional. They address matters
       more efficiently, and they do not joke as much as when there are women around.”
       (The text of the interview with Maha Al Ali appears in Annex 4.)

    	
    Research shows two key benefits to having more gender diversity in the boardroom and in senior
    decision-making positions:

    	   •  Increased impact on corporate governance; and

     	 •  Positive correlation with the financial performance of companies


    4.1 Increased impact on corporate governance

    Some data suggested that gender diversity had an impact on the degree of implementation of good
    corporate governance practices. This information came largely from annual reports, the online survey,
    and focus group discussions. From those sources, we ascertained that companies with increased
    gender diversity have, to a certain extent, more improved corporate governance implementation than
    companies without gender diversity in the boardroom.

    In the focus groups, participants agreed that women on boards increase board effectiveness through
    better and more constructive discussions, thus ensuring a better decision-making process during board
    meetings. Charlotte Laurent-Ottomane of the Thirty Percent Coalition – an American lobbying group
    devoted to having women fill 30 percent of U.S. board seats by 2015 – is quoted as saying that “female
    board members are more likely to speak out, pose challenging questions, and encourage the entire
    group to become more collaborative and less hierarchical” (Rayasam 2013).

    			
       There is also a perception that women are more detail oriented, tend to
       be more accurate, and have good follow-up skills, and that they are also
       less likely to take risks and are more committed to following internal
       regulations and laws. In an interview, we asked Lina Hundaileh: In your
       opinion, what is the business case for focusing on gender diversity at the board
       level? She responded, “Diversity leads to excellence in business, less corruption,
       and more proactive and productive boards.” (See Annex 4 for the full interview.)



                                                                                                               25
     We also found a consensus that women tend to be less corruptible than men. A 2010 Insync survey had
     similar results, finding that board members on gender-diverse boards believe that they have directors
     who act with greater integrity (Barnett, Morley, and Piterman 2010).

     			
        Do all of these traits make women well suited and effective as board
        members and in senior decision-making positions? We asked Suhail
        Jouaneh: Do the dynamics change when there are women directors? Here’s
        what he said: “It was good to see women reaching such positions with their
        qualifications and professionalism. The dynamics certainly change, as male
        domination seemed to decrease, which enhances the implementation of decisions.”
        (See Annex 4.)


     Women tend to be more outspoken and have higher commitment, which creates an atmosphere that
     pushes their male colleagues and challenges them. An NBC News report asserted that even one woman
     on the board makes a difference (White 2014):

     “One of the key attributes boards need to look for is women who ask really good questions,” said
     Jim Alampi, CEO of executive leadership firm Alampi & Associates, who suggested women are more
     willing to ask questions and challenge the status quo.

     “Even if she doesn’t think of herself as breaking new ground… she’s going to ask questions men
     stopped asking years ago or wouldn’t think to ask,” he said.

     Women have an impact on the corporate governance performance of the board through the dynamics
     of discussions and the quality of decision making. They take a more collaborative approach, and
     boards with women are likely to conform to best practices in board evaluations, codes of conduct,
     conflict of interest, and remuneration in alignment with performance (Braund 2011).

     			
        We asked Maha Al Ali: In your opinion, does diversity lead to good corporate
        governance practices or does good corporate governance lead to more diversity?
        She responded, “Diversity leads to good corporate governance, because it brings
        in more ideas, as men might be concerned with maintaining strong internal
        control, while women might be concerned more with succession and developing
        senior staff, which would lead to better corporate governance.” (See Annex 4.)


     Participants in the focus groups generally agreed that companies with at least one woman in their
     boardroom have the following characteristics:

          Better risk-management processes;
     	 •  

     	 •  Better performing boards;

     	 •  Better meetings (in structure, time, and record keeping);

     	 •  More committees; and

     	 •  Better representation of issues – the bigger picture.

The focus groups provided the following reasons for the better performance of companies that include
women on their boards:

     Board members come to meetings better prepared, therefore the board meetings are more effective.
	 •  

     Women are less risk averse and more detail oriented, which results in better risk management and
	 •  
     more careful decision-making processes.

     Women have a more collaborative approach.
	 •  

A Harvard Business Review survey (Groysberg and Bell 2013) asked board members what they
thought their strengths as board members were. In general, women responded that their strength is in
their ability to communicate effectively. Women also are more likely than their male counterparts to
ask tough questions or move boardroom discussions forward in skilled and effective ways. Male and
Female survey respondents also voted on their strengths and weaknesses as board members and the
responses are listed in Table 4.1.

     One area of disagreement is whether it matters how many women are serving on a board. Some people
     argue that the number of women in the boardroom does make a difference and that gender diversity
     doesn’t really kick in until there are enough women on the board to reach “critical mass” of three or
     more (Kramer, Konrad, and Erkut 2006). According to this point of view, a lone woman is a mere
     token.

     Yet other research suggests that even one woman in the boardroom makes a difference. Of the
     companies in Jordan that have women in the boardroom, 81 percent (42 out of 52 of publicly listed
     companies and 173 from 213 of private shareholding companies) have only one. Therefore, we can
     assume that, of the participants in our focus groups and respondents to the online survey that represent
     companies with women in the boardroom, the majority are from companies with one woman in the
     boardroom. Based on the results and opinions shared, we may conclude that some gender diversity is
     better than none.


     4.2 Gender diversity and financial performance of companies

     It is almost impossible to establish with complete certainly that the improved ROA and ROE in
     companies with women in the boardroom is directly correlated with gender diversity. However, it
     appears that diversity plays a role in promoting improved financial performance of companies and is
     reflected in ROA and ROE. Tables 4.2 and 4.3 and Figures 4.1 and 4.2 suggest a correlation.

5   Analysis of the Financial Impact of Gender Diversity

    This chapter examines the impact of gender diversity on the financial performance of companies that
    have women on their boards. It offers a cross-sector analysis of publicly listed companies and private
    shareholding companies.


    5.1 Gender diversity on boards of publicly listed companies

    There are 237 publicly listed companies trading on the Amman Stock Exchange. Of those, only
    52 companies (22 percent) have women on their boards. (See Figure 5.1.)

    The 237 publicly listed companies represent a total of 1,866 board members. Only 66 of them
    (3.54 percent) are women. (See Figure 5.2.)

    The average board size of the 237 companies is eight members, and 185 of the companies
    (78 percent) do not have any women on their boards. Of the 52 companies that have at least one female
    board member, 42 companies (17.72 percent of listed companies) have one woman, eight companies
    (3.40 percent of listed companies) have two women, one company (0.42 percent of listed companies)
    has three women, one company (0.42 percent of listed companies) has four women on its board.
    (See Figure 5.3.)

     Department of Statistics 2013). Unemployment for those who
     hold a bachelor’s degree or higher was 26.9 percent of men and         ROA
     73.8 percent of women, with variations within those categories
     according to the level of education. Limited representation of
     women on boards may also be linked to investment practices. Few
     women invest in shares of companies.
                                                                                3.03                    1.37            0.99

     that we will note in this section.

     Even with such nominal representation, we found a

                                                                            Source: Authors, based on data collected.
     and the financial performance of companies. For example,
     the average ROA for companies in 2012 was 1.37. For
     companies without female representation it was 0.99, and for
     the 52 companies with female representation, it was 3.03 –
     indicating that companies that have women on their boards
     have above-average performance, and companies without
     women on their boards have below-average performance.
     (See Figure 5.4.)

     We further broke down the assessment of ROA for companies with women in the boardroom, based
     on the number of female board members. In ROA, the company with four women on the board
     performed best, with an ROA of 11.74. And all companies with at least one woman performed well
     above the average ROA. (See Figure 5.5.) The data trend holds true from 2009 to 2012. A breakdown
     of the data in the previous years can be found in Annex 5.

                      We identified a similar correlation for ROE. The average ROE for listed companies in 2012 was
                      11.54, and for companies without female representation it was 9.83. However, for companies
                      with one or more women on their boards, the ROE was 17.51. (See Figure 5.4.)
                      ROE data for companies with women on the board show that companies with two women in
                      the boardroom performed best, with an ROE of 22.06. The company with three women in the
                      boardroom performed just a little below market average2, while all other companies with women
                      on boards performed well above market average. (See Figure 5.5.) The data trend holds true from
                      2009 to 2012. A breakdown of the data in the previous years can be found in Annex 5.

     Women in senior management
     Based on the data just presented, it is difficult to justify resistance to gender diversity in the boardroom.
     To better understand the minimal representation of women in high-level positions in Jordanian
     companies, we used publicly available information, such as companies’ reports and information
     disclosed to ASE, to research the number of senior management seats held by women. We found
     that women hold only 21 percent of the senior management positions in publicly listed companies.
     (See Figure 5.6.)

     One of the criteria in choosing a board member is the candidate’s professional position. It is especially
     advantageous for the prospective board member to have served as a CEO or general manager. Given
     that there are few women in senior management positions, it harder for women than men to be
     considered for a board post.

     Although the low representation of women in senior management positions helps explain why there
     are not many women in the boardroom, it does not fully explain how low the numbers actually are.
     For instance, only 3.54 percent of board members are women, and only 2.60 percent of privately held
     companies have a female chair. (For more on this topic, see Section 6.2.)

     Another factor to consider is that, although 21 percent of women are in senior positions, the influence
     of these positions may vary. Many of them are not on a path that can lead to the boardroom. A 2014
     Credit Suisse research report contended that some senior positions “reflect less influential positions
     in the management’s structure… The relative scarcity of women overseeing product lines or entire
     business units risks slowing their advance to the very top. Even when looking at management structures
     – aside from boards – women appear to have more supervision than direct influence” (Credit Suisse
     2014). Table 5.1 illustrates findings from the Credit Suisse research, and Box 5.1 provides a more
     personal view.

     Several of the participants in our focus groups suggested that some companies discriminate against
     married women. Such discrimination limits the opportunities for a married woman to grow in her
     career, hence limiting her chance of rising to an executive position and in turn the boardroom. There
     appears to be a perception that single women are more devoted to work and so they deliver better than
     married women. In upper management, single women and men have almost the same opportunities
     and options, while married women have fewer opportunities and options compared to married men.

     Type of industry also can be a factor in the rise of women to decision-making positions. Banking,
     for example, encourages women to advance and makes it easier for them to gain access to executive
     management and to boardrooms. In some other sectors, such as industrial, it is harder for women
     to advance. However, some professional women have a better understanding of specific industries,
     especially when the beneficiaries or targeted groups are females. Therefore, they bring a perspective
     that adds value.

     Also, we cannot overlook the role that company culture plays in women’s professional advancement
     in Jordan. Companies with a foreign influence, for example, or international organizations have values
     and systems that support women representation more than local organizations.

                       Some of the male participants in our focus groups suggested that
                       one of the reasons for not selecting women to serve on boards is
                       that they lack economic power, since most of them are not major
                       shareholders. These men felt that women should have some
                       economic influence, such as owning stocks or shareholdings, before
                       they can reach senior levels.

                       The governance system in Jordan and current regulations do require
                       directors to have a certain level of shareholding to be nominated,
                       which means that only women with shares can be directors.
                       Alternatively, women can be nominated as directors on behalf of                                    21%
                       corporate shareholders; however, in this case, they would need to

                       be in senior positions to be nominated.                                                   management seats
                                                                                                                  held by women
                       From the online surveys of publicly listed companies, we learned
                       that most women who attain high-level positions are representatives
                                                                                              Source: Authors, based on data collected.
                       of various shareholders and accordingly are not there based on their
                       own capital. Therefore, their lack of capital, or nominal holdings,
                       should not be hindrance for women in accessing boardrooms.

                       To better understand female representation in publicly listed
                       companies, we researched the share ownership by women. The
                       Securities Depository Centre analyzes deposited ownership by
                       investor type (individuals, corporate, and joint) and then by
                       nationality. Individual ownership is further divided by gender.
                       The total value of deposits owned by individuals amounts to 30.497
                       percent – 6.357 percent by women (foreign and Jordanian) and
                       24.140 percent by men (foreign and Jordanian). The total value is
                       approximately 5.494 billion Jordanian dinars JD, JD 1.145 billion
                       of which is owned by women and JD 4.349 billion of which is
                       owned by men (Jordan Securities Commission no date).




                                                                                                                                          35
     Of the deposits owned, categorized by gender, Jordanian women own 4.896 percent of the value, and
     Jordanian men own 19.376 percent. The total value is approximately JD 4.372 billion, with women
     owning JD 882 million and men owning JD 3.49 billion (Jordan Securities Commission no date).
     Figure 5.7 provides additional information.

     We asked board members what, in their opinion, helped them become board members, and 57 percent
     of the respondents said their level of previous experience is what helped them, 14 percent said it was
     their competencies, 14 percent said it was their ownership of shares, and 14 percent said “other,”
     which includes reasons such as family relationships. None of the respondents said that it was their
     relations and network, specific technical knowledge, or their political engagement.

     From the online survey, 42 percent of board members said their professional experience comes from
     executive management, followed by 17 percent from a public relations background. So it would be a
     mistake not to highlight the importance of having women in senior executive positions if they are to
     get into the boardroom.


         Gender diversity in private shareholding companies
     5.2 

     Two types of shareholding companies are permissible in Jordan: a limited liability company and a
     private shareholding company. Simply put, the difference between them is that a private shareholding
     company has the flexibility to have varying governance structures and allows for preferential shares, if
     necessary, to streamline the company to become a publicly listed company or attract foreign investors.

     It was very difficult to collect data for private shareholding companies and limited liability companies
     because of the minimal public disclosure of information required by law. There are 936 active private
     shareholding companies and 35,697 active limited liability companies in Jordan. This analysis is limited
     to private shareholding companies and based on publicly available information on the Companies
     Controller’s Department’s (CCD) website3. We collected more qualitative information from focus
     group discussions.

     Of the 993 private shareholding companies in Jordan, 936 were still operational at the time we
     conducted this research. It is worthy to note that not all private shareholding companies are required
     to have a board, and there are six companies that do not. Of the 930 companies with boards,
     213 companies (22.75 percent) have women in their boardroom. (See Figure 5.8.)

     The 930 private shareholding companies have a total of 3,126 board members. Of those, only
     284 (9.1 percent) are women. (See Figure 5.9.)

     Of the 930 private shareholding companies, we learned that there are 24 female chairs, which translates
     to female leadership in 2.6 percent of companies. (See Figure 5.10.) This low percentage underscores
     the lack of female presence in leadership positions, a circumstance that some companies believe should
     be addressed.

     Of the 930 private shareholding companies, 717 companies (77 percent) do not have any women on
     boards. Of the 213 companies that do have women board members, 173 companies (18.48 percent)
     have only one woman in the boardroom; 36 companies (3.85 percent) have two women; three
     companies (0.32 percent) have three women; and only one company (0.11 percent) has four women in
     the boardroom. (See Figure 5.11.)

     5.3 Cross-sector analysis

     In view of the limited information available for private shareholding companies, we decided to focus
     on publicly listed companies for further sector analysis. Our analysis took two routes, as follows:

     	 •  Based on ASE’s sector division (banking, insurance, financial services, industrial, and services);
          and

          Based on sectors where women have a high presence compared to where women have no presence.
     	 •  

     Sector analysis based on ASE sectors
     A generic sector analysis, built on the ASE sector divide, demonstrates a positive correlation between
     female representation in the boardroom and the financial performance of companies in all sectors.
     Table 5.2 shows a summary of the ASE sectors.

     Credit Suisse research mapped more than 28,000 senior managers at over 3,000 companies in
     40 countries. Table 5.3 provides a global comparison of female representation on boards in those
     countries, by sector (Credit Suisse 2014).

     It appears that Jordan’s female representation in the boardroom is well below the global average by
     sector as well. However, even with such minimal representation, raw data suggest that companies with
     women in the boardroom outperform companies without any women representation in the boardroom.
     Tables 5.4 and 5.5 summarize sector performance for the years 2012 and 2011, respectively. A more
     detailed sector analysis based on ASE sectors can be found in Annex 7.

     Sector analysis: High female presence versus no female presence
     Our research showed that women have the highest representation in the health (10.71 percent) and
     education (7.14 percent) sectors, compared to many sectors were woman have no representation at
     all, such as engineering and communication and technology. A breakdown of female representation in
     additional sectors can be found in Annex 8. We chose to analyze gender diversity within the sectors
     where women have a high representation (health and education) against sectors without female
     representation (engineering and communication and technology).

     Health sector
     The health sector has a total of four companies, and three of them have one female board member
     each. The four companies have a total of 28 board members, only three of which are women – a
     representation rate of 10.7 percent. We compared the companies’ ROA and ROE. On average, the
     companies with women outperformed the company without women in 2012. But in 2011, they
     performed below average. (See Table 5.6.)

     Education sector
     There are six companies in the education sector. Three of them have women on the board.
     Two of those three companies have only one woman on the board, and the third has two women
     on the board. The six companies have a total of 56 board members, only four of whom are women
     – a representation rate of 7.1 percent. We compared the companies’ ROA and ROE. On average,
     companies with two women outperformed the other companies in 2012 and 2011; companies with
     only one women performed below average in 2011 and 2012. (See Table 5.7.)

     Communication and technology sector
     There are two listed companies in the communication and technology sector, with total of 13 board
     members. (See Table 5.8.)

     Engineering sector
     There are seven listed companies in the engineering sector, with a total of 72 board members.
     (See Table 5.9.)

     The above data show little correlation of gender diversity with companies financial performance.
     If anything, it shows that companies with female representation are performing below average.

     Nonetheless, it appears from the sectors selected for evaluation that sectors with female representation
     (health and education) outperformed sectors without any female representation (communication and
     technology and engineering). Also, it appears that the education sector, with companies that had more
     than one woman in the boardroom, outperformed the health sector, with only one women in the
     boardroom. (See Figure 5.12.)

6   Link between Gender and Financial Performance

    While the data suggest a positive correlation between having women in the boardroom and the financial
    performance of companies, we acknowledge that we cannot state that women in the boardroom are
    the reason behind improved performance, since we cannot identify a direct connection between gender
    and financial performance or provide any form of solid evidence to support such a connection. Data do
    not exist to answer some key questions, such as the following:

    	      Is it a mere coincidence that women are in the boardrooms of companies that are more successful?
        •  

    	      Do women tend to join companies that are more successful?
        •  

    	      Are companies that are more successful more inclined to bring in women to serve on their boards?
        •  

    	      Do women have an impact on the performance of companies?
        •  

    However, it would be valid to assume, based on the data, that there is some connection between the
    improved performance of companies and having women in the boardroom. Therefore, we contend that
    there is a connection between gender diversity and the financial performance of companies, for various
    reasons, such as the following:

    1. Improved diversity ensures greater effort across the board.
    Having women in the boardroom encourages the board to perform better and therefore affects the
    financial performance of the company. Women’s role in this dynamic may be to facilitate better
    discussions, encourage more innovative thinking, ask the difficult questions, challenge the status quo,
    and so on – resulting in better decisions. Does this mean that the women in the boardroom made
    a better decision or played a role in bringing about a better decision? Also, to what extent was the
    women’s role critical? These causality questions are very difficult to answer.

    2. Diversity provides for a mix of leadership skills.
    Neither gender is intrinsically better than the other. However, speaking in generalities, each gender
    does bring in a different skill set and mindset. Having women in the boardroom enables the board
    to manage broader issues and consider different perspectives, resulting in a more well-rounded
    approach to decision making. For example, NASA has completed various studies on the impact of
    mixed-gender crews. The studies found that women’s leadership styles were characterized by task
    orientation, mentoring others, and concern with the needs of others, while all-male expeditions were
    characterized by competitiveness and little sharing of personal concerns. According to NASA, crew
    members reported a general sense of “calmer missions” with women on board. Also, 75 percent of male
    crew members noted a reduction in rude behavior.

    3. Diversity reflects a better understanding of the stakeholders.
    Women represent a large part of the population. Having women in the boardroom to speak to and
    better understand consumers is an advantage that can steer decisions toward increased success and
    better performance. Such input that can affect decisions in the boardroom can also affect the direction
    and performance of companies. (See Box 6.1.)



                        Box 6.1
                        Women Appealing to Stakeholders

                        A 2011 study by a management professor at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology found no
                        relationship between women in the boardroom and the stock market performance, with
                        two exceptions: consumer-oriented companies (because women tend to control household
                        purchases, and other women understand what appeals to them) and companies with a large
                        female workforce (because women can hold onto talent better and decrease employee turnover).

7   Challenges for Women in Jordan

    To gain better insights into the cultural influences on women in board and upper-management positions,
    and the challenges they face, we asked our participants for their views on the subject. The following are
    summaries of some of the key points they made:

         Participation of women at high levels is a result of their ambition to reach top management.
    	 •  
         However, some women lack this ambition and enter the job market merely to supplement their
         family incomes or to become financially independent; these women are not likely to make the
         effort to attain a senior position. (See Box 7.1.)

         Some women with good educational backgrounds and career paths lose their credibility at work
    	 •  
         because of their feminine characteristics. For instance, they approach decisions emotionally
         instead of professionally and take issues more personally.

         Young women often have no clear objectives and take no practical steps toward building a
    	 •  
         career path, and some of them consider working as a chance to find their life partner or for
         guaranteeing a particular level of financial independence.

         When women do get to boardrooms, they have to deal with the negative attitudes of some male
    	 •  
         board members who just look at them as women, not taking into consideration their professional
         qualifications. A female board member typically must prove herself before her colleagues start to
         see her as a peer.

         Women should be encouraged to perceive themselves as equal to men, and the corporate world
    	 •  
         should place more trust in them.

    We reiterate that these points are the opinions of some of the participants in the focus group and not
    evidence based on data. However, we include them here as a representative sample of current views on
    professional women in Jordan.

                                         Conflicting Data about How Ambitious Women Are

                                         On the one hand, there is evidence that women are not as ambitious as
                                         men. Some survey data show particular character traits that are likely
                                         to impede professional progress for women, and women appear to have
                                         lower professional ambitions than men. According to a Harvard Business
                                         Review survey, only 15 percent of highly qualified women aspire to positions
                                         of power, as compared to an average 27 percent of men. A 2011 survey of
                                         3,000 members of the Institute of Leadership and Management suggested
                                         that women’s aspirations to lead and manage were well below that of their
                                         male colleagues for all working ages: in the survey, only half of women
                                         said they expected to become managers, versus nearly two-thirds of men
                                         (Credit Suisse 2012).
                                         On the other hand, there is evidence that women are more ambitious than
                                         men and have clearer career paths than men (Groysberg and Bell 2013).
                                         But cultural influences appear to be a factor. For example, one survey found
                                         that 85 percent of women in India and 92 percent of women in the United
                                         Arab Emirates consider themselves very ambitious. The same survey found
                                         that 63 percent of women in Russia and 65 percent of women in China
                                         consider themselves ambitious, compared to only 36 percent of U.S. women
                                         (Hewlett and Rashid 2010).

     The many challenges and barriers preventing women from getting to the boardroom can be grouped
     into four categories:

     	 • Cultural

     	 • Capacity

     	 • Interpersonal

     	 • Appointment process


     7.1 Cultural

     Cultural barriers are perhaps the hardest to capture. In an attempt to do so, we further divided them
     into different components: society, sheer numbers, financial ability, and social (unconscious) bias.

     Society
     Within society, values may be driven through religion. A view held by many Jordanians is that the
     role of women should be confined to the family and household and should not extend to the business
     world and workplace. Other barriers come from the corporate culture of companies and the way
     organizations operate. Corporate culture in Jordan appears to limit the growth, development, and
     advancement of women (Scheme 2013).

     Women in Jordan are expected to manage a lot of their family-related responsibilities, which creates
     pressure on them because it is hard to balance professional and family responsibilities (Jordan
     Department of Statistics 2013b). Further, some families put enormous pressure on young professional
     women, preventing them from working long hours, encouraging them not to take evening shifts, and
     so on, which hinders them from taking on more responsibilities and reaching higher management
     levels. Some professional women who reach middle management sometimes have to leave their posts
     because of family or social pressures (Jordan Department of Statistics 2013b).

     But it is not just others’ perceptions of female employees that create potential barriers to promotion;
     more women than men choose to opt out of a professional career to have – or look after – a family.
     This automatically reduces the talent pool that managers can choose from and limits the number of
     women available for board positions (Credit Suisse 2012).

     Sheer numbers
     Part of the reason women are not accessing boardrooms in Jordan is that they are generally
     underrepresented in the workforce. Jordan’s population is 51.5 percent males and 48.5 percent
     females. Yet only 15.6 percent of Jordan’s permanent fulltime employees are female, and only
     13.2 percent of women are in the labor force. The female unemployment rate is 22.2 percent,
     compared to the male unemployment rate of 10.6 percent (Jordan Department of Statistics 2013c).
     Women’s low participation in the workplace leaves women in Jordan not only without professional
     exposure, experience, and networks, but also without financial power, making it generally difficult
     for women to reach senior decision-making positions. Also, women are concentrated in certain fields
     such as education (41.0 percent), health and social work (14.7 percent) and public administration
     (14.1 percent) (Jordan Department of Statistics 2013b).

Financial ability
Some family cultures hinder women members from participating in family capital management,
fearing interference from external members (spouses of female family members), as they consider them
strangers when it comes to family business or money issues. Moreover, some male family members
prefer to divide the fortune and exclude females from any family business; accordingly, women are
excluded from being business partners, managers, or board directors.

This insufficient financial ability is made worse by the fact that women invest only nominally in shares
and so have limited representation in companies. For example, Jordanian women own 4.896 percent
of the value of security deposits versus 19.376 percent owned by Jordanian men (Jordan Securities
Commission no date).

Social (unconscious) bias
Social bias exists in Jordan, consciously or in many instances unconsciously. Many experiments, such
as the following, have verified the presence of bias:

Harvard Business School ran a gender-based experiment on students entering its MBA program in
2011 - 2013. The objective was to ascertain why fewer women were making the top 5 percent, even
though both men and women had comparable test results when entering the program.

The team conducting the experiment began by eliminating unconscious grading and memory bias
in the classroom. First, they noted that male-dominant behavior in classroom participation did two
things: 1. it affected the professor’s memory of classroom participation, and 2. it minimized female
participation. To counterbalance this male dominance, they introduced court stenographers and
provided hand-raising coaching to female students. The team also found that female students were
socially conditioned to choose between academic and social success, while for men these aspects were
closely intertwined.

After the two-year experiment, the gender gap in performance narrowed dramatically, and women
made up 40 percent of the top 5 percent at graduation. However, it was difficult to know with certainty
why this change occurred. The New York Times analyzed the experiment and identified three possible
potential drivers for this change: 1. efforts to reduce unconscious bias in grading through the court
stenographer and hand-raising techniques; 2. creating an improved environment inside and outside
the classroom to create more welcoming surroundings for women; and/or 3) an easing of grading on
women. It is most probably a combination of all three, but the key takeaway is that in an unbiased
environment women can narrow the gender gap considerably (Kantor 2013).

Another study confirmed that behavior patterns are generally perceived differently for men and
women. For example, an ambitious male is seen as wanting to succeed, as driven, and as someone
with leadership potential; a similarly ambitious woman is often dismissed as not a team player and as
someone difficult to manage (Credit Suisse 2014).

Another study, by the Harvard University John F. Kennedy School of Government, revealed the specific
impact of stereotyping in the boardroom. The study gave two groups of MBA students separate case
studies that were identical in all but one detail: the chief executive was named John in one and Jane
in the other. The students evaluated the performance of Jane more severely than the performance of
John, even though the two had delivered exactly the same performance. The perception embodied in
the stereotype is that men are better leaders than women (Credit Suisse 2012).

This social bias exists everywhere, including Jordan. For example, if a women applies for a job that is
traditionally a male-dominated post, she is not likely to be considered for such post, even if she is as
qualified as the male applicants (Scheme 2013).




                                                                                                           47
     7.2 Capacity

     Of course, not all women (or men, for that matter) have the capacity, training, and necessary skills to
     become board members. However, certain factors assist people in attaining board membership and
     senior decision-making positions. Two key factors are education and training.

     Education
     According to education data in Jordan, women are as educated as men in general; 51 percent of
     women have an intermediate diploma, a BA degree, or higher. However, the disciplines most favored
     by women differ from those pursued by men.

     For example, substantially more women than men enter into the educational sciences (22.5 percent
     versus 5.8 percent for men) and the humanities (23.8 percent versus 14.0 percent for men), while
     substantially more men enter into engineering, manufacturing, and construction (17.1 percent versus
     4.3 percent for women) and services (4.1 percent versus 1.4 percent for women).

     It is interesting to note that the female and male graduates are comparable in the social sciences,
     business, and law. But those fields are still more preferred by men (34.0 percent versus 22.3 percent
     for women).

     Based on the above data, women seem to be confined to education in certain sectors that offer
     limited opportunity to advance to senior decision-making posts in key sectors such as engineering,
     manufacturing, and construction.

     Training
     Women tend to receive less on-the-job training than men. Research undertaken in Jordan in 2013
     about corporate social responsibility and gender (Scheme 2013), found that companies inadvertently
     invest more in the training of their male employees than their female employees. In one example,
     internal training was provided and accessible to all employees; however, external training was provided
     to 29 percent of the men and only 17 percent of the women.

     Most of the companies in the study made the in-house training open to all employees equally. However,
     the timing and location of such training made it inaccessible to some of the female employees. Based on
     that research, it is important for companies to invest more in providing on-the-job training for women
     and to make the times and locations accessible to them.

7.3 Interpersonal

To advance in a company, it helps to be known to the people who can facilitate such advancement.
Social networks and informal relationships are important to being “seen” by the “higher-ups.” One
of the observations that came out of the focus groups is that women have a limited ability to network
with board chairs and board members, which limits their opportunity to be nominated to join boards.

In a study reported in the Harvard Business Review (“Dysfunction in the boardroom”), 33 percent of the
men who took part in the study said that women have limited access to and acceptance on boards because
of weaker networks (Groysberg and Bell 2013). If women are not “seen” in the workplace or through
various networking activities, they are unlikely to be considered for promotions or board memberships.


   In our interview with Ghassan Nuqul (Vice chair of Nuqul Group, one of the major
			
   investors and biggest industrial groups in the Middle East), we asked: How would
   you characterize the opportunities for professional women in Jordan today? He
   responded, “There are opportunities, but I believe women need to be seen as more
   active in their fields to become future leaders and board members.” (See Annex 4.)


Also, there are usually godfathers in the workplace to support potential members before and after
reaching the boardroom. However, there are few if any godmothers providing that kind of support
for women. We identified several reasons for this lack of female mentoring, including the following:

	 1. there are only a few women in positions to provide mentoring;

	 2. those few women invest little or no time in bridging the gender gap;

	 3. traditionally and socially, women are not geared to support other women; and

      he media do not cover many, if any, success stories and achievements of female role models to
	 4. t
     encourage other women.

Participants in the focus groups also mentioned that some women in top management or in boardrooms
do not deal positively with each other, making women their own enemies. A study of Danish companies
found that having a woman in a very senior position in a company does not lead to increased recruitment
of female board directors, nor does a female board chair improve the representation of women on a
board. In fact, it appears that companies with a female chair have, on average, a 9 percent lower share
of women board members (Parrotta and Smith 2013).

However, there is not universal agreement on this point. Some observers argue that having more
women in senior decision-making positions encourages having more women in the company, thus
increasing the pipeline of women in the organization. (See Box 7.2.)




                                                                                                          49
                     7.4. Appointment process

                     The way people are appointed to board and management positions is a critical component in the analysis
                     of gender diversity. The factors mentioned earlier – culture, capacity, and interpersonal challenges –
                     contribute to an environment in which women are less likely to be nominated for appointment to
                     boards or other decision-making posts. This challenge is part of what has come to be called the “glass
                     ceiling,” a notion that makes it even more unlikely that women will be considered for such positions.

                     Ideally, there should be a well-defined process for appointing board members and senior decision
                     makers. And it should be based on talent, qualifications, and other such attributes. (See Box 7.3.)

                     In reality, however, the appointment process is typically ad hoc. Shareholders and board members tend
                     to elect people they know, relatives, and people considered within the communities as leaders. Women
                     generally are not considered part of that pool for several reasons:

                          Because of their minimal networking activities and involvement, they are not as well known

Furthermore, the presence of women on boards had a
stronger impact on the growth of women in line positions
than in staff positions. Line experience is necessary for
advancement into CEO and top leadership positions,
and Catalyst’s annual censuses show that women are
historically underrepresented in these roles. This research
demonstrates the important contribution that women
board directors make in ensuring that women get this
critical experience.

Accordingly, women are disadvantaged at the get-go of the nomination process and in turn the
appointment process. It is not enough to create a gender-blind appointment process, but there also
needs to be an active proposition to search for and identify qualified women (Kramer, Konrad, and
Erkut 2006). Even where family and social pressures do not exist, there is a perceived glass ceiling
for women in organizations: only 21 percent of women reach senior management positions, and only
4 percent of women are represented in the boardrooms of publicly listed companies.

Social conditioning over centuries, depicting a father as the breadwinner and a mother as the primary
caregiver, has led to a pervasive unconscious bias against women in the workplace today and a
reluctance to promote women because of the expectation that they will eventually put any family
responsibility first. This old “too risky to promote” attitude can trigger a self-fulfilling prophecy and a
vicious cycle; lack of promotion is one of the top reasons cited by women for leaving their jobs (Credit
Suisse 2014).

Credit Suisse’s research identified slightly different obstacles standing between women and the
boardroom or senior decision-making positions. Table 7.1 depicts the way Credit Suisse grouped those
obstacles.

8   Trends for Implementing Board Diversification

    Now that we have identified a business case for gender diversity in the boardroom, let’s consider some
    of the means that can be used to change the status quo and increase gender diversity in boardrooms
    in Jordan. Countries around the globe have used various strategies to address the issue of gender
    diversity. We will examine five strategies – regulations, quotas, disclosure requirements, voluntary
    requirements, and corporate policies – and briefly discuss how they may apply to Jordan.


    8.1 Regulations

    Some countries have adopted various regulations        Box 8.1
    that encourage and enable increased female             Diversity Charter
    participation in the workplace in general and

    in some cases in the boardroom. However, it is
                                                           on to a diversity charter found the following:

    the ranks in organizations. The following are          Source: (Sealy, Doldor, and Vinnicombe 2009)
    examples of such regulations issued by various
    countries:

         Establishing quotas for women (described in further detail below);
    	 •  

    	 •  Issuing diversity guidelines – Australia (see Box 8.1);

         Establishing a national advisory council to promote the participation of women on corporate
    	 •  
         boards – Canada;

         Encouraging boards to have more formal processes and cultures that leverage individual
    	 •  
         contributions;

         Amending regulations to provide improved parental rights, thus encouraging women to return

    In the context of Jordan, some of these regulations would be of great value but would be challenging
    to implement. Some of them have been issued, but they have yet to be implemented in full force.
    For example, the Social Security Fund created the Maternity Fund to encourage the employment of
    women, the Labor Law was amended to consider sexual harassment in the workplace, and there is a
    requirement to have a crèche in the workplace under certain conditions, to enable women to return to
    work if they have children below the age of four. These laws, regulations, and national initiatives (with
    the exception of the Maternity Fund) are still not fully enforced or implemented.

     8.2 Quotas

     The idea of quotas has generated much debate and many different approaches. Quotas can be imposed
     on a compulsory or a voluntary basis and with sanctions (Italy) or without (Austria). Quotas can be
     applied to senior management positions and board membership. And they can be applied in absolute
     terms as a percentage or fraction of the board (Belgium) or merely as a representative sample (Germany).

     Some of the participants in the focus groups expressed resistance to the idea of regulatory quotas
     with sanctions. (In discussing regulations, there had been general agreement that regulations without
     sanctions are less likely to be implemented, and this led to the discussion of quotas with sanctions.)
     The basis of the participants’ objection to quotas with sanctions was the belief that change has to take
     place in the community itself through working on cultural barriers, and that this change will result in
     change in the boardroom without legislation.

     Another argument against setting a quota is that it does not effectively address the issue of the pipeline
     of women in companies and in senior decision-making positions. Rather, it is a short-term box-ticking
     solution that may have the unintended consequence of harming the financial performance of markets,
     since a number of companies might delist to avoid having to comply with such a requirement (Bertrand
     et al. 2014).

     Also, setting a quota may lower the morale and confidence of women. The Scandinavian markets have
     delivered significantly higher female board representation, but other research suggests that forcing
     the issue via quotas has been to the detriment of morale, the working environment, and potentially
     profitability (Credit Suisse 2012).

     Participants of the focus groups also pointed out that the quota system weakens the position of
     women and invites such risks as the appointment of women who lack the necessary experience to be
     a board member, which in turn creates a “bad image” of the presence of women in the boardroom.


     			In an interview, we asked Laith Al Qasem (Owner and chair of Arabian
         Business Consultants for Development.): What has been your experience sitting
         on boards with women directors? Here is his response: “I have generally had
         good experiences with women board members. Most women are better listeners
         than men and take more time in making and weighing decisions. Some women,
         however, feel that they need to be more impetuous (that is, macho), and they
         tend to be abrasive, erratic, and often wrong. Also, I have witnessed poor
         cooperation between women on a board, which was destructive and alarming.”


     On the other hand, participants pointed out that having a quota is a good step to help overcome some
     cultural barriers and facilitate women’s access to boardrooms, giving them a chance to show their
     ability. In Jordan, quotas have been used for parliamentary elections and have resulted in increased
     female representation; more women run for elections. Also, in view of some of the successes of women
     in parliament, some women are now winning elections outside the quota confines. (See also Box 8.2.)

     In addition to the debate for and against quotas, it is important to consider the potential challenges
     of implementing such quotas on a corporate level. Also, will the quotas apply to listed companies,
     state-owned enterprises, or all types of companies? Table 8.1 shows countries that have implemented
     a quota system.

Box 8.2
Quotas in Politics

A study on the impact of quotas in politics examined the
effect that the 1998 implementation of reserved seats for
women in local village elections in India had on gender-
stereotypical beliefs. Under this quota, one-third of village
councils were randomly selected at every election and
made to appoint a female chief councilor. The study looked
at 7,000 households in 495 villages in West Bengal and
perceptions following the 1998 and 2003 elections.
The findings show a dramatic impact on the perceptions
of the effectiveness of female leadership, but only after
the second round of having a female chief councilor. The
introduction of these quotas also raised parental aspirations
for daughters and the aspirations of girls for themselves.
However, even with this positive change in attitude toward
female effectiveness, both female board and management
participation levels in India are only about 7 percent today.

     for gender data, including plans and targets to limit the gender gap    A survey to find out why women are good
     in boardrooms and senior management. In some cases disclosure           for business identified the following factors

8.5 Corporate policies

Some countries have taken a different approach, requiring companies to implement policies that
encourage gender balance in the workplace and channel a percentage of women into the boardroom.
Companies also have used different strategies to achieve gender diversity. Here are some examples:

      assistance, and advice for up-and-coming women to help them learn how to handle situations
      that their experience has not prepared them for;

      Creating tailored programs for women, addressing some of the personal issues that women may

    Gender Diversity in Jordan




9   Conclusion and Recommendations

    We believe that the data we have cited, as well as the information provided from focus groups,
    interviews, and online surveys, make a strong case that greater gender diversity on boards and more
    women in senior decision-making positions add value to companies. We also have shown that there are
    many challenges involved in increasing gender diversity at these top levels of organizations.

    In collaboration with the participants of the study, we have identified specific areas of challenges in
    addressing gender issues: cultural, capacity, interpersonal, appointment process, and overall. Below, we
    offer – in each of those areas – some suggestions and recommendations to encourage greater gender
    diversity in the boardroom. We also recognize that undertaking such a change requires the engagement
    and buy-in of all the stakeholders involved, such as governments, corporations, communities,
    associations, and individuals.


    9.1 Cultural

    For purposes of making recommendations, we have divided the “cultural” area into subcategories:
    society, sheer numbers, financial ability, and social (unconscious) bias.

    Society
    To offset the cultural and social challenges, it is worth considering establishing voluntary quotas for
    companies (public, state-owned, and private). Quotas would be voluntary for a period of two or
    three years, after which they would be enforced with sanctions and penalties for noncompliance. This
    transitional approach would create increased awareness of the importance of gender diversity and
    encourage organizations to invest in gender diversity throughout the workplace.

    Action items:

    	 •  Lobby the organizations to encourage them to implement the quota.

         Advocate that companies create more awareness of the value of gender diversity by integrating a
    	 •  
         gender-sensitive training component into all programs.

    Sheer numbers
    To overcome the imbalance of women to men in the workplace, it is important for favorable regulations
    to be enforced – for example, regulations associated with crèches in the workplace – and for companies
    to implement initiatives that 1. encourage women to enter the workplace; 2. retain women in the
    workplace; and 3. facilitate their development in the workplace.

    Action items:

         Lobby the appropriate authorities for the creation of friendlier working environments for women,
    	 •  
         including but not limited to increased enforcement of the labor law related to crèches, creating
         flexible working options, and so on.

         Integrate some of the findings in this report with the many ongoing gender initiatives as a way to
    	 •  
         create within companies more buy-in for investing in gender diversity in the workplace.

         For the JIoD in particular, lobby a number of public shareholding companies to adopt the
    	 •  
         gender diversity concept as a pilot step for other company types while measuring the changes and
         potential impact of such diversity.




                                                                                                               59
     Financial ability
     Women earn less than men, they invest less than men, and they inherit less than men. This is a very
     difficult challenge to overcome in the short term. However, a long-term approach could effect a shift
     over the next decade by influencing the dynamics of women in the workplace and developing their
     financial know-how. Also, there is already a growing financial focus on investment in women-owned
     microbusinesses and female entrepreneurship.

     Action items:

     	 •  Initiate or increase women-focused training on financial investments.

          Increase the focus on financial solutions for women that would enable more women to
     	 •  
          become financially capable.

     Social (unconscious) bias
     Addressing this challenge on a national level might be unconventional, but it could be of high value.
     Social biases should be addressed in schools, universities, and the workplace.

     Action items:

     	 •  Work with academic institutions to eliminate unconscious social bias.

          Encourage organizations to implement training on social bias, which will in turn affect attitudes
     	 •  
          in the communities (see Box 9.1).

                                                        The Commonwealth Bank of Australia is one organization
                                                        that has taken on unconscious bias head-on. It won the

                                                        gender diversity. The bank implemented a compulsory
                                                        program for all senior executives, requiring them to
                                                        participate in “unconscious bias training” with Helen

                     9.2 Capacity

                     Participants in focus groups, interviews, and the online survey came up with several recommendations
                     for improving women’s capacity:

                           For more women to participate in capacity-building programs;
                      	 •  

                     	       More board-specific training programs;
                          •  

                     	      For women to attend a more diverse range of educational programs (and to pursue degrees
                          • 
                            in less-traditional fields of education);

                           For organizations to provide women with increased exposure, international or otherwise
                      	 •  
                           (see Box 9.2);

                           Use of different media to introduce female role models and their success stories – to encourage

                           other women.

                     Action items:

                     	    •  Run a certified “board of directors” program for women.

                      	 •  Promote training programs that focus on encouraging female leadership.

                      	 •  Support organizations in creating streamlined programs to advance women in organizations.

Helping Women Take Assignments Overseas                                      Helping Women Use Networks

“The battle for female talent in emerging markets,” found                    to help women gain exposure and achieve their business
that women are more likely to break through the glass                        goals. For example, General Electric is piloting a version of

                     9.3 Interpersonal

                     Participants offered the following recommendations to overcome some of the interpersonal challenges
                     women face in becoming and serving as directors:

                           Create a database of qualified women directors.
                      	 •  

                      	 •  Promote women as directors.

                           Create increased opportunities for women to network with male leaders (see Box 9.3).
                      	 •  

                           Provide mentors and sponsors for women who are serving on boards or in positions in senior or
                      	 •  
                           middle management, to support them in their development.

     9.4 Appointment process

     To overcome this challenge, it may be worthwhile to develop the disclosure requirement to include an
     analysis of the following:

          Gender diversity in the boardroom and senior management;
     	 •  

          Targets and strategies to increase gender diversity in the boardroom and senior decision-making
     	 •  
          positions;

          Process for appointment of members (what criteria the nomination committee used to nominate
     	 •  
          these directors, and so on);

          Diversity initiatives undertaken in the course of the year, and the resultant female retention rates.
     	 •  

     Also, the Central Bank of Jordan, in its recent corporate governance regulation (Central Bank of
     Jordan 2014), has the right to object to the nomination of any board member. This may be a great
     tool to continually suggest that the nomination committee of boards consider gender diversity in their
     nomination strategy. It also may be worth considering to initiate tax incentives or other forms of
     incentives to encourage companies to disclose more.

     Action items:

          Promote more gender-sensitive disclosure.
     	 •  

          Work with companies to improve the nomination and appointment process of members.
     	 •  

          Lobby and advocate to amend language of internal governance charters, codes, and regulations
     	 •  
          to be more gender neutral. For example, Apple is adding the following language to its charter:
          “The nominating committee is committed to actively seeking out highly qualified women and
          individuals from minority groups to include in the pool from which board nominees are chosen”
          (Satariano 2014).

          Lobby for various incentives to encourage companies to disclose more and to work on the gender
     	 •  
          disparity in the boardroom.


     9.5 Overall

     Other recommendations that came from our research do not specifically address the challenges mentioned
     above but can aid in overcoming gender-related challenges in general. These recommendations include
     the following:

          Create a diversity watchdog that would report on companies’ performance regarding gender
     	 •  
          diversity.

          Issue a report on the top 10 places to work for women, to incentivize organizations to promote
     	 •  
          more gender-friendly environments.

          Lobby for various incentives to be granted to more gender-diverse working environments through
     	 •  
          awards or public recognition.

     Table 9.1 provides a summary of the recommendations in all of the categories discussed above.

     Annex 1: Some Benefits of Corporate Governance

     Numerous empirical studies have provided evidence that good corporate governance practices can
     accomplish the following:

    How can policymakers              Women tend to have a hard time trying to prove themselves in this society, that they are capable of
    encourage better female           working as much as men; thus, policymakers can assist women by giving them proper training and
    representation on boards?
    Are quotas an option?             employing as many qualified women as possible. This is what I try to do, I try to bring in qualified
                                      women to work with me, and support them so they can have better chances in becoming directors.

                                      Yes, quotas are an option, at least for the time being. This system has proved to be successful previously,
                                      when it gave women access to the Lower House of Parliament.

                                      in terms of how discussions were carried out or how decisions were made. However, it was more
    with women directors?
                                      enjoyable.

4.	How is it different?              It was good to see women reaching such positions with their qualifications and professionalism. The
    Do the dynamics change
                                      dynamics certainly change, as male domination seemed to decrease, which enhances the implementation

5.	How would you characterize        I believe that women have the power to change the world. Unfortunately in Jordan, women are still not
    the opportunities                 using their full capacity, regardless of the reasons. The rate of women involvement is low. Opportunity
    for professional women in
    Jordan today?                     and optimism are there, but I believe the system should be less limiting with more efforts to facilitate the
                                      integration of women into the labor market, and to encourage women to enter all kinds of occupations
                                      and sectors.

6.	In your opinion, does diversity   I think it is both. Having good corporate governance would lead to employing more women in senior
    lead to good corporate            positions, hence enhancement of diversity, while diversity on boards would result in more productive
    governance practices, or does

    business case for focusing on

    level?

8.	In family-owned companies,        Yes, from our experience, they tend to ensure more financial stability than male directors.
    do women directors exert a
    different kind of influence?

   How can policymakers
9.	                                  Policymakers should advocate for companies to attract and employ people based on their knowledge,

                                    Jordan
                                    Board experience:
                                    A member of the Jordan Economic and Social Council and the Jordanian National Competitiveness
                                    and Innovation Council, he has led and participated in national development initiatives such as the

                                    Owner and chair of Arabian Business Consultants for Development.




1.	How many times were you         NGO/nonprofit boards, starting in 1996/7. Nine limited liability companies, starting in 1987, and one
    represented in boardrooms?
                                    private shareholding company.

2.	When was the first time you     I became a board member for the first time in 1987. I was a founding shareholder of this company. Most
    became a board member?          other company seats was because I was either a founding shareholder or represented an investment
    How?
                                    fund which was a founding shareholder.

3.	What has been your              I have generally had good experiences with women board members. Most women are better listeners
    experience sitting on boards    than men and take more time in making and weighing decisions. Some women, however, feel that they
    with women directors?
                                    need to be more impetuous (that is, macho), and they tend to be abrasive, erratic, and often wrong.
                                    Also, I have witnessed poor cooperation between women on a board, which was destructive and
                                    alarming.

4.	How is it different?            Women ask more questions and require male board members to be more communicative in their
    Do the dynamics change
                                    proposals. So dynamics do change and mostly for the better.
    when there are women
    directors?

5.	How would you characterize      There are plenty of professional opportunities for women in Jordan. These opportunities can be
    the opportunities for           improved by getting women to want to take on leadership roles and responsibilities. The majority
    professional women in Jordan
    today?                          of women are educated to a high level, but the majority, in general, do not go out to develop new or
                                    exploit existing commercial opportunities.

6.	
   In your opinion, does            I would say that good corporate governance will lead to diversity, as it is a valuable objective (that is,
   diversity lead to good           recruit a diverse board). I have noticed that boards that are diverse tend to be better and more holistic
   corporate governance
   practices, or does good          in their evaluation of the company. Women add questions that most men do not normally ask. This
   corporate governance             requires the board to think more broadly about the decisions they are taking (that is, less tunnel vision).
   lead to more diversity?

7.	In your opinion, what is the    Gender diversity increases board diversity by virtue of the fact that a female’s view and perception of
    business case for focusing on
                                    the world is, by default, different than a man’s. This is true in both a business and general worldview
    gender diversity at the board
    level?                          context.

8.	In family-owned companies,     I am not completely familiar with family businesses. However, I can imagine that women are likely to
    do women directors exert a
                                   have a generational view instead of a transactional view of decisions, which is likely to facilitate longer-
    different kind of influence?
                                   term successful governance.

   How can policymakers
9.	                               Quotas scare me. Board membership needs to be accompanied by some level of experience and/or
   encourage better female
                                   training. The question is how to encourage women into the workplace to obtain relevant business
   representation on boards?
   Are quotas an option?           experience and bolster that with relevant governance experience and capability. Maybe quotas can
                                   be required to reflect the percentage of females in management in a particular sector or country. The
                                   challenge would be getting more women to pursue professional managerial careers.

    Can you offer some
10.	                              Work on building and developing your professional career. Take courses, invest in yourself. Advocate
    practical tips for women
                                   for women participation at a board level among professional and accomplished women
    seeking directorships?

11.	
    Can you imagine yourself       Yes. Challenges are learning to listen and understanding the female worldview.
    being the only man in a
    board composed of women?

     Annex 5: ROA and ROE (2011, 2010, and 2009)

     Return on assets (2011)
     In 2011, the average ROA for all listed companies in Jordan was 0.65. For companies without female
     representation, it was –1.04, and for the 52 companies with female representation, it was 1.18.
     (See Figure A5.1.)

     Return on equity (2011)
     The average ROE for all listed companies in Jordan was 8.45 in 2011. For companies without female
     representation, it was 7.34, and for the 52 companies with female representation, it was 12.67.
     (See Figure A5.1.)

     Historical data (2010 and 2009)
     Based on the supposition that board members are elected for a period of four years, historical data are
     built on the assumption that the same number of women served in the previous year. This assumption
     is founded on the following:

     	 •  Research concerning average terms;

     	 •  Notes and comments from an online survey.

     Similar historical data exist for 2010 and 2009. In 2009 and 2010, all companies with at least one
     woman in the boardroom had above-average ROA and ROE performance, with the exception of the
     ROE of one company with four women in the boardroom in 2009. (See Table A5.1.)

     In 2010, companies with the best-performing ROE were those with two women on their boards.
     For 2009, the best performers were companies with three women on their boards. In 2010 and
     2009, companies with the best-performing ROA were those with four women on their boards.

                      members, which means there is a 5.16 percent female representation          in their                                  in their
                      in the boardroom. (See Figure A6.2.)                                      boardroom                                 boardroom

                      According to 2012 data, the average ROA for banks in Jordan was         Source: Authors, based on data collected.
                      1.22. For banks with female representation it was 1.15, and for
                      banks without female representation it was 1.28. (See Table A6.1
                      and Figure A6.3.)

                      In 2012, the average ROE for banks in Jordan was 8.79. For banks
                      with female representation it was 7.23, and for banks without
                      female representation it was 10.16. (See Table A6.1 and Figure
                      A6.3.)

                      For 2011, the data indicate similar findings, the average ROA and
                      ROE for banks were 1.14 and 8.04, respectively. For banks with
                      women they were 1.29 and 7.83, and for banks without women
                      they were 1.01 and 8.22. (See Table A6.1 and Figure A6.3.) It
                      appears that banks with female representation averaged slightly
                      worse than banks without – except in ROA in 2011, where they
                      performed above average.

                      Jordan’s insurance sector has a total of 223 board members. Only
                      nine of those board members are women – a 4.04 percent female
                      representation in boardrooms. (See Figure A6.5.)

                      Based on 2012 data, the average ROA for insurance companies
                      was –2.00. For companies with female representation it was –1.29,

                      For 2011, the average ROA for insurance companies was –2.57.
                      For companies with female representation it was –3.52, and for
                      insurance companies without female representation it was –2.27.
                      The average ROE for insurance companies in 2011 was 108.62. For
                      companies with and without female representation the figures were

                      It appears that insurance companies with female representation
                      averaged better performance than insurance companies without
                      women representation in 2012 but worse in 2011.

                      Services sector
                      Of the 57 listed services companies, 15 have women on boards. With a total of 463 board members in
                      the services sector, there are only 20 female board members – that is, 4.3 percent female representation
                      in the boardroom. (See Figure A6.10.)

                      Based on 2012 data, the average ROA for services companies was 4.21. For services companies with
                      female representation, it was 6.06, and for services companies without female representation, it was
                      3.24. (See Table A6.4 and Figure A6.11.)

                      The average ROE for services companies in 2012 was 4.16. For services companies with and without
                      female representation, the figures were 6.53 and 3.27, respectively. (See Table A6.4 and Figure A6.11.)

                      For 2011, the average ROA for services companies was 1.46. For services companies with female
                      representation, it was 5.77, and for services companies without female representation it was –0.08.
                      The average ROE for services companies was 0.62. For services companies with and without female
                      representation, the figures were 5.39 and –1.08, respectively. (See Table A6.4 and Figure A6.11.) It
                      appears that services companies with women representation averaged much better performance than
                      services companies without women representation – and well above average.

                      Industrial sector
                      Eight of the 70 listed industrial companies have women on boards. With a total of 538 board members
                      in the industrial sector, there are only 10 female board members – that is, 1.86 percent female
                      representation in the boardroom. (See Figure A6.12.)

                      Based on 2012 data, the average ROA for industrial companies is 2.85. For industrial companies with
                      female representation, it was 4.61, and for industrial companies without female representation, it was
                      2.60. (See Table A6.5 and Figure A6.13.)

                      In 2012, the average ROE for industrial companies was 1.66. For industrial companies with and
                      without female representation, the figures were 4.74 and 1.22, respectively. (See Table A6.5 and Figure
                      A6.13.)

                      For 2011, the average ROA for industrial companies was 0.21. For industrial companies with female
                      representation, it was 0.78, and for industrial companies without female representation it was 0.13.
                      The average ROE for industrial companies was –5.82, and for companies with and without female
                      representation, the figures were –0.59 and –6.50, respectively. (See Table A6.5 and Figure A6.13.) It
                      appears that industrial companies with women representation averaged much better performance than
                      industrial companies without women representation – and well above average.
