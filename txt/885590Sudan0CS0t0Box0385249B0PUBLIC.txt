I. Objectives

This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Sudan
        perceive the Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Sudan regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Sudan;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Sudan;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in Sudan; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Sudan.

       Use data to help inform the Sudan country team’s strategy.




II. Methodology
In May thru July 2012, 296 stakeholders of the World Bank in Sudan were invited to provide
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President, Vice President/s,
assistants, and advisors; the office of a Minister/State Minister, Undersecretary, Director
General; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry, ministerial department, or
implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World Bank-supported
projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project;
local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral agencies; private sector
organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-based
organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based
groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the judiciary branch. A total of 152
stakeholders participated in the country survey (51%).

Respondents received questionnaires via courier or email and returned it accordingly, or
completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency. Respondents were asked
about: general issues facing Sudan, their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the World Bank’s
effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge; working with the World Bank; the Bank’s
future role in Sudan, and the Bank’s communication and information sharing in Sudan:

A. General Issues facing Sudan: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Sudan is headed
   in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important development
   priorities, and which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and generating
   economic growth in Sudan.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Sudan, Bank staff preparedness, the extent
   to which the Bank should seek to influence the global development agenda, their agreement
   with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an
   effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on
   which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest
   values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most and least effective instruments in
   helping to reduce poverty in Sudan, with which groups the Bank should work more, and to
   what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve sustainable development results in Sudan, the extent to which
   the Bank meets Sudan’s need for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the
   Bank’s level of effectiveness across twenty-seven development areas, such as economic
   growth. Respondents were also asked to indicate where it would be most valuable for the
   Bank to focus its attention on in relation to agricultural development in Sudan.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge/research, the areas on which the Bank should focus its research
   efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge/research, including
   how significant of a contribution it makes to development results, its technical quality, and
   the Bank’s effectiveness at providing linkage to non-Bank expertise.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank disbursing funds promptly, and
   the extent to which the Bank is adequately staffed in Sudan.
F. The Multi-Donor Trust Fund in Sudan as Managed by the World Bank: Respondents were
   asked to indicate the greatest strengths and weaknesses of the Multi-Donor Trust Fund.
G. The Future Role of the World Bank in Sudan: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Sudan’s development in the near future and to
   indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Sudan.
H. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate where they
   get information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, their access to the Internet, and their usage and evaluation of the
   Bank’s website. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to
   Information policy, past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy.
   Respondents were also asked their level of agreement that they know how to find information
   from the Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
I. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Sudan, and their geographic location.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, the small number of consultants working on Bank-supported
        projects were combined with respondents from PMUs, respondents from private
        foundations were combined with those from NGOs and CBOs, respondents from the
        financial sector/private banks were combined with those from the private sector, and the
        few respondents from local government and bilateral agencies were included in the
        “Other” category.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)

Geographic Location

       The vast majority of respondents indicated that they were located in Central Sudan.
        Because of the small number of respondents from Western, Northern, and Eastern Sudan,
        these locations were combined into an “Other Areas” category for all further analyses.
       Responses across geographic locations for all country survey questions can be found in
        the Appendix (see page 85). Only significant differences between geographic locations in
        response to indicator questions will be discussed in the body of this report.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank

As noted in the “Methodology” section, the indicator questions referred to throughout the survey
report are questions that are asked in every country that engages in the Country Survey. These
will be aggregated for the Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. In the Sudan Country Survey
Report, geographic differences that are significant will be reported in the text as related to only
the indicator questions. Otherwise, these distinctions for all other questions can be found in the
Appendix (page 85).

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)

Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable development results in Sudan, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-seven specific
areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of
effectiveness in one specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s
overall effectiveness or perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Sudan. The areas determined
        to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at health;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at rural development;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at education.

       Achieving Sustainable Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest
        Pearson Product-Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results in
        Sudan, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results. The
        areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at rural development;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at health;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at local governance and institutions; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at education.

VII. World Bank Knowledge and Instruments

Knowledge: Frequency of Use

       A plurality of respondents from most stakeholder groups indicated that they consulted
        World Bank knowledge and research a few times a year; however, the majority of
        respondents from the media indicated that they consulted Bank knowledge and research
        monthly and the majority of respondents from the private sector/financial sector/private
        banks indicated that they rarely consulted Bank knowledge and research.

Knowledge: Effectiveness

       There were significant stakeholder group differences in ratings of the World Bank’s
        knowledge and research effectiveness at two of these aspects.
             Respondents from the media had the highest ratings for the effectiveness of the
              Bank’s knowledge and research to stimulate public debate/dialogue whereas
              respondents from the private sector/financial sector/private banks, independent
              government institutions, and other organizations had significantly lower ratings.
             Respondents from the media had the highest ratings for the effectiveness of the
              Bank’s knowledge and research to enhance knowledge and/or skills whereas
              respondents from NGOs/CBOs/private foundations and independent government
              institutions had significantly lower ratings.

The World Bank is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in Sudan or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The following
survey is meant to give the World Bank’s team that works in Sudan, greater insight into how the Bank’s work is
perceived. This is one tool the World Bank uses to assess the views of its critical stakeholders. With this
understanding, the World Bank hopes to develop more effective strategies, outreach and programs that support
development in Sudan. The World Bank commissioned an independent firm to oversee the logistics of this effort
in Sudan. This ensures anonymity and confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the survey, please
circle/check the response that most accurately reflects your opinion. If you prefer not to answer a question,
please leave it blank.
