                    W
                                IFC HISTORY
                                IN A NUTSHELL
                                This is a story of experience—an unparalleled body of knowledge
                                built up in the toughest markets, under the most challenging
                                conditions, and applied to address the world’s most urgent devel-
                                opment challenges.

                                Six decades ago, a few dozen countries made a calculated bet on
                                the transformative potential of the private sector in developing
                                countries. They put up $100 million in capital and established
                                IFC to reinforce the work of the World Bank in spurring growth
                                and development. Today, IFC is the largest global development
                                institution focused on the private sector, having delivered nearly
                                $250 billion in financing to businesses in emerging markets.

                                Throughout its history, IFC has introduced new approaches to
                                meet the needs of developing countries. Initially, it helped to
                                bring leading multinational companies to developing countries—
                                beginning in 1957, when IFC invested alongside Siemens in Brazil.
                                In addition, as businesses in these countries began to thrive,
                                IFC deployed its staff to local markets to be closer to clients.
                                Over time, IFC helped drive growth by providing investment and
                                advice, and by mobilizing resources from other capital providers.

                                IFC consistently brought to bear a distinctive set of advantages
                                in working with the private sector to end extreme poverty and
                                boost shared prosperity—a history of innovation, a mandate
                                for global influence, an understanding of the demonstration
                                effect of its actions, and a determination to achieve measurable

            Those capabilities have made IFC a key player in global efforts
            to address shared challenges such as climate change and
            pandemics. IFC plays a prominent advisory role in major initia-
            tives of the United Nations and the Group of 20 nations. It acts as
            a trusted liaison between the public and private sectors, bringing
            business solutions to the challenges of development.

            Today, the challenges of development are simultaneously global
            and local. Trillions of dollars must be mobilized each year if the
            world is to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals—including
            ending poverty—by 2030. Poverty is increasingly concentrated
            in fragile and conflict-affected areas of the world, where it is
            hardest to eradicate. Climate change threatens to force tens of
            millions of people in developing countries into poverty.

            IFC is uniquely positioned to leverage the capabilities of the
            private sector to address these challenges. Six decades of
            experience and a record of innovation and thought leadership in
            private sector development have made the organization essential
            for creating opportunity where it’s needed most.

THE IFC BRAND
IFC has built up a strong brand identity over six
decades of experience. The corporate brand is           1956
                                                        In the early years the name was fully
expressed in the logo—adding IFC’s acronym, full        spelled out on report covers, supported

                                                        from the outset.
In use since 2014, the current logo is in turn part
of a larger visual identity system that also includes
colors, typefaces, and implementation guidelines

                                                        generally in blue and at times adding the

                                                        Starting in 1993, an enclosed
                                                        globe was added to the logo.




                                                        2005
                                                        In 2005 the enclosed globe element
                                                        was modified further, increasingly using

could finance private enterprise without the World Bank’s
requirement for government guarantees. Garner and
his colleagues made the case persistently for several
years, gradually winning over the skeptics—and in the
process establishing a culture of long-term commit-
ment and dedication to the cause that would become a
lasting hallmark of IFC. “I missed no opportunity during
my travels of promoting the idea with top government
officials,” he later wrote.


BUILDING MOMENTUM
A major political boost came in March 1951 from
Nelson Rockefeller, a former U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State and grandson of the world’s wealthiest man,
oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller. Chairing an influential
U.S. presidential advisory board in international devel-
opment, the younger Rockefeller urged the forma-
tion of “an International Finance Corporation” to
support local private enterprise as part of a larger
set of recommendations. This proposed IFC would
support development by making loans to private busi-
nesses in developing countries, but only on the condi-
tion that it would take no government guarantees,
always work alongside other private investors, and
never manage its investee companies. U.S. President
Harry Truman quickly endorsed the idea.


After four years of negotiations, IFC won acceptance
from the World Bank’s board of country shareholders
in 1955, opening in 1956 with Garner at the helm.
	
IFC began with a staff of only 12 people, $100 million
in initial capital, and no authorization to make the
equity investments that Garner desired and that
would later be key to IFC’s unique impact and financial




27 IFC: THE FIRST SIX DECADES
THE FOUNDING VISION
“The view of management was that if these coun-
tries were really going to develop…the only way
they were going to really increase the production
of goods and have people get more jobs, raise the
standard of living, and build up their countries was
through the development of private enterprise,
industry, and agriculture.

“After a few years, some of us began to realize
that the Bank was not the best type of instrument
to finance purely private business. We began to
work on the idea of a separate institution affili-
ated with the Bank, but with separate capital and
separate organizations which could deal directly
with private industry. It took about seven or eight
years to get the idea accepted, but finally it was in
1956, and IFC was set up: the principle was that
it would operate in conjunction with private busi-
ness and in partnership if possible with private
investment capital.

“Just as I felt private business has been largely
responsible for everything built in my country, it was
the thing that could be the most important element
in the economic growth of these other countries.

"IFC will be able to do a great many constructive
things that no public institution is doing.”

Business leaders in the poorer countries embraced
the idea. “The dynamic force of private enterprise is
strengthened considerably by initiatives such as IFC,”
Brazilian CEO Vicente De Paula Ribeiro said at an IFC
seminar at the 1958 World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings
in New Delhi. “It accelerates its spread and process of
growth by acting as a catalyst.”

BEGINNING
WITH
INNOVATION	
Committed to innovation from the outset, IFC started
as a small, Washington-based institution.
In these early years, IFC worked to increase the private
sector's growth and contribution to development,
well before these essential ideas had widespread
international acceptance.
Wherever possible, the institution focused on “firsts”—
as it has ever since.
Initially IFC worked mainly alongside foreign mul-
tinationals in key sectors such as manufacturing,
mining, and agribusiness.
Over time, the approach widened, as IFC found ways
to help local companies obtain financing in their own
countries, and support governments’ efforts to improve
the investment climate.

But this selected, loan-only approach could only go so
far. After five years, the institution was making less of
a mark on the world than expected, having approved
just $44 million in total lending by 1961. In response,
IFC challenged its own status quo.


“It was time for the idea of change,” recalled Martin
Rosen, who succeeded Robert Garner at IFC’s helm in
1961. “In the opinion of many, IFC would do no more
than pick at the fringes of its problems unless its
scope was greatly widened.”


This new thinking led to three dramatic shifts that
soon became core aspects of IFC’s business model, in
each case catalyzing much greater results over time.


1959: FIRST MOBILIZATION
The Articles of Agreement encouraged IFC to focus not
just on investing its own resources, but on mobilizing
additional capital from others. The first step in this key
direction was IFC’s first loan syndication: $2 million
raised from commercial banks in 1959 for Brazilian pulp
and paper producer Champion Celulose. Packaged
alongside IFC’s own loan, the financing supported a
new bleached sulfate wood pulp mill then being built
at Mogi Guacu in the state of São Paulo. The mill still
operates today, now owned by one of the world’s
largest pulp and paper companies, International Paper.


By putting a trusted stamp of approval on this high-pri-
ority start-up, IFC was able to mobilize more capital
from other investors than it could provide alone. This
capability soon became a critical aspect of IFC’s            1960:
approach to financing development. Today, IFC’s              New York Times

from a blue-ribbon panel of experts headed by former
Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson. In many
ways, it changed the course of IFC history.


Created at the World Bank Group’s request in 1967,
the Pearson Commission spent nearly two years trav-
eling the world to investigate a wide variety of topics,
including the volume and terms of aid, the debt burden
of developing countries, trade, private investment, and
more. One of its key findings was that IFC could have
a powerful role in international development, but only
if it stepped up its activities.


The commission’s report criticized the narrowly
defined IFC of the 1960s for “overemphasizing prof-
itability as an investment criterion and not taking
project initiatives,” wrote historian Jonas Haralz in the
World Bank’s official 50th anniversary history book.
New World Bank Group President Robert McNamara
agreed, encouraging IFC to start thinking bigger. His
call for more changes signaled a redefinition of IFC’s
commitment to development impact.

45 IFC: THE FIRST SIX DECADES
SMALL AND MEDIUM
ENTERPRISES
Knowing that they are the backbone of emerging
market economies but too often are held back
by a lack of access to capital, IFC has long made
small and medium enterprises (SMEs) a focus of its
work with local financial institutions. Helping local
lenders see the potential in this market has unlocked
vast sums of private capital for entrepreneurs who
drive job creation.

It all began in 1976 with a $2 million line of credit
to Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB), which then
provided smaller sub-loans and business advice to
local SMEs. It was the first transaction of its kind in
World Bank Group history, and “took some doing
and a lot of hand-holding,” IFC’s investment officer
in the transaction, Promodh Molhotra, later wrote,
“but the new approach slowly began to take hold
and loans began to be made successfully.” Within
seven years, all the loans had been repaid. The
businesses that KCB had selected had all expanded
profitably, helping it see the promise of the untapped
SME finance market.

IFC’s commitment to increasing capital flows to
local SMEs grew dramatically over time, sup-
ported by new products such as the African Project
Development Facility advisory initiative for SMEs,
launched with UNDP and the African Development
Bank in 1978 and then replicated in other markets.
Today, IFC’s SME finance work is global in scope,
delivered through 900 financial intermediaries in
120 countries. It is part of a larger effort to mobilize
private capital for the traditionally excluded—not
just SMEs, but also women, youth, firms, and
individuals based in rural and underserved areas.                SME Finance: IFC's

46 BEGINNING WITH INNOVATION
COINING A PHRASE:
EMERGING MARKETS

Beginning in the late 1970s, IFC began collecting data
on emerging stock markets and gave presentations
in various global forums, putting forth data on size,
depth, liquidity, and the regulatory environment. This
helped launch a global debate on the advantages of
local stock markets and the issues involved in allowing
foreign investment.


In 1980, IFC began tracking total return data since
1976 for 10 markets (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Greece,
India, Jordan, Korea, Mexico, Thailand, and Zimbabwe),
showing attractive results and making a good case
for increased investment. In 1981, IFC’s Antoine van
Agtmael made a presentation to investment bank
Salomon Brothers in New York, proposing a global listed
equity investment fund for developing countries. While
many of the fund managers present were interested, a
banker from JP Morgan made an astute observation:
IFC would never get buy-in using the original proposed
name, “Third World Equity Fund.”

INCREASING
INFLUENCE
As the world grew increasingly open to market-based

pushed the frontiers of privatization, and developed

to manage projects’ environmental and social risks.

RUSSIA
There were even greater challenges in the former Soviet
Union. There, IFC made a difference with small-scale
privatization. This activity began in the city of Nizhny
Novgorod, Russia’s main trade and commercial center
before the 1917 Revolution, but until recently a city that
had been completely closed to outsiders.


Assembling a team of consultants from Poland,
auctioneers from Czechoslovakia, and lawyers from
Sweden and the United States, IFC devised a process
that emphasized speed, transparency, and efficiency
in the first sales of small state-owned businesses.
Starting in April 1992, the Nizhny Novgorod city
government worked with IFC’s concepts, running
weekly auctions open to the public. By the end of the
year, more than 2,000 businesses had been sold. The
transfer of ownership was immediate, with new owners
taking control within two days of the auction. The work
went smoothly, establishing a framework for auctions
in 28 other Russian cities, helping to boost local
entrepreneurship and build a market-oriented culture.

THE BTC PIPELINE
By the early 2000s, this stronger expertise in envi-
ronmental and social issues had become an essential
part of IFC’s own value proposition—helping clients
see that sustainability factors were not just risks to
be managed, but could also become a key source of
competitive advantage.


As a result, IFC began providing leadership on much
larger and more complex projects, such as the
$4 billion Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline
running through Azerbaijan and Georgia to a terminal
facility on the Turkish Mediterranean coast. Able to
transport 1.2 barrels of crude oil every day, the 1,768 km
pipeline is one of the longest of its kind in the world.
Its route passes through a wide range of land-use
types, affecting over 17,700 parcels of land used by
households in 515 villages, and therefore involving a
complex set of social and environmental issues.

112 DEMONSTRATION AND IMPACT
In Asia, the $3 billion IFC Capitalization Fund has
invested $40 million in longtime IFC client ACLEDA
Bank, Cambodia’s largest provider of microfinance.
This capital injection is supporting the bank’s
domestic growth and regional expansion into Lao
People’s Democratic Republic and Myanmar, allowing
it to serve more businesses. It is an important part of
a long-term partnership with IFC that has enabled
ACLEDA Bank to reach more than 2.5 million of the
poorest people in Cambodia and support micro and
small businesses throughout the Mekong region.


With strong governance, dedicated investment teams,
and the ability to select diversified portfolios from IFC’s
pipeline, AMC provided an attractive value proposition
to its investors even in the wake of the financial crisis.
Its achievement in combining commercial capital with
development needs soon led to the best success of
all—other asset managers from the private sector
increasingly looking to attract institutional investors
into emerging markets.


The significant amounts of third-party capital
AMC raised in turn had a major effect on IFC itself,
increasing its ability to fund larger projects, take a
more active portfolio management approach, and
explore other ambitious ideas for directing private
capital toward development needs.

NEW PLATFORMS FOR:
SOLAR POWER
The sun has enormous potential as an energy source
in frontier regions. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for
example, two-thirds of the population lacks access to
electricity, while grid-based power generation capac-
ity is far short of what is needed. Many countries
have abundant potential, but they have struggled
to develop utility-scale solar power plants due to
challenges such as lack of scale, lack of competition,
high transaction costs, and high perceived risks and
costs of capital, among others.

In response, in 2015 IFC launched Scaling Solar,
bringing together a suite of World Bank Group
services under a single engagement aimed at creat-
ing viable markets for solar power in client coun-
tries. The “one-stop shop” program aims to make
privately funded grid-connected solar projects
operational within two years and at competitive
tariffs. Now being implemented across multiple
countries, it is creating a new regional market for
solar investment.

The program’s integrated platform reduces risks

sector interest. Its first bidding auction, held in
May 2016 in Zambia, led to some of the world’s
lowest-priced solar power to date. Major U.S. and
European firms are now building new solar plants
to boost Zambia’s power supply by 5 percent. Based
on this early demonstration effect in Africa, Scaling
