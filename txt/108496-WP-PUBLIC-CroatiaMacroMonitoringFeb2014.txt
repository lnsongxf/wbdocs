Real developments
   Pace of recession slows in Q4. GDP declined by 0.6 percent in Q3, while high frequency data shows a decline
    of 0.4 percent in Q4. Industrial production declined by 2.4% y/y in Q4 of 2013, compared to a decline of 3.8%
    y/y in Q3. Construction observed a 4.9% decline y/y in November. Retail trade growth in real terms slowed in
    Q4 to 0.1% y/y, compared to 1.4% in Q4, as tourism-related consumption dissipated.
   Early signs of bottoming-out. Industrial turnover in December grew by 16 percent y/y, the first increase in
    several years: car sales surged by 15% y/y in January, while the issuance of construction permits in December
    rose by 18% y/y. Vacancies increased by 11 percent y/y in January; and despite increased job placements, the
    number of newly registered unemployed offset employment gains as unemployment grew by 3% in January, up
    from 21 percent in December 2013. Preliminary data for January suggest an increase in consumer optimism and a
    halt to the steady decline in business optimism in the industry and construction sectors.

Fiscal developments
   Budget revision under preparation. The Government presented the broad outline of the 2014 budget revision
    in January, seeking HRK8.8 billion in savings to meet the EDP deficit target of 4.6% of GDP. Additional
    revenue, HRK4.7 billion, is expected while expenditure will be cut by HRK 3.8 billion. However, treatment of
    pension proposals needs to be assessed against the ESA95 methodology, and further spending cuts likely needed.
     Tax policy: Broadening the base for gambling tax (HRK 0.3 billion), in 2015 and 2016, revision of the MTEF
        and introduction of capital gains and savings tax as well as property tax.
     Social sector: Suspension of the second pillar pension contributions for select occupations on “extended work
        service provision” (HRK0.4 billion) and transfer of the 2nd pillar savings of these categories to the 1st pillar
        (HRK2.8 billion), pharmaceutical rationalization and central procurement in hospitals (HRK0.6 billion); the
        proposal also announced an additional HRK3.2 billion (1% of GDP) for health arrears to cover new debt
        generated since an equal amount was spent in July 2013 suggesting ongoing control problems in the sector.
     Business support: Withdrawal of SOE profits (HRK1 billion); increased concession fees (HRK0.2 billion),
        rationalization of investments (HRK0.455 billion), subsidies' reduction (HRK 0.55 billion); and
     Public administration: public administration bonuses will be reduced (including the seniority bonus) as well as
        an employment freeze (HRK0.5 billion)
   Direct public debt amounted to 60.5% of GDP in Q3 2013, while contingent government liabilities stood at 17%
    of GDP (roughly constant compared to 2012).
   Due to the delayed fiscal adjustment, the rating agency Fitch downgraded the outlook to negative from stable,
    but retained the BB+ and BBB- long-term foreign and local currency default ratings.

External sector developments
 Current account surplus increased to 1.1% of GDP on a rolling basis in Q3, driven by declining income outflows.
 Exports continued to decline throughout 2013 (falling by 8% by November), driven by shipyards and metal
   production dropping 50 and 20 percent, respectively. Imports declined by 2.8% cumulatively by November 2013.
 External debt fell slightly, to 101.4% of GDP in Q3, while net external debt remained at 62.4% of GDP.
 The nominal exchange rate remained relatively stable against the Euro throughout the year, despite some
   depreciation in Q4.

Monetary and financial sector developments
   Commercial banks posted a 70–percent drop in profits in 2013, with half of the 30 banks, led by HAAB, in the
    red. This resulted from a major cleanup of banks’ balance sheets, which included the write-off of NPLs upon the
    strengthened supervision rules as well as pre-bankruptcy settlements concluded for over 750 companies.
   Private sector lending grew by a tepid 0.1% in November 2013, compared to end-2012, due to a combination of
    weak demand and more stringent lending conditions.
   Average inflation declined to 2.2% in 2013, compared to 3.4% in 2012, as domestic demand remained weak (due
    to the wide output gap) and as energy prices’ growth decelerated from 14.8% in 2012 to 6.2% in 2013.
