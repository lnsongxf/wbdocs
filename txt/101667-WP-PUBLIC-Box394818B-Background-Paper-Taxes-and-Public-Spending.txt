        Summary
                                                  I n e qua l i t y i n I n d on e s i a i s r i s i ng r a pi dly.
                                                  During the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, poverty rose
                                                  sharply, while the Gini measure of inequality fell, as the
                                                  richest were the hardest hit. Since then, the Gini has
                                                  increased from 30 points in 2000 to 41 points in 2014, its
                                                  highest recorded level. In 2002, the richest 10 percent
                                                  of Indonesians consumed as much as the poorest 42
                                                  percent combined; by 2014, they consumed as much
                                                  as the poorest 54 percent. Even this is likely to be
                                                  understated, as household surveys often miss the rich.
                                                  Indonesia’s level of inequality is now becoming high and
                                                  climbing faster than most of its East Asian neighbors.

                                                  be h i n d. Since the 1997-97 crisis, Indonesia’s real GDP
                                                  per capita grew at an annual average of 5.4 percent
                                                  between 2000 and 2014. This has helped to create a
                                                  stronger middle class than ever before; there are now 45
                                                  million people (the richest 18 percent of all Indonesians)
                                                  who are economically secure and enjoy a higher quality
                                                  of life. But the problem is that this segment is leaving
                                                  the other 205 million, who are much less likely to enjoy
                                                  benefits of growth, behind. The consequences of
                                                  doing nothing to address high levels of inequality can
                                                  be serious. The public shares this view; 88 percent of
                                                  Indonesians who were surveyed in 2014 believed that it
                                                  was urgent for the Government to address inequality.

           vulnerability and economic security lines. See World Bank (forthcoming (a)) for more details.

          A government can choose to spend in different ways,

          HOW D O W E WOR K T H I S OU T ? We combine government revenue and spending data to know how much revenue
          was raised from which sources and how much was spent in di erent areas, with household survey data, to know who
          paid which taxes and how much, and who benefitted from which spending and by how much. Box 5 provides a
          summary of how we do this.

     Overview of methodology and data9
     We begin with market income, which as explained, is                                price they pay is higher than the market price, and they are
     all household income from non-government sources,                                  indirectly providing revenues to the Government. The post-
     including income from working (wages and salaries),                                ﬁscal income is a household’s disposable income, adjusted
     income from savings and investments (rents, interest,                              for how much the household is indirectly receiving from
     dividends), transfers from other households or individuals                         and paying to the Government through its consumption.

  types of relative incidence graphs; ones that slope downwards, ones that slope upwards, and ones that are ﬂat. Downward
  sloping relative graphs (Figure 8) mean that inequality is reduced in the case of spending (the poor receive more as a
  percentage of their market income than the rich) and increased in the case of a tax (the poor pay more as a percentage of their
  market income than the rich). Conversely, an upward sloping relative graph (Figure 10) means increasing inequality for spending
  or decreasing inequality for taxes. A ﬂat curve means inequality is unchanged (Figure 9).

although not as much as in other countries

          When considered in absolute terms, richer households                                    When we
          beneﬁt slightly more from education spending than poorer                                consider the education beneﬁts as a share of market
          households (Figure 14). Despite having fewer children who                               income, it is nearly 20 percent for the poorest decile
          are more likely to be enrolled in private schools11, their                              compared with only 2 percent for the richest decile
          children are also more likely to be enrolled at the more                                (Figure 15). A similar pattern holds after accounting
          expensive secondary and tertiary levels. However, when                                  for out-of-pocket costs. As a consequence, education
          we include out-of-pocket expenses such as school fees,                                  spending is inequality-reducing in Indonesia.
          the net beneﬁt of education spending is slightly higher for
          poorer households (Figure 14).



           Most households receive similar education                                              …but relative to household income, education
           beneﬁts, but because richer households pay                                             spending beneﬁts poorer households much
           more out-of-pocket, poorer households                                                  more than richer ones.

           beneﬁt much more as a percentage of their market income in other countries. This likely reﬂects a greater focus on

more to the poor. However, other countries spend more overall
and direct it more effectively to the poor

only spends the least on health of the countries studied12, but health spending also beneﬁts the poor more in other countries
(Figure 19). As a consequence, health spending is more inequality-reducing in most of these other countries than it is in
Indonesia. Moreover, greater spending on health in general would beneﬁt Indonesia as a whole, with the persistently high
stunting rate and growing incidence of non-communicable diseases, as well as the poor and vulnerable, who are more likely to
use public health services than the middle class, who tend to use private health services (World Bank 2015c).

            Indirect taxes in Indonesia do not have much
            impact on inequality. Closing VAT exemptions
            on basic staples would increase revenue but also
            inequality; increases in tobacco excise would be
            more effective

            of Indonesia’s tax revenue comes from direct taxes, mainly VAT. VAT is almost completely neutral, with richer
            households paying about the same percentage of their market income in VAT as poorer households (Figure 29).
            The tobacco excise is slightly regressive but does not signiﬁcantly a ect inequality, reducing the Gini by only 0.4
            points. Moreover, even if a tobacco tax is regressive, there is evidence that the poor save more in the long run from
            reduced health expenditures in the future, as well as being more likely to beneﬁt from a reduction in premature lives
            than the rich (Savedo and Alwang 2015).

      As Figure 30 shows, indirect taxes are either neutral or favor the poor in Mexico, Peru, Sri Lanka and Indonesia, but are borne
      heavily by the poor in Bolivia, Brazil, Uruguay and Armenia. In the more neutral countries, indirect taxes bring in less revenue
      as a share of GDP, while in the regressive countries they bring in considerably more revenue. This is likely because the greater
      revenue with increases in inequality come through fewer or no exemptions on staple items, which are consumed frequently by
      poorer households.

Revenue from personal income tax is low in Indonesia;
increased compliance and a broader tax base would
increase revenue and lower inequality

Personal income taxes make up only 10 percent of tax revenues in Indonesia, or around 1.9 percent of GDP. In other countries,
they raise signiﬁcantly more revenue and this is borne to a much greater degree by the rich, helping to reduce inequality
(Figure 31)18.



A number of other countries have used personal income taxes to both raise
signiﬁcant revenue and reduce inequality, with the richest households paying
signiﬁcantly more as a percentage of their market income.

   Indonesia’s personal income taxes were not included in this study as they are not captured in the household survey, and many of the high
income earners who would be among the few who do pay income tax are not in the survey data either.

         CONCLUSION
         Excluding income taxes, all households are net beneficiaries of
         Indonesian taxes and spending. Poorer households enjoy net
         benefits as a greater percentage of market income, but in total they
         represent only a 25 percent increase in spending power.
         RICHER HOUSEHOLDS RECEIVE MORE GOVERNMENT SPENDING BUT PAY MORE IN TA XES AND OUT-OF-POCKET
         EXPENSES, MEANING MOST HOUSEHOLDS RECEIVE ABOUT THE SAME NET SPENDING. The poorest 10 percent
         of households receive IDR 21 trillion of total transfer, subsidy and social spending, compared with IDR 59 trillion for
         the richest 10 percent (Figure 32).However, the poorest households pay only IDR 7 trillion in indirect taxes and out-

         the more it receives in beneﬁts but the more it pays in taxes and expenses. As a consequence, most households
         receive the same beneﬁts from government spending after taxes, or around 9-11 percent of the total. Only the richest
         households receive slightly less, at 7 percent, and even then, they remain beneﬁciaries of net spending (although
         personal income taxes have not yet been factored in).
