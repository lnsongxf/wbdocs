Indonesia has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past 15 years. The national
poverty rate was halved, from 24 percent in 1999 to 11.3 percent in 2014. Growth averaged at 6
percent annually for a decade up until 2015. Internationally, Indonesia also joined the G-20 as
Southeast Asia’s only representative.

But the quest for widely shared prosperity is not over. Indonesia is at risk of leaving its poor
and vulnerable behind. Poverty reduction has begun to stagnate, with a near zero decline
in 2014. Income inequality is rapidly rising and up to one third of it is explained by inequal-
ity of opportunities. Healthy and well educated children live side by side with children
who suffer from malnutrition, learn little when they are in school, and drop out too early.
And there are stark inequalities between regions; for example, 6 percent of children in Jakar-
ta do not have access to proper sanitation while, at the same time, 98 percent of children in
rural Papua have no access. This kind of inequality dims the prospects of important segments
of society for generations.

The Government of Indonesia has rightly identified inequality as an obstacle to sustainable
development and has set targets to reduce it. In support of this public policy objective, the
World Bank embarked on research to better understand why inequality is rising in Indonesia,
why it matters, and what can be done about it. This work is the result of partnerships between
many government agencies and The World Bank. The study enjoyed the financial support
from the Australian Department of Foreign A airs and Trade.

Inequality is complex, impacting many facets of life and involving many actors. We hope that
this report will encourage public policy based on evidence and informed by experiences from
countries that have successfully reduced inequality.

In the country Indonesians deserve and want, extreme poverty is eliminated. In the Indonesia
its people dream of, the poor and vulnerable have more opportunities to enjoy ‘shared pros-
perity’. This is not an agenda of redistributing an economy of a ﬁxed size. Indonesians need to
expand the size of the pie, and keep expanding it and sharing it, to ensure that the welfare of
all, and especially the most vulnerable, rises as quickly as possible.

The task of slowing – or even reversing – the trend of rising inequality is a large challenge, and
one that will take time to achieve. But we believe that by standing together – the government,
alongside civil society and the private sector, with the support of development partners – the
country will be able to make a di erence for current and future generations who deserve a fair
opportunity for a better life.

We at the World Bank Group stand ready to continue supporting these objectives.

  Overview



  Rising
  Rising inequality is creating an Indonesia
  that is more divided than ever before . Fifteen
  years of sustained economic growth in Indonesia have
  helped to reduce poverty and create a growing middle
                                                                 Ur gent acti on i s needed, not on ly b e cause
                                                                 i nequali ty i s often unfai r, b u t a l s o

                                                                 poverty red u cti on, and an i ncre a se d risk

  80 percent of the population—about 205 million people—         and take risks. But income inequality is unfair when not

                                                                 issue and believe that the Government should take action.

                Allowing inequality to grow unchecked could
                give rise to slower economic growth and poverty
                reduction, and increase the risk of conﬂict.


                THERE ARE FOUR MAIN DRIVERS OF INEQUALITY IN INDONESIA THAT AFFECT BOTH CURRENT AND
                FUTURE GENERATIONS. Taking action requires a better understanding of why inequality is rising. So in partnership
                with the Government of Indonesia and supported by the Australian Department of Foreign A airs and Trade, the World
                Bank conducted a research project that explored this question and identiﬁed four main causes.

               Inequality
           of opportunity      Poorer children often have an unfair start in life, undermining their ability to succeed later. At least one-
                               third of inequality is due to factors outside an individual’s control.
                 Unequal
                    jobs       The labor market is divided between high-skilled workers who receive increasing wages, and the rest
                               of the workforce that does not have the opportunity to develop these skills and is trapped in low-
                               productivity, informal, and low-wage jobs.
              High wealth
            concentration      A minority of Indonesians are beneﬁtting from the possession of ﬁnancial assets—sometimes acquired
                               through corrupt means—that, in turn, drives inequality higher both today and in the future.

                      Low
                resiliency     Shocks are becoming increasingly more common and disproportionately a ect poor and vulnerable
                               households, eroding their ability to earn incomes and invest in the health and education needed to climb
                               up the economic ladder.



                PUBLIC POLICIES CAN HELP INDONESIA TO BREAK THE INTERGENERATIONAL CYCLE OF INEQUALITY.
                High inequality is not inevitable; policymakers can reduce inequality by tackling those factors exacerbating inequality
                that lie outside an individual’s control. The World Bank recommends four key actions:

          Improving local
          service delivery     A key to a better start for the next generation lies in enhanced local service delivery, which can improve
                               health, education and family planning opportunities for all.

    Promoting better jobs
       and skills training     Skills training programs can improve the competitiveness of workers who have missed out on a
     opportunities for the     quality education. Also, the Government can help to create better jobs through greater investment in
               workforce       infrastructure, a more conducive investment climate and a less rigid regulatory approach.

     Ensuring protection
            from shocks        Government policies can reduce the frequency and severity of shocks, as well as provide coping
                               mechanisms to ensure that all households have access to adequate protection when shocks do occur.


          Using taxes and
  government spending to       Speciﬁc ﬁscal policies could focus on increasing spending on infrastructure, health and education,
reduce inequality now and      social assistance and social insurance. Such improved public spending could also be supported by
             in the future     a fairer taxation system designed to address some of the current tax regulations that encourage the
                               concentration of wealth.

                              income divide between the richest 10 percent and       formal safety nets that can protect them from the

                            from poverty and vulnerability; the economic security line in 2014 was about IDR 1 million in consumption per
                            person per month. See note to chart and the report ”Indonesia’s Not Quite Middle: Who is the middle class, how
