SUMMARY
The Korean authorities have made significant progress since the last FSAP in revising the
securities regulatory framework, with the current framework achieving good overall
compliance with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles.
Importantly, the earlier legal impediments to international cooperation and exchange of
information have been removed. Since 2011, Korea also applies the Korean International Financial
Reporting Standards (K-IFRS) that follow the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Although the regulators’ responsibilities are defined in legislation, the complexity of the
structure obscures the transparency of the decision-making processes. The responsibility for
deciding on a particular supervisory or enforcement action can lie either at the Financial Services
Commission (FSC), Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), or Financial Supervisory Service (FSS),
depending on the nature and gravity of action, but it is not always clear which one of them is
ultimately in charge. The process is further complicated by the use of pre-deliberation committees
at various levels. Self-regulatory organizations—the Korea Exchange (KRX), the Korea Financial
Investment Association (KOFIA) and the Korean Institute of Certified Public Accountants (KICPA)—
also play a role in the regulatory and supervisory processes. Publication of additional information
on the decision-making structure and processes would be beneficial.

Operational cooperation and coordination between the various authorities is currently
addressed by having the agencies represented in each others’ decision-making bodies.
However, the full participation of the Minister of Strategy and Finance at the FSC Board has the
potential of compromising the independence of the FSC’s supervisory and enforcement decisions.
Consideration should be given on how best to mitigate the potential for undue political influence
arising from such governance arrangements by, for example, restricting the participation of the
Minister of Strategy and Finance in the supervisory and enforcement decisions. Attention should
also be paid to ensuring that the various arrangements for gathering commercial input provide for
equal and transparent treatment of market participants.

The authorities have a broad set of powers, most of which are used effectively. The on-site
examination program could be expanded to ensure sufficient coverage of smaller entities, in
particular asset management companies and auditors. Improved oversight of small auditors is
important to address challenges in enforcing compliance with the auditor independence and
quality control requirements. The on-site inspections should also continue to focus on ensuring
proper handling of customer securities and funds.

Despite recent improvements announced or taken by the authorities, challenges remain in
enforcing compliance with the unfair trading/market abuse provisions of the Financial
Investment Services and Capital Markets Act (FSCMA). This is primarily due to the lack of
sufficiently dissuasive administrative sanctions and the length and less than optimal outcome of the
criminal enforcement process. Jointly with the public prosecutor’s office, the authorities should




                                                                                                      5
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



continue to seek ways to improve both the administrative and criminal enforcement powers and
processes.

Comprehensive disclosure requirements apply to both issuers and collective investment
schemes (CIS). Applicable rules prescribe the content of primary market, periodic and ongoing
disclosures. While their prescriptive nature ensures compliance with the IOSCO Principles, the
authorities are encouraged to monitor whether the current ongoing disclosure requirements for
issuers continue to best serve the interests of investors and market evolution while maintaining a
manageable compliance burden. Given the risks arising to investors from any shortcomings in CIS
custody and valuation, it is important to focus on monitoring compliance and require the use of
market or fair value for all CIS.

The current processes to monitor systemic risk do not appear to sufficiently acknowledge the
potential for systemic risk arising from the securities sector. This combined with certain
deficiencies in the regulators’ arrangements to manage defaults could negatively impact their
ability to deal with market disruptions and institutional failures.

INTRODUCTION
1.       An assessment of the level of implementation of the IOSCO Objectives and Principles
of Securities Regulation (IOSCO Principles) was conducted in the Republic of Korea (Korea)
from April 3 to 19, 2013 as part of the IMF-World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP). The assessment was made by Eija Holttinen, Monetary and Capital Markets Department,
IMF, and Andrea Corcoran, an external expert working for the World Bank. The previous IOSCO
assessment of Korea was conducted in 2001-02 before the first IOSCO Assessment Methodology
had been developed. From the perspective of the IOSCO Principles, this is therefore effectively a
first assessment. Hence, comparisons with the prior assessment are discouraged since the process
has since been refined to promote consistency and has become progressively more rigorous.


INFORMATION AND METHODOLOGY USED FOR
ASSESSMENT
2.      The assessment was made based on the IOSCO Principles approved in 2010 and the
Assessment Methodology adopted in 2011. As has been the standard practice, Principle 38 was
not assessed due to the existence of separate standards for securities settlement systems and
central counterparties.

3.      The IOSCO Assessment Methodology requires that assessors not only look at the legal
and regulatory framework in place, but also at how it has been implemented in practice. The
ongoing global financial crisis has reinforced the need for assessors to make a judgment about
supervisory and other operational practices and to determine whether they are sufficiently effective.
Among other things, such a judgment involves a review of the inspection programs for different
types of supervised entities, the cycle, scope and quality of inspections, as well as how the relevant
authorities follow up on findings, including by using enforcement actions.

4.      The assessment was based on: (i) a self-assessment and additional written responses
prepared by the authorities; (ii) reviews of the relevant legislation and regulations; (iii) meetings
with the management and staff of the FSC, SFC, FSS, Ministry of Strategy and Finance (MOSF), Bank
of Korea (BOK), Seoul Central District Public Prosecutor’s Office; and (iv) meetings with SROs and
market participants, including the KRX, Korea Securities Depository (KSD), KOFIA, KICPA, Korean
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, banks, securities companies, fund managers, issuers, credit
rating agencies, audit firms and local lawyers specialized in securities markets law.

5.     The assessors want to thank the Korean authorities and market participants for their
cooperation and willingness to share information during the mission. In particular, the FSC’s
and FSS’s patience in responding to the numerous follow-up queries after the mission was highly
appreciated. Our particular thanks go to the translators, without whose assistance it would not have
been possible to complete this report.

INSTITUTIONAL AND MARKET STRUCTURE—
OVERVIEW
A. Regulatory Structure

6.       The Korean securities regulatory and supervisory structure is comprised of three main
agencies established by the Act on the Establishment of the Financial Services Commission
(AEFSC). The FSC is responsible for setting financial and supervisory policy across all financial
institutions and markets in Korea. The SFC established under the FSC deals with matters related to
unfair trading on the capital markets and accounting and auditing. The FSS conducts the
supervision, inspection and investigation of financial institutions under the guidance and
supervision of the FSC or SFC. In addition to these three regulatory and supervisory agencies, the
MOSF, the BOK and its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), and the Korea Deposit Insurance
Corporation (KDIC) play significant roles in the Korean financial system. The Fair Trade Commission
(FTC) also has the ability to review the terms of certain financial contracts and to bring actions
related to anti-competitive activities, including manipulation.

7.       The overall structure for the supervision of financial markets, institutions and
products is that of an integrated regulator/supervisor with internal functional diversification.
Supervision of all financial institutions, including banks, insurance companies, financial investment
business entities (which include securities companies, fund management companies, investment
advisors, discretionary portfolio managers, and managers of trusts) and other entities such as
operators of securities and derivatives markets, mutual savings banks, and other non-bank financial
institutions is executed from within separate departments of the FSS. Various arrangements are
used to promote collaboration on overall policies and information exchange.

8.      The core regulatory and supervisory function is located within the FSC, which acts like
a Board with a Secretariat and has staff devoted to policy issuance and supervision, whereas
the SFC and FSS have prescribed roles in effectuating this policy operationally. The FSC is a
governmental agency with Ministerial/Cabinet level status and 287 staff, of which about 20 are in
the Capital Markets Bureau. The FSC oversees the FSS, which is a publicly chartered private
corporation with an Executive Director/CEO (the FSS Governor). The FSS has approximately 1750
employees of which about 23 percent (404) are dedicated to capital markets issues. The FSS has an
independent budget that is funded through statutorily permitted fees and by a constant
contribution of the BOK. The SFC, within the FSC, has a separate Board but no staff or secretariat of
its own and relies on access to staff from the FSC as needed to fulfill its individual mandate.

9.     The relevant authorities have multiple interlocking governance and coordination
arrangements. For example, the Vice Chairperson of the FSC serves as chairperson of the SFC and
the Governor of the FSS serves on the board of the FSC. The Vice Minister of the MOSF, the
President of the KDIC and the Deputy Governor of the BOK are by law ex-officio commissioners of
the FSC with full voting rights, including on supervisory and sanctioning decisions. The Vice Chair of

 the FSC, the Vice Minister of the MOSF and the Vice Governor of the BOK are members of the
 Deposit Insurance Committee of the KDIC. The following chart illustrates the agencies and some of
 the inter-locking arrangements among them.

B. Market Structure

11.       Korea has one exchange (Korea Exchange, KRX) into which three markets, the Korea
Stock Exchange (securities), the Korean Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (KOSDAQ)
Stock Market (smaller cap securities), and the Korea Futures Exchange (KOFEX) (futures),
were combined in 2005. The KRX acts as the central counterparty (CCP) for the exchange-traded
securities and futures markets. The Korea Securities Depository (KSD) is the central securities
depository. The KRX has links with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and Eurex for night
trading of futures and options. The KRX has one of the largest markets in the world, with 1,788
listings, and a market capitalization of USD 1,179.4 billion. It trades the world’s most traded futures
contract, the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) 200, which has a daily turnover of 7.4
million contracts. The Korean market is highly volatile with more than 60 percent of trading
originating with retail investors and another 20 percent from foreign investors with little
institutional participation. The KRX has recently (June 2013) announced the addition of a new
platform Korea New Exchange (KONEX), which will specialize in small and medium enterprises.

12.       A small platform for quotations in companies not listed on the KRX with a market
capitalization of USD 554 million and annual trading value of USD 24 million operates under
the oversight of KOFIA. KOFIA is a self-regulatory organization (SRO) with various statutory
functions, including the certification of securities professionals and the pre-clearance of
advertisements. Membership is not mandatory, but it is not practicable to work in the area of
financial services without being a member. Alternative trading systems (ATS) or multilateral trading
facilities (MTF) were not permitted at the time of the on-site visit, but the law has recently changed.
A bill passed in March 2013 contemplates the creation of a CCP for OTC derivatives clearing. At the
moment the plan is that this infrastructure would operate under the auspices of the KRX. Bonds
trade over-the-counter (OTC) and on the exchange.

         PRECONDITIONS FOR EFFECTIVE SECURITIES
         REGULATION
         15.      Korea is a civil law jurisdiction which has drawn its financial services legislation from
         multiple models including the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union and
         others. The law is highly detailed and comprises thousands of pages of text. Korea has an
         independent judiciary and the prosecutors are officers of the courts. Korea has made a significant
         effort to benchmark its financial sector framework against international standards and to implement
         international accounting and auditing standards. Its insolvency law supports finality of settlement,
         the protection of customer funds held by securities brokers, and close out netting procedures. Its
         commercial law, originally based on the German model has been updated to be more consistent
         with Anglo Saxon corporate governance structures and to permit the governmental agencies
         implementing capital markets law some scope to interpret their primary legislation. There are some
         residual legal issues relative to the integrity of pledged collateral in indirect holding systems.

         Uniquely the deposit protection scheme and the resolution arrangements are extended to all
         financial institutions covered by the financial supervisory architecture, including not just deposit
         taking banks but also investment brokers and traders. The Korean system makes use of self-



                                                                                                                              13
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



regulatory organizations that are themselves empowered by statutes, and to whom delegations of
various functions related to financial services regulation are made in a transparent manner. The
judicial system is observed to be fair, although the amount of prosecutorial resources available for
combating financial crime is limited and may retard prosecuting financial crimes.

MAIN FINDINGS
16.     Principles for the regulator: The Korean regulatory structure is intended to permit an
integrated approach to supervision, while maintaining functional expertise, and to enhance the
capacity of the securities regulator to issue binding guidance. Nonetheless, the operational
structure and the procedural allocation of responsibilities are so complex that individual mandates
seem unclear and the overall system lacks operational transparency. The interlocking governance
structures, particularly through the voting participation of the Minister of Strategy and Finance in
supervisory and enforcement decisions, can at least be perceived to compromise independence.
There may also be structural impediments to maximizing the use of existing resources, especially
because the SFC does not have its own staff. Effort should continue to be dedicated to refining the
cooperative protocols among domestic authorities. The procedures for consultation could be
improved by providing a feedback statement and increasing the transparency of the Regulatory
Reform Committee’s (RRC) decision-making processes. Communication of restrictions on personal
trading and the monitoring for compliance should be enhanced. Despite cross-agency
arrangements for identifying and mitigating potential systemic risks, the possibility for risks to arise
from the capital markets seems underweighted. Although there is a system for developing policy
responses to emerging regulatory issues, the process for assessing perimeter risks is not
documented. Prevention of conflicts of interest and misaligned incentives has been addressed in
the regulatory framework.

17.      Principles for self-regulation: SROs are used to augment the front line oversight of
markets and certain market professionals. There is a comprehensive program by the FSC/FSS to
oversee the self-regulatory responsibilities of each of the statutory SROs. This includes approval of
rules and processes, receipt of notifications of SRO activities, including sanctions, dispute resolution
results, and business reports, and on-site and off-site reviews.

18.     Principles for enforcement: The FSS, together with the SROs, has sufficient inspection,
investigation and surveillance powers vis-à-vis regulated entities. Its on-site examination program is
largely based on periodic and thematic examinations, with some elements of a risk-based approach.
The program is relatively robust with the exception of limited examinations of certain types of
smaller regulated entities. The FSS, FSC and SFC jointly have a broad set of investigative powers
that are however currently not fully utilized, leading to the need for the public prosecutor’ s office
to be largely in charge of the investigative process after a referral by the SFC or FSC. The three
authorities can impose a range of administrative sanctions, but their power to impose pecuniary
administrative sanctions is limited to certain violations. The maximum amounts for civil money
penalties and administrative fines are low. The enforcement process appears to take a relatively
long time. Numerous administrative measures have been taken, subject to the limitations on the

                                                                                    REPUBLIC OF KOREA



types of sanctions available. Available evidence suggests that the criminal process has not
necessarily led to a credible use of the range of sanctions available.

19.     Principles for cooperation: The FSC and FSS have sufficient authority to share information
with their domestic and foreign counterparts without a need for any external approvals. They are
signatories to the IOSCO MMoU, a number of bilateral MoUs with their foreign counterparts, and a
domestic MMoU on macroprudential cooperation and exchange of financial information. In
practice, they have provided timely assistance to a number of requests for assistance.

20.     Principles for issuers: The regulatory framework includes comprehensive and sufficiently
timely primary market, periodic and material event disclosure requirements for issuers of listed and
publicly offered securities. Relevant accountability provisions and enforcement mechanisms are in
place. Derogations from disclosure obligations are clearly defined. The basic rights of shareholders
are addressed in the Korean regulatory framework. Acquisitions of large shareholdings are required
to be disclosed. Obligation to make a public tender offer and prepare a public tender statement
and prospectus applies to those that intend to acquire at least 5 percent of the equity securities of a
company. All listed corporations are required to prepare their financial statements according to the
K-IFRS that are fully in line with the IFRS, and attach them to the registration statements and annual
business reports. The Korea Accounting Institute (KAI)/Korea Accounting Standards Board (KASB)
has been entrusted with the duty to set and interpret the K-IFRS, whereas compliance with them is
supervised by the FSS and KICPA, with enforcement measures taken by them or by the SFC or FSC
in more serious cases.

21.      Principles for auditors, credit rating agencies and other information service providers:
The FSS and KICPA share the responsibility for the oversight of audit reports and auditors. Their
oversight programs are based on the sampling of audit reports and periodic on-site visits to audit
firms and teams, with smaller entities subject to less frequent visits. Despite the active use of
enforcement measures, non-compliance by audit firms remains a challenge, leading to a recent
legislative proposal to strengthen quality control requirements for the audit firms of listed
companies and financial institutions. Relevant auditor independence requirements and the
obligation to apply the Korean Standards on Auditing (KSAs) are in place, but in practice non-
compliance by some auditors has been a concern. The KSAs will be fully aligned with the revised
International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) in the beginning of 2014. Credit rating agencies are
required to be authorized, and are subject to a regular on-site examination program and periodic
reporting requirements. The IOSCO CRA Code of Conduct requirements have been fully
implemented. The FSC has rules in place to prevent conflicts of interest by sell-side analysts that
follow IOSCO guidance and are in the vanguard in applying oversight to all types of evaluators, in
the manner of CRAs. Nonetheless, the pricing by bond pricing agencies should be kept under
review as guidance on benchmarks for pricing evolves.

22.    Principles for collective investment schemes: CIS can be provided in various legal forms,
although in practice publicly offered funds are either investment trusts or investment companies. All
CIS operators and those that market or distribute CIS are required to be authorized and are subject




                                                                                                    15
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



to a full range of conduct of business, organizational and reporting requirements. The on-site
examination program of the FSS does not provide sufficient coverage of the small CIS operators.
Custodians are subject to limited examinations in relation to their role as CIS custodians. The assets
of a CIS have to be properly segregated, and related party custody is forbidden in the FSCMA, but
sufficient evidence was not available to conclude that compliance with this prohibition is effectively
monitored and enforced. A potential investor in a CIS has to be provided with an investment
prospectus that is analogous with the registration statement reviewed by the FSS. The requirements
on advertizing, periodic and ongoing reporting, disclosure of investment strategy, valuation of CIS
assets, and subscription and redemption of CIS securities are largely appropriate. However, money
market fund assets are valued at book value. Pricing errors above a certain level have to be
disclosed, but compensating investors that have suffered from an error is based on market practice
rather than an obligation. Hedge funds can be offered only as private placements to qualified
investors, but operating a hedge fund requires the same authorization as operating a regular CIS.
Hedge funds are exempted from the FSCMA audit requirements, and the FSS has not yet conducted
any on-site examinations on them.

23.      Principles for market intermediaries: The Korean authorities have comprehensive rules
for licensing intermediaries, which include the vetting of principals, including major shareholders.
Ongoing supervision uses detailed examination guides that combine actively followed compliance
and risk-based regimes, as well as appropriate early warning information reporting. Steps should be
taken to further document contingency arrangements, and risk basing would be enhanced by
designing supervisory models that give more weight to intra-group exposures. Additionally, care
should be taken to assure that forbearance with respect to compliance with capital requirements
does not lead to the accrual of unmanageable risks.

24.      Principles for secondary markets: The KRX is a participant utility with a monopoly in
exchange trading. It has multiple programs to control risk, including short interest reporting
procedures, individual price limits, circuit breakers, and the power to isolate failures through the
transfer of positions. Disclosure of more information on the use of these provisions would be useful.
According to the authorities, OTC activity is limited and is subject to reporting consistent with
international standards. However, the actual amount may not be readily measurable and the level of
enforcement of reporting requirements is difficult to substantiate. The exchange plays an active
front line role in the oversight of the markets, with real time surveillance and active surveillance
staff. More information on the delineation of events of default and corresponding resources for
completing settlement should be readily available to the market at large as well as to clearing
participants. International benchmarks with respect to pre- and post-trade transparency of various
transaction types and valuation of illiquid securities by pricing agencies should be kept under
review.

      Readers should be aware that standards assessments are neither audits nor investigations. They are a review of
    existing laws, regulations and practices. The assessors are not expressing legal opinions on the laws, and it is not
    expected that such reviews will expose individual cases of misconduct or malpractice.

                                                                trades are typically done by voice or messenger and
                                                                reporting is related to time of settlement. For bond
                                                                trades to be settled, prices must be reported as all

                                              and related allocation of regulatory and decision-making
                                              responsibilities by e.g. posting an organigram and related decision
                                              making flow chart on the website of each authority.

                                             The authorities should continue to augment the practical
                                              arrangements for cooperation, e.g. by a written protocol.

                                             The FSC and FSS ensure that the investor protection requirements in

                                              administrative sanctioning process and individual supervisory
                                              decisions or at least remove his voting powers in those cases.

                                             The FSC should identify certain financial safety and soundness and
                                              business conduct regulations that should be exempted from the RRC
                                              process, though subject to general administrative review under the
                                              APA.

                                             The participating authorities should clarify the RRC decision-making
                                              process, when it is reviewing regulations proposed by the FSC.

Principle 3                                  The FSC and FSS should assess whether their staffing levels in the

                                             The government should consider whether there needs to be a
                                              specific dedication of governmental resources to facilitate the
                                              execution of powers provided under the FSCMA to the SFC to
                                              combat market abuse.

Principle 4                                  The FSC and FSS should consider providing a feedback statement on
                                              consultations (see also Principle 2 regarding the RRC process).

Principle 5                                  The FSC and FSS should ensure timely communication of guidance
                                              on personal trading restrictions and property registration affecting
                                              staff and Commissioners/Board members.

                                             The FSC and FSS should document their monitoring programs for
                                              compliance with the trading restrictions.

Principle 6                                  The authorities should heighten the awareness that problems in the
                                              securities sector could precipitate runs or other problems with
                                              systemic effect.

                                             The authorities should continue to identify with more particularity
                                              the information that should be shared among the authorities to

Principle 7                  The FSC and FSS should develop a more formal top down process to
                              review emerging risks of misconduct and products or services that
                              do not appear to be sufficiently supervised/regulated and a related
                              escalation process.

                              and 24).

                             The FSS, SFC, FSC and the public’s prosecutor’s office should work
                              jointly to aim at improving the effectiveness of the criminal
                              enforcement process, including through increased information
                              sharing on the outcome of the cases referred to the public
                              prosecutor’s office.

Principle 16                 The FSC should consider whether the current prescriptive material
                              event disclosure regime is the most efficient and effective manner to
                              ensure sufficient disclosure to investors.

                             The FSC should consider proposing a change to the deadline for

                             The FSS and KICPA should ensure that their audit oversight
                              programs are sufficiently comprehensive and address the risks of
                              non-compliance identified in the market.

Table 6. Recommended Action Plan to Improve Implementation of the IOSCO Principles (concluded)

               Principle                                   Recommended Action
Principle 27                            The FSC should require the use of market or fair value also for the
                                         valuation of MMF assets as required by the IOSCO Policy
                                         Recommendations on Money Market Funds.

                                        The FSC should assess whether the regulatory framework applicable
                                         to the treatment of pricing errors is sufficient to enforce the
                                         obligation to compensate investors.
Principle 28                            The FSC should consider the appropriateness of exempting hedge
                                         funds managers from the requirement to have the fund audited.

                                        The FSS should ensure that it launches its on-site inspection
                                         program in hedge fund managers as planned.
Principle 29                            The FSS should consider early on-site “nursery visits” to newly
                                         licensed firms.
Principle 30                            The FSS should consider simplifying its guidance on capital
                                         compliance.

                                        The FSS should review whether performance improvement plans
                                         related to capital deficiencies should be more expeditiously
                                         implemented (see also Principles 32 and 37).
Principle 31                            The FSS should increase the focus of its examination activities on
                                         customer funds and order allocations, especially within brokers
                                         acting as trustees.

Principle 32                            The authorities should document their contingency plan for
                                         addressing financial disruption and firm failures.

                                        The authorities should further document and make readily available
                                         to participants and the public the definition of events of default,
                                         existing default mitigation arrangements and the order by which
                                         available resources to redress defaults will be used by the financial
                                         investment business entity, the KRX, the KSD and any future CCP.
Principle 35                            The FSC, FSS and KRX should consider whether the current KRX
                                         practice for reporting block trades provides sufficient information
                                         to the market.
                                        The FSC, FSS and KOFIA should consider whether further guidance
                                         (and enforcement) is necessary with respect to reporting OTC bond
                                         trades.
Principle 37                            The authorities should request an assessment of the securities
                                         settlement system.

                                         The KRX and KSD should better describe the arrangements for the
                                         completion of settlement in the event of default, even assuming the
                                         insolvency of a clearing member, and keep the sufficiency of these
                                         arrangements under continuous review.

AUTHORITIES' RESPONSE TO THE ASSESSEMENT
25.      The Korean authorities would first like to thank the IMF and the World Bank for their
work on the assessment of Korea’s securities regulation and welcome the recommendations
and suggestions made by the assessment team. While we are very much appreciative of this
opportunity to review and enhance our supervisory and regulatory framework for the securities
sector, there are certain areas in the assessment report where we do not fully agree with and thus,
would like to provide further comments.

26.     In relations to principle 2, the report states that the Ministry of Strategy and Finance’s
participation in the Financial Services Commission enables collaboration and adequate
balance between relevant authorities but may weaken independence of the regulatory
authority. However, the Commission is a representative system, comprising of 9 commissioners
representing relevant organizations as well as experts, which makes it difficult to make decisions in
favor of any one of the 9 commissioners. Moreover, the rules governing the Commission clearly
stipulates that any commissioner shall be excluded or may file application for challenge or withdraw
from resolution and deliberation on matters in which he/she has either direct or indirect interests to
ensure fair resolution and deliberation.

27.     With respect to principle 12 on effective and credible use of inspection, investigation,
surveillance and enforcement powers and implementation of an effective compliance
program, the assessment report suggests that the on-site examination program is relatively
robust with the exception of smaller collective investment business entities and audit
firms/teams, which are subject to less frequent examinations.

28.     While the Korean authorities believe sufficient time is a necessary component for
ensuring sound quality of investigation and enforcement, we also highlight the authorities’
steady efforts to innovate and expedite the investigative process in an effort to minimize
consumer complaints and investor harm. For instance, the Financial Services Commission (FSC),
the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) and the prosecutors’ office are working together in a joint
task force since May 2013 to fast-track the criminal enforcement process.

29.     In the meantime, the FSC is in the process of consulting with the Ministry of Justice to
introduce civil money penalty in the punishment of unfair trading cases, including market
abuse, in an effort to recover unlawful gains and allow timely punishment. Introduction of civil
money penalty is expected to reduce reliance on criminal procedures and provide more diversity in
the enforcement process.

30.      We also note that the recently revised Financial Services and Capital Markets Act
(FSCMA) introduces civil money penalty to punish violations of requirements to disclose
large holdings of securities. In addition to the civil money penalty, the revised FSCMA also
introduces fines ranging from 100 percent up to 300 percent of the amount of unlawful gains from
unfair trading to discourage such unlawful activities and recover ill-gotten gains more effectively.

31.      In August 2013, the FSS has also launched a team dedicated to the management of
unfair trading cases. The team works to enhance the quality and effectiveness of investigation and
enforcement of unfair trading by following up and collecting information on indictment and
conviction rates of the unfair trading cases that have been referred by the FSS to the prosecutors’
office. In an effort to bolster information sharing, the FSC, the FSS, and the prosecutors’ office have
already set up a permanent consultative body for information exchange.

32.      The FSS would also like to underscore our continuous effort to ensure the
effectiveness of on-site examination process for smaller asset management firms. For
instance, not only have we increased the number of examiners for on-site examinations by 55
percent in 2013 compared to 2012, we select timely and emerging issues for our on-site visits, such
as partial examinations of newly established asset management firms. For 2014, wide-ranging
factors, like exam frequency, will be considered in putting together annual examination plans. For
example, small asset management firms that have never been subject to on-site examinations since
inception will be subject to partial examinations in the first quarter of 2014 with a special focus on
areas and issues that have been identified to be deficient during the general full-scope examination
of large asset management firms.

33.      In terms of the inspection of smaller audit firms, we believe supervisory risk
associated with small audit firms tend to be small because of their small size and relatively
small impact on the overall financial market. Thus, in order to achieve the most efficient
supervision with limited resources, the FSS allocates more supervisory resources to the inspection
of large accounting firms with greater significance in investor protection. For instance, audit teams3
undertake audits not of large listed securities firms but mostly of small non-listed securities firms
with relatively limited impact on the overall financial market. Similarly, smaller audit firms conduct
audits mostly of non-listed firms.4 Thus, the regulatory risk stemming from smaller firms and teams
is limited. On the other hand, mid and large audit firms,5 which audit 86 percent of listed companies
have the most influence on financial markets and thus warrant the most supervisory resources.


DETAILED ASSESSMENT
34.      The purpose of the assessment is primarily to ascertain whether the legal and
regulatory securities markets requirements of the country and the operations of the
securities regulatory authorities in implementing and enforcing these requirements in
practice meet the standards set out in the IOSCO Principles. The assessment is to be a means of
identifying potential gaps, inconsistencies, weaknesses and areas where further powers and/or

3
 Audit teams together audit 15 percent of all companies subject to external audits and the quality of audit
conducted by audit teams is inspected by the KICPA.
4
 Only 14 percent of total listed firms are audited by small audit firms and the quality of audit performed by small
audit firms are also inspected by the KICPA.
5
    Audit quality inspection for mid- and large audit firms are directly conducted by the FSS.




                                                                                                                      33
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



better implementation of the existing framework may be necessary and used as a basis for
establishing priorities for improvements to the current regulatory scheme.

35.     The assessment of the country’s observance of each individual Principle is made by
assigning to it one of the following assessment categories: fully implemented, broadly
implemented, partly implemented, not implemented and not applicable. The IOSCO assessment
methodology provides a set of assessment criteria to be met in respect of each Principle to achieve
the designated benchmarks. The methodology recognizes that the means of implementation may
vary depending on the domestic context, structure, and stage of development of the country’s
capital market and acknowledges that regulatory authorities may implement the Principles in many
different ways.

    A Principle is considered fully implemented when all assessment criteria specified for that
     Principle are generally met without any significant deficiencies.

    A Principle is considered broadly implemented when the exceptions to meeting the assessment
     criteria specified for that Principle are limited to those specified under the broadly implemented
     benchmark for that Principle and do not substantially affect the overall adequacy of the
     regulation that the Principle is intended to address.

    A Principle is considered partly implemented when the assessment criteria specified under the
     partly implemented benchmark for that Principle are generally met without any significant
     deficiencies.

    A Principle is considered not implemented when major shortcomings (as specified in the not
     implemented benchmark for that Principle) are found in adhering to the assessment criteria
     specified for that Principle.

    A Principle is considered not applicable when it does not apply because of the nature of the
     country’s securities market and relevant structural, legal and institutional considerations.

                                       Principles Relating to the Regulator
Principle 1.   The responsibilities of the regulator should be clear and objectively stated.

Description    Allocation of Regulatory Responsibilities

               The key financial regulatory and supervisory authorities in Korea are: the FSC at http://www.fsc.go.kr/eng,
               the FSS at http://english.fss.or.kr/fss/en/main.jsp, the SFC, which is a Board of five members located
               within FSC, and does not have its own staff or website, the BOK at
               http://eng.bok.or.kr/eng/engMain.action, the KDIC at www.kdic.or.kr/english/index.jsp, the FTC at
               http://eng.ftc.go.kr/ and the MOSF at http://english.mosf.go.kr/. The Financial Intelligence Unit is located
               within the FSC.

               Additionally, the system makes extensive use of SROs, which have statutorily mandated functions,
               responsibilities delegated by statutory authorities, and contractual duties assigned under regulatory
               services agreements.

               More specifically, a bottom up description follows:

               Self-Regulatory Organizations

               Self-regulatory functions are currently primarily consolidated in the KRX and KOFIA, which oversee the
               exchange markets for all products and the OTC markets for “unlisted” equities and bonds, enforce
               compliance by their members with the SRO rules, and provide data, educational, and other services (see
               Principle 9). KRX and KOFIA have a degree of private rule making authority over their members and
               markets, subject to the FSC approval. The KSD also has private rulemaking authority as a matter of law
               subject to the FSC approval. Additionally, the decision to list securities or admit them to trading is taken
               by the KRX, although the FSS must approve prospectuses under delegation from the FSC. The SROs also
               run dispute resolution forums and, while the FSC licenses (authorizes or registers) institutions conducting
               financial investment business, KOFIA certifies individual professionals who are employed by such
               institutions.

               Financial Supervisory Service

               The ongoing supervision and inspection/examination/surveillance program for financial investment
               business and securities issues is vested in the FSS, a non-governmental entity. The Governor of the FSS is
               a Board Member of the FSC, but effectively the Governor is comparable to a CEO or Executive Director in
               charge of managing the operational supervisory work of the FSS. The FSS has a professional staff that, at
               approximately 1750 persons, exceeds that of the FSC by 300 percent. The FSS has 31 departments, four
               regional offices, three district offices and four overseas representative offices in New York, London,
               Beijing and Tokyo.

               The AEFSC statute charters the FSS as a private “non-capital special corporation”. As such, it is funded
               primarily by fees from regulated financial market participants, with examination/inspection powers both
               mandated by statute and delegated from the FSC (AEFSC, Article 24(2)). The FSS is accountable to the
               FSC (“to perform duties relating to the inspection and supervision over financial institutions, under the
               instruction and supervision of the FSC”) (AEFSC Article 24, see also Article 18). In addition, the FSC
               supervises the KDIC, which is also a non-capital special corporation (see Article 27 of the Depositor
               Protection Act).




                                                                                                               35

            Financial Services Commission

            The FSC is a “central administrative agency” established at the ministerial/Cabinet level under Article 2 of
            the GOA—with a nine member board and related Secretariat. Central administrative agencies are under
            the authority of the President, who may delegate his authority to the Prime Minister under Chapters II
            and III of the GOA and Article 3 and 4 of the AEFSC. By law, the FSC Chairman is appointed by the
            President of the Republic of Korea, on recommendation of the Prime Minister, for a fixed term of three
            years, extendable once; and the Vice Chairman is appointed for a similar term on recommendation of the
            FSC Chairman. The Chairman must undergo personnel hearings before the National Assembly (AEFSC
            Article 4(2)). The Vice Minister of the MOSF, the President of the KDIC, the Deputy Governor of the BOK
            and the Governor of the FSS by law are all ex officio commissioners. The FSC commissioners also include
            two financial experts recommended by the FSC Chair and one industry representative recommended by
            the Chair of the Korea Chamber of Commerce, currently filled by an academic. In addition to presiding
            over the FSC, the FSC Chairman may attend and speak at the State Council (AEFSC Article 4 (6)). All of the
            currently sitting commissioners at both the FSC and the SFC are either ex officio, government servants, or
            academics.

            The FSC’s governmental powers are set forth by the AEFSC and the related Enforcement Decree. The FSC
            is responsible for supervisory policy and its implementation for all financial market participants, including
            banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions (such as mutual savings banks, credit unions,
            and credit finance companies), as well as securities issuers, companies and markets, and such additional
            participants as may be prescribed by the Enforcement Decree of the AEFSC.

            The FSC organization chart is as follows:




36
                                                                               REPUBLIC OF KOREA



Securities and Futures Commission

Although it has an independent mandate and Board under the AEFSC, the SFC is a governmental entity
that sits within the FSC structure. It relies on staffing from the FSC and must use the FSS to undertake
supervisory activities under its specific remit, as it does not have its own staff or Secretariat or an
independently approved budget. The SFC is chaired by the Vice Chairman of the FSC and has a five
member Commission/Board. The four remaining commissioners (one of which is a standing
commissioner, who must be a public official in special service and member of the Senior Civil Service) are
appointed by the President on recommendation of the Chair of the FSC. They must include persons who
have relevant financial sector experience in the government at the Senior Civil Service level or who have
majored in law, economics, business administration or accounting and have at least 15 years academic
experience at the level of an associate professor or at a research institute.

Bank of Korea

BOK is a central bank, which has a financial stability mandate under the Bank of Korea Act and related
Enforcement Decree. BOK does not do day-to-day supervision of banks, but it has the power to require
the FSS to examine banking institutions at its request, to include BOK personnel in the
inspection/investigation team and process, and to reconsider a supervisory decision of the FSS if that
decision would have a bearing on monetary and credit policies (AEFSC, Article 62). By law, the FSS must
comply within one month with a request for inspection (see Enforcement Decree of the AEFSC Article 22-
3).

The authorities also have interlocking governance arrangements. For example, the Vice Chairperson of
the FSC serves as chairperson of the SFC and the Governor of the FSS serves on the board of the FSC.
The Vice Minister of the MOSF, the President of the KDIC and the Deputy Governor of the BOK are by law
commissioners of the FSC. The Vice Chair of the FSC, the Vice Minister of the MOSF and the Vice
Governor of the BOK are members of the KDIC Deposit Insurance Committee (see a more extended
discussion of independence issues in Principle 2).

Evolution

The existing structure is the product of a multi-step consolidation of separate institutional regulators that
began in 1998 in response to the Asian crisis, which mirrored an international trend to consolidate
supervision of multiple institutions within an integrated supervisory authority. Framework changes were
refined in 2004 and 2008 and the overall structure continues to evolve.

The current structure preserves certain historic vestiges of past structures, for example, the MOSF retains
an ex officio seat on the Board of the FSC. Further, the SFC retains a special mandate related to capital
markets including setting and overseeing compliance with the accounting and auditing standards and
detecting, investigating and sanctioning unfair trading practices/market abuses, such as insider trading,
manipulation and fraud. The FTC has functions relative to anticompetitive conduct, including
manipulation of prices generically.

Specific Mandates of the Financial Services Commission and Securities and Futures Commission

The FSC has the following competences (Article 17 AEFSC):

    Development of policies and systems related to finance;
    Supervision, inspection, and sanctioning of financial institutions;




                                                                                                 37
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



                      Authorization of the establishment, merger, conversion, acquisition and transfer of business of
                       financial institutions;
                      Management6, supervision and monitoring of capital markets;
                      Creation and development of a financial hub;
                      Enactment, amendment and repeal of Acts, subordinate statutes and regulations regarding the
                       foregoing;
                      Bilateral and multilateral negotiations and international cooperation over financial institutions and
                       foreign exchange; and
                      Supervision of soundness of institutions handling foreign exchange.
                 The SFC has the following competences (Article 19 AEFSC):

                      Investigation of unfair trade in the capital market;
                      Accounting and auditing standards and oversight;
                      Preliminary deliberation on important matters relating to the management, supervision, and
                       monitoring of capital markets within the FSC; and
                      Matters delegated by the FSC related to management, supervision and monitoring of capital
                       markets.
                 The SFC can partially or entirely revoke or suspend a disposition made by the FSS with regard to any
                 matter specified in Article 19, if the SFC finds that the disposition “is illegal or substantially inappropriate”
                 (see Article 61).

                 There is a broad range of matters that the FSC may refer for deliberation to the SFC, that include for
                 example guidelines for inspection, production of documents with respect to tender offers and other
                 matters, including financial management (FSCMA Article 439 and the Articles referred to therein,
                 including Articles 131(1), 146 etc.). The hierarchy of law adds additional complexity.7

                 All of the laws and guidance governing the financial system are publicly available on various websites,
                 although not always in English (for more information, see Principle 4).

                 Powers of Interpretation

                 The Framework Act of Administrative Regulations states that: “No administrative agencies may limit the
                 rights of citizens or impose duties on citizens pursuant to regulations that are not based on Acts”. In this
                 regard, the FSC and the SFC may partially delegate8 to the Governor of the FSS either’s authority under

6
    Management under the relevant law should be read to mean “oversight.”

7
 The hierarchy of law is as follows: Acts of Parliament, Enforcement Decrees, which typically are Presidential Decrees,
Ordinances of the Prime Minister or other Ministers, Regulations, which may be adopted by the FSC, Detailed
Regulations, which may be adopted by the FSS, as well as other informal, non-binding guidance that may be issued
by various entities with respect to the implementation of their specific operational mandates—for example, the
Governor of the FSS has the authority under Article 39 of the AEFSC to “establish rules, where necessary in
connection with the performance of the business affairs of the FSS”.
8
    Such delegation implies a retained oversight of the delegated activities within the FSC or SFC as the case may be.

the AEFSC or any other Act or subordinate statute (Article 71 AEFSC). The APA explicitly requires an
administrative agency to provide an interpretation or clarification upon request (Article 5). All of the
specific delegations (there are more than 100) are documented and public.

The APA explicitly requires that interpretations of general applicability be made public (Article 51).
Market participants and FSS staff reported however that it is not always apparent, who has the authority
to interpret what, which can lead to forum shopping by market participants. They, however, did not
report that interpretations are unfair or that the discretion to interpret is abused.

Principal Laws

For purposes of securities, the principal laws, in addition to the AEFSC are the FSCMA and the related
Enforcement Decree, the Commercial Act, the APA, the Depositor Protection Act, the Act on the
Structural Improvement of the Financial Industry, the Act on Rehabilitation and Bankruptcy, the CPA Act,
the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies, the Use and Protection of Credit Information Act, and
multiple other pieces of legislation.

Gaps and Duplication

The law is intended to provide uniform coverage of institutions and products. But the law is very
complex—one member of the public described its format as “prescriptive ambiguity”. Further, although
the integrated regulatory structure is intended to be comprehensive, gaps could still occur. For example,
anecdotal evidence indicates that in practice schemes have been designed, taking account of the
description of the scope of securities products, to attempt to evade the strict requirements of the
securities law through the use of trusts or deposits. According to the FSC and FSS, all types of financial
services entities engaging in securities business must “obtain approvals” of the regulator and are subject
to the conduct of business rules pertaining to securities companies, or largely similar rules. Banks and
insurance companies however observe the governance requirements for those categories of institutions,
certain insurance products linked to securities may not be securities, and there is an area of business that
is described as “concurrent business.” (Articles 22 and 37 FSCMA, see also Principles 29 and 31). In this
regard, bank branches increasingly are an important distribution channel for collective investment
schemes provided by management companies related to the bank.

Additionally supervisory responsibility for particular institutions, such as financial market infrastructures
(for example the newly permitted CCP) has not been fully articulated nor has the ultimate responsibility
for the effectuation of macro-prudential policies.

Requirement to Cooperate

The law permits the various authorities with responsibilities affecting the same institution or related
institutions to share oversight. This is accomplished both via participation in the Board of the FSC or by
joint inspections or access to data permitted under the law. The law specifically permits certain inter-
authority requests and requires compliance. For example, the law requires the FSS to examine financial
institutions at the direction of the BOK (see Bank of Korea Act Articles 87-89 and AEFSC Article 65). The
law also permits the FSC to request the cooperation of the key related agencies and “any other
institution or organization” with respect to inspections, data provision or rectification measures (Articles
65 and 65-2 AEFSC). Under the same Act, the KDIC may request the inspection of an insured institution
or of a financial holding company that has the insured institution as a subsidiary or affiliate. The Act also
allows any employee of the KDIC to share the report or to take any necessary measures based on its
results and the FSC must comply (Article 66). When deemed necessary to execute policies any of the
MOSF, the FSC and the Monetary Policy Committee of the BOK may request the others to share data

             with respect to any institution, and the agencies requested must comply except in extenuating
             circumstances (Article 65 AEFSC). The Governor of the FSS also has an independent power by law to
             request the cooperation of any institution (Article 67 AEFSC).

             In September 2012, an MoU was executed among the MOSF, FSC, BOK, FSS and KDIC related to
             information exchange on a routine periodic basis and deferred exchange of ad hoc information in a
             manner consistent with respecting the duties and discretion of each authority and the principle of mutual
             cooperation and reciprocity. The MoU provides for dispute resolution through the Macroeconomic
             Financial Meeting (MEFM), which is headed by the Vice Minister 1 of the MOSF, and specifies the
             composition of the working level group from each participant. The MPFM working level group assembles
             on an ad hoc basis to discuss emerging macro-prudential issues. However, discussions with the
             authorities indicate that more specific agreements/protocols designating information that should be
             shared across sectors on a “top-down basis” to identify problems and responsibility have not been
             explicitly articulated. Issues emerging from the securities sector in particular are not identified (see also
             Principles 6, 7, 32 and 37).

             The SFC must rely on the FSS, subject to the FSC control over allocation of resources, to execute its
             mandate. See for example Article 22, according to which the rules and organization of the SFC must be
             as prescribed by the FSC, except as otherwise explicitly provided by law (i.e., Article 23, according to
             which the SFC shall instruct the FSS in matters committed to SFC under Article 19). According to Article
             61 the FSC may override the SFC and FSS, and the SFC may override the FSS in matters related to Article
             19. Anecdotally, the Secretariat of the FSC controls the flow of business to the FSC, which would provide
             an opportunity to discourage sanction recommendations.

Assessment   Broadly Implemented

Comments     The existing structure of financial services regulation in Korea is uniquely complex. It combines the
             competence and resources of multiple authorities with different powers, resources and mandates derived
             from different legal sources. The structure is intended to separate the operational day-to-day supervisory
             function from policy making at both the regulatory level and governmental level. The structure, while
             complex, nonetheless attempts to provide credibility and norm setting powers to the regulator by giving
             it ministerial status and to implement an integrated system across all financial institutions, while retaining
             functional specialization.

             A clearer, more detailed organigram/flow chart of the various functions, particularly decision-making
             functions, performed by each of the relevant authorities separately, and the authorities in conjunction,
             would assist the public in better understanding the responsibility of each authority for the
             implementation of the regulatory framework and how, when and by whom the law is applied in practice.
             Such an organigram could clarify with precision who has the ultimate decision-making power on specific
             issues and identify the authority that can render interpretations in specific cases, which the public and
             indeed the authorities believe is subject to doubt. More transparency on how/when banks, insurance
             companies and other institutions engaged in securities transactions must meet securities requirements
             would also be desirable.

              Korean law contains a very broad direction to the relevant authorities to cooperate with respect to
             sharing data, information generated in the course of inspections, and opinions on remedial measures,
             albeit sometimes on a delayed basis. The recently executed MoU documents the intention of the
             signatories to share certain specific periodic and ad hoc information generated under the respective
             reporting requirements and supervisory regimes of each agency. An internal agreement/protocol among
             the authorities further illustrating the decision-making responsibilities with respect to specific regulated
             institutions where cooperation is required or encouraged in ordinary and crisis circumstances would

               enhance the ability to address emerging problems and promote further efficiency in cooperation and
               coordination practices. In any event, the effectiveness of cooperation arrangements in practice should be
               kept under continuous review by each competent authority (see also Principles 6 and 32).

               A recent legislative proposal submitted to the National Assembly is intended to give additional
               prominence to consumer protection issues and augment the existing consumer protection delivery
               structure. The most efficient framework for providing adequate consumer protection across all sectors,
               however, remains subject to ongoing debate. One challenge going forward will be to make clear how the
               consumer protection function fits with other existing supervisory functions, particularly business conduct
               functions. This will require consideration of how to balance the following interests: designing inspection
               programs that appropriately weigh the potential impact of mistreatment of customers on financial and
               market integrity; avoiding potential conflicts between the objectives of stability, financial integrity and
               proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for misconduct; and evaluating the role of responsiveness to
               consumer concerns in maintaining public confidence.

Principle 2.   The regulator should be operationally independent and accountable in the exercise of its functions and
               powers.

Description    Operational and Political Independence

               Impact of the regulatory structure

               The bottom-up description of the responsibilities of the various regulatory, supervisory and self-
               regulatory bodies provided in Principle 1 demonstrates how the Korean system attempts to achieve
               independent but accountable and collaborative operations. It also highlights the multiple inter-
               relationships among political and commercial participants within that structure that could be susceptible
               to abuse, if they are not transparent and kept under review. As noted above, the financial services
               regulatory structure affecting securities products, institutions and markets in Korea is intended to provide
               for a layer of independent decision-making that insulates day-to-day operations from political or
               commercial interference and provides ministerial level credibility to the securities function. Under the
               structure, the FSC (a governmental entity) has the ultimate licensing authority, but the FSS (a private
               entity) processes licenses and undertakes the day-to-day examination and oversight program of those
               institutions that are under the FSC remit. The SFC has some special powers with respect to the oversight
               of accounting and auditing and the sanctioning of market abuses, subject to the oversight of the FSC.
               Special deliberation committees with outside industry and academic participants hear sanction cases and
               therefore provide third party input into the “probable cause” part of the sanctioning process (see
               Principle 4). However, the Minister of Strategy and Finance continues to participate as a voting member
               with respect to supervisory and sanctioning as well as normative decisions made at the FSC Board level.
               Although a majority of Board members can take action, it is more typically taken by consensus.

               Even though the FSS is accountable to the FSC, it is free from the broader accountability within the
               government that applies to the issuance of norms and policy making. This enables the FSC to play an
               important role in influencing the issuance of norms affecting customer protection and market integrity,
               while the FSS can undertake day-to-day supervision without the governmental oversight applicable to
               proposing secondary legislation. This multi-tiered structure, while unusually complex, reflects the
               practical differences between the FSC policy role and the FSS role of performing examinations,
               surveillance, investigations and certain enforcement functions, recognizing the difficulty of total
               separation. In practice, the structure appears to achieve the intended level of protection from day-to-day
               political and commercial interference taking into consideration the particularities of the legal system in
               Korea, with the exception of the taking of sanctioning and supervisory decisions against individual
               entities and persons.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA



            The prescriptive legal framework in Korea may to some extent legally circumscribe the potential for
            undue interference. However, the inter-locking governance structure, which permits the Minister to sit
            and vote on the Board of the FSC, the participation of industry nominees on the Board and in the various
            deliberation committees, and the lack of transparent deliberations could potentially jeopardize
            independence depending upon actual practice.

            Political independence more broadly

            Regulations adopted by the FSC and detailed regulations adopted by the FSS are not reviewed directly
            by the MOSF. However, the Minister of Strategy and Finance is a voting member of the FSC Board, which
            has the final say on policy and enforcement actions, except with respect to less severe disclosure and
            unfair trading cases (see Principle 11). Additionally MOSF is represented in the RRC (see below), which
            reviews all substantial legislation and regulations through an apparently non-transparent deliberative
            process and whose recommendations must be taken into account by the FSC and FSS.

            The Vice Minister of the MOSF is also an ex officio member of the Deposit Insurance Committee of the
            KDIC. The KDIC and resolution processes are relevant to all financial institutions within the Korean
            structure. The MOSF can also appoint a member to the BOK MPC. Separately, the MOSF has a role with
            the BOK in addressing the stability of the exchange rate and managing foreign exchange reserves under
            the Foreign Transaction Law, which activities are intended to proactively avert instabilities. The MOSF
            also has a key role in crisis management in that it is the governmental unit that has the capacity to raise
            money through the issuance of bonds and to provide government guarantees for bonds issued with
            respect to the resolution activities. Its leadership is part of closed door highest level “Blue House”
            meetings on urgent matters. The MOSF at the First Vice Chairman level also sits on the Board of the
            Korea Center for International Finance (KCIF) together with equal level representatives of the FSC and
            BOK, the Chairman of the Korea Federation of Banks and two other dignitaries. The KCIF
            (http://www.kcif.or.kr) is a “think tank” initially formed during the Asian crisis known also as the “Watch
            Dog”. Among other things, it provides global daily real-time market monitoring and issues alerts and
            early warnings to the financial services agencies and the government more generally (see also Principle
            6).

            Beyond the potential MOSF political influence, the overlay of the responsibility of the Chair of the FSC to
            the President could also have an indirect chilling effect on the FSS.

            Terms of office and criteria for appointment and dismissal

            The AEFSC sets fixed terms of office for the Chairman and Commissioners of the FSC and for all members
            except the Chairman of the SFC, who is also the Vice Chairman of the FSC and protected under the terms
            of that appointment. The law also specifies bases for removal for cause (see Article 10 for the FSC and
            Article 32 for the SFC). As a matter of practice the Chairman of the FSC resigns upon the election of a
            new President (though as a matter of law the person could continue his/her term as a Commissioner).

            Accountability

            To the Regulatory Reform Committee

            The RRC (at http://ww.rrc.go.kr/) was originally formed in 1998. It is co-headed by the Prime Minister and
            a civilian co-chair, and has 22 members, six of which are representatives of designated government
            ministries (MOSF, Ministry of Trade and Industry, Ministry of Security and Public Administration, Ministry
            of the Office of Government Policy Coordination, FTC, and Ministry of Government Legislation) and the
            remainder of which are largely academics. The Committee makes an analysis of all new regulations

                 except some that are not considered important (based on number of people affected or amount of
                 costs), within a 45 day period9. The review is in the nature of a regulatory impact/feasibility review, which
                 assesses costs and benefits of regulatory initiatives, legal validity, results of consultation, and makes a
                 recommendation. The proposing agency must take account of the RRC determination (see Framework
                 Act on Administrative Regulations Article 14 and discussion under Principle 4). The relationship to the
                 APA and the process and the criteria by which the RRC may override an FSC regulation, however, are not
                 fully transparent.

                 To the National Assembly

                 The FSC must report quarterly to the National Assembly and must present and defend its budget
                 annually. The National Audit Board conducts the budget review.

                 Administrative and Judicial Recourse

                 The APA contains a comprehensive set of procedures intended to protect the interests of the affected
                 public and to ensure fairness and consistency (Article 1). Articles 22 through 24 of the APA require that
                 decisions must be reasoned and that dispositions must be provided in writing to affected individuals,
                 except in times of emergency, wherein reasons may still be requested ex post. An affected person has an
                 opportunity to be heard either on the papers or orally (Article 27). The FSS also has an Enforcement
                 Review Committee that acts like a probable cause committee and permits both the investigation staff
                 and the regulated entity against whom a charge is being lodged to be heard. The Committee pre-hears
                 the case before a sanction is proposed to and approved by the FSC.

                 There is also a process whereby individuals aggrieved by a process can file a complaint with the
                 Administrative Review Committee in the Office of the Prime Minister. Judicial review of administrative
                 actions is also available in the courts. In the case of securities licenses, which are granted based on
                 objective criteria, bases for appeal would however be relatively limited (see also Principle 29).

                 Budget Oversight and the Capacity to Reallocate Funds

                 The budget of the FSC is part of the governmental budget and subject to review by the National
                 Assembly and the Board of Audit and Inspection of the government. The FSS budget must be proposed
                 prior to the commencement of the FSC fiscal year and is reviewed by the FSC, subject to external audit
                 and review by the FSS’s internal audit function, and published in the FSS Annual Report and on its
                 website. Both the FSC and FSS have the capacity to reallocate the FSS budget, should such reallocation
                 be necessary, subject to rules relative to the payment of civil servants.

                 Confidentiality

                 The FSS and its employees are subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to any information
                 acquired in the course of their duties or the use of such information for any purpose other than the
                 performance of their duties (AEFSC Article 35). Faithfulness, integrity and duty of trust are all obligations
                 of administrative agencies and their employees under the APA (see e.g., Articles 1 and 4).

 REPUBLIC OF KOREA



             Immunity

             There is no protection from criminal liability for the FSC, SFC, FSS and their employees for actions taken
             in performance of their duties which intentionally infringe penal law, and there is explicit civil liability for
             gross negligence. The State may itself compensate applicants for damages caused by public employees
             or private persons charged with public duties. Such officials may, however, have individual liability to the
             State if the damage is ultimately deemed to be intentional or grossly negligent (see State Compensation
             Act, Articles 2(1) and (2)). Therefore, though further clarification would be welcome, there is a process for
             indemnification of employees which is not based explicitly on good faith but on whether the employee
             engages in intentional misconduct or gross negligence, which would appear to protect most actions
             taken in good faith. As a matter of nuance, however, gross negligence may not be the equivalent of bad
             faith. Nonetheless, although there has been litigation, there has been no case in which employees have
             been required to compensate a third party for damages within the last five years.

             In regard to the criminal law affecting government officials, non-career personnel of the FSC and private
             persons with public duties are subject to the criminal law as if they were public officials and to the
             disciplinary processes affecting government employees (see State Public Officials Act and AEFSC).

             Multiple Objectives and Commercial Interference

             The structure described above also reflects that the FSC has a dual developmental and regulatory
             mandate. Article 2 of the AEFSC provides that the FSS and the FSC “shall endeavor to keep fairness,
             ensure transparency, and refrain from disturbing the autonomy of financial institutions in performing their
             affairs” (emphasis added). This injunction and overall powers that include developing a financial hub
             further demonstrate the mixed objectives of the regulatory scheme.
Assessment   Partly Implemented

Comments     The Korean system employs a complex, interwoven system of checks and balances. Since the initial FSAP,
             the Korean authorities have increased the level of transparency of many of their operations and the
             ability of the public to comment on regulatory and supervisory activities. However, the Minister of
             Strategy and Finance continues to participate as a voting member with respect to normative and
             individual supervisory and sanctioning decisions made at the FSC Board level. Although a majority of
             Board members can take action, it is more typically taken by consensus and the political presence and
             accountability regime could potentially have a chilling effect on decision-making. The overall decision
             making process among the FSC, SFC and FSS is not transparent, although procedures of each are clear
             and documented (see also Principle 1). Additionally the RRC process for taking normative actions and for
             overriding potential norms proposed by the FSC is not itself transparent.

             As a result, it is difficult to analyze whether, and if so, the extent to which, the balance of measures
             adopted to assure cooperation, coordination and accountability could improperly compromise
             independence. The design has the admirable purpose of giving the FSC ministerial power and related
             credibility to adopt regulations and operational independence in control of the budget and of the
             ongoing examination program. However, there are some indications that the FSC takes a very hands-on
             role in directing FSS activities. Thus there is a potential that the political participation on the FSC Board
             can impact the examinations and their follow-up processes. While the integrity of the structure is not
             questioned by market participants, the level of independence of the FSC and FSS would be improved by
             removing the MOSF representative at least from voting on and potentially altogether from the
             supervisory and sanctioning process. This would ensure that political objectives do not conflict with
             enforcement and supervisory objectives. The independence of the FSC would also be enhanced by
             providing it with more authority to ignore the RRC recommendations in cases of regulation committed
             to its particular authority. Finally consideration could be given to advocating the use of public meetings
             to reach normative conclusions.

Principle 3.   The regulator should have adequate powers, proper resources and the capacity to perform its functions
               and exercise its powers.

Description    Powers

               The FSC, SFC and FSS, between them, have a broad complement of powers to license financial
               institutions, markets and market infrastructures, to adopt secondary legislation, to address financial
               deterioration and market disruption, including through the transfer of accounts and performance
               improvement plans, and to obtain and share information. They can also take a range of remedial and
               enforcement actions, as described in more detail in Principles 10-12 and in the functional parts of this
               report including:

                   Issuance of cautions and warnings;
                   Suspension of trading;
                   Restriction of business;
                   Removal of management;
                   Requirement of additional equity contributions;
                   Requirement to correct a financial statement or an offering document;
                   Rescission of profits in the event of misleading disclosure;
                   Publication of information on short swing profits by an insider;
                   Suspension of redemptions;
                   Transfer of funds or securities;
                   Imposition of monetary penalties;
                   Withdrawal, conditioning or revocation of a license;
                   Delisting; and
                   Referral for criminal process.
               The exercise of these powers is dependent on the violation in question—for example there is a wider set
               of administrative measures to address disclosure violations than market abuses, which are currently
               treated primarily as criminal offenses under the FSCMA. Also, to the extent that the SFC has some special
               investigative powers, the resources to use them must be obtained from the FSC or the FSS.

               The FSC, SFC and/or FSS oversee the SROs, receive ongoing disclosures from issuers, supervise financial
               investment services companies (see p. 11), oversee accounting and auditing practices and audit firms and
               practitioners, and have some responsibility for various entities with securities functions within financial
               holding company groups. They also have some responsibility to prevent unauthorized business (see
               Principle 7).

               Boards

               Both the Board of the FSC and the SFC are very active. During 2011 and 2012, both Boards met regularly
               twice a month. In 2011, the FSC also held 14 ad hoc meetings. In 2012, it held three ad hoc meetings and
               processed seven seriatim resolutions. The SFC also had one ad hoc meeting in 2011 and three in 2012.

                Staff

                The Capital Markets resources are about 10 percent of the FSC staff and 23 percent of the FSS staff.

                Financial Services Commission

                The FSC Capital Markets Bureau is very small and is comprised of approximately 30 out of 287 overall
                staff. The FSC budget is part of the overall governmental budget. The FSC salaries are constrained by civil
                service pay scales and rules, but include government benefits. Under the Enforcement Decree of the
                FSCMA alone, there are 160 delegations to the FSS.

                Securities and Futures Commission

                The SFC has no separate staff, secretariat, or budget. It must conduct operations using staff that is loaned
                or seconded from other parts of the regulatory structure.

                Financial Supervisory Service

                The FSS budget is approved by the FSC and its fiscal year is aligned with that of the FSC. The FSS is
                permitted by law to raise funds from the industry in accordance with a formula set forth in the
                Enforcement Decree of the AEFSC. It also receives support from the BOK and can receive governmental
                support by loan or otherwise if necessary. The FSC can permit the FSS to accrue budget surplus over a
                year end (AEFSC Article 50). The FSS salaries are competitive with private sector salaries for the same
                disciplines. According to staff about 400 of the total FSS staff of 1700 are dedicated to capital markets
                and securities products and professionals. The FSS designates one Deputy Governor to Capital Markets,
                underneath which an Assistant Governor is dedicated to each of supervision of financial investment
                business entities and corporate disclosure; examination of financial investment business entities and
                capital markets investigations; and accounting and auditing.

Self-Regulatory Organizations

KRX indicated that it has more than 600 staff. 121 of them are dedicated to member supervision and
market surveillance, while 100 are responsible for the listing and disclosure review. KOFIA has 36
employees whose role is to conduct random inspections of branch distribution practices, pre-review
advertising, accept electronic registration of OTC trades, certify specified securities professionals, and
develop guidance and best practices for engagement contracts and other matters such as suitability.
KOFIA also monitors risk management practices. These oversight staff operate under a special oversight
committee in each case. The KSD oversees the settlement process pursuant to its business, deposit and
settlement rules.

Reliance on Economic Crime Unit Support

The prosecutorial staff responsible for prosecuting economic crimes related to financial services (which
include market abuses) number about 17 (including those in charge of tax crimes) out of 184 staff in the
Seoul Central District public prosecutor’s office. The criminal process isj protracted (see also Principles 11
and 12).

Disciplines Represented

The FSC has 287 staff, which includes 242 active professionals, 6 active administrative personnel and 39
persons on overseas training secondments or otherwise on leave. 193 have bachelor’s degrees and 69
have graduate degrees. The FSS has 1681 professional staff and 71 administrative staff. Their professional
qualifications are listed below. Neither provided statistics for staff dedicated to capital markets activities
in that personnel are rotated on a three year cycle.

            Turnover

            Between 2010 and 2012 the average turnover rate varied from 0.8 to 4 percent for the FSC and FSS in the
            aggregate.

            Technology

            The FSC has the Data Analysis Retrieval and Transfer (DART) system, which is a fully electronic system for
            the electronic filing of registration statements, prospectuses, and material event and periodic disclosures.
            With respect to surveillance of the market, the FSC has access to KRX terminals to observe trading in real
            time and can perform analysis using proprietary systems, but performs batch surveillance primarily. One
            staff member is committed to liaison with the KRX and KOFIA. 88 staff are committed to surveillance and
            investigation for securities violations and other oversight activities.

            Ongoing Training

            The FSS conducts a professional career development program, which permits staff to undertake training
            to obtain enhanced expertise, such as MBAs in finance, CFA certification, and legal or accounting
            qualifications with (partial) financial support from the FSS. KOFIA conducts multiple training programs
            and FSS staff may attend these.

            Internal Audit and Governance

            The FSS has an internal audit function and the FSC and SFC are subject to governmental audit
            procedures. The FSC is subject to the accountability requirements for a central administrative agency,
            and therefore must be reviewed by the National Audit Board. The Board of the FSC contains outside
            experts. In addition to the Chairman, three members of the Board can convene a special meeting.
            Complex internal policies exist, but they are not particularly accessible (see Principle 1).

               Investor Education

               The FSS has an educational/informative blog on its website. It also publishes investor alerts and a
               newsletter as does the FSC. The FSS operates an education program known as the Public Financial
               Educational Department. KOFIA also runs investor education programs and has trained over 240,000
               individuals.

Assessment     Broadly Implemented

Comments       In view of the size and complexity of the Korean market, and the demands of a complex banking system,
               the resources dedicated to the capital market have not been demonstrated to be as sufficient as
               desirable considering the allocation of various operational functions, even taking into consideration the
               use of self-regulatory resources to augment those of the statutory regulators. The FSC Capital Markets
               Bureau only has approximately 30 personnel out of a staff of 287. The SFC is a board of five members
               with no independent secretariat, budget or staff, and within the FSS the capital markets area has
               approximately 400 staff without agency wide data bases, with the exception of DART, or dedicated
               access to IT support systems for market surveillance and other activities. Effectively, the sanctioning of
               market abuses is not staffed with dedicated personnel at the authorities. Neither, per Principles 11 and
               12, are they capable of promptly imposing sanctions intended to combat market abuses even with the
               assistance of otherwise occupied prosecutorial authorities.

Principle 4.   The regulator should adopt clear and consistent regulatory processes.

Description    Transparent and Consistent Processes

               The various regulatory authorities in Korea are subject to the APA, the objective of which is to ensure
               that administrative agencies exercise their mandates in a manner consistent with fundamental fairness.
               The APA requires the pre-publication of proposed legislation and secondary regulations or amendments
               to regulations for at least 20 days with an opportunity for public comment. Additionally, in certain
               circumstances, the law permits a hearing on regulatory actions of general applicability (Articles 43 and
               44). The law also provides for notice of a proposed action, an opportunity to be heard, and reasoned
               decisions in writing with respect to administrative decisions, except emergency, trivial or repetitive
               actions (see e.g., APA Articles 22, 23, and 24). Judicial review is available for material actions, but if the
               matter is licensing or reporting the scope would be limited, as the decisions are made using objective
               non-qualitative criteria.

               The FSS and/or the FSC consult with the industry, in particular the SROs and trade associations with
               respect to the development of policy. Regulations that could impact more than 1 million people or result
               in incurring more than KRW 10 billion (USD 1 million) of costs must be submitted to the RRC, described
               above in Principles 1 and 2, which conducts a regulatory impact analysis, considers the costs and benefits
               of the proposal, and evaluates the regulations’ implications for government policies more broadly than
               the proposing agency may, pursuant to the RRC’s mandate to ”deliberate upon and coordinate the
               Government’s regulation policies” (Article 23). The review period ranges from 10 to 45 days and the final
               results are gazetted, published in the media and by the internet, and can bind the securities authorities if
               they conflict with normative proposals made by FSC.

               Commercial Independence and Accountability

               As noted above, the Framework Act on Administrative Regulations requires that important regulations
               (as determined by the RRC within 10 to 45 days after submission by an agency head) be modified or
               improved, if the RRC so recommends absent special circumstances to the contrary. Improved regulations




                                                                                                                 49

            must be resubmitted following the changes. Regulations are initially submitted in draft, coupled with a
            regulatory impact analysis, an independent analysis of propriety, and a review of comments from
            interested parties, including other agencies, civic groups, research institutes, and the general public
            gathered via public hearings and pre-announcement procedures (see the APA). In the case of legislation,
            this process must precede submission to the Minister of Government Legislation (see Articles 7 through
            14 APA). The review/decision-making by the RRC itself, however, is not transparent. Separately, any
            person may submit an opinion on the abolishment or amendment of an existing regulation (Article 17).

            Other Consultative Mechanisms

            The FSC has five standing expert committees upon which senior members of the regulated industry sit,
            which have existed since the early 1990s. These committees, which were previously organized under the
            MOSF, are intended to improve communication between the industry and the FSC. The committees each
            meet quarterly and their membership is composed in each case of 20 percent of the FSC staff and 80
            percent of private sector members. The Committees and some of the issues that they have considered
            are as follows:

                                  Committee                               Recent Considerations

                    Financial Policy Committee                 Major policy issues (household debt,
                                                               European sovereign debt; segregation of
                                                               industrial conglomerates and banks)

                    Service Committee                          Improvement of quality of financial services
                                                               (e.g., insurance annuity products, social
                                                               responsibility)

                    General Public Committee                   Customer protection, access to finance

                    Securities Industry Committee              Improvement of the capital market (rating

                                                               improvement of mutual savings banks)

                                                               repositories, Basel III, shadow banking


            In 2012, the FSS established similar committees under its aegis.
            The Korean Chamber of Commerce and KOFIA also organize comments on various regulatory initiatives.

            Feedback

            Although the authorities do not necessarily provide a feedback statement indicating their disposition of
            the comments received in a rulemaking procedure, the FSS publishes a handbook, updated yearly, and
            available on its website that explains many of its policies and procedures in lay terms. The FSS annual
            handbook also contains one section that summarizes the rule changes made during the prior year and
            their rationale. For important changes, the FSC must provide the rationale required by the Framework Act
            for Administrative Regulations—that Act also requires frequent regulatory review and publication of an
            agenda of planned revisions or reforms.

              Licensing Process

              The FSS handbook contains information on the process (and criteria) for obtaining a license and explains
              the then current regulatory framework in layman’s terms. Applications for licenses are posted on the FSC
              website, which permits objections to be filed with the FSC (FSCMA Article 13). Interestingly, the overall
              number of securities companies however has not materially changed since the 2002 FSAP assessment.

              The criteria for granting a license include specific fitness criteria, including a standard of financial
              soundness and disqualification for a record of misconduct.

              Sanctions Deliberation Committees

              The decision to undertake a post investigation sanctions proceeding is made by the FSC and in some
              cases the SFC. There are two SFC committees that act as “sanctions-support, pre-deliberation” type
              committees prior to decision by the SFC: (i) the Committee for Deliberation on Investigations of Capital
              Markets (Article 21 of the Regulations on Investigation of Capital Markets) that deliberates on disposition
              of investigations on unfair transactions and disclosure violations, and (ii) the Accounting Oversight
              Deliberative Committee (Article 23 of the Regulations on External Audit and Accounting) that deliberates
              on measures on audit reviews and inspections. These Committees are partially composed of outside
              experts11. The FSS has an Enforcement Review Committee on which sits the Deputy Governor for
              Planning & Management Support, the Deputy Governor who raised the enforcement matter, a legal
              advisor, the director of the FSC related to the subject matter of the alleged violation, and four outside
              experts. This committee reviews sanctions recommended for regulated entities and their executives and
              employees on the basis of inspections, and is intended to ensure the fairness and equity of the process.

              The SROs also have disciplinary panels, which are comprised of individuals who do not represent
              members but who have market experience. These disciplinary panels hear the presentation of evidence
              with respect to the proposed disposition of sanctions by the exchange for violation by members of its
              rules, and report to the KRX Market Oversight Commission, which is composed of independent members
              of the Board. Upon request, an aggrieved defendant can request a rehearing by the disciplinary panel.

              The purpose of the above processes is to promote consistent and equitable administrative treatment.
              Further review can be taken through the judicial system. Matters referred to the criminal prosecutor are
              subject to the protections accorded defendants in a criminal proceeding.

              Transparency in General

              All the laws, legislation, decrees, regulations, detailed regulations and any guidance of general
              applicability must be made public. The contents of these are available on the Internet at one or more
              sites, including the KRX, KSD, KOFIA, FSS and FSC, among others. The legal framework is frequently, but
              not always, available in English as well as Korean. See for example:
              http://www.kofia.or.kr/kofia/index.cfm?event=eng.rul.page01 (rules available in English on KOFIA site),
              and http://english.fss.or.kr/fss/en/laws/securities/list.jsp?bbsid=1289368624482 (link to FSS regulations).
              See especially the Regulations on Financial Investment Business with respect to conduct of business, and
              Regulations on Investigations of Capital Markets that relate to the procedures for investigatory
              proceedings. In addition, standards for imposing penalties are available (see e.g., Regulations on
              Examination and Sanctions Against Financial Institutions).

               Additionally the DART system retains all electronically filed information, which is accessible to the general
               public. Minutes of the meetings of the Boards of the FSC and the SFC must be maintained as a matter of
               law, and can be reviewed by the appropriate audit entities.
               The FSS also publishes a biweekly Newsletter with informative contents. The FSC publishes a weekly
               economic publication and a blog. Additionally, inspection manuals and the Risk Analysis and
               Management System (RAMS) guidance (see Principles 6 and 30) is provided to each financial institution
               to which it applies.

               The agencies’ Annual Reports and financial statements are also available on their Internet sites, as is the
               FSS Handbook.

               Reports on Investigations

               Reports on investigations are not made public and not all sanctions imposed are made public, as the
               reputational impact of publishing a sanction is considered an augmentation of the penalty. In addition,
               the SROs do not appear to systematically publish the results of their disciplinary proceedings. Non-public
               information that becomes available to the authorities and their staffs in the course of performing their
               responsibilities must be treated as confidential (see also Principle 5).

               Conciliation Process

               The Enforcement Decree of the AEFSC provides a process for a mediation or conciliation service for
               disputes among financial institutions provided for under Article 51 of the AEFSC. The FSS Financial
               Disputes Mediation Committee must have not more than 30 members drawn from judges, attorneys,
               prosecutors, former executives of the Korea Consumer Agency, persons with at least 15 years experience
               in a financial institution or related organization, a Deputy Governor from the FSC, and other members as
               deemed necessary as appointed by the Governor of the FSS.

Assessment     Fully Implemented

Comments       The FSC, SFC, FSS and the other authorities have well-documented processes, which must be followed to
               propose, adopt, and implement rules and operations, including multiple templates and manuals. There is
               a consultation process and guidance on the regulatory program in lay person’s language. The processes
               are subject to a comprehensive administrative law, which provides for review of individual sanctions and
               requires administrative sanctions to be reasoned and in writing. While the consultation process does not
               result in a feedback statement as to the consideration of comments, the authorities do discuss emergent
               issues with the industry and also publish a regulatory calendar and an annual review. The RRC is intended
               to keep regulation across the government coordinated and to look at regulatory impact—however, the
               criteria and the deliberative process for determining how the RRC procedure can affect FSS and FSC
               decision-making are not transparent, a matter addressed in Principle 2. Market participants state that the
               regulatory/supervisory process has become increasingly transparent, but that some of the comment
               processes seem merely matters of form. The informal committee system may also leave some
               stakeholders less well represented than others. The latter matters are addressed in Principle 2. The
               authorities should continue to appropriately increase the transparency of their processes.

Principle 5.   The staff of the regulator should observe the highest professional standards, including appropriate
               standards of confidentiality.

Description    Professional Conduct

               Both career officials and non-career employees are subject to the ethical provisions of the State Public

                  disciplinary action, duty to perform duties with impartiality and religious neutrality, prohibition on receipt
                  of gifts or gifts to superiors or subordinates, and duty to maintain confidential information both during
                  and after the tenure of office. Prohibition and/or restrictions also apply to political participation and
                  engagement in profit-making business (Articles 56–66). The FSC and the FSS also have internal Codes of
                  Conduct and investigators are subject to a Code related to on-site investigations (Annex of the Detailed
                  Regulations on Investigation of Capital Markets).

                  Additionally, the FSC and the FSS both have differently constituted internal audit and inspection
                  functions. At the FSC, the function is under the Bureau of Planning and Coordination, which itself is under
                  management. The Audit and Inspection unit conducts the following activities per the FSC website:

                      Manages matters relating to audit and inspection;

                      Conducts audit and inspection on the FSC and its affiliates;

                      Registers and inspects the wealth12 of public officials and manages matters relating to the
                       employment of retired public officials consistent with post employment requirements; and

                      Investigates and handles petitions and corruption charges.

                  The FSS also has a Chief Auditor (see Article 29(4) AEFSC) appointed by the President on
                  recommendation of the Chair of the FSC and an Internal Audit and Inspection Function that reports to
                  the Chief Auditor and is not under management. The SFC does not have any such function independent
                  of the FSC, and the FSC is accountable to the national authority with respect to proper accounting for its
                  budget and resources.

                  Conflicts of Interest and Other Matters

                  The AEFSC has specific provisions providing that the non-ex officio members of the FSC Board, i.e., the
                  two financial expert Commissioners, the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, the head of the FSC Secretariat
                  and the Governor of the FSS may not concurrently engage in profit-making business and be appointed
                  as state officials in public service. The AEFSC also provides that where the Governor is conflicted with the
                  FSS, the Deputy Governors should act on his behalf in the order of precedence set forth in the articles of
                  incorporation of the FSS (Articles 9, 31, and 34). All the foregoing persons are subject to limitations on
                  other public officials related to integrity and loyalty.

                  Employees of the FSC and the FSS are subject to general rules relating to the avoidance of conflicts of
                  interest. Employees and members of the Boards are subject to legal provisions against conflicts of
                  interest and also to a Code of Conduct, which are intended to prevent an employee or commissioner
                  from taking action where they would have a personal interest.

                  All personnel of the authorities are subject to the Act on Real Name Financial Transactions and
                  Guarantee of Secrecy. Persons who are non-public official commissioners of the FSC or SFC and officers
                  and employees of the FSS are deemed public officials for purposes of the penal provisions of the
                  Criminal Act or any other Act such as civil servant law (AEFSC Article 69), in particular, treatment of
                  certain employees as public officials for purposes of applying anti-bribery provisions of Articles 129-130
                  of the Penal Code by the Enforcement Decree of the AEFSC. Similarly, the FSS is a government chartered
                  private entity, whose employees will be deemed to be government servants with respect to penal laws

             prohibiting certain conduct in exercising their inspection and other functions. Duties may be delegated
             to FSS personnel by both the FSC and the SFC respectively.

             Holding and Trading Securities

             The FSCMA states in Article 441 that the limitations of trading and the requirement for quarterly
             reporting of aggregate transactions above the value specified in relevant guidance (now KRW 10 million),
             apply to all members of the FSC and public officials under its control as well as members of the SFC and
             the Governor, Deputy Governors, Assistant Governors, Auditor and employees of the FSS. The trading
             restrictions apply to listed equity securities and debt, depository receipts, and derivatives indexed or
             related to the same. Annual property registration provisions apply to persons above Grade 4. At the FSS,
             trades cannot be margined, no more than 50 trades can be made per quarter, there can be no conflict
             with responsibilities or use of non-public information and the annual total value of trades cannot exceed
             50 percent of earned income reported for taxation. In the case of the FSC a blind trust may be required
             under certain circumstances.

             The Audit and Inspection functions of both the FSC and FSS can conduct inspections as to compliance
             and required reports are filed with the audit units. However, the processes for the oversight and
             monitoring of trading restrictions and their application are not documented. Further there was
             substantial confusion among employees as to the scope and application of the existing limitations,
             reporting requirements and restrictions.

             Confidentiality

             The personnel of the authorities are required to maintain the confidentiality of information acquired in
             the course of their duties and may not use such information for financial transactions or otherwise for
             personal gain (see Article 60 of the State Public Officials Act and Article 35(2) of the AEFSC). Under Article
             127 of the Criminal Act and Article 68(1) of the AEFSC, an officer or employee of either the FSC or FSS
             may be found guilty of a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment or a fine for the disclosure of
             confidential information. Although the FSS takes strict internal control measures, including mandatory
             ethics course offered to all FSS employees to prevent such disclosures from happening, there has been
             one case where an employee of the FSS was criminally prosecuted for breach of these confidentiality
             provisions in 2012, when the employee unlawfully disclosed information relating to the suspension of
             mutual savings banks in Korea.

             Monitoring

             The Internal Audit and Inspection Office of the FSS surveys the executives and employees of financial
             institutions that have recently obtained a license or undergone an on-site examination to identify
             whether FSS supervisors and examiners engaged in any inappropriate or unethical behavior. Market
             participants confirmed that visits were made by that function to regulated entities after an inspection to
             confirm that the exercise was properly conducted. Whistleblowers also can complain to the FSS of such
             behavior and their anonymity will be protected.

Assessment   Broadly Implemented

Comments     There seemed to be substantial confusion about applicable securities trading restrictions among staff.
             Monitoring of compliance with securities holding and trading rules is not documented and could not be
             confirmed. The requesting of information from audited entities about inappropriate behavior while
             seemingly a benign way of enforcing professional conduct might be viewed, depending on how it was
             conducted in practice, as a means for the FSC interference with the FSS examination program.

Principle 6.   The Regulator should have or contribute to a process to monitor, mitigate and manage systemic risk,
               appropriate to its mandate.

Description    The Korean authorities assess systemic risk using prescribed early warning thresholds and real time
               economic and market reports from the Watch Dog (KFIC). They also evaluate multiple risk indicators,
               including potential macro-indicators differentiated by sector known as “Handy Indicators of Financial
               Institutions”. Ten of these relate specifically to securities.
               Micro Factors: Bottom-up Analysis

               Micro-indicators under the RAMS applied to brokers, related systems for banks and insurers, and the
               Management Evaluation Regulatory Framework (MERF) complement the macro-level analysis. For the
               most part risk assessments and risk management rely on close monitoring of matters intrinsic to each
               sector rather than on analyzing interconnections. The following risk indicators provided by the FSS
               explain some of the factors evaluated on a daily basis and aggregated periodically.

               Macro Factors: Top-down Analysis

               Since July 2012, the Vice Minister of the MOSF, the Vice Chair of the FSC, the Deputy Governor of the
               FSS, the Deputy Governor of the BOK, and the Vice President of the KDIC have convened the MPFM (or
               Council) on an ad hoc basis. As needed, it considers the emerging macro-prudential issues that could
               become potential systemic issues, reviews channels for risk transmission and considers the potential



                                                                                                               55
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA



             impact of macro-prudential matters on financial stability, contagion among institutions and general
             economic health in the real sector. This group executed an MoU in September 2012, in which the
             participants agreed to share annual business and other periodic reports, including material event reports
             obtained as part of their regular operations. Various of the advisory committees described in Principle 4
             also provide input to the authorities’ assessment of systemic risks, including a specialist Macro-Prudential
             Risk Advisory Committee.

             An explicit macro-prudential function is also located within the FSS under the Senior Deputy Governor
             for Planning and Management. According to the information provided by the FSS it is designed to
             monitor systemic risks in the financial markets on a cross-sectoral basis. The mission did not find
             evidence that the processes of this function would be reflected in other affected departments, possibly
             because of the significant hierarchical divisions and siloed operations within the regulatory/supervisory
             structure.

             Triggers for Heightened Reporting and Stress Testing Across Sectors

             The FSS has also established early warning levels and identified key risk indicators for each financial
             sector. It reviews reports about financial institutions on daily, weekly, monthly and other periodic bases
             and undertakes scenario analysis and stress testing. The overall framework incorporates multiple special
             funds that can be tapped for injecting liquidity, for example Korea Securities Finance Corporation (KSFC),
             which is owned by financial institutions participating in the market, KRX and KSD. The KSFC holds
             customer cash deposits and engages in securities financing activities. The FSS also is developing a group
             of risk specialists, hiring experts with modeling and other risk management skills, and managing its
             employees in a way that by rotation they become acquainted with multiple parts of the overall financial
             system. Further, the use of structured debt and other financial instruments that can magnify
             interconnections between the sectors is relatively limited at this time, stringently managed from issuance
             to distribution, and not of the type of exotic instruments (e.g., CDO squared) with embedded leverage
             that multiplied risk in other jurisdictions. Also, leverage has been moderated under recent reforms and
             legislation permitting establishment of a CCP to address OTC clearing was approved in March 2013.

             Potentially Insufficient Regard to Securities-based Risks

             Nonetheless, there remains some indication that financial investment business entities may attempt to
             hide exposures and that the potential for risk to migrate from the securities sector to other sectors may
             be being undervalued. In fact, the mutual savings banks collapse is indicative that liquidity crises can
             become solvency crises. In this respect the authorities recently evaluated and limited securities
             companies’ access to the short term lending market (call market) to 25 percent of their capital and
             further reforms are pending. Fairly contemporaneously, with the view to limiting liquidity risks, the BOK
             Macro-Prudential Analysis Department conducted analysis, for example, of shadow banking and the
             exchange- traded fund (ETF) markets in Korea. Nonetheless, the existing micro-prudential inspection
             process appears extremely siloed considering the number of large, integrated financial groups and the
             advantage of having a single operational entity to manage financial institution inspections and
             supervision for all sectors.

Assessment   Broadly Implemented

Comments     The MOSF acknowledged that there might be liquidity risks in the system that could impact the financial
             sector adversely and expressed a concern about European and other exogenous risks. At the same time,
             it noted that its principal concerns were exchange rate stability (having a long memory for the Asian
             crisis), and the sustainability of the economic return on financial sector business for demographic and
             other reasons that might cause overall demand to decline. At all levels, the authorities were candid in
             stating their judgment that the likelihood that information generated through capital markets would be

               material to a debate on managing, monitoring and mitigating systemic and macro-prudential risks was
               remote.

               As the impact of risks generated from one part of the system on another part is difficult to predict
               reliably, the possibility that risks could emanate from the securities sector or that securities transactions
               could be used to disguise risks should be considered more seriously. It appears that insufficient work has
               been done to date on mapping interconnected risks, notwithstanding the advantage of the integrated
               structure for all financial institutions including banks, insurance companies and securities companies,
               around which Korean financial market supervision is organized. It is also possible that conduct risks in the
               securities and derivatives markets have not been factored sufficiently into discussions on systemic risk. As
               set forth under Principle 7, all these matters need to be assessed on a continuous basis. As the role of
               clearing is expanded to OTC products, and as new products are permitted and new trading and clearing
               links are agreed, the related risks should be evaluated and integrated with other risk management and
               contingency planning activities.

Principle 7.   The Regulator should have or contribute to a process to review the perimeter of regulation regularly.

Description    Defining the Perimeter

               The basic rule in Korea is that “fund raising” by any person must be conducted by either an authorized or
               an exempt entity, even if such entity is not specifically identified as a financial institution as a matter of
               law. The Act on the Regulation of Conducting Fund-Raising Business Without Permission of 2000 (as
               amended in 2010) makes it a criminal offence to conduct a fund-raising business without obtaining the
               appropriate authorization, which is punishable by imprisonment for up to five years and also by a fine of
               up to KRW 50 million. This Act also prohibits the use of a trade name similar to a financial business and
               advertisements related to such unauthorized business. See also Articles 11 and 17 of the FSCMA that
               prohibit engaging in an investment advisory business or a discretionary investment business without
               registration or other financial investment business without authorization.

               Evaluating the Perimeter

               The FSS has an internal process to evaluate ongoing supervisory performance. It undertakes an annual
               self-assessment or a 360 degree review process and requires the same of firms. The FSS Internal Audit
               function also provides feedback about the regulatory/supervisory processes. Additionally there is a
               process for the review of customer complaints relative to the market and to regulatory services that may
               surface unregulated activities that should be within the regulatory system, which in practice would be
               escalated for further review. The industry (KOFIA, the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and
               others), the various advisory committees, including the informal committees (see Principle 4), and the
               media may also bring issues about market evolutions to the attention of the authorities.

               Seeking Legislative and Regulatory Change

               The authorities have a robust ongoing process to seek change necessary to keep abreast of international
               developments. Through an active process to benchmark the FSS and FSC rules and procedures against
               other jurisdictions and international standards, Korea has successfully advanced the adoption of IFRS and
               ISAs (see Principles 18 and 21), obtained legislative approval of an OTC derivatives CCP, and augmented

               the process for oversight of auditing (Principle 19), credit rating agencies (Principle 22) and other
               evaluators (Principle 23).




                                                                                                                 57
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA



               Issue Identification

               Some examples of the bottom up process follow. The FSS examination teams make use of thematic
               examinations to determine what firms are doing and to test Korea’s exposure to misconduct occurring in
               other jurisdictions. Not only do these inspections and other supervisory activities result in
               recommendations or exception reports affecting individual regulated entities, but also they may cause
               more general guidance to be issued or discussions with the regulated community to be undertaken.
               Recently, the FSS discovered that the industry was selling loans of up to three years duration as
               commercial paper and also had designed other collective investment instruments using deposits to
               attempt to avoid certain regulatory requirements that pertain to collective investment schemes or other
               regulated instruments. The FSS in consequence issued guidance to constrain such activities. Staff of the
               FSS reports that they actively review new sales and product activity and are alert to emerging problems
               within their respective assigned areas, though the results of the overall assessment and performance
               review process may not be as widely distributed as optimal and internal silos may also prevent the
               optimal flow of information.

Assessment     Broadly Implemented

Comments       The authorities do have a bottom-up practice of identifying new areas of concern and a routine process
               for collecting information on market evolutions. However, the means by which results are disseminated
               and the way that the process feeds into policy responses to and from the top are not documented.
               Consideration should be given to documenting and refining the existing process for policing the
               perimeter, for escalating issues for further review, for developing policy related to that process, and for
               assuring that the efficiencies and information advantages of an integrated system of functional
               regulation are fully maximized and not adversely affected by silo thinking.

Principle 8.   The Regulator should seek to ensure that conflicts of interest and misalignment of incentives are
               avoided, eliminated, disclosed or otherwise managed.

Description    The legal requirements for financial investment business entities clearly specify the various requirements
               to prevent conflicts of interest. Financial investment business comprises:

                   Investment trading business;
                   Investment brokerage business;
                   Collective investment business;
                   Investment advisory business;
                   Discretionary investment business: and
                   Trust business.

               Both authorized and registered financial investment business entities must have a system for preventing
               conflicts of interest as a condition of initial approval (authorization and registration) and policies and
               procedures for applying this system as part of their ongoing operation. Each type of regulated entity
               must have a system for preventing conflicts “between the financial investment business entity and
               investors as well as between a specific investor and other investors,” as detailed by the relevant
               Enforcement Decree (FSCMA Articles 12(7) and 18(6)). If a firm uses investment solicitors that make
               investment recommendations as an equity raiser, the authorized entity must control/supervise its agent
               investment solicitors in good faith so that their activities do not undermine fair practices (FSCMA Articles
               51 and 52(4),(5)). Such solicitors cannot handle funds.

Specific Prohibitions

From the perspective of issuance and underwriting of securities, research analysts and functions within a
financial investment business entity cannot receive remuneration contingent on the success of any
underwriting, as such compensation arrangements are prohibited (FSCMA Article 71(3)). Therefore,
research compensation cannot be tied to sales. Additionally, an investment broker or trader is prohibited
from trading on its own account based on forecasts until 24 hours after they are released or from
providing special information to its clients between a contract for an IPO and the actual offering (Articles
71(2) and (4)). A financial investment business entity is required to explore the potential for conflicts
between itself (or between its businesses) and any investor and to either disclose the potential conflict,
not engage in the related business activity for that investor, or to erect an appropriate Chinese wall (see
Articles 44 and 45 FSCMA, related Enforcement Decree Article 31 et seq. and Regulations on Financial
Investment Business Chapter II, Article 2-21 and Chapter IV, Conduct of Business regarding investment
recommendations and supply of information to affiliated entities among other things).

Systems and Oversight

Within each financial investment business entity, the system for prevention of conflicts of interest must
be designed to detect, evaluate and manage conflicts of interest and be reflected in guidelines that are
reasonable and verifiable. The system must be tested by the financial investment business entity from
time to time and updated to reflect issues that arise in the course of carrying on the business and to
ensure that the potential for new types of conflicts is a matter of ongoing oversight.

Additional Provisions Affecting Specialist Entities

Major shareholders

Additional provisions apply to a major shareholder of a financial investment business entity. Such
shareholders are prohibited from exercising undue influence, obtaining special information, or otherwise
pursuing their own interests in conflict with the interest of the entity in which they hold shares (FSCMA
Article 35).

Self-Regulatory Organizations

Separate provisions also apply to SROs (see below) and separate SRO rules on conflicts of interest apply
to SRO members, which are required to have their own ethical standards. These standards establish
additional requirements for Chinese Walls and contacts between the corporate finance and the research
and analysis departments, including: (i) documentation and oversight by a compliance officer; (ii) the
exercise of appropriate due diligence; (iii) the general duty of loyalty; (iv) the prohibition of receipt of
gifts; and (v) the requirement to verify the reliability of research materials (see KOFIA conduct of business
standards or best practices). A list of financial analysts at each firm and information on their years of
experience, good standing, and any other affiliations is posted on the KOFIA website.

Credit Rating Agencies and Other Evaluators

There is also a full complement of requirements relative to credit rating agencies (CRAs) and to other
evaluators whose services have regulatory implications. These include bond rating companies (which are
affiliated with the CRAs) and other providers of evaluating services, such as fund rating agencies that rate
CIS performance (see related discussions under Principles 22 and 23). Auditors are also subject to conflict
of interest requirements (Principle 20).

                                             Principles for Self-Regulation

Principle 9.   Where the regulatory system makes use of Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) that exercise some
               direct oversight responsibility for their respective areas of competence, such SROs should be subject to
               the oversight of the Regulator and should observe standards of fairness and confidentiality when
               exercising powers and delegated responsibilities.

Description    The law provides for the following SROs:

                   The KRX at http://eng.krx.co.kr/m7/m7_2/m7_2_1/m7_2_1_1/UHPENG07002_01_01.html;
                   KOFIA at http://www.kofia.or.kr/kofia/index.cfm;, and
                   Korea Institute of Certified Public Accountants (KICPA) at global@kicpa.or.kr.

               Under the FSCMA, the FSC may delegate part of its authority to the KRX or KOFIA (Article 438) and may
               entrust part of its inspection responsibilities to the KRX and KOFIA (Article 419(8)). The FSC and SFC have
               delegated certain tasks and responsibilities to KICPA under the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies
               and CPA Act (see Principle 19).

               The KSD, owned 70.4 percent by the KRX, is also established with SRO responsibilities by statute. Article
               294 of the FSCMA provides for a corporation to serve as a central depository, pursuant to specificities set
               out by the Enforcement Decree, subject to inspection under Article 419, with the ability to adopt business
               rules (Articles 302 and 303) subject to submission of its rules and their amendments for the approval of
               the FSC (Article 305). The Board of Audit conducts financial audits of the KSD, and the MOSF has a role in
               the appointment and dismissal of any external auditor of the KSD.

               In fact, each SRO has particular self-regulatory functions, delegated functions and statutory functions and
               the FSS tailors its oversight to the SRO.

               Korea Financial Investment Association

               KOFIA, established by law as a membership organization (FSCMA Article 283) has 165 regular, 116
               associate and 20 special members representing respectively authorized (i) securities companies, futures
               companies, and collective investment business entities; (ii) providers of financial investment business
               activities within banks, financial holding companies, insurance companies, and advisors; and (iii) credit
               rating agencies, bond pricing agencies, CIS administration companies, and others. It conducts the
               following self-regulatory activities (Article 286):

                   Investor protection—determination of terms of standard account opening documents and review of
                    advertisements;
                   Registration of qualified individual professionals (in seven different categories);
                   Issuance of suitability and other business conduct and customer protection rules, such as
                    prohibition of cold calls;

              It also adopts regulations for its members. Currently its rulebook (best practices), which covers several
              areas of securities operations and proper conduct of business, totals 925 pages. Among other things the
              rules cover standard account opening requirements for different types of accounts (including futures
              accounts), ethics rules, internal control rules, and business conduct and suitability rules.

              KOFIA also registers OTC bond trades in its system, which provides a message board, chat rooms,
              quotations and yields for eight types of bonds and 51 reference points. It also operates the Freeboard
              unlisted equity market that is 99 percent retail (see Secondary Markets Principles).

              Korea Exchange

              The KRX is a stock company provided for by Article 373 of the FSCMA mostly owned by members. It
              operates the listed equity and bond market, the futures/derivatives market (formerly KOFEX), and the
              KOSDAQ (SME) market. By law, until the implementation of the pending changes, the KRX has a
              monopoly position for the trading of securities and derivatives through a central matching facility
              (FSCMA Article 386). It also conducts both real-time and batch market surveillance, undertakes initial
              investigations of market abuses, and sells market data. KRX’s rule books include operational rules,
              disclosure rules, pricing rules for block trades, prohibitions on members accepting contracts which
              appear to violate the market abuse provisions of the FSCMA, and requirements on settlements of
              accounts, contributions to the compensation fund and other matters. KRX has approximately 696 staff, of
              which 121 engage in self-regulatory market surveillance and member supervision. It also conducts other
              self-regulatory activities, such as listings and review of compliance with the requirements for timely, fair
              and periodic disclosures (to which 100 staff are committed), regulation of the exchange operations, and
              the detection, deterrence, and disciplinary action relative to aberrant activity in the markets that it
              operates.

              The governance of the market supervision function of the exchange is set by law. The KRX must have a
              Market Supervision Committee (Commission)13, whose Chairman is appointed by the general meeting of
              shareholders of the KRX (FSCMA Article 402). The membership of the Market Supervision Committee
              must include two persons recommended by the Chairman of the FSC and two persons recommended by
              KOFIA. Members of the Committee are appointed for a fixed term of three years. The Market Supervision
              Committee is responsible for market surveillance, supervision of members, cross market surveillance
              between the cash and derivatives markets, discipline of members, dispute resolution, and development
              and refinement of surveillance rules under applicable law (see e.g. Article 403). Committees for KOSPI
              and KOFEX that hear matters are chaired by the President of the exchange, two independent directors
              and one investment broker.

              Regulations for the KRX markets can be found at
              http://eng.krx.co.kr/m7/m7_1/m7_1_1/JHPENG07001_01.jsp. Per the KRX website, its membership of 94
              includes 57 firms of which seven are futures firms, 20 banks, 16 foreign branches and one national
              cooperative.

              The KRX conducts inspections for members’ compliance with market rules two times per year, and has
              brought multiple disciplinary actions. It does not however systematically publish the results of its
              disciplinary actions. The KRX reported that during the prior three years it conducted 565 investigations

            for unfair trading abuses, and concluded 112 disciplinary cases against members, and 70 cases against
            members’ employees.

            Korean Institute of Certified Public Accountants

            KICPA is provided for under Article 41 of the CPA Act. Membership by certified public accountants and
            audit firms and teams is compulsory. KICPA is a juristic person. It can establish rules of ethics and other
            matters pursuant to bylaws approved by the FSC. KICPA is responsible for registering CPAs pursuant to
            delegation from the FSC, taking minor disciplinary measures with respect to matters delegated by the
            FSC, setting and revising audit standards, subject to FSC approval, mediating disputes between CPAs and
            their clients, and providing training and guidance for its member CPAs as well as career development
            and continuing education opportunities. 40 hours of annual continuing education is required. KICPA has
            16,000 members, of which 10,000 are registered as individual CPAs. There are 125 audit firms, 32 of
            which are supervised by the FSS and the remainder of which are subject to oversight by KICPA (see
            Principles 19-21).

            Oversight by Financial Supervisory Service

            Articles 292 and 410 of the FSCMA permit the FSS to oversee the self-regulatory activities of KOFIA and
            KRX and to monitor any regulatory delegation or services undertaken on its behalf. In this regard the FSS
            can inspect KOFIA and KRX and does so biennially. The FSS also can require KOFIA and KRX to submit
            rules or rule changes for information and/or approval and to file such reports and respond to such
            inquiries related to its business operations and property as the FSS or FTC may require (see e.g., Article
            412). These oversight powers also apply to the KSD (see, for example, Article 305). The FSS conducted full
            scope on-site reviews of KRX in 2008 and 2010 and of KOFIA in 2009 and 2011. Each review resulted in
            exception reports, management recommendations and requests for improvement. Although the FSC
            delegates various matters to the SROs (for example the oversight of derivatives position limits), the FSC
            and SFC retain full authority to address market abuse and other matters directly and have greater
            authority to sanction the employees of member firms and their customers than do KRX and KOFIA.

            Oversight by the Fair Trade Commission

            The Fair Trade Commission also has a limited role to prevent anti-competitive conduct by the SROs. This
            may include review of their contract terms and pricing conduct.

            Governance and Ethical Conduct

            The FSCMA sets forth the required governance structure of the KRX, and the terms of service of the
            directors. The law requires that more than one-half of the directors of the KRX be outside directors (that
            is independent directors) as defined by law (Articles 380 and 381). The law further requires, among other
            things, the formation of a Market Supervision Committee that is accountable for market surveillance,
            including cross-sectoral surveillance, investigation of abnormal trading activity and supervision of
            members (Article 402).

            All the SROs and their executives and employees must maintain and adhere to standards of professional
            conduct. They are also subject by law to a prohibition on the use or disclosure of information obtained in
            the course of performing their self-regulatory responsibilities except as consistent with those duties (see
            Principle 10). Executives and employees must also restrict their trading and business activities and adhere
            to guidelines and procedures in connection with trading financial instruments and to prevent any unfair
            conduct or conflicts of interest (see FSCMA Articles 402, 63, and 383).

Assessment    Fully Implemented

Comments      The numbers of members in each category of membership and their current status should be clarified on
              the public website of each SRO and more systematic information should be available on exchange
              disciplinary actions. Additionally more information should be available as to what oversight is provided
              to the operation of the KOFIA Freeboard and OTC bond trading systems.

                              Principles for the Enforcement of Securities Regulation

Principle 10. The regulator should have comprehensive inspection, investigation and surveillance powers.

Description   Since Principle 10 focuses on the powers of the regulator in relation to inspections and investigations of
              regulated entities, the following discussion focuses on the powers of the FSS. The powers of the SFC and
              FSC are discussed in more detail under Principles 11 and 12, since they play a bigger role vis-à-vis other
              persons than regulated entities and have also a more significant role in deciding on the enforcement
              measures to be taken, whereas the FSS is solely in charge of inspections of regulated entities.

              Financial Supervisory Service Inspection Powers

              Under Articles 37 and 38 of the AEFSC and Article 419 of the FSCMA, the Governor of the FSS is required
              to perform the inspection of the status of the business and property of financial institutions subject to
              the FSS’ inspections. Upon completion of an inspection, the Governor of the FSS is required to submit a
              report to the FSC. If there is any violation of the FSCMA or an order or disposition issued or made
              pursuant to it, his written opinion on the measures against such a violation has to be attached to the
              report submitted to the FSC.

              The FSC may determine the methods and procedures for inspection, the standards for measures for the
              results of inspection, and other matters relating to inspection work (Article 419(9) FSCMA). These are
              stipulated in the Regulations on Examination and Sanctions against Financial Institutions. The FSC also
              provides additional informal guidance to the FSS on how to conduct inspections in e.g. regular meetings.

              In practice the FSS refers to inspections as examinations and, in its capital market area, has established a
              Financial Investment Examination Department that is responsible for conducting the examinations of all
              financial institutions that fall under the responsibility of the capital market area of the FSS. Examinations
              may be either general examinations or partial examinations and may be conducted either on—site or
              through documentary examination (Articles 8 and 8-2 of the Regulations on Examination and Sanctions
              against Financial Institutions).

              Where an on-site examination is conducted, the financial institution concerned has to be given a prior
              written notice of examination including its purpose and period no later than one week before the
              commencement of the examination. This does not apply to any of the following cases where the
              achievement of the purpose of the examination is likely to be difficult if prior notice is given:

                  Where the achievement of the purpose of the examination is expected to be significantly affected
                   by the possibility of forgery or destruction of data, books, documents, etc., or concealment of
                   property of large shareholders;
                  Where significant adverse effects on financial markets are likely to be caused, such as incurring of
                   serious worries of investors and depositors, if the fact of conducting an examination becomes
                   known;
                  Where any extenuating circumstances arise due to lack of time for prior notice on account of




                                                                                                                63
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



                  checking of urgent pending matters, etc.; and
                 Other cases where the achievement of the purpose of the examination is likely to be difficult, as
                  determined by the Governor.

             In practice, prior notice is almost always given for on-site examinations, whereas documentary
             examinations are carried out without prior notice. On-site examinations without prior notice can take
             place with the approval of the Heads of the FSS Examination Departments. According to the FSS, this
             possibility has been used in multiple instances in the past.

             Financial Supervisory Service Powers to Obtain Books, Records, and Data from Regulated Entities

             When the FSS Governor deems it necessary, he may request any financial institution subject to the FSS’
             examination under Article 38 of the AEFSC or any other Act or subordinate statute to submit a report or
             data about its business affairs or property, or may require a person involved to appear before the FSS to
             make an oral statement (Article 40 AEFSC and Article 419 FSCMA). Article 9 of the Regulations on
             Examination and Sanctions Against Financial Institutions further specifies this power by noting that the
             Governor of the FSS may also require affidavits, testimonies, or books and other documents of relevant
             persons or parties pursuant to the FSCMA and other relevant statutes.

             The Governor of the FSS is also expected to make efforts for early detection of potentially problematic
             financial institutions or weak areas through off-site supervision of financial institutions (Article 7
             Regulations on Examination and Sanctions against Financial Institutions).

             Korea Exchange and Financial Supervisory Service Surveillance Powers

             The frontline responsibility for market surveillance lies with the KRX. One of the duties that it is required
             to perform under Article 377 of the FSCMA is surveillance of abnormalities in trading, including abnormal
             fluctuation of prices or volumes of securities or exchange-traded derivatives. According to Article 402 of
             the FSCMA, the KRX is required to establish a Market Supervision Committee in order to conduct market
             surveillance, investigation of abnormal trading and supervision of members; cross-market surveillance
             across KOSPI, KOSDAQ, and the derivatives market; and discipline of members or decisions on the
             requests for disciplinary measures against executives or employees concerned (see Principles 9 and 36).
             These matters have to be addressed in the Market Surveillance Regulations of the KRX to be established
             by the Market Supervision Committee.

             Upon completing an investigation or inspection, the market surveillance staff of the KRX submits to the
             KRX Market Supervision Committee14 a written report on the outcomes. When becoming aware of a case
             violating the FSCMA, the Market Oversight Commission is required to notify such a case to the FSC (§20
             of the Market Oversight Regulation of the KRX). In practice the KRX market surveillance staff copies the
             relevant FSS staff to these notifications to the FSC.

             In addition to the frontline responsibility of the KRX in market surveillance, the Capital Market
             Investigation Department 1 of the FSS has a Market Monitoring Team that monitors the market activities.
             The KRX has provided the FSS with real-time access to the KRX trading system. However, the FSS does
             not have any electronic market surveillance system, and it analyzes trading on a batch basis. The Market

 Monitoring Team feeds its observations to the other teams in the Market Investigation Department so
that a decision can be made on whether there is a need to initiate an investigation.

Requirements for Record-keeping and Determination of Client Identity

According to Article 60 of the FSCMA a financial investment business entity is required to keep and
maintain records of data related to the operation of its business. This requirement is further specified in
Article 62 of the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA for various types of records (e.g. operations, finance,
business affairs, and internal controls), with minimum record retention periods ranging from three to ten
years.

The record-keeping requirements include the following specific requirements for transactions made on
behalf of clients:

    Data related to investors' trading of financial investment instruments, including records and details
     of trading orders, and other data related to trading: ten years;
    Data related to management of investors' property, such as the collective investment property, the
     discretionary investment property, and the trust property: ten years; and
    Data related to contracts signed with investors, including creation of and agreement on trading
     accounts: ten years.
Further, pursuant to Article 4-13 and Table 12 of the Regulations on Financial Investment Business, every
financial investment business entity is required to maintain (i) records of property deposited and
withdrawn by investors for five years; (ii) records of safekeeping of property deposited by investors for
five years; (iii) records of each investor’s orders for ten years; and iv) records of each investor’s
transactions for ten years.

The records have to kept in the form of writing, electronic data, micro film, or similar.

According to the FSS, it has the authority to have access to the identity of all clients of regulated entities
pursuant to Article 6 of the Regulations on Examination and Sanctions against Financial Institutions,
according to which an examiner, when necessary for performing his/her examination duties, may take the
following measures:

    Request for submission of certificates, confirmations, opinions, answers to inquiries, and other
     relevant documents and objects;

    Sealing of safes, books, objects and other storage places;

    Request for the appearance and statements of a relevant person of the financial institution
     concerned; and
    Other measures deemed necessary for the examination.

Outsourcing of Inspections to Self-Regulatory Organizations

The Governor of the FSS may delegate part of the examination work that he is required to undertake to
the KRX or KOFIA (Article 419(8) FSCMA). The examinations that the Governor may delegate to KOFIA
relate to examinations on investment solicitors, self-regulatory requirements on underwriting of
securities, and compliance with the terms and conditions of standardized contracts (Article 372(1)




                                                                                                 65
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA



                Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA). In practice KOFIA also conducts branch examinations on behalf of
                the FSS.

                KOFIA is required to observe the guidelines prescribed by the Governor of the FSS for the method,
                procedure, etc. for an examination carried out by it. It must report the results of its examinations to the
                FSS Governor without delay upon completion of the examination.

                Article 14 of the Regulations on Devolution and Entrustment of Administrative Competence requires that
                the government or a government related entity conducts proper supervision of the delegate and
                provides instructions to it. According to Article 292 of the FSCMA, KOFIA receives examinations
                conducted by the Governor of the FSS. The examination powers of the FSS and the requirement for it to
                report the results of its examinations to the FSC provided in Article 419 of the FSCMA apply also to the
                examinations of KOFIA.

                Pursuant to Article 372(3) of the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA and Article 16-2 of the Regulations
                on Devolution and Entrustment of Administrative Competence, the Governor of the FSS may order KOFIA
                to take corrective measures and/or impose disciplinary actions on its executives or employees. He can
                also terminate the delegation, if KOFIA’s performance is improper or conflicts with relevant laws and/or
                regulations (Article 14-3).

                The KRX self-regulatory functions are defined in Article 402 of the FSCMA. The KRX may examine
                business, financial status, books, documents, and other materials related to the members and request a
                financial investment business entity (limited to a broker or dealer that provides financial investment
                services for securities or exchange-traded derivatives) to submit relevant data after specifying the
                reasons in writing. This may be done in order to identify trading circumstances of securities or exchange-
                traded derivatives in cases where abnormal trading on the securities or derivatives market is suspected,
                or in order to ensure that members comply with the Business Regulations of the KRX (Article 404(1)
                FSCMA).

                According to Article 410 of the FSCMA, the FSC may, if necessary for the protection of investors or sound
                trade practice, order the KRX to submit reports or references related to its business and property, and
                have the Governor of the FSS inspect the business, financial status, books, documents, or other materials
                related to the KRX.

                The prohibition on the use of job-related information applies also to KOFIA. More specifically, it is not
                allowed to use information known to it in the course of its business and undisclosed to the public for its
                own or a third party’s interest without a justifiable ground (Articles 54 and 289 FSCMA). With regards to
                the KRX, similar confidentiality requirements apply. According to Article 402(7) of the FSCMA, any person
                who serves, or has served, as a member of the KRX Market Supervision Committee is prohibited from
                using or divulging any confidential information in connection with its duties.

Assessment      Fully Implemented

Comments        The FSS, KRX and KOFIA have sufficient examination, investigation and surveillance powers vis-à-vis
                regulated entities. The regulators’ investigative and enforcement powers applicable to other persons
                than regulated entities are discussed under Principles 11 and 12. Principle 12 also discusses the
                effectiveness of the use of the examination, investigation and surveillance powers that the FSS and the
                SROs have.

Principle 11.   The regulator should have comprehensive enforcement powers.

Description     Power to Require Records, Statements, and Testimony

                                                                               REPUBLIC OF KOREA



The powers of the FSS to require records, statements, affidavits, testimonies, books or other documents
are covered in Principle 10 above. On the basis of Article 419 of the FSCMA, its powers to require records
and statements appear to extend beyond regulated entities. However, both the FSC and FSS are of the
view that the FSS does not have powers vis-à-vis other than regulated entities, their executives and
employees.

The FSC may, if there is a violation of the FSCMA or an order or disposition issued or made pursuant to
it, or if it is deemed necessary for protecting investors or maintaining sound trade practice, order any
person concerned to submit a report or materials for reference (Article 426(1) FSCMA). This power is
provided to the SFC in case the violation relates to the unfair trading provisions of Articles 172–174, 176,
178, and 180. The FSC and SFC may also demand any person concerned to submit a statement on the
facts and status of the case under investigation; attend as witness for a case under investigation; or
submit account books, documents, and other materials necessary for the investigation (Article 426(2)). A
person who does not comply with a demand made by the FSC or SFC is subject to imprisonment for not
more than three years or to a fine not exceeding KRW 100 million. These powers have been delegated to
the FSS under the delegations in Attachment 20 of the Enforcement Decree of the FSC.

In addition, under Article 427 of the FSCMA, the SFC may, if deemed necessary for investigating a
violation of any provision falling under its area of responsibility, assign investigative officials among
those who work for the FSC to interrogate the suspect involved in such a violation, seize goods, or search
a place of business, etc. Whenever they conduct a seizure or search for investigating a violation, the
officials are required to carry a warrant for seizure and search issued by a judge upon a public prosecutor
office's request.

However, according to the FSC staff the above powers have not been exercised in practice for several
reasons, including the fact that unfair trading cases have historically been addressed as criminal cases in
Korea, the FSC and SFC do not have sufficient resources and expertise to exercise the powers, and they
would in the end need to refer the cases to the public prosecutor’s office anyway for criminal
prosecution.

Power to Take Administrative Measures

The FSC and SFC have the power to take various administrative measures in certain cases specified in the
FSCMA. Taking some of these measures has been delegated to the FSS.
Regulated entities

In case of certain breaches specified in the FSCMA, the FSC can take the following measures in relation to
regulated entities (see e.g., Article 420 of the FSCMA):

    Revoke authorization or registration;
    Suspend the business entirely or partially for up to six months;
    Order to transfer contracts;
    Order to correct or discontinue violation;
    Order to publicly disclose or notify the fact that the entity has become subject to a measure due to
     its violation;
    Issue an institutional warning;
    Issue an institutional caution; or




                                                                                                67
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



                 Take any of the measures specified in Article 373(5) of the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA as
                  necessary, including closing the branch offices or other sales offices or suspending their business
                  completely or partially; demanding or recommending improvement of methods of business
                  management or operation; demanding compensation for losses; filing criminal complaints or
                  informing an investigative agency of violations of the FSCMA; or informing a related agency or an
                  investigative agency of violations of other Acts.

             Issuing an institutional warning and caution as well as demanding or recommending improvement of
             methods of business management or operation and demanding compensation for losses has been
             delegated to the FSS.

             The FSC has a limited possibility to impose civil money penalties15 on financial investment business
             entities under Article 428 of the FSCMA. A civil money penalty of 20 percent of the violated amount may
             be imposed in case of a breach of the prohibitions on cross-ownership and related party lending
             included in Article 34(1) of the FSCMA. The FSC may also impose a civil money penalty on a financial
             investment business entity in lieu of a business suspension within the limit of the benefits of a period of
             suspension of business. These civil money penalties can be imposed only when the breach has been
             intentional or grossly negligent.

             In addition, the FSC can issue a fine for negligence not exceeding KRW 50 million in the case of violations
             of certain specific provisions of the FSCMA (Article 449 FSCMA).

             Executives of regulated entities

             The FSC has the possibility to take the following measures against executives of a regulated entity (see
             e.g. Article 422(1) FSCMA):

                 Request for dismissal;
                 Suspension from office for up to six months;
                 Disciplinary warning;
                 Warning;
                 Caution; or
                 Other measures specified in Article 374(2) of the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA, including filing
                  criminal complaints or informing an investigative agency of violations of the FSCMA or informing a
                  related agency of violations of other Acts.

             Making a request for dismissal and issuing a warning or caution to an executive has been delegated to
             the FSS.

             Employees of regulated entities

             In relation to employees of regulated entities, the FSC may demand the regulated entity to take any of
             the following measures against any of its employees (see e.g. Article 422(2) FSCMA):



15
  The FSCMA and its Enforcement Decree use the term penalty surcharge whereas the Regulations on Examination
and Sanctions against Financial Institutions use the term civil money penalty that is used in this report.

                                                                               REPUBLIC OF KOREA



    Removal from office;
    Suspension from office for six months or less;
    Salary reduction;
    Reprimand;
    Warning;
    Caution; or
    Other measures specified in Article 374(2) of the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA (see item 6
     above for executives).

All the above measures except those noted in items 1 and 7 have been delegated to the FSS.

Breach of disclosure obligations

With regards to the breach of the public disclosure obligations, the FSC may demand the issuer, seller,
underwriter, or other relevant party to restate the disclosed facts; suspend or prohibit the issuance,
public offering or sale or any other transaction of such securities; or take any of the measures prescribed
in the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA, if necessary (see e.g. Article 132 of the FSCMA and Article 138
of the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA). The latter measures can consist of imposing restrictions on
the issuance of securities within the limit of one year; recommending the dismissal of executives; filing
criminal complaints or informing a competent investigative agency of violations of the FSCMA; informing
a related agency or an investigative agency of violations of any other Act; or issuing warnings or
cautions. Similar measures apply in case of a failure to notify the acquisition of at least 5 percent of the
stocks or other equity securities of a stock-listed corporation (see Principle 17).

The FSC may also impose a civil money penalty within the limit of 3 percent of the value of the public
offering or sale or tender offer (with a maximum of KRW 2 billion) in case a person does not comply with
the relevant disclosure obligations (Article 429 FSCMA). Similarly, if a corporation breaches the
obligations relating to the submission of a business report, the FSC may impose a civil money penalty
within the limit of 10 percent of the average daily trading amount of the corporation’s stocks during the
immediately preceding business year (with a maximum of KRW 2 billion). As noted above, these civil
money penalties can be imposed only when the breach has been intentional or grossly negligent. In
addition, as in the case of regulated entities, the FSC can issue a fine for negligence not exceeding KRW
50 million in the case of violations of certain specific provisions of the FSCMA (Article 449 FSCMA).

The FSC has delegated the authority to take measures against breaches of disclosure obligations to the
SFC except for civil money penalties above KRW 500 million, business suspensions in whole for one
month or longer, and closure of branch offices or other sales offices (Article 387(2) Enforcement Decree
of the FSCMA). Issuing warnings or cautions has been delegated to the FSS.

Unfair trading

In the unfair trading cases covered in Article 174 (insider trading), 176 (market manipulation), and 178
(other types of unfair trading) of the FSCMA, the SFC may issue an order to correct or take other
measures prescribed in Article 376 of the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA. In case of regulated
entities, their executives and employees, the above measures would apply. In case of other persons, the
SFC can issue a caution or warning, file a criminal complaint, inform an investigative agency of a violation
of the FSCMA, or inform a related agency or an investigative agency of violations of other acts (Article
376(1) (11) Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA).



                                                                                                69
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



            In addition, under Article 172 of the FSCMA, if an executive, employee, or a significant shareholder of a
            stock-listed corporation derives profit by purchasing the securities and then selling them within six
            months or by selling the securities and then purchasing them within six months, the corporation may
            require them to return the short-swing profit to the corporation. If the SFC discovers an accrual of short-
            swing profits, it is required to notify the relevant corporation. This obligation has been delegated to the
            FSS.

            Accounting and auditing

            The administrative measures that can be taken against auditors and CPAs are described in Principle 19
            below.

            Power to Seek Court or Judicial Orders or Refer Matters to Civil Proceedings

            The FSC or FSS do not have the power to seek court or judicial orders. Civil proceedings are not used by
            public authorities in Korea.

            Power to Initiate Criminal Proceedings or Impose Criminal Sanctions

            The FSC, SFC and FSS do not have the power to initiate criminal proceedings, but the FSC (and in the
            case or Articles 172–174, 176, and 178 the SFC) can refer matters to the public prosecutor’s office. These
            referrals are made either as charges or notifications, where the former are officially registered as criminal
            cases upon receipt, whereas the latter are registered as criminal cases only after the investigation has
            been started. As part of its investigation of the cases, the public prosecutor’s office can use the powers
            available to it under the Act on Criminal Litigation Procedures to seize and search documents and to
            compel statements.

            Criminal sanctions are imposed by courts. The penal provisions relevant to the scope of the IOSCO
            assessment are in the FSCMA (Articles 443–449), the Act on the External Audit of Stock Companies
            (Articles 19–21) and the CPA Act (Articles 53–54). In the FSCMA, the violations are included in several
            different categories, with the theoretical maximum penalty of imprisonment for life or for no less than
            five years or a fine not exceeding an amount equivalent to three times the profit accrued or the loss
            avoided by the violation applying to certain unfair trading cases where the profit gained or loss avoided
            is KRW 5 billion or more. For a violation conducted by a regulated entity or person subject to the
            disclosure obligations, the theoretical maximum penalty would be imprisonment for not more than five
            years or a fine not exceeding KRW 200 million.
            Power to Order Suspension of Trading

            The FSC may, if it finds that transactions of securities cannot be normally made because of a natural
            disaster, warfare, disturbance, sudden and significant change in economic conditions or other similar
            incidents, alter the opening hours of the KRX, suspend transactions or temporarily close the securities
            market, or take other necessary measures. The FSS does not have a power to suspend trading.

            The Securities Market Business Regulation of the KRX has to prescribe, among other things, matters
            regarding the suspension or temporary closing of the securities market (Article 393 FSCMA). On the basis
            of §25 of the KOSPI Market Business Regulation, the KRX may suspend trading of all issues in the market,
            when the KOSPI has declined by 10 percent or more from the previous day's closing value and such
            situation persists for one minute. The KRX must resume trading after twenty minutes have elapsed since
            the suspension of trading. In addition, the KRX may suspend trading in the case of a failure or expected
            failure of its computer system due to the excessive influx of quotations for specific issues.

                The KRX also has the power to order suspension of trading in individual securities in circumstances
                prescribed in §95 of the KOSPI Market Listing Regulation.

                Private Rights of Action

                The FSCMA includes several provisions on the liability for damages by e.g. the financial investment
                business entities and other persons that have breached the requirements of the FSCMA. Investors can
                also seek civil remedies. A class action is also possible in Korea, but it is rarely used.

                Cooperation between Authorities

                The FSS, SFC and FSC can share information obtained in their investigations between themselves and
                with the public prosecutor’s office. The arrangements with the public prosecutor’s office are not formal,
                but exchange of information takes place on a regular basis in the connection of investigations.

Assessment      Broadly Implemented

Comments        Taken as a whole, the FSC, SFC and FSS (under delegation from the FSC or SFC) have the powers to
                obtain most information, records and statements essential for effective enforcement of securities laws
                from any regulated entity or any other person. The powers of the FSS are more limited, and the FSC’s
                and SFC’s exercise of powers is subject to resource constraints. However, Principle 11 does not require
                that all such powers are vested on the securities regulator, as long as another competent authority in the
                jurisdiction is able to obtain the information required. In Korea, the public prosecutor’s office has such
                powers. The impact of this on the effectiveness of enforcement of securities laws is assessed under
                Principle 12.

                The powers of the FSC, SFC and FSS to impose administrative sanctions on regulated entities and their
                executives and employees include a range of measures from caution to cancelling a registration and
                removing a person from office. Persons subject to the disclosure requirements of the FSCMA can also be
                subject to some administrative sanctions of the FSC, SFC or FSS. The same applies to auditors and CPAs.
                Beyond the relatively harsh measures of cancelling or suspending a registration of a regulated entity, the
                administrative sanctions at the disposal of the FSC, SFC and FSS are not particularly dissuasive. There are
                no other administrative sanctions applicable to unfair trading cases than warning and caution, except if
                the violator is a regulated entity or its executive or employee. The ability of the FSC, SFC and FSS to issue
                pecuniary penalties is limited to specific cases, where the amount of the civil money penalty or fine is
                limited and does not necessarily reflect the economic benefit gained from violating the legal
                requirements. The FSS can refer matters to the criminal process through the SFC or FSC, where there is a
                broader range of sanctions available.

                On the basis of a general assessment of the Korean authorities’ enforcement powers, that although
                comprehensive, could benefit from additional variety and dissuasiveness, the Broadly Implemented
                rating has been assigned to this Principle.

Principle 12.   The regulatory system should ensure an effective and credible use of inspection, investigation,
                surveillance and enforcement powers and implementation of an effective compliance program.

Description     Types of Examinations of Regulated Entities

                The FSS conducts general and partial examinations in financial investment business entities (see Principle
                31), collective investment business entities (see Principle 24), credit rating agencies (see Principle 22),
                auditors (see Principle 19), and KRX and KOFIA (see Principles 9 and 33).




                                                                                                                 71
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



            Risk-based general examinations

            The process for selecting financial investment business entities for examination is described in more
            detail in Principle 31. As a general rule, the examination type (general vs. partial examination) and cycle
            vary depending on several factors such as the company’s capital position. Financial investment business
            entities categorized as large and medium-sized ones in terms of their capital are subject to general
            examinations every three years.

            The FSS performs a monthly assessment on each financial investment business entity’s risk volumes and
            risk management system using RAMS. This assessment is used in selecting companies for additional
            examinations.

            Periodic general examinations

            In contrast to financial investment business entities, the collective investment business entities are not
            subject to risk-based general examinations, i.e. RAMS is not used to support the selection of collective
            investment business entities for examination. Instead, the examination cycle varies primarily on the basis
            of assets under management (AUM) and is approximately six years for entities with AUM of KRW 2.5
            trillion or more and seven years or more for entities with AUM of less than KRW 2.5 trillion.

            CRAs and auditors are examined on a regular basis. Since there are only four CRAs, there are no
            particular criteria for determining the examination interval; instead all of them are examined every 3–4
            years (see Principle 22). In case of audit firms, the FSS audit quality review cycle differs between 2 and 5
            years depending on how many companies the firm audits (see Principle 19). The KICPA review cycle is
            longer, ranging from 5 years for audit firms to 7 years for audit teams.

            Partial examinations

            If FSS on-site examinations reveal specific issues or problems, the FSS may initiate a partial examination.
            The FSS may also conduct a partial examination based on the information it has obtained from consumer
            complaints or other sources. A thematic examination is a partial examination where the same topic is
            covered in several regulated entities.

            Effectiveness of Examinations

            The 69 financial investment business entities (securities and futures companies) have been subject to the
            following number of examinations in the past two years:

                                                On-Site Examinations 2011–2012

In 2012, the thematic examinations covered six themes, whereas in 2011 they encompassed three
themes. The total number of companies subject to at least one examination is lower than the number of
examinations since some companies were subject to more than one partial examination. The 2012
examinations related to trading with major shareholders and affiliated companies, adequacy of internal
business conduct requirements applicable to interns, short selling and arbitrage transactions conducted
by foreign investors, breaches of employees’ trading restrictions, compliance with mandatory depository
rate for repos, and providing collective management of advisory-type wrap accounts (prohibited under
the FSCMA). The focus of the 2011 thematic examinations was on conduct of business and internal
controls on derivatives products as well as adequacy of conduct of business in trading a particular
government security.

The 85 collective investment business entities have been subject to the following number of
examinations in the past three years:

In 2010–2012, the thematic examinations conducted in collective investment business entities included
the following themes: adequacy of execution of trust business entity’s requests; adequacy of disclosures
on exercising voting rights; internal controls and preventive measures for financial incidents; risk
management; adequacy of audit committee’s role; compliance with reporting requirements on the
reference price; and transactions with major shareholders and affiliated companies.

The examinations conducted in credit rating agencies, audit firms, and KRX and KOFIA are described in
the respective Principles.

Effectiveness of Market Surveillance

The KRX monitors trading on a real-time basis with an automated monitoring system. In 2009-2012, the
KRX referred almost 600 suspected unfair trading cases to the FSC (FSS) for further investigation. This
represented approximately 64 percent of all cases investigated by the FSS.

            In terms of the outcome of the cases, the majority of them have led to referrals to the public prosecutor’s
            office. 80 cases passed by the FSS to the FSC were dismissed without leading to any administrative
            sanction or referral to the criminal process.

            Accounting and auditing

            The enforcement cases arising from the audit oversight are addressed under Principle 19.

            Effectiveness of the Enforcement Process

            As the information provided in Principle 11 indicates, the division of responsibilities between the FSS, SFC
            and FSC in deciding on an enforcement action depends on the action proposed. The proposals are made
            by the FSS. Before its proposal is submitted to the SFC or FSC for decision making, the investigation
            report and proposed enforcement measures are discussed within the FSS. With regards to proposals for
            enforcement measures relating to regulated entities and their executives and employees, after
            departmental approval they are submitted to the Enforcement Review Office of the Planning &
            Management Support area of the FSS for opinion. After receiving this opinion, the cases are passed to
            the FSS Enforcement Review Committee for its opinion (with the exception of very minor measures that
            are not specifically referred to in the FSCMA, such as management attention and onsite action), after
            which they can be passed on to the FSC or SFC for decision unless the decision-making power has been
            delegated to the FSS.

            The FSS has to send unfair trading and disclosure cases to the SFC Committee for Deliberation on
            Investigation of Capital Markets for consultation before they can be passed to the SFC for decision-
            making. According to the information provided by the FSC, the FSC (rather than the SFC) also decides on
            the unfair trading cases that would lead to the more serious sanctions referred to above for disclosure
            cases. The authorities were not able to explain what this restriction on the SFC decision making power is
            based on, given that Article 426 of the FSCMA provides the SFC with the power to decide on measures to
            be taken in unfair trading cases without any limitations.

As noted above under Principle 11, the Korean authorities have in the past preferred passing the
investigation of unfair trading cases to the criminal authorities at an early stage of an investigation rather
than using all of the powers provided to them to compel information. One of the reasons mentioned by
the FSC was resource constraints at the FSC. However, the public prosecutor’s office has all the necessary
powers to conduct investigations, and as noted above in Principle 11, the IOSCO Assessment
Methodology does not require all the investigative powers to be vested on the securities regulator, as
long as the overall investigative and enforcement process remains effective.

To try to assess the effectiveness of the overall investigative and enforcement process involving both the
administrative and criminal authorities, the authorities were requested to provide data on the average
length of the various stages of the investigative and enforcement process. According to the FSC, due to
shortage of examination and investigation personnel at the KRX and FSS, the waiting period is significant
before an examination or investigation is actually launched. After that, it takes on average 382 days from
the examination by the KRX and investigation by the FSS of an unfair trading case to the decision by the
SFC. In disclosure cases, the average time has varied between 95 and 161 days in the past three years.
The time needed for the public prosecutor’s office to indict, where appropriate, varies depending on the
case and on the particular suspect to be indicted in cases where there are multiple suspects. On average,
this has taken between 260 and 364 days in the past five years.

Under the Criminal Procedure Act, only prosecutors can prosecute misconduct. After a prosecutor
presents the case in a criminal trial, a criminal sanction may be imposed by the criminal court. The Korean
authorities were not able to provide any specific information on the normal length of the court process
for cases covered by the scope of the IOSCO assessment and how many of the cases indicted in the past
three years have been concluded by courts. Neither were the FSC, SFC, FSS or the public prosecutor’s
office able to provide information on the number and nature of criminal sanctions given. The information
received from the Punishment Determination Committee of the Supreme Court indicates that the
criminal sanctions have primarily relied on conditional imprisonment sentences.

No similar information was available on fines, but anecdotal evidence suggests that at least in the most
significant cases they have been largely limited to the value of the illegally obtained profits.

The FSC, SFC and FSS do not receive information on the outcome of the criminal cases (including on the
indictment decisions of the public prosecutor’s office). This as such can be considered to potentially
undermine the effectiveness of the criminal enforcement process, which for the reasons noted above, is
the primary means of enforcing compliance with the unfair trading prohibitions of the FSCMA.

Adequacy of System to Receive and React to Market Intelligence

The FSS has a standardized procedure for dealing with investors’ complaints received by internet,
telephone, mail, and through in-person visits. Article 384 of the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA




                                                                                                  79

             includes the guidelines to be observed when informing the FSC or the SFC of violations of the FSCMA.
             The FSC and SFC have to process the information received within 60 days from the date of receipt,
             extendable by up to 30 days. The FSC and SFC are required to notify an informant of the results of the
             disposition related to the information. If the information received leads to detecting a violation of the
             FSCMA, the FSC and SFC may authorize the Governor of the FSS to pay a reward not exceeding KRW 100
             million to the informant.

             Requirements for Compliance Systems

             According to Article 28 of the FSCMA, each financial investment business entity is required to establish
             appropriate guidelines and procedures that must be complied with when its executives or employees
             perform their duties (internal control guidelines). A financial investment business entity must have one or
             more persons (compliance officers), who are responsible for monitoring compliance with the internal
             control guidelines, investigating violations of them, and reporting to the audit committee or the internal
             auditors. The FSS monitors compliance with the requirements on internal controls through off-site
             surveillance, and documentary or on-site examinations.

             The Market Supervision Committee of the KRX is required to establish market surveillance mechanisms
             to permit an audit of the execution and trading of all transactions made on the KRX.

Assessment   Partly Implemented

Comments     Although the FSS on-site examination program is fairly comprehensive, there appear to be some gaps in
             its coverage in particular in relation to smaller collective business entities that are subject to infrequent
             periodic or thematic examinations. For the smaller audit firms and audit teams, the FSS and KICPA on-
             site inspection cycle is also relatively long.

             The process of investigating, prosecuting and reaching a court decision on a suspected unfair trading
             case has taken a relatively long time. After the assessment mission, the Korean authorities informed that
             they are in the process of stepping up coordination to expedite the investigative and enforcement
             process, for example by setting up a joint task force between the FSS, FSC and Public Prosecutor’s Office.

             During the assessment mission, the FSC and SFC were not able to provide information on the outcome of
             the cases they had passed to the Public Prosecutor’s Office. This raised a question on the overall
             effectiveness of the enforcement of unfair trading cases and sufficiency of cooperation between the
             authorities involved. After the assessment mission, the authorities provided updated data on the number
             of cases referred to the Public Prosecutor’s Office. Compared to the information presented above, the
             number of cases referred in 2010–2012 that were still pending in early October 2013 had dropped from
             247 to 136, while the number of cases closed had risen from 223 to 334. Out of the 334 closed cases, 278
             had been indicted. The authorities were also able to provide previously unavailable preliminary data on
             the court process that indicates that, out of the 278 cases referred in 2010–12 and subsequently indicted
             by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, 54 cases were still pending at the courts. The data provided does not
             include information on the nature of criminal sanctions, and the available evidence on e.g., the probation
             rates still indicates a lack of dissuasiveness of the criminal sanctions.

             The authorities also informed that the FSS has set up on August 1, 2013 a specific team that follows up
             on and manages unfair trading cases that have been referred to the Public Prosecutor’s Office. This
             together with the increased ability of the authorities to systemically collect and analyze information on
             the enforcement cases are important steps forward in improving the effectiveness of the criminal
             enforcement process in Korea. The authorities are also encouraged to continue their efforts to ensure
             and improve the dissuasiveness of the criminal sanctions.

Principle 13. The regulator should have authority to share both public and non-public information with domestic and
              foreign counterparts.

Description   Domestic Information Sharing

              Financial Services Commission

              According to Article 65 of the AEFSC, when the Minister of Strategy and Finance, the FSC, and the
              Monetary Policy Committee of BOK deem it necessary to execute policies, any of them may request the
              others to share data. In such cases, an agency receiving a request is required to comply with it, except in
              extenuating circumstances.

              Further, when the FSC deems it necessary to enforce the AEFSC, it may request the head of a related
              administrative agency or any other institution or organization to conduct an examination, to provide
              necessary data, or to cooperate as necessary (Article 65-2 AEFSC).

              Financial Supervisory Service

              According to Article 58 of the AEFSC, the Governor of the FSS is required to present data necessary for
              financial supervision as requested by the FSC or SFC. Also, when the Governor completes an examination
              or takes disciplinary measures against executives or employees of financial institutions, he is required to
              report the results to the FSC (Article 59 AEFSC).

              The Governor of the FSS also has the right to request cooperation from an administrative agency or
              other related institution when he deems it necessary to perform his duties (Article 67 AEFSC). This
              provision is used e.g. to request information from the immigration authorities and Ministry of
              Administration in case of market abuse investigations.

              Under delegation from the FSC, the FSS also receives information from the SROs. According to Article
              426(4) of the FSCMA, the FSC may, if deemed necessary in conducting an investigation, demand the KRX
              to submit materials as may be necessary for the investigation. The KRX must notify the FSC, if it becomes
              aware of a suspected violation of the FSCMA or an order or disposition issued or made pursuant to the
              FSCMA as a result of its inquiry into an abnormal transaction or supervision over members. However, the
              FSS, SFC or FSC are not empowered to share confidential information with the KRX or KOFIA.

              The FSS also supports the public prosecutor’s office in the investigations of unfair trading cases and
              other violations of securities markets legislation by passing on all the information it gains in the course of
              its investigations to the Public Prosecutor’s Office through the SFC and FSC.

              No external approval is needed for information sharing between the FSC, SFC and FSS, or between them
              and the SROs and the Public Prosecutor’s Office.

              Foreign Information Sharing

              According to Article 437 of the FSCMA the FSC may exchange information with foreign financial

              176, 178, or 180 is violated) may cooperate in an investigation or examination upon receiving a request

              supervisory agency with materials relevant to the investigation or examination or receive such materials
              from it under the principle of reciprocity.

              The FSS has been delegated the power to register requests for sharing information from the foreign
              financial investment supervisory agencies and provide relevant information to them.

              Article 4 of the Act on Real Name Financial Transactions and Guarantee of Secrecy includes provisions on
              the guarantee of secrecy of financial transactions preventing a person working for a financial institution
              from providing or revealing transaction information to other persons unless certain exemptions prevail.
              One of these exemptions relates to the provision of transaction information necessary for the FSC or the
              Governor of the FSS to cooperate and exchange information with foreign financial investment
              supervisory agencies which perform work equivalent to that of the FSC or FSS.

              As noted above, the FSC, SFC and FSS can share information with foreign counterparts even if the alleged
              conduct would not constitute a breach of the Korean laws. The FSC and SFC can also make a decision on
              sharing information with foreign regulators without the government’s (such as the Ministry of Justice’s)
              permission.

              Unsolicited Information

              As a signatory to the IOSCO MMoU, the FSC is committed to making all reasonable efforts to provide,
              without prior request, the foreign authorities with any information that it considers is likely to be of
              assistance to them in securing compliance with the laws and regulations applicable in their jurisdiction.

              Beneficial Ownership and Bank Record Information

              The FSC and FSS can share with all relevant domestic and foreign counterparts’ information and records
              identifying the person or persons beneficially owning or controlling bank accounts related to securities
              and derivatives transactions and brokerage accounts as well as the necessary information to reconstruct
              a transaction, including bank records.

              Confidentiality

              According to Article 60 of the State Public Officials Act and Article 35(2) of the AEFSC, the officers and
              employees of the FSC and FSS are prohibited to disclose any information acquired in the course of
              performing their duties or using such information for any purpose other than their duties.

                                                   Principles for Issuers

Principle 16.   There should be full, accurate and timely disclosure of financial results, risk and other information that is
                material to investors’ decisions.

Description     In the following descriptions, as per Article 9(15) of the FSCMA, a listed corporation means a corporation
                that has issued securities listed on the securities exchange (e.g., KRX) and an unlisted corporation means
                a corporation other than a listed corporation. A stock-listed corporation is a corporation that has issued
                stock certificates listed on the securities exchange or stock certificates underlying securities depository
                receipts listed on the securities exchange. Finally, a stock-unlisted corporation means any corporation
                other than a stock-listed corporation, i.e. a corporation that has listed fixed income securities would be
                considered a stock-unlisted corporation.

Primary Market Disclosure Requirements

Primary market disclosure requirements apply to public offerings and sales. Public offering means the
invitation to at least 50 investors to make offers to acquire securities newly issued. Public sale means
inviting offers to purchase securities already issued from at least 50 investors (Article 9(7) and 9(9)
FSCMA). Conversely, a private placement means the invitation to acquire securities newly issued without
putting them on public offering (Article 9(8) FSCMA).

In calculating whether the fifty person threshold is exceeded, the number of persons who have been
invited to subscribe securities of the same class in any manner other than by public offering or sale
during the previous six months will be aggregated, excluding professional investors and related persons
of the issuer.

Requirement to file a registration statement

No securities can be publicly offered or sold, until a registration statement has been filed with the FSC
(delegated to the FSS), except in the following cases:

 Small offerings and sales, i.e. cases where the aggregate value of securities intended to be publicly offered or sold
and that of the securities already publicly offered or sold without filing a registration statement during the past
one year is below KRW 1 billion (Article 120(1) Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA);

    Issuance of national bonds, local government bonds, bonds issued by public institutions or special
     entities established directly pursuant to certain Acts specified in Article 119(1) of the Enforcement
     Decree of the FSCMA; and

    Issuance of other securities where investors are deemed to be properly protected through sufficient
     public disclosure in compliance with other Acts or in any other way, as specified in Article 119(2) of
     the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA (e.g. debt securities the payment of principal and interest of
     which is guaranteed by the State or a local government).

An issuer that makes a small public offering or sale of securities without filing a registration statement is
required to disclose certain matters concerning its financial status and take measures prescribed in
Article 137 of the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA to protect investors.

According to Article 120 of the FSCMA and Article 12 of the Enforcement Rule of the FSCMA, the
securities registration statement will be effective after the expiration of the following time periods,
beginning on the day on which it was submitted to the FSS.

                                                                     Stock-listed              Others

            Well-known, seasoned issuers and certain other issuers defined in Article 121 of the Enforcement Decree
            of the FSCMA can use shelf-registration. If its shelf-registration statement is accepted by the FSS, the
            issuer is not required to separately file a registration statement for multiple and similar kind of securities
            to be offered publicly during a particular period. In such a case, supplements to the issuer’s shelf-
            registration statement have to be submitted each time such securities are publicly offered or sold.

            Content of the registration statement

            The Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA (Article 125) includes the requirements for the descriptions to be
            included in a registration statement for other securities than collective investment schemes and asset-
            backed securities for which the relevant requirements are in Articles 127 and 128. The registration
            statement is comprised of two parts: matters concerning public offering and sale, and matters
            concerning the issuer.

            The matters concerning public offering or sale include, among others, the following:

                Details of rights to securities publicly offered or sold;
                Investment risks ensuing from the acquisition of securities publicly offered or sold;
                The underwriter's opinion on securities publicly offered or sold, where applicable; and
                Purpose of using the funds.

            The above requirements also apply to registration statements for asset-backed securities.

            The matters concerning the issuer include the following:

                An overview of the company;
                Details of business;
                Matters concerning financial affairs;
                An external auditor's audit opinion;
                Matters concerning the organization of the company, such as the board of directors, and affiliated
                 companies;
                Matters concerning shareholders;
                Matters concerning executives and employees;
                Details of transactions with interested parties; and
                Other matters specified and publicly notified by the FSC, as necessary for protecting investors.

            In addition, the following matters are required to be included for asset-backed securities:

            1.   Matters concerning the asset holder:

                 (a)   An overview of the asset holder;
                 (b)   Details of business;

2.   Matters concerning securitized assets:

     (a) A detailed list of securitized assets by type;
     (b) Details of evaluation of securitized assets; and
     (c) Methods of transfer of securitized assets and a detailed plan for transfer.

3.   Matters concerning the asset-backed securitization plan:

     (a)   The detailed structure of the asset-backed securitization plan;
     (b)   A plan for issuance and repayment of asset-backed securities;
     (c)   The asset manager and the method of management of assets; and
     (d)   A plan for borrowing and management of funds.

Requirement to file an investment prospectus

According to Article 123 of the FSCMA, when an issuer publicly offers or sells securities, it also has to file
an investment prospectus with the FSC on the day on which the relevant registration statement becomes
effective and make it available to the public at the issuer’s head office and branches, the FSS, the KRX,
and places where subscriptions can be made. An investment prospectus is not permitted to contain any
descriptions different from those included in the registration statement or omit any such description. A
description may be omitted from the registration statement and investment prospectus, if it is necessary
in consideration of the balance between confidentiality in corporate management and protection of
investors (Articles 123 and 129 FSCMA). Such description could relate to matters classified as military
secrets and matters confirmed by the FSC among those concerning the business affairs or operations of
the issuer (Articles 131(5) and 136 Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA). According to the FSS, the latter
refers to matters pertaining to business secrets of the issuer. Such descriptions may be omitted from the
investment prospectus and registration statement after confirmation by the FSC.

On the basis of Article120 of the FSCMA, the most recent audited financial information is required to be
attached to the registration statement for public offerings.

Regulatory review of the registration statement

As noted above, the FSS has a certain time period to review the registration statement before it becomes
effective. If a registration statement has not been prepared in conformity with the prescribed form, if
there is any false description or representation of a material fact, or if there is any omission, uncertain
description or representation of a material fact which might undermine reasonable investment decision
of investors or significantly mislead investors, the FSC may demand that the issuer presents the reasons
for it and submits a corrective registration statement with correct contents no later than the day before
the date set for offering to acquire or purchase the securities stated in the registration statement (Article
122 FSCMA). Filing a corrective registration statement restarts the time period at the end of which the
registration statement becomes effective.

According to the information provided by the FSS, it reviews all securities registration statements. 27 staff
members are involved in reviewing them and other disclosure documents in the Corporate Disclosure
Department, with 5 additional staff members in charge of reviewing the relevant registration statements
in the Derivatives, Trust, Structured Products and Pension Department. The number of securities
registration statements (including the ones for initial public offering) filed during the last three years and
the number of registration statements that the FSS required to be corrected are as follows:

            Advertising of public offering outside a prospectus

            According to Article 124(2) of the FSCMA, a person who intends to advertise a public offering or sale of
            securities required to be registered must use a short-form investment prospectus. A short-form
            investment prospectus refers to a document, an electronic document, or any other similar description or
            representation that omits a part of the mandatory descriptions of the investment prospectus or makes an
            abstract of the important descriptions. It has to be prepared in a manner prescribed in Article 134 of the
            Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA and published through an advertisement, notice, or leaflet via
            newspapers, broadcasting, magazines, or electronic transmission media, after the relevant registration
            statement has been accepted.

            Periodic Disclosure Requirements

            Annual business report and other periodic reports

            According to Article 159(1) of the FSCMA, stock-listed corporations and certain other corporations have
            to submit their annual business reports (accompanied by the consolidated financial statements) to the
            FSC and the KRX within ninety days of the closing of the business year. Article 167 of the Enforcement
            Decree of the FSCMA defines the other corporations as follows:

            1.   Issuers that have listed any of the following securities on the securities exchange:

                 (a) Equity securities other than stocks;
                 (b) Unsecured corporate bonds;
                 (c) Convertible bonds, bonds with warrant, participating bonds, or exchangeable bonds;
                 (d) Instruments representing preemptive rights to new stocks;
                 (e) Securities depository receipts (limited to securities depository receipts related to stocks or the
                     securities under items (a)-(d) above); and
                 (f) Derivative-combined securities.

            2.   Issuers that do not fall under item 1 but publicly offered or sold (excluding small offerings and sales)
                 any of the following securities:

                Stocks; and
                Securities falling under item 1 above.

            3.   Issuers that are corporations subject to external audit under Article 2 of the Act on External Audit of
                 Stock Companies, if the number of persons who hold securities of the issuer are at least 500 persons.

            The above requirements mean that all issuers that have made a public offering or sale or whose
            securities are listed are subject to the requirement to prepare an annual business report. The FSS
            adopted the XBRL disclosure system in its Data Analysis, Retrieval and Transfer (DART) system in October

2007, and requires listed companies to submit financial statements by using XBRL in their annual, half-
yearly and quarterly business reports. The disclosures are available also through the KRX Korea Investor’s
Network Disclosure (KIND) system.

The deadline for submitting consolidated financial statements is extended to 120 days for corporations
whose total assets are less than KRW 2 trillion as at the end of the latest business year and that do not
apply the K-IFRS (see Principle 18 for corporations required to apply the K-IFRS).

A business report must describe the purpose, trade name and details of business of the corporation, the
remuneration of executives, the matters concerning finance, and the following matters (Article 159(2)
FSCMA and Article 168(1) Enforcement Decree of the FCSMA):

    An overview of the company;
    Matters concerning the organization of the company, including the board of directors, and its
     affiliated companies;
    Matters concerning shareholders;
    Mattes concerning executives and employees;
    Details of transactions with major shareholders (including their specially related persons),
     executives, or employees of the company;
    Matters concerning financial affairs and annexed statements;
    The external auditor's audit opinion; and
    Other matters specified and publicly notified by the FSC as those of which it is necessary for
     investors to be informed.

A corporation obligated to submit an annual business report is required to submit a half-yearly report
and quarterly reports for three months and nine months both to the FSC and the KRX within 45 days of
the closing of each term, with an extension to 60 days in case of consolidated financial statements for the
first and second business years (Article 160 FSCMA). The FSC and the KRX are required to keep the
annual business reports and half-yearly and quarterly reports for three years and to disclose them to the
public.

The half-yearly and quarterly reports do not have to include an external auditor’s audit opinion. However,
the half-yearly report has to always include the external auditor’s review report. In the case of quarterly
reports, the external auditor’s review report is required for financial institutions subject to the FSS
examinations under Article 38 of the AEFSC and for stock-listed corporations whose total assets reached
or exceeded KRW 500 billion as at the end of the latest business year.

Disclosure of related party transactions is addressed in Articles 10(1) (1)–(5) of the Guidelines on
Corporate Disclosure Filings. If a company engages in direct and indirect transactions with credit risk;
asset transfers, exchanges, or gifts; or transactions in excess of certain threshold amount with a large
shareholder of the company, a person specially related to a large shareholder, or an executive or
employee of the company, it must disclose it in its annual business report and half-yearly and quarterly
reports.

In addition to the regulatory requirements, listed companies are subject to the detailed material event
disclosure requirements under the KRX regulations.

Shareholder voting decisions

Pursuant to Article 363 of the Commercial Act, when a company convenes a general meeting of
shareholders, it must give written notice or notice in electronic form to each shareholder at least two
weeks prior to the date set for such general meeting. There is no general requirement to disclose
shareholder voting decisions beyond the specific material event disclosure requirements highlighted
above.

Ways to ensure equal access to disclosures

According to Article 174 of the FSCMA certain persons becoming aware of material non-public
information of a corporation are prohibited from using such information in trading or any other
transaction involving specific securities, or allowing another person to use it. These persons include the
corporation itself (including its affiliated companies) and its executives, employees, agents and significant
shareholders. A person violating this prohibition will be liable for the damages sustained by a person
who makes any transaction in the relevant securities.

In addition, pursuant to Article 172 of the FSCMA, if a listed corporation’s executive, employee that is in a
position to acquire material non-public information, or a significant shareholder derives profit by
purchasing specific securities and then selling them within six months or by selling specific securities and
then purchasing them within six months, the corporation may require such person to return the profit to
it.
Regulatory review of material event disclosures

According to the information provided by the FSS, all material fact reports are reviewed by it. If the
review reveals that the report includes material misstatements or lacks material information, the issuer
may be required to make necessary changes and to file the report again.

Liability for Disclosures

According to Article 125 of the FSCMA and Article 135 of the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA, the
following persons are liable for damages inflicted upon any person as a result of acquiring securities, if a
false description or representation of any material fact has been included in a registration statement or
investment prospectus or a material fact has been omitted from them.

    The registrant of the relevant registration statement and directors of the issuer at the time of filing
     the registration statement;

             Cross-Border Matters

             The number of securities registration statements filed by foreign issuers with the FSC during the past
             three years is as follows. All of them were filed for initial public offering.

             According to Article 176(2) of the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA, foreign corporations may submit a
             business report within 120 days (instead of 90 days) of the closing of the business year, and may also
             submit a half-yearly or quarterly report within 60 days (instead of 45 days) of the closing of each term. In
             addition, if a foreign corporation has submitted any document equivalent to a business report to its
             home country, it may submit it along with a Korean translation within ten days (or five days in case of a
             report on material facts) from the day on which it submitted such a document. Foreign corporations are
             also subject to somewhat modified periodic and material event disclosure obligations.

Assessment   Fully Implemented

Comments     The Korean disclosure requirements are very prescriptive, in particular with regards to the material event
             disclosures. The views of market participants on the content of the current disclosure requirements were
             somewhat mixed. Some were of the view that despite some duplication in the statutory and KRX
             requirements, the compliance burden is acceptable given the underlying investor protection objective.
             However, others considered that there is already too much information, and it is difficult to filter the
             essential information.

             The prescriptive material event disclosure requirements are not necessarily the most effective manner to
             ensure that investors are best informed of all matters relevant to the price of the security. Even though
             compliant with the minimum requirement of the IOSCO Assessment Methodology, the following day
             deadline for material event disclosures is not in line with international best practice.

             The disclosures are made efficiently and transparently through the FSS DART and KRX KIND systems that
             are interlinked.

Principle 17.   Holders of securities in a company should be treated in a fair and equitable manner.

Description     Possibility to Issue Different Classes of Shares

                According to Article 344 of the Commercial Act, a company may issue different classes of shares which
                are different in respect of their particulars as to the dividends, distribution of surplus assets, exercise of
                voting rights at a general meeting of shareholders, repayment, conversion etc. In such cases, the articles
                of incorporation are required to provide the particulars of each class of shares. However, according to
                Article 369(1) of the Commercial Act, a shareholder will always have one vote for each common stock.

                Shareholders’ Meetings

                Voting on election of directors

                According to Article 382 of the Commercial Act, directors have to be elected at a general shareholders'
                meeting.

                On the basis of Article 382-2 of the Commercial Act, in case where a general meeting of a company is
                convened to elect at least two directors, shareholders who hold at least three percent of the total
                outstanding shares other than non-voting shares may request that the company elect directors by means
                of a concentrated vote, except as otherwise provided by the articles of incorporation. Such request hast
                to be made in writing at least seven days prior to the date set for the meeting. Each shareholder will then
                have voting rights per share in the same number as the number of directors to be elected, and the voting
                rights may be exercised by means of a concentrated vote for one or several candidates for directors.

                Voting on changes affecting the terms and conditions of securities

                According to Article 435 of the Commercial Act, if a company has issued different classes of shares and a
                certain class of shareholders is to be prejudiced by the amendment of the articles of incorporation, a
                resolution of a general meeting of such specific class of shareholders is required for effecting the
                amendment in addition to that of a general shareholders' meeting. Such resolution has to be adopted by
                the affirmative votes of at least 2/3 of the voting rights of the shareholders present at the general
                meeting and of at least 1/3 of the total outstanding shares of such class. The same applies where special
                provisions are to be made with regard to each class of shares in accordance with Article 344 and where
                the shareholders of certain class of shares are to be prejudiced by a division or merger of the company
                or a swap or transfer of shares (Article 436 Commercial Act).

                A resolution adopted by the affirmative votes of at least 2/3 of the voting rights of the shareholders
                present at the general meeting and of at least 1/3 of the total outstanding shares is sufficient to effect
                the following (Article 374 of the Commercial Act):

                    Transfer of the whole or a substantial part of the business of the company;
                    Takeover of the whole business of another company; and
                    Takeover of parts of business of another company which significantly affects the company's
                     business.

                According to Article 374-2 of the Commercial Act, a shareholder who dissents with the above mentioned
                decisions or has notified the company in writing of his intention of such dissent before the general
                shareholders' meeting may request the company in writing to purchase his shares. Such a request has to
                be made within twenty days after the resolution is adopted at the general meeting. Similar requirements




                                                                                                                   93

            apply to share exchanges and simplified share exchanges under Articles 360-3, 360-5 and 360-9 of the
            Commercial Act. The company is required to purchase the shares within two months after receiving the
            request. The purchase price of the shares will be determined through a negotiation between the
            shareholder and the company. Where the negotiation has not been concluded within 30 days since the
            receipt of the request, the company or the shareholder requesting the purchase of shares may request a
            court to determine the purchase price. Where the court makes a decision on the purchase price of
            shares, it has to compute it using the fair value of the assets of the company, taking into account other
            relevant matters.

            According to Article 363 of the Commercial Act the notice for convocation of a general meeting must be
            dispatched in writing or by an electronic document to each shareholder at least two weeks prior to the
            date set for the meeting. The written notice has to state the subject matters of the meeting. If the
            company has issued bearer share certificates, it has to give public notice stating its intention to hold a
            general meeting and the subject matters of the meeting at least three weeks prior to the meeting.

            Pursuant to Article 542 of the Commercial Act, if a listed company convenes a general meeting of
            shareholders, it may give public notice to shareholders who own stocks not exceeding 1 percent in two
            or more daily newspapers on two or more occasions or by disclosing such information in the DART
            system.

            Use of proxies or voting instructions

            According to Article 152 of the FSCMA, a person who intends to solicit a person to exercise voting rights
            by proxy (a proxy solicitor) has to deliver a proxy form and reference documents to the solicited voting
            right holder. The proxy form has to be prepared in such a manner as to allow each solicited voting right
            holder to express whether he/she approves or not each item on the agenda of the general meeting of
            shareholders. No proxy solicitor may exercise a voting right in contravention of the solicited voting right
            holder's intention expressed on the proxy form.

            Ownership Registration and Right of Transfer

            Article 396 of the Commercial Act requires the directors to keep the register of shareholders and the
            register of bonds at the principal office of the company. If there is a transfer agent, the register of
            shareholders or duplicates of it may be kept in the business office of the transfer agent. The following
            information on registered shares has to be entered in the register of shareholders (Article 352
            Commercial Act):

                The name and address of each shareholder;
                The classes and number of shares held by each shareholder;
                The serial number of share certificates when such certificates have been issued for shares held by
                 each shareholder; and
                The date of acquisition of each share.

            If bearer share certificates are issued, the register of shareholders has to state the class, number, serial
            number, and issuance date of such certificates.

According to Article 335 of the Commercial Act, shares are required to be transferrable to other persons.
However, the articles of incorporation of a company may subject the transfer of shares to the approval of
the board of directors.

Shareholder Rights for Dividends

As noted above, a company may issue two or more classes of shares that are different in respect to,
among other things, dividends. The articles of incorporation have to provide for the particulars of each
class of shares.

Shareholder Rights in Bankruptcy or Insolvency

As noted above, the share classes can also be different with respect to the distribution of surplus assets
in the case of a bankruptcy or insolvency.

Accountability of the Company, its Directors, and Senior Management

Article 402 of the Commercial Act provides that if a director commits an act in contravention of the
relevant acts, subordinate statutes or the articles of incorporation and the act is likely to cause
irreparable damage to the company, the auditor or a shareholder who holds at least 1 percent of the
total outstanding shares may demand on behalf of the company that the director stop such act. Further,
any shareholder who holds at least 1 percent of the total outstanding shares may demand the company
to file an action against directors to enforce their liability (Article 403 Commercial Act).

According to Article 385 of the Commercial Act, a director may be dismissed from office at any time by a
resolution at a general shareholders' meeting, provided that in case where the term of office of a director
was fixed and he is dismissed without cause before the expiration of such term, he may claim damages. If
the dismissal of a director is rejected at a general shareholders' meeting notwithstanding the existence of
dishonest acts or any grave fact in violation of the relevant acts, subordinate statutes or the articles of
incorporation in connection with his duties, any shareholder who holds at least 3 percent of the total
outstanding shares may demand the court to dismiss the director within one month from the date on
which the above resolution of the general meeting was made.

Regulation of Takeover Bids and Other Change of Control Transactions

According to Article 133 of the FSCMA and Articles 139 and 140 of the Enforcement Decree of the
FSCMA, a public tender offer is a public invitation or offer to purchase the voting stocks (including
certificates representing preemptive rights, convertible bonds, certificates of bonds with warrants, and
exchangeable bonds) from a number of unspecified people outside the KRX. A person, who together
with his/her specially related persons intends to acquire at least 5 percent of the total number of voting
stocks and other securities from 10 or more shareholders in a 6-month period has to make a public
tender offer.

According to Article 134 of the FSCMA, a person who intends to make a public tender offer has to
provide a public notice of tender offer on the:

    Person who intends to make the tender offer;

    Issuer of the stocks and securities subject to the tender offer;




                                                                                                95
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



                Purpose of the tender offer;

                Class and number of stocks and other securities subject to the tender offer;

                Terms and conditions of the tender offer, including the period, price, and payment date of the
                 tender offer; and

                Details of the purchasing fund and other matters prescribed in the Enforcement Decree of the
                 FSCMA as necessary for the protection of investors.

            The tender offeror is also required to file a public tender statement with the FSC and the KRX on the day
            on which such public notice of tender offer is provided. On the basis of Article 146 of the Enforcement
            Decree of the FSCMA, the tender offer period cannot be less than 20 days and more than 60 days.

            In addition, Article 137 of the FSCMA requires a tender offeror to prepare a prospectus for tender offer,
            submit it to the FSC and KRX on the public notice date of the tender offer, and make it available to the
            public. No prospectus for tender offer is allowed to contain a description different from the relevant
            tender offer statement or omit any such description.

            On the basis of Article 141 of the FSCMA, a tender offeror is required to purchase without delay all the
            stocks and other securities tendered according to the purchasing terms, conditions and manners stated
            in the tender offer statement on and after the day following the expiry date of the tender offer period.
            The purchasing price at the time of purchase has to be uniform. The tender offeror can include a
            condition in the public notice of tender offer and the tender offer registration that if the total number of
            tendered stocks and securities exceeds the proposed number for the tender offer, he/she will buy the
            stocks pro rata within the limit of the proposed number of stocks and other securities subject to the
            tender offer.

            Disclosure of Changes in Substantial Holdings

            Registration statements and annual business reports
            The term major shareholder is defined in Article 9 of the FSCMA as a shareholder who falls under any of
            the following:

                A principal who together with his/her specially related persons holds the greatest number of stocks
                 (including securities depository receipts that are related to the stocks) out of the total number of
                 outstanding voting stocks; and
                A person who falls under any of the following items (referred to as a significant shareholder):

                (a)   A person who holds 10 percent or more of the total number of outstanding voting stocks
                      (including securities depository receipts that are related to the stocks) of a corporation; and

                (b)   A shareholder who exercises de facto control over major matters of a corporation through
                      appointment and dismissal of executives or in any other way.

            As noted under Principle 16, each registration statement and annual business report have to include
            information on matters concerning shareholders. According to the information provided by the FSS, this
            is interpreted to require the presentation of information on the largest shareholder and significant
            shareholders at the beneficial owner level.

              Ongoing disclosure obligations

              A person who acquires at least 5 percent of the stocks and other equity securities of any stock-listed
              corporation is required to report the aggregate number of its and its specially related persons’ holdings
              and the purpose of those holdings to the FSC and KRX within five days from the date of acquisition
              (Article 147 FSCMA). The purpose of the holding refers to whether the acquirer has any intention to
              exercise influence on the issuer's business control or whether the acquisition has been made only for
              investment purposes. The details of a change of at least 1 percent also have to be reported to the FSC
              and KRX within five days from the date on which such change occurs if the purpose of the acquisition is
              to exercise influence on the issuer’s business control. When a person subject to the 5 percent rule files a
              report as "investment only" purpose, the reporting deadline is changed from within 5 days from the date
              of occurrence of the reporting obligation to the tenth day of the following month.

              Holdings of Voting Securities by Directors and Senior Management

              The executives of a stock-listed corporation are required to report to the SFC and KRX the status of
              equity securities held by them within five days from the day on which they became executives or within
              five days from the day on which any change occurred in the status of the equity securities (Article 173
              FSCMA). The SFC and KRX have to keep such reports for public inspection for three years, and disclose
              them through their Internet homepages.

              According to the information provided by the FSS, the requirement to include matters concerning
              executives and employees in the annual business reports of issuers (see Principle 16) covers information
              on their holdings of voting securities.

              Cross-border Situations

              The FSC requires that foreign issuers that intend to be listed at the KRX disclose in their registration
              statements information on whether they intend to comply with the relevant laws and regulations of their
              home jurisdiction rather than the Korean requirements (Article 129 Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA).

Assessment    Fully Implemented
Comments
Principle 18. Accounting standards used by issuers to prepare financial statements should be of a high and
              internationally acceptable quality.

Description   Requirement to Include Audited Financial Statements in Disclosures

              Primary market disclosures

              As noted in Principle 16, the securities registration statements are required to include information on
              matters concerning financial affairs and an external auditor's audit opinion. According to Article 125(2) of
              the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA and Article 2-6(8) of the Regulation on Issuance, Public
              Disclosure, Etc. of Securities, each registration statement for a public offer of equity securities also has to
              be accompanied by, among other things, the following documents.

                  An external auditor's audit report;
                  An external auditor's consolidated audit report;
                  An external auditor's semi-annual audit or review report; and




                                                                                                                 97
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



                An external auditor's quarterly audit or review report.

            The above requirement applies also to most other types of securities, with the exception of guaranteed
            and secured bonds. The documents accompanying the registration statement are published in the DART
            system together with the registration statement.

            Annual business reports

            As noted in Principle 16, the issuer’s annual business report has to include information on matters
            concerning the issuer’s financial affairs. According to Article 168(6) of the Enforcement Decree of the
            FSCMA, each annual business report also has to be accompanied by, among other things, the
            conglomerate’s consolidated financial statements and the external auditor’s audit reports on both the
            corporation’s and consolidated financial statements (see Principle 16 for the filing deadlines).

            Requirement to have the financial statements audited

            According to Article 2 of the Enforcement Decree of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies, a
            stock company falling under any of the following is subject to external audit by an independent auditor
            (see Principle 19 on the requirements for the auditor):

                A stock company whose total assets as of the end of the immediately preceding business year
                 amounted to at least KRW 10 billion;
                A stock-listed corporation or a stock company that intends to become a stock-listed corporation
                 during the current business year or the following business year;
                 A stock company whose total liabilities and total assets amount to at least KRW 7 billion respectively
                 as of the end of the immediately preceding business year; and
                A stock company whose number of employees exceeds 300 as of the end of the immediately
                 preceding business year and whose total assets amount to at least KRW 7 billion.

            The audit requirement also applies to the financial statements of issuers that have issued and/or listed
            fixed income securities (Article 169(1) FSCMA and Articles 167(1) and 189(1) Enforcement Decree of the
            FSCMA).

            Content of Financial Statements

            According to Article 1-2 of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies and Article 1-2 of the
            Enforcement Decree of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies, a financial statement includes:

                Balance sheet;
                Income statement;
                Statement of changes in stockholders' equity;
                Statement of cash flow; and
                Footnotes.

Accounting Standards Applied in Korea

The Enforcement Decree of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies determines that the following
companies have to prepare their financial statements and consolidated financial statements in
accordance with the K-IFRS:

    A stock-listed corporation;
    A stock company that intends to have its stocks listed during the current or following business year;
    A financial holding company under the Financial Holding Companies Act;
    A bank under the Banking Act;
    An investment trader, an investment broker, a collective investment business entity, a trust business
     entity, or a merchant bank under the FSCMA;
    An insurance company under the Insurance Business Act; and
    A credit card business entity under the Specialized Credit Financial Business Act.

The use of K-IFRS by the above mentioned companies has been compulsory since 2011, and voluntary
since 2009. In particular smaller companies are apparently still struggling to comply with the new
requirements.

The other companies (e.g. companies that have only issued and/or listed fixed income securities or
whose stocks are not listed) can apply Korean GAAP.

Standard Setting and Interpretation

The FSC is required to determine the accounting standards after going through a deliberation of the SFC
(Article 13 of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies). In Article 7-3 of the Enforcement Decree of
the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies, this duty has been further entrusted to the Korea
Accounting Institute (KAI)/Korea Accounting Standards Board (KASB), including interpretations of
accounting standards and replies to inquiries about them. When preparing new or revised standards, the
KASB applies a public exposure period of 30 days before it votes on the standards. The proposed
standards are delivered to the Accounting Policy Deliberation Committee of the SFC (see Articles 23, 24,
and 26 of the Regulation on External Audit and Accounting) before being submitted to the FSC for
approval, after which the revised standards are published.

The KAI is an association established with the approval of the FSC pursuant to the Civil Act. It is required
to have a committee comprised of competent experts to deliberate and resolve matters regarding
accounting standards. The FSS is required to grant the KAI an amount equivalent to 5 percent of the fees
collected by it as a subsidy. The KAI in turn must set aside an amount equivalent to at least 30 percent of
the subsidies granted by the FSS as a reserve separate from its working capital that can be used only in
specific cases, subject to the prior approval of the FSC.
The FSC (taking into account the advice of the SFC) may ask the KAI/KASB to change the details of the
accounting standards when deemed necessary to protect interested parties and to conform to the
international standards (Article 13 of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies). In such cases, the
KAI/KASB must comply with the request unless justifiable grounds exist that make it impossible for it to
do so.




                                                                                                99
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



            Supervision and Enforcement of Compliance with the Accounting Standards

            The SFC is assigned with the duty to conduct supervision over the audit reports. It may delegate matters
            concerning examinations on account books and documents related to accounting of a company or
            investigations of the current status of business and property of a company to the Chairperson of the SFC
            (Articles 8 and 9 of the Enforcement Decree of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies). The review
            of the audit reports and related financial statements has been further delegated to the FSS and KICPA.

            The SFC may, if necessary for the purposes of performing its duties to supervise the audit reports,
            request a company or its related company and an auditor to submit data, state opinions or make reports,
            or may have the Governor of the FSS inspect the accounting books and documents of the company or its
            related company, or investigate its business and financial status (Article 15-2 Act on External Audit of
            Stock Companies). If necessary, the FSS may also review the external auditor’s audit report. For the
            purpose of conducting an audit report review, the FSS may review auditor’s working papers and
            interview those involved in the audit engagement (see Principle 19 for further details).

            When the FSS reviews the audit engagements of external auditors (including their audit reports), it also
            assesses issuers’ compliance with accounting standards. As a rule, this assessment primarily consists of
            the analysis of public disclosures made by issuers. If needed, the FSS may demand access to issuers’
            books and other records, order issuers to submit documents and data, or order their executive officers
            and/or employees to be available for an interview or statement. In addition, the FSS may initiate an on-
            site visit to issuers’ office, factory, or any other business premises.

            On the basis of the above, the Korean authorities approach the enforcement of accounting standards
            primarily through their audit oversight function. However, this approach has led to some measures
            against issuers as well, as demonstrated by the sanctions imposed by the SFC in 2010-2012 for issuers'
            non-compliance with the accounting standards (“issuers” here include both listed and non-listed
            companies):

                described in or attached to annual business reports, half-yearly reports and quarterly reports of foreign
                corporations that have listed equity securities at the KRX are required to be prepared based on any of
                the following accounting standards:

                    K-IFRS;
                    IFRS; or

Assessment      Fully Implemented

Comments        The infrastructure for establishing and interpreting the K-IFRS and supervising and enforcing compliance
                with them is in place. However, according to the FSC press release published shortly before the end of
                the assessment mission, accounting fraud by top management of companies continues to be a problem,
                and there is a need to strengthen enforcement powers in this area by, among others, introducing the
                possibility to restrict the eligibility for an executive of a listed company for up to two years. Such
                measures are planned to be taken in connection with measures targeted at auditors (see Principle 19).
                The enforcement challenges in the area of compliance with accounting standards have been taken into
                account in the ratings of Principles 19 and 20.

Description     Auditor Qualification Requirements

                According to Article 3 of the Act on Certified Public Accountants (CPA Act), each person who has passed
                the certified public accountant (CPA) examination will be admitted as a CPA. The CPA examination is
                administered by the FSS with delegation from the FSC. If a person qualified as a CPA intends to render
                audit and other services defined in Article 2 of the CPA Act (including as an employee of an audit firm),
                he/she needs to apply for registration as a CPA after completing an apprenticeship training of not less
                than one year. The FSC has delegated the registration of CPAs to KICPA.

                Any CPA may establish an accounting corporation16 in order to systemically and professionally render
                audit and other services (Article 23 CPA Act). Any such audit firm is required to register with the FSC. A
                registrant has to satisfy the following main requirements:

                    Have at least three directors who are CPAs;
                    Have at least ten CPAs among its directors and employees; and
                    Have capital of at least KRW 500 million.

                In Korea, an individual CPA can be the auditor of stock companies, with the exception of stock-listed
                corporations (i.e. corporations whose shares have been listed on KOSPI or KOSDAQ). Article 3 of the Act

  Accounting corporations are referred to below as audit firms for consistency with the IOSCO terminology and
 market practice.




                                                                                                                101

            on External Audit of Stock Companies requires that an auditor conducting an audit of a stock-listed
            corporation has to be either an audit firm (as defined in Article 23 of the CPA Act) or an audit team
            registered with KICPA.

            Responsibility for Audit Oversight


            The following diagram summarizes the responsibilities of the FSC, SFC, FSS, and KICPA in audit oversight.




            Source: KICPA.


            Legal responsibility of the Securities and Futures Commission

            Under Article 15 of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies and Article 8 of the Enforcement
            Decree of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies, the SFC is assigned with the responsibility

            To review the audit reports in order to ensure a fair auditing and to review whether the audit has been
            made in compliance with the auditing standards.

            The SFC is also required to perform the supervisory activities related to the quality control environments
            of auditors (Article 8(3) of the Enforcement Decree of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies).

            Legal responsibility of the Financial Services Commission

            The legal responsibility for registering CPAs lies with the FSC (Article 7 CPA Act). It is also responsible for
            refusing and withdrawing a registration (Articles 8 and 9 CPA Act) and disciplining registered CPAs
            (Article 48(1) CPA Act).

            Delegated responsibility of the Financial Supervisory Service

            The SFC has entrusted the Governor of the FSS with the responsibilities for audit oversight (Article 9(2) of
            the Enforcement Decree of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies and Article 75 of the
            Regulation on External Audit and Accounting). In particular, the FSS has been delegated the
            responsibility for the supervision of the audit reports on stock-listed corporations and on financial
            institutions subject to its examinations. Further, it is charged with the supervision of the following
            external auditors:

 Auditors that audit more than 1 percent of the total number of stock-listed corporations as of
the end of April each year;

 Auditors that audit any stock-listed corporation whose total amount of assets is at least KRW 1
  trillion as of the end of April each year;
 Auditors with more than 30 registered CPAs; and
 Auditors for which direct supervision of the FSS is required due to the parallel supervision by a
  foreign supervisory agency and the request of the auditor.

In addition, in accordance with Article 49(2) of the Regulation on External Audit and Accounting, at the
request of the FSC or if the FSC or SFC’s performance of their duties or a tip from related parties reveals
that an auditor has performed its work inappropriately, the FSS may initiate a for cause audit quality
review.

Delegated responsibility of Korean Institute of Certified Public Accountants

KICPA is responsible for the supervision of those audit reports and auditors that are not the responsibility
of the FSS (Article 67 of the Regulation on External Audit and Accounting). The responsibility for
registering CPAs as well as rejecting or withdrawing their registration has also been entrusted to KICPA
(Article 52 CPA Act and Article 38 of the Enforcement Decree of the CPA Act).

KICPA is required to establish a committee necessary for carrying out the business affairs entrusted to it
and to establish regulations on the organization and operation of this committee and supervisory
guidelines (Article 9(4) of the Enforcement Decree of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies).
When KICPA intends to establish or amend its regulations, it has to obtain the approval of the SFC. It is
also required to report to the SFC on the results of the affairs entrusted to it.

Outcome of the delegations

In practice, the above delegations have led to the FSS being in charge of the supervision of 32 out of a
total of 125 audit firms, whereas KICPA is responsible for the rest (including any audit teams and
individual CPAs that act as auditors). The 32 firms supervised by the FSS audit about 85-90 percent of
stock-listed corporations. Through its supervision of audit reports of stock-listed corporations, the FSS is
involved in the oversight of a broader group of audit firms. However, if a small auditor audits only
corporations that have listed or publicly offered only other securities than stocks, it is subject only to
KICPA supervision. The same would apply to auditors of corporations that have only made public offers
of stocks without having them listed. As a result of this, firms providing audit services to issuers whose
shares are traded on the Freeboard of KOFIA would be excluded from the FSS oversight.


Practice in the Review of Audit Reports and Quality Control of Audit Firms

Financial Supervisory Service

As noted above, the FSS is responsible for reviewing the audit reports of stock-listed corporations and
financial institutions. It conducts this primarily through sampling by reviewing approximately 10 percent
of all audit reports falling under its responsibility. Further, it reviews additional 5 percent of the reports
on a for cause basis due to suspected disclosure deficiencies by issuers.




                                                                                                  103
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



               With regards to audit quality reviews, the FSS conducts them on a periodic basis, and the review cycle
               varies depending on the number of stock-listed corporations an audit firm audits. More specifically, if an
               audit firm audits 100 or more stock-listed corporations, it is subject to the FSS’ audit quality review every
               two years. The review cycle is three years for audit firms auditing 20 or more but less than 100 publicly-
               held companies, and three to five years for audit firms auditing less than 20 publicly-held companies.

               In its examinations, the FSS reviews whether the auditors comply with the independence requirements of
               the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies and Section 290 of the KICPA Code of Ethics that pertains
               to the independence of audit firms (see Principle 20). The FSS also verifies whether the audit firm
               complies with the quality control policies and procedures included in the Korean International Standard
               on Quality Control (ISQC) 1.

               Korean Institute of Certified Public Accountants

               KICPA has put in place a mechanism to review the audit reports and quality control systems of audit
               firms falling under its responsibility. KICPA’s Audit Quality Control Supervisory Committee reports the
               results of its review to its Audit Quality Review Committee that determines any disciplinary measures on
               auditors and individual CPAs, except in the cases that have to be decided by the SFC or FSC (see below).

               The team responsible for the reviews of audit reports and quality control of audit firms in KICPA has 11
               members. The focus of the activities is in the review of audit reports that KICPA reviews by sampling on
               the basis of certain criteria (both risk-based and random). It also reviews the quality control of audit firms
               through on-site visits every five years (seven years for audit teams).

               The main objective of the KICPA audit report reviews is to summarize the findings and communicate
               them to all auditors as an input for discussions on how to improve audit quality. The KICPA quality
               control reviews of audit firms also follow a somewhat different approach from that
               applied by the FSS, by focusing more on guiding the firms and preparing recommendations on the basis
               of the findings of the on-site visits.

               Enforcement Powers

               Securities and Futures Commission and Financial Services Commission

               According to Article 52 of the Regulation on External Audit and Accounting, when the chairman of the
               SFC considers that it is necessary to recommend improvement of the quality of audit as a result of an
               examination of an auditor, he will submit a proposal to the SFC to advise the auditor to achieve
               improvement of the operation or quality control system within a year. In order to ensure that the
               recommendations for improvement will be implemented, the SFC may require an auditor to report
               details of its performance within one month after the end of the period given for compliance with the
               recommendation (Article 64(3) of the Regulation). According to the information disclosed by the FSC this
               power is currently not used effectively.17 In addition, these types of recommendations are not allowed to
               be disclosed to the public due to a specific prohibition in Article 52(2) of the Regulation18.



17
  See the FSC press release of April 16, 2013, which notes that no follow-up is currently made. The FSC proposes in
the press release that, in the future, if an audit firm’s quality control system has serious defects, it would be disclosed
to the public immediately and follow-up would be made within 1 year from the notification of recommended
improvement.

              According to Article 16 of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies, if the requirements of the Act
              are breached, the SFC may either itself take or recommend that the FSC take certain measures. The
              measures against auditors are specified in Article 53 of the Regulation on External Audit and Accounting,
              according to which the SFC may impose one of the following measures against an auditor for violations:

                  Suggestion of following measures to the FSC:

                    (a) Cancellation of registration of the audit firm or team; and
                    (b) Suspension of part or entire operations of the audit firm for up to one year.

                   Restriction on providing audit services for specific companies for up to five years;
                   Additional contributions to the joint fund for damages;
                   Warning or caution; and
                   Other necessary measures, such as a correction order or a request for submission of a
                    memorandum (in which the auditor promises to comply faithfully with the auditing standards).

              On the basis of Article 15 of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies, the SFC may delegate certain
              of its tasks to the FSS. However, none of its enforcement powers have been delegated to the FSS. Before
              the SFC takes a decision on enforcement measures against auditors, the cases are deliberated by its
              Accounting Oversight Deliberation Committee (see Articles 23, 25, and 26 of the Regulation on External
              Audit and Accounting).

              Certain enforcement measures may also be taken under the CPA Act. The FSC may cancel the registration
              of an audit firm that does not meet the requirements specified in Articles 26(1), 26(2), or 27(1) of the Act
              and fails to supplement them within three months, that has made a registration in a false or unlawful
              manner, or that has rendered the services in violation of a suspension order. The FSC may also suspend
              the services of an audit firm that has violated the CPA Act on an order made under the Act.

              The FSC may also impose a civil money penalty in lieu of a business suspension under Articles 39(1)(5) or
              48(1)(2) of the CPA Act, if such a suspension is feared to have a serious impact on interested persons, etc.
              or harm the public interest. The penalty cannot exceed KRW 500 million on audit firms and KRW 100
              million on CPAs.

              The Audit Quality Review Committee of KICPA may take appropriate in case of non-compliance,
              depending on the result of the review of audit reports (Article 9.1 of the Terms of Reference on the
              Operation of the Audit Quality Control Review Committee). The measures that can be taken by KICPA are
              the same as those that can be taken by the SFC under Article 16 of the Act on External Audit of Stock
              Companies.

              The Ethics Committee of KICPA may also take or propose appropriate disciplinary measures against
              auditors or CPAs that have violated the CPA Act (Article 48(2) of the CPA Act and Article 38(2) of the
              Enforcement Decree of the CPA Act). Minor disciplinary measures provided under Article 48(2) of the CPA

            Act (i.e., reprimand or suspension of part of practicing for one year or less) can be taken by KICPA,
            whereas the FSC itself decides on cancellations of registrations and longer suspensions of practicing (for
            maximum of two years) for CPAs.

            In addition, there are measures against CPAs that were involved in a violation conducted by an audit firm
            (Article 54 of the Regulation on External Audit of Stock Companies):

                   Suggestion of following measures to the FSC:

                     Suspension of license for up to two years.
             Restriction on audit services for specific stock-listed corporations and companies whose auditor is
                designated by the SFC;

             Restriction of audit services for specific companies for up to five years;
             Completion of KICPA professional education program for up to twenty hours;
             Warning or caution; and

Assessment     Broadly Implemented.

Comments       Shortly before the end of the assessment mission, the FSC published a press release announcing that the
               proposed amendments to the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies had been passed at a Cabinet
               meeting. The amendment bill was planned to be submitted to the National Assembly in April 2013 in
               order to be passed in the course of 2013. The key purpose of the amendments is to root out accounting
               fraud and poor auditing and promote the establishment of sound and credible accounting systems. The
               press release and its accompanying document provide extensive information on the deficiencies
               identified in the quality control reviews of audit firms, emphasizing the fact that on average audit reviews
               in small/medium-sized audit firms discovered almost twice as many issues as those made in large audit
               firms.

               Although the IOSCO Methodology does not impose specific requirements on the qualifications of those
               that provide audit services for issuers whose securities are listed or publicly offered, the significant
               quality control and independence deficiencies identified in the Korean market indicate that there is room
               for improvement in the requirements for auditors that provide such services. From that perspective, the
               recently proposed introduction of tightened quality control requirements for audit firms is important.

               The FSS oversight program appears to be fairly robust, but the recurring misconduct cases raise the
               question on whether it should be further strengthened along the changes to the regulatory requirements
               on quality control and independence. This applies in particular to the smaller audit firms that are
               inspected only every three to five years. Further, the KICPA oversight program focuses on the review of
               audit reports, and audit firms (audit teams) falling under its responsibility are inspected only every five
               (seven) years. No information was available distinguishing the number and nature of enforcement
               measures taken by the FSS and KICPA, respectively. Along with robust oversight, it is important that the
               existing enforcement powers available to the authorities (including KICPA) are used effectively.

Principle 20. Auditors should be independent of the issuing entity that they audit.

Description    Regulatory Requirements on Independence

               Auditor independence is addressed in several regulatory requirements in Korea.

               Act on External Audit of Stock Companies and CPA Act




 108
                                                                                REPUBLIC OF KOREA



Article 3 of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies provides that an audit firm cannot audit a
company with which it has financial interests or an employment relationship as prescribed in Article 33(1)
of the CPA Act. A member of an audit team cannot audit a company with which one or more of the audit
team’s CPAs have a relationship prescribed in Article 21(1) of the CPA Act.

According to the Enforcement Decree of the CPA Act, a CPA (including audit firms, partners of audit firms
or their spouses, or engagement team members or their spouses) is not entitled to perform audits on
entities with which he/she has financial interests or an employment relationship. Financial interests refer
to owning stocks or equities, having credits or liabilities worth at least KRW 30 million (KRW 100 million
in case of an audit firm), or being continuously given remuneration for what are not considered as usual
audit services. An employment relationship is described as serving as an executive member of the entity
in question or holding an equivalent position including being in charge of financial matters.

An audit firm is not allowed to have the same director perform the audit business of a company for six
consecutive business years (four in the case of a stock-listed corporation). Further, in case of a stock-
listed corporation, an audit firm cannot have a director who has audited the stock-listed corporation for
three consecutive business years conduct any audit of such corporation for the whole period of the next
three consecutive business years (Article 3(4) of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies).

If an audit firm has had its CPAs perform the audit of a stock-listed corporation as assistants for three
consecutive business years, such audit firm is required to replace at least two thirds of the assistants in
the next business year. The same rule applies to audit teams performing the audit of a KOSDAQ listed
corporation.

Any CPA, who is contracted to perform the business of auditing or certifying the financial statement of a
particular company, is prohibited from performing the following business for the company during the
contract term:

    Making accounting records and compiling financial statements;
    Conducting internal audit;
    Creating or operating the financial information system; and
    Other business conflicting with the business of auditing or certifying the financial statement,
     including conducting certain valuation services (Article 14(2) of the Enforcement Decree of the CPA
     Act).
For performing any other business, a CPA is required to consult with the internal auditor and audit
committee of the company and receive their consent on such business.

Korean Standards on Auditing and Korean Institute of Certified Public Accountants Code of Ethics
The Korean Standards on Auditing (KSAs) mandate conformity with the KICPA Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants, which has incorporated the international code of ethics published by the
International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) in 2005. According to §290 of the Code of
Ethics, the auditor is required to reject the auditing offer where there is no tool, such as clearance of
financial interests, which would remove or decrease the factors compromising the independence of the
auditor.

In order not to compromise its independence, an auditor is not allowed to provide an audited
corporation with non-auditing services that may create circumstances of self-interest, self-review,
advocacy, familiarity, or intimidation (§290.158–290.205 of the Code of Ethics).




                                                                                                109
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



            Requirements for Monitoring, Identifying, and Addressing Threats to Independence

            Pursuant to §18 and 19 of the KICPA Audit Quality Control Standards, an auditor and any person who is
            obliged to comply with the independence requirements (including the experts who are involved in the
            audit and the network auditor’s members) should establish and implement policies and procedures
            providing confidence that the requirements for maintaining independence are observed.

            An auditor should (i) make it easy to confirm compliance with the independence requirements; (ii) update
            all the documents on independence; and (iii) take action where it detects any compromise of
            independence by providing to all the members involved in the audit the information necessary for
            maintaining independence.

            Role of the audit committee

            According to Article 4 of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies, in selecting and appointing an
            auditor, any stock-listed corporation is required to get the approval of the auditor selection and
            appointment committee. If an audit committee has been established pursuant to the Commercial Act, it
            will be considered to be the auditor selection and appointment committee.

            A stock-listed corporation with at least KRW 2 trillion in total assets is required to establish an audit
            committee (Articles 542-11 and 542-12 Commercial Act). In this case, shareholders having voting rights
            exceeding 3 percent of the total number of voting rights cannot vote with those excess voting rights at
            the general shareholders’ meeting for the appointment or dismissal of the audit committee members.

            Governance standards for monitoring and safeguarding independence

            Pursuant to §290.29 of the Code of Ethics, the internal auditor or audit committee is required to monitor
            the independence of the external auditor. The internal auditor is required to exchange information on the
            independence of the external auditor with the audit committee. According to §290.33 of the Code of
            Ethics, an external auditor is required to cooperate with or get approval of the internal auditor or audit
            committee when seeking to provide non-auditing services other than those that are prohibited.

            Disclosure of the resignation, removal or replacement of an auditor

            According to Article 4-4 of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies and Article 4-3 of the related
            Enforcement Decree, if a company appoints or replaces an auditor, it has to submit a report to the SFC
            within two weeks of the date of the contract. Article 4-2 of the Act provides that any stock-listed
            corporation has to appoint an auditor within four months from the initial date of the first business year
            and allow such auditor to conduct an audit for three consecutive business years. Where an auditor falls
            under any cause specified in Article 3(5) of the Enforcement Decree, such as a breach of duty, the
            company may dismiss the auditor upon approval from the auditor selection and appointment committee
            within three months from the end of each business year even during the period of three consecutive
            business years. In such cases, the company is required to report the dismissal without delay to the SFC.

            Enforcement

            See Principle 19 above for the various types of enforcement measures that can be used and have been
            used to enforce compliance with the auditor independence standards. According to the information
            provided by the authorities, the reason for the total of four independence related enforcement measures
            taken in the last three years was that the same audit firm partner conducted audits of non-listed
            corporations for six consecutive years. Principle 19 also provides information on the enforcement

               measures taken against CPAs for violation of the independence requirements. During the mission, the
               FSC published a press release expressing concerns about auditors’ compliance with the various
               independence requirements. Most importantly, some auditors do not apparently comply with the
               prohibition to compile the financial statement of the companies that they audit.

Assessment     Broadly Implemented

Comments       The independence requirements included at the regulatory and self-regulatory level in Korea incorporate
               the key issues addressed in Principle 20. However, despite the low number of enforcement cases in the
               past three years, there have been challenges in enforcing compliance with the independence
               requirements. This is likely to be related to the broader challenge on how to ensure sufficient availability
               and use of high quality and independent audit services (see also Principles 19 and 21).

Principle 21. Audit standards should be of a high and internationally acceptable quality.

Description    Audit Standard Setting in Korea

               The requirements for including audited financial statements in the registration statements, annual
               business reports and half-yearly and quarterly reports are described in Principle 18 above.

               Article 5 of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies provides that an auditor has to conduct an
               audit according to the standards for external audit generally accepted as fair and reasonable. KICPA is
               authorized to set these standards after having obtained the prior approval of the FSC. In practice, the
               Korea Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (KAASB) established under KICPA sets the auditing
               standards applied in Korea.

               The current KSAs, which are based on the former ISAs issued by the International Auditing and Assurance
               Standards Board (IAASB) before 2004, focus more on audit procedures than the new clarified ISAs that
               are characterized by a risk-based approach. While the current KSAs include elements of a risk-based
               approach, the underlying approach is still different from the clarified ISAs.

               One of the additional differences between the KSAs and clarified ISAs is that the KSAs still allow a group
               auditor to divide the responsibility for audit work between the audit team, while the primary auditor is
               responsible for the component auditors’ work to render the audit opinion under the clarified ISAs. In
               December 2008, KICPA published its International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) Part 3 Action Plan, in
               which it announced that the KAASB and FSC plan to approve the clarified ISAs in Korean as new statutory
               auditing standards. The new KSAs were issued in December 2012, and will take effect from the period
               commencing January 1, 2014. In practice the large Korean audit firms already apply the clarified
               ISAs/KSAs.

               The KAASB’s tasks in relation to the KSAs are to establish, revise and interpret:

                   KSAs;

                   Details of the KSAs, such as the practical guidance;

                   Standards for non-audit assurance services;

                   Standards for quality control; and

                   Standards for and practical guidance on audit, excluding those subject to the Act on External Audit
                    of Stock Companies.




                                                                                                              111
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA



               The process for adopting or revising a standard includes exposure for public comments (normally for 30
               days), final decision making and vote by the KAASB, approval by the FSC, and publication by KICPA.
               Before the approval of the FSC, the proposed standards are first approved by the Accounting Policy
               Deliberation Committee of the SFC (Article 26 Regulation on External Audit and Accounting).

               Enforcement

               The disciplinary measures provided in Article 16 of the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies apply
               to cases where an auditor has violated the requirement in Article 5(1) of the Act to conduct the audit
               according to the required standards. There have been a significant number of cases where auditors and
               CPAs have been sanctioned due to the violation of the auditing standards.

Assessment     Broadly Implemented

Comments       The KSAs are currently not fully in line with the clarified ISAs, but will become so from the beginning of
               2014. In line with the other Principles covering enforcement of various requirements on accounting,
               auditing and auditors, there appears to be a challenge in enforcing compliance with the auditing
               standards.

Principle 22. Credit rating agencies should be subject to adequate levels of oversight. The regulatory system should
              ensure that credit rating agencies whose ratings are used for regulatory purposes are subject to
              registration and ongoing supervision.

Description    Registration

               Obtaining a credit rating from at least two credit rating agencies is mandatory in Korea in the case of
               public offers of corporate bonds and issuance of commercial papers. If a CIS intends to invest in a
               privately placed security, such a security also has to have a credit rating.
               Article 2(12) of the Use and Protection of Credit Information Act defines a credit rating service as
               assessing the probability of repayment of the principal and interest in connection with financial
               instruments, credit facilities, etc. and the credit worthiness of companies, legal entities, indirect
               investment vehicles, etc. for the purpose of protecting investors. Credit rating business is one type of
               credit information business, and any person who intends to engage in credit information business is
               required to obtain a license from the FSC (Article 4).

               According to Article 6(1) of the Use and Protection of Credit Information Act, any person who intends to
               obtain a license for credit information business has to satisfy the following requirements:

                   The applicant has to have sufficient human resources and physical facilities, including computer
                    equipment, to carry out credit information business;
                   The applicant has to have reasonable and sound business plans;
                   Major investors of the applicant have to have sufficient investment capacity, viable financial
                    standing and social credibility; and
                   The applicant has to have a sufficient level of expertise to perform credit information business.
               Any person who intends to be licensed to engage in credit rating business has to possess capital of at
               least KRW 5 billion (Article 6(2) (1)).

               There are currently four licensed credit rating agencies (CRAs) in Korea, although one of them is not
               authorized to provide credit ratings for corporate bonds. No foreign CRAs provide credit rating services
               in Korea, but three of the four Korean CRAs are majority owned by foreign CRAs.

According to Article 5(2) of the Use and Protection of Credit Information Act, a corporation is prohibited
from being licensed to provide credit rating services if at least 10 percent of its capital is invested by a
company that is part of a conglomerate or a financial institution or its affiliates.

The FSC may cancel the license of a credit information company in certain cases (Article 14). It may also
issue an order to wholly or partially suspend business for a specified period of not more than six months,
if a credit information company does not continue to satisfy the requirements of sufficient human
resources and physical facilities (Article 6(4)), or violates Article 11 or 28 of the Act.

Ongoing Supervision

A credit rating agency is required to submit to the FSC documents to identify its rating capabilities,
including a credit rating performance report, etc., and provide such documents to the KRX and KOFIA to
make them available to the public (Article 29(5) Act on Use and Protection of Credit Information).

According to Article 45(1) of the Act, the FSC supervises whether a credit information company complies
with the Act and orders under it. The FSC may, if necessary, order a credit information company to report
in relation to its business, financial standing, etc. The Governor of the FSS may have the personnel of the
FSS inspect the business and financial standing of a credit information company. The Governor may, if
deemed necessary for an examination, request a credit information company to submit data and have
persons concerned attend meetings and state their opinions. The Governor has to report the findings of
an examination to the FSC.

In practice, the FSS conducts a regular on-site examination in the CRAs every three or four years.

Oversight Requirements: Quality and Integrity

A CRA is required to prescribe the appropriate standards and procedures to be observed by its
executives and employees (internal control standards) and verify compliance with them. The internal
control standards have to address the following matters (Article 29(7) Use and Protection of Credit
Information Act and Article 26(2) related Enforcement Decree):

    Separation of the rating and sales organization;
    Prohibition of conflicts of interest;
    Prohibition of unfair practices;
    Introduction of credit rating criteria appropriate for the nature of rated entities;
    Recording and storage of rating related data;
    Development of internal procedures to review the adequacy of credit ratings;
    Examination of compliance with the internal control standards for executives and employees; and
    Procedures for the establishment and amendment of the internal control standards.

The CRAs should have an appropriate rating methodology requiring that a credit rating team composed
of professional analysts carries out the credit rating business. The credit rating process should be
consistent and the methodology should be periodically updated. The CRAs should continue to monitor
the rated entities and regularly publish the results even after completing the credit rating.




                                                                                                113
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA



               The CRAs are required to adopt a guideline on collecting, treating and using internal corporate
               information, and to monitor the storage and management of the materials used for the credit rating.
               Materials relating to the credit rating business must be recorded and stored in the form of documents,
               electronic materials, micro film, etc. for the minimum period of time determined by the CRA.

               Oversight Requirements: Conflicts of Interest

               Article 29 of the Act requires that, in assessing the credit worthiness of a client, a credit rating agency has
               to consider in a comprehensive manner both the client’s current status, including its financial standing
               and business performance, and its outlook, including business, management and financial risk. No credit
               rating agency may perform credit rating activities on any person that is in a special relationship with the
               credit rating agency, including a person having an investment relationship exceeding a given ratio. In
               other cases of investment relationships, the credit rating agency is required to specify in the credit report
               the matters relating to the investment relationship.

               The CRAs are also prohibited from providing a credit rating on a person who contributed more than 10
               percent of the CRA’s total revenue during the last fiscal year. An analyst of the CRA who owns shares of
               the rated company, has an important business relationship such as discussing the commission, or has
               received a gift or treatment from the borrowers of the rated company, issuers of the securities or
               underwriters, is prohibited from providing a credit rating.

               Oversight Requirements: Transparency and Timeliness

               CRAs are required to disclose through their internet homepage or publicly when an important part of the
               credit rating methodology, practices or processes has been changed.

               Oversight Requirements: Confidential Information

               According to Article 29(9) of the Use and Protection of Credit Information Act no person who is or was
               an executive or employee of a credit rating agency is permitted to disclose any client’s trade secrets
               obtained during the course of business except in the following cases:

                   If the trade secret is provided and used for purposes agreed by the client;
                   If the trade secret is provided subject to a court order or a warrant issued by a judicial officer; or
                   If the trade secret is provided pursuant to other Acts.
               The trade secrets are permitted to be used only for CRAs’ rating activities.

Assessment     Fully Implemented

Comments       Credit rating agencies have been subject to regulation and supervision in Korea since 2000. A bill that is
               currently being considered by the National Assembly is intended to transfer the legal provisions
               applicable to credit rating agencies from the Use and Protection of Credit Information Act to the FSCMA.
               This change, although largely technical, is expected to give more emphasis on investor protection rather
               than protection of privacy which is the focus of the current Act.

Principle 23. Other entities that offer investors analytical or evaluative services should be subject to oversight and
              regulation appropriate to the impact their activities have on the market or the degree to which the
              regulatory system relies on them.

              The description under Principle 8 covers the legal framework intended to prevent conflicts of interest,
              and the overall requirements relative to the duty of loyalty, fairness and honesty required from those
              who perform evaluative or analytical services to financial investment business entities and to their
              research and analysis units, equity raisers or investment solicitors. Specific requirements to identify,
              monitor, mitigate, disclose and/or prevent conflicts of interest, as well as the requirement for a system of
              internal controls and related compliance procedures to ensure that these requirements are observed in
              practice are described in various detailed rules as outlined in Principle 8, including the requirement that
              compliance personnel review for proper treatment, mitigation, disclosure and prohibition of conflicts.
              The discussion also describes limits on contingent compensation to research analysts that may be related
              to underwriting activities. The activities related to CRAs are described under Principle 22. In general
              Korea follows the standards for sell-side analysts advocated by IOSCO (see also Principle 29).

              Other Evaluators

              This Principle relates directly to the emergence of reliance on analytical services and the impact of such
              services on the market more generally. In this regard, the system in Korea also makes use of bond pricing
              agencies22. There are four of these, each of which is related to one of the four credit rating agencies.
              These agencies were created at the direction of the government to address the need for development of
              a more reliable yield curve and to assist in the pricing of illiquid products. Other rating services that are
              offered (as referred to by KOFIA on its website) include rating of collective investment schemes and
              evaluations related to mergers, acquisitions and real estate investment vehicles.

              The law provides for the registration and supervision of bond pricing agencies and fund rating agencies23
              (FSCMA Articles 258 and 263). These evaluators are required to have certain systems and work processes
              more particularly spelled out by the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA and related regulations. In this
              regard, the Enforcement Decree (Articles 285–288) provides criteria for the registration of bond pricing
              agencies and specified standards of operation including:

                  Provisions for maintaining consistency and staying abreast of accepted standards;
                  Prohibition on misuse of non-public information;
                  Prevention of use of information developed for pricing for any other business of the company;
                  Disclosure of pricing standards to the public;
                  Notification and publication of changes in bond prices/yields;
                  Requirement for maintenance of policies and procedures relative to conflicts of interest; and
                  Supervision to ensure the policies and procedures are being followed.

              Article 238 of the FSCMA provides that debt securities of a collective investment scheme should be
              valued at market price, but at fair market value if no market price is available on the valuation date.
              Market price usually means the closing market price traded or publicly announced. Article 260 of the
              same Act provides that in the case of debt securities, debt traded on an overseas exchange and debt for
              which a price has been formed for ten or more days continuously for three months immediately before

                the valuation date, may be valued on the basis of price information provided by two or more bond
                pricing agencies (see also Principle 27).

                Bond pricing agencies typically develop independent evaluations of prices and disseminate financial
                market data, especially mark-to-market data on thinly traded bonds. They also develop other financial
                supplementary systems such as bond, derivatives, portfolio, and market and credit risk management
                systems. These firms may evaluate straight bonds, structured bonds and OTC derivatives. Market
                participants including asset managers providing collective investment schemes and their administrators
                must use at least two pricing agencies when such are used for pricing purposes. The pricing
                methodologies are based on guidance from the KAI and proprietary models used by the providers.

                KOFIA also has substantial regulations on business conduct for financial services providers including its
                special members that provide valuation services to collective investment schemes. Bond pricing agencies
                and fund rating agencies are special members of KOFIA and subject to its regulatory regime and
                oversight as well as to the FSC regulations.

Assessment      Fully Implemented

Comments        Korea appears to be ahead of international best practice in that it has applied a similar regime to that
                advocated by IOSCO, and otherwise internationally, for CRAs to other pricing and rating agencies whose
                ratings and assessments are required as a matter of law. The authorities should keep abreast, however, of
                the ongoing international discussions more broadly on pricing methodologies and benchmarks, the
                potential for these to be abused and best practice for their oversight. They should also have clear rules
                related to switching among pricing models and agencies and regulatory access to relevant information
                relative to pricing.

                                     Principles for Collective Investment Schemes

Principle 24.   The regulatory system should set standards for the eligibility, governance, organization and operational
                conduct of those who wish to market or operate a collective investment scheme.

Description     Legal Forms Required from Collective Investment Schemes and their Operators
                According to Article 9(18) of the FSCMA the term collective investment scheme means any of the
                following forms established for making collective investment:

                    A trust, in which trustors that are collective investment business entities, require a trust business
                     entity to invest and manage the property entrusted to the trust business entity in compliance with
                     instructions provided by the collective investment business entities (investment trust);
                    A stock company under the Commercial Act (investment company);
                    A limited liability company under the Commercial Act (investment limited liability company);
                    A limited partnership company under the Commercial Act (investment limited partnership
                     company);
                    An association under the Civil Act (investment association);
                    An undisclosed association under the Commercial Act (undisclosed investment association); and
                    A limited partnership company that invests and manages its fund in equity securities, etc. for
                     participation in management, improvement of business structure, corporate governance, etc. by
                     issuing equity securities only through private placement (private equity fund).

In practice, all publicly offered CIS in Korea have been established in the form of investment trust or
investment company. The same applies to all privately placed CIS, except one that has been established
in the form of an investment limited liability company. Therefore the discussion in Principles 24–27
focuses on investment trusts and investment companies.

A privately placed fund is a collective investment scheme that issues collective investment securities only
through private placement, in which the total number of investors cannot exceed a prescribed number
(Article 9(19) FSCMA). The definition of a private placement in the case of collective investment schemes
is similar to the one used in the case of other securities (see Principle 16).

With regards to the entities involved in operating and managing a CIS, the collective investment business
entity runs the collective investment business, whereas the trust business entity keeps in custody and
manages the collective investment property. A trust business entity needs to be authorized for trust
business (see Principle 29); in practice banks provide these services to collective investment business
entities. The investment traders and investment brokers (see Principle 29) are responsible for selling the
collective investment securities. Where applicable, there is also a general administration company with
which the affairs of an investment company are entrusted.

Authorization Requirements

Collective Investment Schemes

According to Article 182 of the FSCMA, a collective investment scheme to be created has to be registered
with the FSC. However, in cases where a collective investment business entity or an investment company
files a registration application together with a registration statement, it will be deemed that the relevant
CIS is duly registered at the time when the registration statement becomes effective. This means that the
only CIS that have to be registered with the FSC (or the FSS under delegation from the FSC) are the
privately placed funds. The process for filing the registration statement for CIS is the same as for other
securities (see Principle 27).

Operating/marketing a Collective Investment Scheme

According to Article 12 of the FSCMA, an entity that wishes to obtain authorization for financial
investment business (including collective investment business) is required to be a stock company under
the Commercial Act. A foreign financial investment business entity may also be authorized for collective
investment business in certain circumstances. A collective investment business entity has to comply with
the following requirements:

    Equity capital of at least KRW 1-6 billion;
    Feasible and sound business plan;
    Human resources, an electronic computer system, and other physical facilities;
    Fit and proper executives;
    Good financial standing and social credibility; and
    System for preventing conflicts of interest between the collective investment business entity and
     investors, as well as between a specific investor and other investors.

Those who wish to market a CIS must obtain authorization from the FSC for investment trading business
or investment brokerage business under Article 12 of the FSCMA (see Principle 29). This requirement




                                                                                              117
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



            applies also to banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions that may distribute CIS.
            According to Article 16(4) of the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA, the business plan of an applicant for
            authorization for financial investment business has to include information on the internal control system
            appropriate for risk management and prevention of financial incidents. In addition, every financial
            investment business entity is required to establish a risk management system to identify, assess, monitor,
            and control all transaction risks in a timely manner (Article 3-42 of the Regulations on Financial
            Investment Business). All financial investment business entities must establish and manage risk and
            transaction limits for each department, each transaction, and each product in order to manage risks
            effectively. They are required to assess and manage various types of risk, including market risk,
            operational risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk, and identify and monitor changes in major risks
            comprehensively and jointly with their subsidiaries. The Governor of the FSS may assess the adequacy of
            the current status of risk management of each financial investment business entity and reflect the results
            of such an assessment in the FSS supervision and examinations.

            According to Table 2., Section 3.C. of the Regulations on Financial Investment Business (Internal control
            system and protection of investors) there must be supervisory and internal control systems appropriate
            for ensuring executives' and employees' compliance with laws and regulations, risk management, and the
            prevention of executives and employees from wrongdoing, based on the authorized business unit and its
            size. A financial investment business entity is also required to have a system for the prevention of
            conflicts of interest, including internal control guidelines for the detection, assessment, and management
            of conflicts of interest and appropriate Chinese walls (Table 2, Section 4.A of the Regulation on Financial
            Investment Business).

            When the FSS receives an application for collective investment business, it goes through the documents
            and conducts an on-site visit in the applicant. It prepares a report on the application that is sent to the
            FSC for deciding on whether to grant the authorization or not.

            Soliciting investment in foreign collective investment schemes

            Foreign CIS can be sold in Korea only after the scheme has been registered with the FSC (Article 279(1)
            FSCMA). In principle, the same requirements apply for the registration of a foreign CIS as a domestic one.

            Supervision and Ongoing Monitoring

            On-site examinations

            The powers of the Governor of the FSS to conduct examinations and demand reports and material under
            Article 419 of the FSCMA apply also to collective investment business entities. Information on the general
            and partial examinations conducted in the collective investment business entities is provided in Principle
            12. There are currently 85 collective investment business entities, 21 of which were subject to a general
            examination in the course of 2010-2012. Thematic examinations are conducted in a larger group of firms,
            but they tend to focus on inspecting the large asset management companies.

            The FSS considers that there is little incentive to examine small asset management companies due to the
            low value of their AUM (see the table below) and the fact that 30 out of 36 small firms have entered the

According to the information provided during the assessment mission, the FSS does not conduct
examinations in the trust business entities (custodians) that would specifically focus on the custody
services they provide to CIS (see Principle 25). Instead any examinations would be part of the general
examinations of banks.

Enforcement

The enforcement measures taken against collective investment business entities and their executives and
employees during the past three years are discussed in Principle 12. The statistics demonstrate that the
FSS and FSC have used a range of measures to deal with the violations of the FSCMA, ranging from some
minor measures taken by the FSS to a cancellation of one license in 2012 by the FSC.

Periodic reporting

Pursuant to Article 90 of the FSCMA a collective investment business entity is required to prepare a
business report for each quarter concerning the collective investment property, and submit it to the FSC
(delegated to the FSS) and KOFIA no later than two months after the end of each quarter. The FSS and
KOFIA disclose the business reports to the public through their Internet homepages. KOFIA compares the
performance of each CIS and discloses the results to the public through its Internet homepage.

According to the information provided by the FSS, it also monitors the asset management companies on
a monthly basis using the Handy Indicators (see Principle 6) to identify any issues that deserve
supervisory attention. The results of the analysis are described in a management status evaluation report
of the relevant asset management company.

Reporting of material changes

Whenever there is any change in the matters registered, a collective investment business entity and an
investment company are required to file the details of the change as a revised registration with the FSC
within two weeks, except in certain cases where there is no possibility of undermining the protection of
investors (Article 182 FSCMA).

Record-keeping

Article 187 of the FSCMA and Article 214 of the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA include the following
record-keeping requirements:
  A list of collective investment property: ten years;




                                                                                             119
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



                The ledger of base price of collective investment securities: ten years;
                A full statement of management of collective investment property: ten years;
                Minutes of the general meeting of collective investors and the directors' meeting: ten years; and
                Other account books and documents that any other Act or subordinate statute requires to keep and
                 maintain: the period of time prescribed in the relevant Act or subordinate statute.

            Conflicts of Interest

            According to Article 84 of the FSCMA, in managing the collective investment property, the collective
            investment business entity is not entitled to make any transactions with an interested party, unless
            certain exemptions apply. Such interested parties include the executives, employees and major
            shareholders of the collective investment business entity and their spouses (Article 84 Enforcement
            Decree of the FSCMA). In those cases, the collective investment business entity needs to notify without
            delay the details of such events to the trust business entity. In addition, in managing the collective
            investment property, no collective investment business entity is allowed to acquire securities issued by
            the collective investment business entity itself on its collective investment scheme's account. Further, no
            collective investment business entity is allowed to acquire securities issued by its affiliated company in
            excess of a limit prescribed in the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA.

            According to Article 44 of the FSCMA, a financial investment business entity is required to probe and
            assess the likelihood of conflicts of interest, which may arise between it and any investor, or between a
            specific investor and other investor in connection with its financial investment business. The purpose of
            this is to prevent and control such conflicts of interest in compliance with the method and procedure
            prescribed in the internal control guidelines issued by KOFIA. If there is a likelihood of conflicts of
            interest, the financial investment business entity is required to notify the relevant investors in advance,
            and commence trading only after reducing the likelihood of conflicts of interest to a level that will not
            impede the protection of investors. No financial investment business entity is allowed to commence
            trading, if it is difficult to reduce the likelihood of conflicts of interest.

            Conduct of Business

            There is no specific requirement in the Korean regulatory framework in relation to the best interest of
            investors or best execution. However, a collective investment business entity owes investors the fiduciary
            duty of due care in managing collective investment property and is required to carry out the business in
            good faith for the purpose of protecting investors’ interests (Article 79 FSCMA).

            A collective investment business entity is required to give the trust business entity transaction
            instructions separately for each investment trust property (Article 80 FSCMA). The trust business entity
            must, in return, make the transaction in compliance with these instructions. If it is unavoidable for the
            purpose of managing the investment trust property efficiently, the collective investment business entity
            may acquire or dispose of any asset for investment directly in its name. When it carries out the
            transaction, a collective investment business entity is required to distribute the outcome in accordance
            with the asset distribution schedule predetermined for each investment trust property.

            No collective investment business entity is allowed to manage the collective investment property in
            violation of the collective investment agreement or the investment prospectus, or trade the collective
            investment property for financial investment instruments too frequently, disregarding the collective
            investment scheme's management policy or strategy (Article 85 FSCMA and Article 87(4) Enforcement
            Decree).

A collective investment business entity must, when it intends to create an investment trust, execute a
trust contract with a trust business entity in a form that contains, among others, the computation
method and the time and method of payment of the fees to which the collective investment business
entity and the trust business entity will be entitled (Article 188 FSCMA). There are restrictions on the
maximum amount of sales commission and remuneration that an investment trader or broker selling the
CIS can get (Article 76 FSCMA).

Delegation

A financial investment business entity may entrust a third party with a part of its affairs (Article 42(1)
FSCMA). However, it is not allowed to do so when it is likely to undermine the protection of investors or
sound trade practice. The types of affairs that a collective investment business entity can entrust are
stipulated in Article 45 of the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA. Such affairs are limited to the
management of foreign currency denominated assets and not more than 20 percent of the Korean won
denominated assets, research and analysis related to collective investment, and valuation of the
collective investment property.

Any financial investment business entity that entrusts a third party with any of its affairs is required to
make an entrustment agreement that includes the scope of the affairs entrusted, restrictions on the
trustee’s activities, terms and conditions for maintaining records on the performance of entrusted affairs,
and matters concerning termination of the entrustment contract and compensation and other conditions
for entrustment. Such an agreement has to be reported to the FSC.

If any term or condition of the entrustment agreement undermines the soundness of the business
management of the financial investment business entity, causes any impediment on the protection of
investors, undermines the stability of the financial market, or disturbs the financial trading order, the FSC
may place a restriction on the entrustment of the affair or issue an order to rectify it.

Article 756 of the Civil Act applies to the damages inflicted on investors by a person to whom any affair is
entrusted in the course of carrying out the affair (Article 42(9) FSCMA). According to the Civil Act a
person who employs another to carry out an undertaking is required to make compensation for damages
done to a third person by the trustee in the course of the execution of the undertaking. However, this will
not be the case, if the employer has exercised due care in the appointment of the trustee and the
supervision of the undertaking, or if the damage would have resulted even if due care had been
exercised.

Article 42(7) of the FSCMA requires that each financial investment business entity that intends to entrust
its affairs to another establishes guidelines for the management of the entrusted affairs concerning the
protection of investors' information and management and assessment of risks. The guidelines should
include matters concerning the management and assessment of risks ensuing from the entrustment of
affairs; the procedure for the determination and termination of the entrustment of affairs; the control and
management of the trustee; the protection of investors’ information; the countermeasures against
incidents; and ways to secure means to demand written information in relation to the entrusted affairs.

In addition, the collective investment business entity can terminate the delegation and make alternative
arrangements for the performance of the delegated function, where the trustee acts with negligence,
since this is considered to be a violation of duty under the Civil Act.

If a person to whom any affair is entrusted violates Article 54 of the FSCMA on the prohibition on use of
job-related information or the Act on Real Name Financial Transactions and Confidentiality, rejects,
interferes with, or evades an examination, or fails to comply with a demand for a report by the Governor

               of the FSS, the FSC may order either party to the entrustment contract or both to cancel or amend the
               contract (Article 43(2) FSCMA).

               Pursuant to Article 42(8) of the FSCMA, each financial investment business entity is required to state the
               details of the affairs entrusted in the contract documents provided to investors and in the investment
               prospectus, and give notice of any changes to investors, whenever there is any affair entrusted or any
               change made in the content of the entrustment.

               A person to whom an affair is entrusted is subject to the examinations conducted by the Governor of the
               FSS in connection with the entrusted affairs (Article 43(1) FSCMA).

Assessment     Broadly Implemented

Comments       The on-site examination program of the FSS does not provide sufficient coverage of the small collective
               investment business entities. Custodians have an important role in ensuring the protection of collective
               investment scheme assets, and should be subject to examinations by the FSS that are targeted at
               addressing this role.

Principle 25. The regulatory system should provide for rules governing the legal form and structure of collective
              investment schemes and the segregation and protection of client assets.

Description    Legal Form

               The various possible legal forms of a collective investment scheme are described in Principle 24.

               Changes to Investor Rights

               In case any of the material matters included in a trust contract between the collective investment
               business entity and the trust business entity are to be amended, the amended contract has to be
               brought for resolution in advance to the general meeting of collective investors. These include an
               increase in the remuneration or any other fee and change in the nature of the trust business entity.
               The requirements for ad hoc public disclosure are in Article 89 of the FSCMA, according to which a
               collective investment business entity is required to disclose the following events or causes to the public
               without delay:

                   Information on any replacement of a fund manager and the fund management career of the new
                    fund manager;

                   Decisions on deferment or resumption of redemption and the reason for it;

                   Details of non-performing assets, if any, and their depreciation rate;

                   Details of resolutions of the general meeting of collective investors; and

                   Other matters prescribed in the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA as those necessary for the
                    protection of investors.

               Ad hoc public disclosure is required to be made through the Internet homepage of the collective
               investment business entity, an investment trader or broker that sold the relevant collective investment
               securities, and KOFIA; by informing investors through electronic mail; and by posting a public notice at
               the head office, branch offices, and other sales offices of a collective investment business entity and an
               investment trader or investment broker that sold the relevant collective investment securities.

Investment Restrictions

Korean CIS are subject to statutory investment restrictions, under which the collective investment
business entities are prohibited from making certain investments (Articles 81 and 82 FSCMA). The
following are examples of those restrictions:

Equity securities

    Investing the assets of each collective investment scheme in the same securities in excess of 10
     percent of the total assets of each collective investment scheme;

    Investing the total assets of all collective investment schemes managed by the collective investment
     business entity in equity securities issued by the same corporation in excess of 20 percent of the
     total number of equity securities; and

    Investing the total assets of each collective investment scheme in equity securities issued by the
     same corporation in excess of 10 percent of the total number of equity securities.

Over-the counter derivatives

    Trading over-the-counter derivatives with a person that does not meet the qualification
     requirements prescribed in the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA; and
    Investing assets of each collective investment scheme to over-the-counter derivatives so that the
     counterparty risk exceeds 10 percent of the total assets of each collective investment scheme.


Funds of funds

    Investing the assets of each collective investment scheme in the collective investment securities of a
     collective investment scheme (including foreign collective investment schemes) managed by the
     same collective investment business entity in excess of 50 percent of the total assets of the
     collective investment scheme;

    Investing the assets of each collective investment scheme in the collective investment securities of
     the same collective investment scheme (including foreign collective investment schemes) in excess
     of 20 percent of the total assets of the collective investment scheme;

    Investing assets in the collective investment securities of a collective investment scheme (including
     foreign collective investment schemes), which is allowed to invest in collective investment securities
     in excess of 40 percent of the total assets;

    Investing assets in the collective investment securities of a privately placed fund (including foreign
     privately placed funds corresponding to Korean privately placed funds); and

    Investing the collective investment property of each collective investment scheme in the collective
     investment securities of the same collective investment scheme (including foreign collective
     investment schemes), in excess of 20 percent of the total number of collective investment securities.

Borrowing

    No collective investment business entity may borrow money on its collective investment scheme's
     account, except when it is difficult to pay a redemption price momentarily because of rush claims




                                                                                                123
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



                 for redemption. The total amount of such loans cannot exceed 10 percent of the total value of the
                 collective investment property at the time of borrowing (Article 83 FSCMA).

            Compliance with investment restrictions

            Article 85 of the FSCMA and Article 87 of the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA prohibit, among other
            things, managing the collective investment property in violation of the collective investment agreement
            or the investment prospectus and trading the collective investment property for financial investment
            instruments too frequently, disregarding the collective investment scheme's management policy or
            strategy.

            The primary responsibility for complying with the investment restrictions lies on the collective investment
            business entity. The trust business entity is required to examine whether the collective investment
            business entity violates the investment restrictions included in the laws and regulations, the collective
            investment agreement or the prospectus, and demand that the collective investment business entity
            withdraw, revise, or rectify the management instruction or operational act in case of any violation. If the
            collective investment business entity fails to comply with such a demand in three business days, the trust
            business entity must report it to the FSC. The FSS monitors compliance with the investment restrictions
            through periodic reporting and on-site inspections.

            The FSC and FSS have the power to supervise and inspect the collective investment business entity for
            compliance with the above requirements.

            Segregation and Safekeeping of Assets

            According to Articles 246(1) and (3) of the FSCMA, a trust business entity is required to separate the
            collective investment property from its proprietary property, other collective investment property, and
            other property with which it has been entrusted by a third party for safekeeping and management.
            Securities and other instruments specified by Presidential Decree belonging to the collective investment
            property have to be deposited in the securities depository.

            The trust business entities are required to execute the instructions of the collective investment business
            entities for the acquisition, disposition, safekeeping and management of assets separately for each
            collective investment scheme (Article 246(4) FSCMA).

            Article 246(2) of the FSCMA prohibits a trust business entity to be an affiliated company of the
            investment company or the collective investment business entity. According to the information provided
            by the FSS, the examiners verify during their on-site examinations whether the collective investment
            business entity has entered into a trust agreement with an affiliate. However, the relevant section of the
            examination manual does not refer to Article 246, and some of the FSS staff interviewed during the
            mission did not seem to be aware of this prohibition. Therefore the mission has not been able to verify
            that compliance with this important prohibition is effectively monitored and enforced.

            Winding Up

            According to Article 202 of the FSCMA, an investment company has to be dissolved in certain cases. In
            such cases, the liquidator is required to file a report with the FSC on the reason for and date of
            dissolution as well as names and citizen registration numbers of the liquidator and the liquidation
            overseer within 30 days from the date of dissolution. When an investment company is dissolved, it must
            hold a liquidators' meeting composed of liquidators and liquidation overseers. If a liquidator or
            liquidation overseer is significantly incompetent in performing his/her duties or if there is a serious

               violation of a relevant law or statute, the FSC may, ex officio or upon receiving a request from an
               interested person, dismiss the liquidator or liquidation overseer. In such cases, the FSC may appoint a
               new liquidator or liquidation overseer.

               A liquidator must inspect the status of property of the investment company immediately after his/her
               inauguration and prepare a property list and balance sheet within a prescribed period of time, submit
               them to the liquidators' meeting for approval, and submit a certified copy of them to the FSC without
               delay (Article 203 FSCMA). A liquidator must provide peremptory notices to creditors of the investment
               company within one month of his/her inauguration by providing public notice, at least twice, that
               creditors must file a statement on their claims within a certain period of time and that the claims on
               which a statement has not been filed during such period of time will be excluded from the liquidation
               proceedings. The time period provided for filing a statement must be at least one month. A liquidator
               must, upon completion of the liquidation proceedings, prepare a report of the settlement of accounts
               without delay for approval of the general meeting of shareholders and provide public notice of the
               report on the settlement of accounts and submit it to the FSC and KOFIA.

               An investment trust may be terminate only subject to prior approval of the FSC, except if there is no
               possibility of undermining beneficiaries' interests. In such cases, the collective investment business entity
               must report the termination to the FSC without delay. An investment trust has to be terminated in the
               following cases without delay, which termination has to be reported to the FSC immediately:

                   Expiration of the trust contract term stipulated by the trust contract;
                   Resolution by the general meeting of beneficiaries to terminate the investment trust;
                   Absorbed merger of the investment trust; and
                   Revocation of the registration of the investment trust.

               When terminating an investment trust, the collective investment business entity may pay the assets that

Assessment     Broadly Implemented

Comments       The mission has not been able to verify that compliance with the prohibition on related party custody is
               effectively monitored and enforced upon review of the registration statement and/or as part of on-site
               examinations.

Principle 26. Regulation should require disclosure, as set forth under the principles for issuers, which is necessary to
              evaluate the suitability of a collective investment scheme for a particular investor and the value of the
              investor’s interest in the scheme.

               Advertisements

               According to Article 57 of the FSCMA and Article 60 of the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA, a financial
               investment business entity is not permitted to include in the advertisement for investment any other
               statement than the name and type of the collective investment scheme, its investment purpose and
               operational strategy, and certain other matters prescribed by the Enforcement Decree. It must, however,
               include in the advertisement a recommendation that the investor reads the investment prospectus
               before acquiring the collective investment securities; a reference to the fact that there is a risk of loss of
               the invested principal; and, if the advertisement contains the past performance of the collective
               investment scheme, a statement that the past performance does not guarantee a future return on
               investment.

               Further, whenever a financial investment business entity makes an advertisement soliciting investment, it
               is required to refrain from showing the investment return or management results only for the period of
               time during which it had good performance results and from representing, without solid grounds, that a
               certain financial investment instrument is inferior or disadvantageous (Article 60 Enforcement Decree of
               the FSCMA).

               According to Article 4-12 of the Regulations on Financial Investment Business the financial investment
               business entities must establish and enforce compliance with internal control guidelines regulating the
               production and contents of advertisements. An advertisement must be confirmed by the compliance
               officer in advance, and a report on a plan for advertisement soliciting investment and a draft
               advertisement soliciting investment must be submitted to KOFIA for examination. The advertisements
               must state the fact that the examination by KOFIA or by the compliance officer has been completed.

               Enforcement of Disclosure Obligations

               Over the past three years, the FSS has imposed sanctions on CIS operators and their executive officers
               and employees in connection with CIS disclosure documents (e.g., misleading information in the
               prospectus, etc.) as follows:


                                        2010               2011               2012              Total

               The above sanctions include one severe institutional caution issued by the FSC. In addition, the FSS
               imposed one salary reduction, one caution against employee, 13 management recommendations for
               improvement, 13 action requests, and 7 on-site actions.

Assessment     Fully Implemented

Comments
Principle 27. Regulation should ensure that there is a proper and disclosed basis for asset valuation and the pricing
              and the redemption of units in a collective investment scheme.


Description    Asset Valuation
               According to Article 238 of the FSCMA a collective investment business entity must value a collective
               investment property according to market price. If there is no reliable market price available as of the
               valuation date, it must value it according to fair value. The method for determining the market value and
               fair value are prescribed in the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA.

              The market price means the closing market price at which the property was traded in the securities or
              derivatives exchange. However, securities of a publicly offered CIS may be valued at a different price in
              the following circumstances:

                  The price based on price information furnished by two or more bond pricing agencies on the basis
                   of the closing market price of debt securities on the valuation date, in case of debt securities whose
                   market price has been formed in the securities exchange for ten or more days each month
                   continuously during three months immediately before the month on which the valuation date falls;

                  The price based on price information furnished by two or more bond pricing agencies, in case of
                   debt securities whose market price has been formed in an overseas securities exchange; and

                  The fair value means the price assessed for each type of asset that belongs to collective investment
                   property by the committee on valuation of collective investment property (see below), considering
                   the following matters, exercising a duty of good faith, and maintaining consistency in valuation:

                       Acquisition prices of investment assets;
                       Trading prices of investment assets;
                       Prices provided by the following persons with respect to investment assets:
                       A bond pricing agency;
                       An audit firm;
                       A credit rating agency;
                       An appraisal business entity under the Public Notice of Values and Appraisal of Real Estate Act;
                       An investment trader running an underwriting business;
                       A person similar to an above mentioned person that holds permission, authorization,
                        registration, etc. in accordance with the relevant Act and subordinate statutes; and
                       A foreigner similar to an above mentioned person.
                       Exchange rates; and
                       Base prices of collective investment securities.

              In addition, the regulatory framework permits valuing collective investment property at book value, “if
              investors are frequently changed or there is little possibility of undermining investors' interests”. This is
              considered to be the case for money market funds24. If book value is used, the collective investment
              business entity must monitor the difference between the base price determined according to the book
              value and that determined according to the market or fair value, and take necessary measures as
              stipulated in the collective investment agreement, if the difference exceeds or is likely to exceed 50 basis
              points (Article 7-36 of the Regulations on Financial Investment Business).

              The book price means the price determined by the following formulas:

  The weighted maturity of a money market fund’s assets can be at most 90 days, which is currently planned to be
reduced to 60 days.

                For debt securities: the price calculated by depreciating the difference between the acquisition cost
                 and the face value at maturity over the repayment period by the effective interest rate method and
                 adding or subtracting the price to or from the acquisition cost and interest income; or
                Assets other than debt securities: the price calculated by adding to the acquisition cost the interest
                 income accrued until the valuation date.

            A collective investment business entity must organize and operate a valuation committee, which is
            required to carry out the affairs related to the valuation of the collective investment property. It must
            prepare the standards and procedures for the valuation of the collective investment property to ensure
            that it is carried out fairly and precisely. A collective investment business entity must inform the trust
            business entity of the details of a valuation without delay. The trust business entity must review the
            valuation to confirm that it has been fairly made in accordance with the relevant Acts and subordinate
            statutes and the standards for valuation of the collective investment property.

            A collective investment business entity and an investment company must compute the base price of
            collective investment securities according to the results of the valuation of the collective investment
            property. They must provide and post a public notice of the computed base price daily. A different
            period not exceeding 15 days may be stipulated by the relevant collective investment agreement, if it is
            difficult to provide and post a public notice of the base price daily.

            A collective investment business entity and an investment company must receive an external audit for
            the collective investment property within two months from the end of each financial term, except where
            the total assets of a collective investment scheme do not exceed KRW 5 billion. In auditing the
            computation of the base price of collective investment securities and the accounting of the collective
            investment property, an external auditor must determine compliance with the standards for valuation of
            the collective investment property, and must inform the internal auditor (or the audit committee) of the
            collective investment business entity or the investment company of the results.

            Subscription and Redemption

            A collective investment business entity and an investment company must compute the base price used in
            the subscription and redemption of collective investment securities by subtracting total liabilities from
            total assets stated on the balance sheet as at the day immediately before the publicly notified and
            posted date of the base price and dividing the resulting amount by the total number of collective
            investment securities as at the same day (Article 238(6) of the FSCMA and Article 262 of the Enforcement
            Decree of the FSCMA).

            If a base price computed by a collective investment business entity or an investment company is false or
            in violation of Article 238(6), the FSC may order the collective investment business entity or investment
            company to entrust the work related to the calculation of base prices to a general administration
            company.

            According to Article 235 of the FSCMA, an investor may make a claim for redemption of collective
            investment securities at any time. Upon receiving a request for redemption through the investment
            trader or broker that sold the securities, the collective investment business entity and the investment
            company must pay the redemption money on the day prescribed for redemption by the collective
            investment agreement within 15 days from the day on which the investor made the request for
            redemption. Certain exceptions from this requirement are provided in Article 254 of the Enforcement
            Decree of the FSCMA on the basis of the realizability of the investment assets of the collective
            investment scheme.

Pricing Errors

According to Article 262 of the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA, each collective investment business
entity and investment company must, if an error in the calculation of the base price is discovered, revise
it without delay and publicly notify and post the correct base price again. The requirement to publicly
notify and post the correct base price excludes cases where the difference

 between the base price publicly notified and posted initially and the revised base price does not exceed
the following limits:

    Where the collective investment scheme invests in equity securities traded in domestic securities
     market: 0.2 percent;
    Where the collective investment scheme invests in equity securities traded in foreign securities
     market: 0.3 percent;
    Money market funds: 0.05 percent; and
    Collective investment schemes other than the above: 0.1 percent.

Each collective investment business entity and investment company must, when it intends to revise the
base price, obtain the confirmation of its compliance officer and trust business entity. It also needs to
report the intention to revise the base price to the FSC. On the basis of Article 7-37 of the Regulations on
Financial Investment Business, the collective investment business entity and investment company must
include in their report a written statement describing the changed base price, the reasons for the change,
and the measures taken for protecting investors, along with documents that can prove the details of the
change, such as the certificates of the compliance officer and the trust business entity. Necessary matters
concerning the form and method for the preparation of the report are prescribed by the Governor of the
FSS.

Article 64 of the FSCMA includes a general liability for damages that have been caused by financial
investment business entities’ violations of any Act or subordinate statute, term, or condition of their
standardized contract form, collective investment agreement, or investment prospectus. This also applies
to damages sustained by investors due to the financial investment business entities’ negligence in
carrying out their business. On the basis of this provision, an investor can seek compensation from a
collective investment business entity in the case of pricing errors. However, there is no automatic
obligation on the collective investment business entities to compensate the investors that might have
subscribed or redeemed CIS securities at a wrong price.

According to the information provided by the FSS, collective investment business entities in practice
examine whether a revision of the base price would cause any losses to their investors. If this were the
case, they would devise a plan to compensate their investors and advise the FSC of how they have
executed the plan. During the period from May 11, 2011 to June 14, 2013, the FSC was informed of a
total of seven cases where collective investment business entities compensated their investors. However,
given that compensating investors is not compulsory, enforcing any request to compensate investors
might in practice become a challenge to the authorities in the absence of voluntary compliance.

Suspension of Pricing and Redemptions

According to Article 237 of the FSCMA, in the event that a collective investment business entity or an
investment company is unable to redeem collective investment securities on the day prescribed by the
collective investment agreement, it may postpone the redemption in the following cases:




                                                                                               131

                   Where it is impossible to redeem securities due to the impossibility to dispose of collective
                   investment property as result of a significant slump in transactions or a permanent closure,
                   temporary closure, or business suspension of the securities exchange or a foreign securities
                   exchange, or where a natural disaster or any other similar event occurs;
                  Where equality in dealing with investors is feared to be undermined, because such a disposition is
                   likely to lead to default on payments for checks and bills; because assets that belong to the
                   collective investment property have no market value; or because accepting a large claim for
                   redemption would be likely to undermine equality of investors;

                  Where any other cause similar to those above exists and where the FSC deems necessary to
                   postpone redemption.

              A collective investment business entity must disclose to the public without delay decisions on the
              suspension or resumption of redemptions and the reason for it (Article 89 FSCMA). The collective
              investment business entity or an investment company must obtain a resolution on the matters
              concerning the redemption of the collective investment securities by a general meeting of collective
              investors held within six weeks after the postponement of redemptions.

Assessment    Broadly Implemented

Comments      The Korean regulatory framework includes specific regulatory requirements for the valuation of CIS
              assets on a regular basis. However, the assets of money market funds can be valued at book value, which
              contradicts the basic principle expressed in the IOSCO Methodology that requires the use of market or
              fair values whenever they can be determined. This principle has been further enforced in the October
              2012 IOSCO Policy Recommendations on Money Market Funds, that makes the use of book values
              possible only subject to certain safeguards.

              The Korean regulatory requirements address the need to revise the base price in case of pricing errors,
              and disclose the revision of the base price above certain thresholds. However, beyond a general liability
              for damages, there is no automatic obligation for the collective investment business entities to
              compensate investors for losses occurred in the case of subscription or redemption at an erroneous base
              price. Even though collective investment business entities in practice tend to compensate their clients in
              case of errors, it would be recommendable to ensure the enforceability of the obligation by introducing a
              more specific, compulsory requirement.

Principle 28. Regulation should ensure that hedge funds and/or hedge funds managers/advisers are subject to
              appropriate oversight.

Description   Authorization Requirements

              Hedge fund manager

              Those that wish to manage hedge funds are required to be authorized as collective investment business
              entities. The requirements for the content of the application are the same as for regular collective
              investment business (see Principles 24 and 29).

Korean hedge funds can only be privately placed funds for qualified investors. According to Article 249-2
of the FSCMA, when a privately placed fund for qualified investors is created or established, it must be
reported to the FSC within one month.

Other Regulatory Requirements

The requirements of Article 28 of the FSCMA on internal control guidelines described under Principle 24
apply to hedge fund managers as financial investment business entities. The same applies to the
requirements on risk management in Article 3-42 of the Regulations on Financial Investment Business
and on conflicts of interest in Article 44 of the FSCMA that have also been described under Principle 24.
Equally, the requirements for the segregation of client money and assets described under Principle 25
apply to hedge fund managers.

Pursuant to Articles 30 and 31 of the FSCMA, hedge fund managers are subject to the requirement to
maintain a net operating capital ratio of 150 percent or higher (see Principle 30). In addition, they are
subject to the requirements of Article 31 of the FSCMA on soundness in business management. The FSS
may evaluate the actual status of business management and risks in order to secure the soundness in
business management of each financial investment business entity.

Disclosure to Investors

Because hedge funds can only be privately placed, hedge fund managers are not subject to the periodic
and ongoing disclosure requirements to investors set out in Articles 88–90 of the FSCMA (see Principle
26) or the requirement to disclose the base price (see Principle 27). However, they are subject to the
guidelines issued by KOFIA that require hedge fund managers to provide certain information on the
performance of their hedge funds to investors. The guidelines require the hedge fund managers to
prepare an investment prospectus and establish a policy on the scope of other information (such as
investment performance, transaction counterparties, and the arrangements for the custody and
safekeeping of collective investment assets) that they will provide to investors.

The audit requirements applicable to other CIS under Article 240 of the FSCMA do not apply to hedge
funds.

Disclosure to the Regulator

A collective investment business entity is required to report to the FSS the current status of the hedge
funds’ borrowing and sale and purchase of derivatives (Article 249-2(7) FSCMA). Article 271-2(6) of the
Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA specifies that a collective investment business entity is required to file
a quarterly report for each hedge fund including the following information:

    Current status on borrowing of funds and trading of derivatives;
    Current status on guarantee of liabilities or provision of collateral;
    Major fund-managing strategies and types of investment assets; and
    Matters concerning investment risk management.

Supervision and Enforcement

As financial investment business entities, the Governor of the FSS has the power to inspect the hedge
fund managers and demand them to submit reports as provided in Article 419 of the FSCMA (see




                                                                                             133
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA



              Principle 10). However, given that hedge funds were first introduced in Korea only in late 2011 and that
              the hedge fund market is still in its early stage of development, the FSS has not yet conducted any on-
              site examinations of hedge fund managers.

              Similarly, the FSC has the power to take the same measures against hedge fund managers and their
              executives and employees as against any other regulated entities and their executives and employees on
              the basis of Articles 420 and 422 of the FSCMA (see Principle 11).

              The FSC’s and SFC’s powers to share information with and provide assistance to foreign regulators on the
              basis of Article 437(2) of the FSCMA are covered in Principles 13-15.
              Pursuant to Article 4-102(4) of the Regulations on Financial Investment Business, each prime broker is
              required to report the present conditions of credit extension and collateral to the Governor of the FSS.
              This includes credit extension to hedge funds.

Assessment    Broadly Implemented

Comments      Because Korean hedge funds can only be sold to qualified investors, the current KOFIA guideline based
              requirements for investor disclosure can be considered to be sufficient. However, the fact that they are
              not required to have their financial statements audited has the potential of undermining the quality of
              investor disclosures and the reliability of the reports submitted to the regulator.

              The FSS plans to start on-site examinations of hedge funds in December 2013. It is recommended to
              proceed with this plan, also in order to monitor developments in preparation for the likely growth of the
              sector.

                                         Principles for Market Intermediaries

Principle 29. Regulation should provide for minimum entry standards for market intermediaries.

Description   Requirement for Authorization or Registration

              The financial investment businesses that require authorization or registration in Korea include (Article 6
              FSCMA):

                  Investment trading business;
                  Investment brokerage business;
                  Collective investment business;
                  Investment advisory business;
                  Discretionary investment business; and
                  Trust business.

              All the above business falls under the IOSCO term market intermediary, with the exception of collective
              investment business that is covered in detail in Principles 24–27.
              No one can engage in financial investment business (except investment advisory business and
              discretionary investment business) without authorization (including for changes) or registration in the
              case of the aforesaid advisory and discretionary investment businesses (Articles 11 and 17 FSCMA).
              Articles 12 and 13 set out the relevant requirements. Each line of financial investment business (trading,
              brokerage, collective investment, trust and underwriting) must be specified as well as the range of
              covered products (securities, exchange-traded derivatives, over-the counter derivatives, and the type of
              CIS business (Article 229) or trust business (Article 103(1)). The class of investors must also be specified,




 134
                                                                                                  REPUBLIC OF KOREA



                 and the authorization pertains specifically to the approved “authorized business units”. Banks and
                 insurance companies have to be authorized for financial investment business, if they carry out any of the
                 above mentioned activities (see the introduction for the number and types of approved intermediaries).

                 Information on authorized financial investment business entities is available on the FSC website and in
                 the case of exchange members on the KRX website. If the firm, or its holding company, is also a public
                 company, additional information is available in the DART system.

                 Legal Form

                 The entity (except for foreign branches) authorized must be a stock company under the Commercial Act
                 (in the case of a broker) or a type of entity otherwise specified by the Enforcement Decree (see e.g.,
                 Principles 24 et seq. regarding collective investment business). Anyone engaging in electronic brokerage
                 (FSCMA Article 78) must also be a member of the KRX.

                 Other Criteria, Including Fitness and Propriety Criteria

                 Applicants for authorization (and/or changes to the authorized business units) must have:

                      Equity capital of at least KRW 500 million for each authorized business unit;
                      A feasible and sound business plan;
                      Proper human resources, including staff who hold the certifications of competence required for the
                       business conducted by the entity and fit and proper executives (directors), who are not subject to
                       statutory disqualification as set forth under Article 24 and major shareholders that are “financially
                       sound and socially credible”;
                      Appropriate physical facilities and sufficient IT system for the business authorized;
                      Systems for preventing conflicts of interest and other internal controls, which include e.g., a proper
                       internal audit function, a compliance officer with at least 10 years of work experience, outside
                       directors; and
                      Total assets of over KRW 2 trillion at the end of the preceding fiscal year (see Articles 13 and 25–28
                       of the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA).
                 Banks and Insurance Companies

                 In general, according to the FSC and FSS, banks and insurance companies that engage in securities
                 business are subject to the same requirements as securities companies. Certain differences may apply to
                 products not described as securities products and the governance requirements pertaining to banks and
                 insurance companies are covered by their own licensing requirements, not those for financial investment
                 business entities under the FSCMA. Additionally, there are some products, such as insurance variable
                 annuity products indexed to securities, whose distribution is covered by insurance rather than securities
                 conduct of business law25 (see Principles 1 and 31).

                 Any person located in Korea, including a foreign branch or business office, must register its advisory and
                 discretionary investment business. Such firms must have capital of KRW 100 million for each unit, fit and
                 proper executives and major shareholders, and appropriate number of professional advisors

     The scope of what is concurrent or incidental business may also be unclear.




                                                                                                                 135

                 qualified/certified by KOFIA as advisors, analysts, etc., as specified in regulations. Registrants (i.e.
                 investment advisors) are not permitted to directly deal (execute transactions) for clients; this must be
                 done by authorized persons.

                 However, persons engaging Koreans from offshore by telecommunication for offshore transactions are
                 not required to be authorized.

                 Authorization26 Process

                 The process is a two stage process with specified time limits (subject to the ability of the FSC to request
                 additional information). It involves (as in some other jurisdictions) a period of public exposure of the
                 application, which permits the gathering of information from the market of objections or potential
                 disqualifications not otherwise surfaced in the vetting process. The process also involves a review of the
                 facilities and the IT and an “on the papers” review of the business plan, strategy and other matters such
                 as written internal control, compliance and risk management provisions. In some cases, a more complete
                 on-site visit can be conducted rather than just a facilities verification. However, relevant staff indicated
                 that the FSS typically did not conduct “nursery visits” early in the life of a newly authorized financial
                 investment business entity, and often did not audit new licensees until they had had three years of
                 operations. The authorization if granted (or denied) by the FSC and subject to judicial review, but the
                 processing is handled by FSS.

                 Ongoing Requirements

                 Requirements must be met on an ongoing basis. Any organizational change or acquisition (merger,
                 exchange of stocks, and transfer of business) must be approved (FSCMA Article 217). Periodic financial
                 reporting is required (see Principle 30 about compliance with capital requirements). Further, a change of
                 an executive or of stock holdings of a large shareholder or its related persons (by at least one percent),
                 opening or closure of a branch, addition or transfer of an authorized business unit or line, and many
                 other specified matters must be reported immediately.

                 Denial, Suspension or Revocation

                 Denials may be appealed, but the bases for reversal of a denial are limited. Once granted, in addition to
                 the potential for suspension or revocation of the authorization or registration for violating various
                 securities laws, rules or regulations, authorizations and registrations may also be withdrawn if a condition
                 is breached, the application was false, or the party does not comply with an order of the FSC or fails to
                 meet financial soundness requirements. Upon revocation, the business must be dissolved.

                  
                 Record-keeping

                 All business records must be retained on a specified schedule for at least three years FSCMA Article 60).

                 Trust Business

                 Significant business is conducted through trusts that are not constructed under the rules relating to
                 collective investment schemes (see Principles 24 to 27) or under the specific requirements for

     This process is somewhat more extensive than the registration process, which is separately articulated in the law.

                discretionary investment business. As the trusts are managed by brokers in their own names as the legal
                owners (in contrast to discretionary investment business where the client is the legal owner), there is the
                potential risk of abuse of customer funds and of a lack of appropriate arrangements to cover other risks
                addressed by requirements on collective investment business or discretionary investment business more
                generally.

Assessment      Fully Implemented

Comments        The observations on trust business have not impacted the rating on this Principle, but have been taken
                into account in the discussion on Principles 1, 31 and 32.

Principle 30. There should be initial and ongoing capital and other prudential requirements for market intermediaries
              that reflect the risks that the intermediaries undertake.

Description     Capital Calculations and Reports

                In order to be authorized a financial investment business entity must meet the basic minimum capital
                requirement on a business unit by business unit basis. According to the FSC, this requirement also applies
                to banks and insurance companies that apply for authorization/registration of financial investment
                business. Articles 30 and 31 of the FSCMA also require the maintenance of net operating capital
                consistent with the financial soundness of the business enterprise on a continuous basis. Assets that
                constitute good capital are “discounted” in accordance with applicable guidance similar to the type of
                provisioning rules applied to banks, with reserves of up to 100 percent required in some cases, as
                described below. The granting of margin loans is limited to 100 percent of firm equity capital and up to
                no more than 40 percent of the value of the security margined, 30 percent in the case of on-line trading
                and 25 percent in the case of

                Short-term money market transactions. There is extensive guidance on assessing risk, and each of credit,
                liquidity and market risk are given consideration.

                Capital must be calculated daily, and reported monthly (by the end of the following month). Reports
                must calculate gross risks and net capital. Quarterly reports (due 45 days after quarter end) reviewed by
                an auditor are also required to be filed and posted on the financial investment business entity’s website.
                Records of these reports must be maintained for one year by brokers, and the reports themselves are
                contained in the electronic reporting system indefinitely. Records of investors’ trading (10 years) and
                proprietary trading (3 years) are maintained for different time periods (see e.g., FSCMA Article 60).

                Early Warning

                The capital requirement is based on a net capital ratio calculated as net capital divided by risk27. The early
                warning level is 150 percent of the minimum required amount. Early warning notices for reductions in
                capital or reductions of 10 percent must be filed immediately. Haircuts are not specified, but rather the
                financial investment business entity is to value asset quality by categories ranging from normal (0.5),
                precautionary (2), doubtful (75) or estimated loss (100), with the parenthetical numbers reflecting the
                requisite required provisioning. (KRX however applies a haircut to collateral received in connection with
                clearing—see Principle 37). These numbers are related to the cost of liquidating the asset and recovering
                its value, if need be (see FSS Handbook 2012). The Regulations on Financial Investment Business include
                comprehensive guidance on computing capital in Chapter II, which contains guidance on the

 investment products.

            measurement of market, credit, liquidity, operational, interest rate and foreign exchange risks. This
            guidance also permits modelling, subject to approval by the FSC.

            The FSS applies RAMS to evaluate the financial soundness of financial investment business entities that
            engage in underwriting, brokerage and trading. This system is explained in a lengthy manual that
            contains additional extensive guidance on risk measurement and is provided to all financial investment
            business entities engaged in securities brokerage or trading (see also the discussion of Principles 6 and
            12). There is no similar manual for assessing the risks of collective investment business entities, which
            ostensibly are exposed to different risks and have different risk profiles. The insurance and banking
            institutions supervised by the FSS are also reviewed against other standards. The various supervisory
            teams do not actively share observations about the transmission or interconnection of risks between
            related companies.

            Credit Risk

            Article 4-34 of the Regulation on Financial Investment Business requires investment firms and brokers to
            file daily reports on credit extensions to KOFIA according to KOFIA’s guidelines and KOFIA to report to
            the FSS credit extensions in excess of the established limit.

            In addition to KOFIA’s compliance monitoring, the FSS assesses the adequacy of credit extensions by
            investment traders and brokers during its on-site examinations and takes supervisory actions if this
            regulatory limit is breached.

            Corrective Actions and Timing for Rectifications

            Corrective actions for firms which fall below required capital levels range from a management
            improvement recommendation (such as restriction on new business, establishment of bad debt
            allowance, or disposal of non-performing assets) to requirements to close businesses, replace officers, or
            transfer business or accounts, when the capital level falls below 120 percent or the firm’s qualitative
            control rating is 4 or lower (see discussion in Principle 31). In the case capital level falls to 100 percent,
            the authorities would issue an order to suspend business execution by officers or appoint an
            administrator. In either the case of a recommendation or an order, the firm would have two months to
            develop a management improvement plan.

            Customer Funds

            These various requirements and remedial provisions do not reflect risks emanating from misuse of client
            assets. There is however the Act on the Structural Improvement of the Financial Industry that addresses
            the wind down of institutions whose ongoing operations are threatened by a scandal or financial losses
            (see also Principles 32 and 37).

            Additionally, under Article 74 of the FCSMA, an investment trader or investment broker is required to
            separate an investor's fund (referring to money deposited by investors in connection with trading of
            financial investment instruments and other transactions) from its proprietary property and place it in a
            deposit or trust account with the Korea Securities Finance Company (KSFC), see the diagram below:

              Group Risk

              There is a Financial Holding Company Act, but it does not apply to all groups, and hence financial
              investment business entities within groups that are not covered by this Act are not subject to group risk
              rating and supervision.

              The Financial Holding Company Act applies to the financial holding companies that have been approved
              by the FSC and their subsidiaries. The term “financial holding company” means any company that has
              total assets of KRW 100 billion or more and control over one or more financial institutions, and whose
              main business is to control financial institutions28 or other companies that are closely related to the
              operation of a financial institution.29

              Regulated financial subsidiaries of a holding company that is not covered by the Financial Holding
              Company Act (non-financial holding company) are not subject to the Financial Holding Company Act.
               When the aggregate book value of a non-financial holding company’s ownership in the share of its
              financial subsidiaries exceeds 50 percent of the company’s total assets - thereby meeting the qualifying
              criteria for a financial holding company - the company is required to report to the FSC, and either
              become a financial holding company by obtaining approval from the FSC, or reduce its stock ownership

               in financial subsidiaries to below the 50 percent threshold within one year from the day the share
               ownership exceeded 50 percent. Only the holding companies that are approved by the FSC to become a
               financial holding company are subject to the Financial Holding Company Act.

               Other Controls

               There are certain restrictions on financial investment business entities owning securities issued by a
               major shareholder, granting credit to major shareholders (to the lesser of KRW 100,000,000 or the one
               year salary) or owning stocks, bonds or notes issued by a related person in excess of 8 percent of
               shareholder’s equity (FSS Handbook).

Assessment     Fully Implemented

Comments       The rating is fully implemented based on the ability of the authorities to oversee the capital regime in a
               timely way and the lack of failures. Nonetheless, the time frame for filing financial reports, reviewed off-
               site, seems too long in the case of financial investment business entities as the risks such firms undertake
               are primarily with respect to the trading and holding of financial instruments directly and the credit risk
               exposures such firms have to customers that are actively trading (see statistics on volatility and turnover
               above) and/or in the short term financing markets. This issue was also mentioned in the 2002 IOSCO
               assessment. The impact of the time frame is mitigated in that capital must be calculated daily and can be
               called for prior to a reporting period, monthly reports are now required and a reduction of assets of 10
               percent and quantitative early warning events must be immediately reported as must other specified
               material events such as the departure of a compliance officer. Two months is also a lengthy time to
               submit a performance improvement plan in the event that a firm is actually at the minimum capital level,
               taking into consideration best practice and the risk of a loss of confidence or the potential risk of loss to
               customers (in this respect see Principle 32). The FSC does appear in practice to prevent such companies
               from taking on new business.

Principle 31. Market intermediaries should be required to establish an internal function that delivers compliance with
              standards for internal organization and operational conduct, with the aim of protecting the interests of
              clients and their assets and ensuring proper management of risk, through which management of the
              intermediary accepts primary responsibility for these matters.

Assessment     Broadly Implemented

Comments       The documentation, planning and execution of on-site examinations are extensive and thoughtful. The
               FSC and FSS should ensure that sufficient monitoring is directed to oversight of the allocation of trades
               and handling of orders at the brokers. In connection with the development of a more formal consumer
               protection regime, as discussed above, review of the fairness of the outcomes of the dispute resolution
               process might also be considered.

Principle 32. There should be a procedure for dealing with the failure of a market intermediary in order to minimize
              damage and loss to investors and to contain systemic risk.

Description    Contingency Plan

               The FSC and the FSS do not have a documented contingency plan which addresses the potential failure
               of a market intermediary (see also Principle 37 about the accessibility of the applicable rules). The FSC
               and FSS do however have substantial powers related to the management of a market failure, timely
               information on exposures available from the KRX, and access to more than one arrangement related to
               protecting customers’ funds and completing pending settlements. Although the KRX performs some
               scenario testing of its clearing processes, it is not clear that the FSC/FSS arrangements have been tested
               for adequacy using various securities market scenarios since the recent crisis.

              The exchange has detailed rules related to posting of margin and default, as does the KSD. The
              sophistication of these was enhanced in 2010, when options volatility and implied volatility were added
              to the margin calculation. Extension of credit by brokers to customers is overseen by KOFIA. The
              exchange also has rules for correcting error trades and how the loss (if any) will be apportioned/borne. It
              can in certain cases cause cancellations and is looking into developing a so-called kill switch. There also is
              an explicit procedure for dealing with settlement fails in equity securities.

              Early Warning Systems and Related Risk Mitigation Powers

              The processes for minimizing the damage and risk of loss to customers due to the failure of a market
              intermediary are:

                  Ongoing monitoring, price limits on individual securities, and circuit breakers;
                  Risk rating through off-site and on-site analysis and the application of “trigger events”-that is events
                   (market moves, economic changes, capital reduction, early warning and other material reporting)
                   that trigger enhanced or more intensified review of the firms;
                  Measures to support the conclusion of settlement, if a firm fails or there are excessive fails to
                   deliver; and
                  A deposit insurance regime that applies to all financial investment business entity deposits (see
                   Deposit Protection Act Article 2 (j))30. Funds deposited by securities customers thus have a certain
                   level of protection as a matter of law (KRW 50,000,000 per investor) in the event of the insolvency of
                   a broker.

              Further, the exchange maintains both a joint compensation fund and a fidelity fund and there are
              exchange rules establishing a waterfall of resources for addressing troubled firms, which rules and
              procedures are not readily accessible to the public as stated in Principle 37, although the KRX recently
              posted its self-assessment under the CPSS-IOSCO Principles, which contains some of this information.

              The FSS oversight program applies an early warning system trigger of 150 percent of the net capital ratio,
              after which more intensive monitoring and potential limitation of riskier activities occurs. The FSS, which
              is the prudential supervisor, also reviews firms’ periodic financial reporting using other information about
              risk intended to expose a firm, whose financial situation is weakening, including the measures detailed in
              Principle 30 above. In consequence, some firms are on a “watch list” or risk management performance
              improvement plan due to their risk rating. Firms are accountable to the KRX and KSD for the completion
              of transactions and the funding of executed trades, which become “locked in” upon matching.

              In addition to providing insurance the KDIC may join on-site inspections, where it believes it has an
              interest and may engage in restructuring actions. The FSC, in addition to requiring a firm to take
              corrective actions, can act to remove management and to appoint an administrator under certain
              circumstances. The FSC reported, however, that no financial investment business entity has failed in the
              past ten years, due to which there is no practical experience from applying these measures.

               Restructuring

               The specific provisions relative to restructuring are contained in the Act on the Structural Improvement of
               the Financial Industry. They require that where any financial institution’s financial status falls short of
               required standards, the FSC must recommend, request or order the financial institution concerned or its
               executives to take the following measures or order it to furnish its implementation plan in order to
               prevent insolvency, and promote the sound management of the financial institution:

                   Admonition, warning, reprimand or salary reduction in relation to the financial institution concerned
                    and its executives and employees;
                   Capital increase or capital deduction, disposal of property holdings or reduction in inventory and
                    downsizing;
                   Ban on acquisition of high-risk assets;
                   Suspension of executives’ performance of duties or appointment of management supervisors to
                    perform executives’ duties;
                   Amortization or consolidation of stocks;
                   Suspension of all or part of business;
                   Merger or third-party takeover of the financial institution concerned;
                   Transfer of business or contracts related to financial transactions, such as deposits or loans; or
                   Other measures equivalent to those listed above, which are deemed necessary to improve any
                    financial institution’s financial soundness.

               There must be compelling circumstances that there will be injury to creditors for transfer of all business
               or contracts to occur.

Assessment     Broadly Implemented

Comments       Korea is in the vanguard in that its provisions for deposit insurance and for restructuring are applied to
               all financial institutions, including financial investment business entities that are investment brokers or
               traders. Nonetheless, the FSS, FSC, and other related agencies with responsibilities for addressing default
               situations should consider joint crisis simulation and default remediation exercises taking into account
               the recent global crisis and also new Principle 6 and document their contingency plans.

                The period for returning to capital compliance of two months permitted under the law seems to be
               excessive in light of best practices and the volatility of the Korean market (see Principle 30).
                                          Principles for the Secondary Markets

 Principle 33. The establishment of trading systems including securities exchanges should be subject to regulatory
               authorization and oversight.

Description    Establishment

               By law, at the time of the assessment a single exchange market in the form of a stock company (Articles
               373 and 386 FSCMA) was operative in Korea. KRX is for profit exchange, but it is not listed or publicly
               traded. As of December 2012, KRX had 94 members (see also Principle 9). The law prescribes the
               governance structure of the market, including the provision for a Market Supervision Committee (Article
               402) and the duties and responsibilities relative to the operation of the market, as well as the role of the
               KRX with respect to clearing and settlement of securities and futures (see Articles 380-384, 388 FSCMA




 142
                                                                                                REPUBLIC OF KOREA



                 regarding governance and Articles 377 and 378 regarding duties and clearing).

                 The law also unifies the pre-existing markets within the KRX. Thus, the KRX contains multiple platforms
                 (KOSPI, KOSDAQ, KOFEX and as of July 2013 KONEX), provides for clearing and non-clearing members
                 (Articles 386–388) and has responsibilities relative to listing regulations and timely/continuing disclosure
                 (Articles 390–392). Pursuant to these provisions, KRX trades multiple products including equities,
                 government, corporate and market stabilization bonds, exchange- listed third party warrants (ELW)31,
                 ETFs, stock index futures and options on multiple indexes, and interest rate futures on the Treasury bonds
                 among others on three different platforms. Overnight trading links for KOSPI index futures and options
                 have been developed with Eurex (since 2010) and CME (since 2009). Via these links, qualified individuals
                 with a clearing arrangement with a KRX member can trade KOSPI 200 futures overnight using the Unified
                 System for Global Trading (UGS) of the KRX member linked through CME Globex. The front end of the
                 UGS is the Home Trading System.

                 The organization of the KRX is as follows:




                 Financial Integrity of Trading and Clearing Operations

                 In addition to posting the applicable margin depending upon the type of interest traded, members must
                 contribute to both a fidelity fund to repay debt likely to be incurred in the course of undertaking


31
     These have been substantially reduced recently.




                                                                                                               143

            securities transactions, and to a joint compensation fund. Separate joint funds are maintained for the
            derivatives and the securities market (see Articles 394–396 FSCMA). The foregoing funds are available to
            satisfy debts to customers and the exchange in preference to other creditors in the event of a default as a
            matter of explicit provisions of the FSCMA and exchange rules. The KRX effectively acts as a CCP for
            exchange traded securities pre settlement and for futures. According to the legal community, the current
            treatment of finality and of customer funds is permitted under the relevant insolvency law. The exchange
            also provides that, once executed on the platform, trades are locked in and cannot be reversed.

            Per the KRX Fact Book, the KRX joint compensation fund is funded at KRW 200 billion each for securities
            and derivatives respectively and there is a KRW 400 billion settlement reserve (fidelity fund). The KRX also
            maintains a line of credit of KRW 1.5 trillion. Information provided suggests that for the settlement of
            OTC share trading, KSD has a KRW 50 billion settlement fund and KRW 200 billion in reserve. The KRX
            itself also has KRW 50 billion in capital.
             
            Mechanisms to Address Market Disruption and Financial Instability

            The rules of the exchange as approved by the FSC limit price fluctuation on an equity-by-equity basis to
            ±15 percent from the previous day’s close. The KRX also employs a circuit breaker mechanism. If the
            KOSPI overall declines10 percent from the previous day’s close, and the situation persists for one minute,
            trading will halt for 20 minutes. If the price falls 5 percent, the KRX will suspend the receipt of orders for
            five minutes. The KRX has the authority under the FSCMA and its own rules to suspend trading in the
            event of emergencies, such as natural disasters or sudden significant changes in economic conditions
            and for market stabilization (“overheated” trading after an IPO) and other purposes.

            In addition to circuit breakers and side cars and other arrangements discussed in Principle 37, which
            protect the functioning of the market, the KRX has rules which permit it to suspend trading to permit
            more demand to develop to achieve a better equilibrium price and to prevent distortions from the
            possible leakage of information or other problems. These arrangements are implemented by exchange
            rule subject to FSC and FSS oversight.

            Business Conduct

            Exchange rules related to business conduct as required by the FSCMA prohibit unsound business
            conduct, such as front running (see for example KOSPI Enforcement Rules). The exchange may request
            data from members to investigate market misconduct (Article 404 FSCMA). If the member fails to
            cooperate the exchange may suspend membership or restrict transactions (Article 404(3)). The exchange
            can also request that a member dismiss an employee. The FSS, FSC and SFC can also request information
            relative to their mandates.

            Fairness of Order Execution Procedures and Access

            The FSC has the authority to review the trading algorithm and the trading results for fairness. In principle
            the exchange provides, and the law requires, equivalent access for customers. Neither the KRX nor the
            FSS, however, have introduced any special restrictions relative to algorithmic trading, other than checking
            the integrity of order routing systems and pre-trade controls. Algorithmic trading constitutes a significant
            amount of the volume. The rules of the exchange are public and available on the exchange website. The
            exchange also maintains a disclosure system that contains disclosures filed by issuers (see Principle 16).
            This information is available to the general public. Direct access to the exchange is limited to authorized
            entities, and persons whose business they guarantee. Initial responsibility for exposures is with the
            member (see also Principles 31 and 37).

Clients may use the APIs of brokers through whom they trade on the KRX to place orders electronically
using either the Internet or a HTS. According to the KRX and KOFIA, 60 percent of all trading activity on
the exchange occurs through HTS. These systems permit customers to enter their orders directly for
routing via the account of the broker. There are no foreign omnibus accounts, so foreign customers must
be disclosed to local brokers.

Oversight

In addition to the matters discussed in Principle 9 above, the FSC approves exchange rules, including
those related to products such as ETFs and to listings and delistings (Articles 409 and 412 FSCMA). The
FSC also reviews the IT systems of the market, and oversees the role of the KRX in maintaining fair,
efficient and transparent markets and in enforcing compliance with its business regulations. Finally, the
FSC monitors the effectiveness of KRX market surveillance and operation of systems required by law such
as dispute resolution. The exchange’s requirements for issuer disclosures are discussed in Principle 16.

The exchange surveils market activity in real time, and the FSS reviews trading on a batch basis and also
uses a KRX terminal. Audit trail records are required to be maintained for 10 years.

Other Markets or Trading Systems

ATS or MTF were not permitted in Korea at the time of the on-site visit, but enabling legislation has
recently been adopted. This expansion may eventually permit more extensive supervision of the current
OTC market. Since 2010 two additional markets besides KRX have operated under the auspices of KOFIA,
which are described as OTC markets: the OTC bond market and the Freeboard. The latter is a market in
unlisted very small cap equities, where prices are quoted on the system and negotiated usually by
messaging. The value of daily trading is USD 0.09 million (see also Introduction and Principle 9). Prices
must be registered before settlement in the case of the OTC bond market. There are no cross listed
securities among the Korean exchange markets and OTC markets, and only about 17 listed foreign issues.

There is also a provision that permits brokers to operate electronic brokerage systems. Article 78 of the
FSCMA permits internal trading, that is electronic securities brokerage at the latest price on the securities
exchange or a uniform price determined by a formula prescribed by Ordinance (which is a Volume
Weighted Average Price calculated from certain specified transactions). These provisions also relate to
block trading (or negotiated trading generally, whether during regular or after hours (see Principle 35).

Ownership Structure

By law, transfer of 5 percent or more of the stocks of KRX requires FSC approval. KRX as of its 2012
Annual Report had 37 shareholders, all of which are members except the KSFC and KOFIA. Between them,
the 37 shareholders held all but 924,872 treasury shares of the 20 million shares of KRX. KRX wholly owns
Koscom which sells securities operations systems, and the majority of KSD. It also has an interest of 11.35
percent in the KSFC and holds a 49 percent share in the Laos exchange.

                 Composition of the Market

                 The market is a heavily retail market (more than 60 percent of trading activity), and the issues traded
                 have on average a free float of between 30 and 50 percent (and as much as 70 percent for some
                 securities). About 20 percent of daily trading activity is that of foreign investors, and 10 percent is
                 contributed by investment trusts. Institutional investors contribute barely 5 percent. Insurance funds hold
                 less than 1 percent of outstanding securities and banks less than 5 percent. The largest securities contract
                 in terms of market capitalization and trading volume is the share of Samsung Electronics. The KOSPI 200
                 futures and options contracts are particularly active and are also traded overnight through links with
                 both CME and Eurex. The average number of daily contracts traded in the KOSPI 200 is 7.4 million32.
                 Block trading is a minor part of trading activity, but the prices for blocks, which need only be of USD
                 50,000 on KOSPI irrespective of the security traded are not reported (see Principle 35). Only the volume is
                 reported at the end of the day.

     This compares with only slightly more than this for a full year when the last report was done.

                The Freeboard equity market has 40 members, as of end 2012 traded 52 equities and had a market
                capitalization of USD 554 million, of which the 10 largest companies constituted about 80 percent. The
                number, amount of trading and capitalization has decreased significantly in the last three years. 99
                percent of all trading on this market is by retail participants.

                In the OTC bond market, although the system permits for all quotations to be entered on the system,
                transactions may be negotiated by messaging outside the system and reporting them to KOFIA prior to
                settlement. The rules require reporting within 15 minutes of the trade.

Assessment      Fully Implemented

Comments        The clearing and settlement arrangements including the “waterfall” should be prominently displayed on
                both the KRX and the KSD websites and linked through the FSC website as well (see Principles 32 and
                37).

Principle 34.   There should be ongoing regulatory supervision of exchanges and trading systems which should aim to
                ensure that the integrity of trading is maintained through fair and equitable rules that strike an
                appropriate balance between the demands of different market participants.

Description     Ongoing Compliance

                Both the KRX and the FSS monitor the ongoing compliance of market participants and issuers with the
                requirements of the FSCMA and the KRX rules and procedures. Effectively, the KRX is the front line
                overseer of the market, and also accountable for compliance with its own trading, listing and ongoing
                disclosure requirements as approved by the FSC.

                The governance of the KRX oversight function is that the Market Oversight Division (i.e. staff of the
                exchange) reports to the Market Supervision Committee, a structure required as a matter of law to



                                                                                                              147

            ensure that the regulatory function of the exchange is insulated from the commercial function. KOFIA has
            a similarly insulated self-regulatory function.

            Trade Monitoring

            The exchange monitors trading in both real time and by batch using proprietary parameters and
            exception reporting. The KRX system is known as the Intermarket Surveillance Information System (ISIS).
            The FSC, SFC and FSS all have access to records of the exchange as necessary to oversee compliance with
            applicable law and appropriate maintenance of an audit trail. Trading records are maintained for 10 years.

            Supervision by the Financial Services Commission/Financial Supervisory Service

            As do other regulated entities, the KRX files multiple reports with the FSC/FSS. In addition the FSC,
            through delegation to the FSS, can request additional reports from the exchange and can conduct an
            inspection of the exchange (see FSCMA Articles 410 and 419)

            The FSS conducts biennial inspections of the exchange (see Principle 9 above). It or the FSC also can take
            action against the exchange and exchange officials (Article 416 FSCMA), including:

               In the case of executives or officials:

                      Suspension from office;
                      Request for dismissal; and
                      Disciplinary or cautionary warning.

               In the case of the exchange itself:

                      Suspend all or part of business for up to six months;
                      Order transfer of a contract;
                      Order correction or suspension of a violation;
                      Order publication of measures taken to correct a violation; and
                      Issue an institutional warning or caution or other measure permitted by the Enforcement Decree
                       of the FSCMA.

            Officers of the SFC, FSS and KRX may also convene a council of agencies to investigate and examine
            unfair trading practices, coordinate investigative policies and organize procedures for the deterrence,
            detection and investigation of unfair trading practices on a continuous basis (Regulation on Investigation
            of Capital Markets Section 41).

            Practice

            A review of files of on-site inspections conducted by the FSS indicated that the FSS examines the KRX’s
            operations and regulatory program in detail to determine that it is properly fulfilling its self-regulatory
            function and maintaining a fair and equitable market. In this regard, the FSC, as recommended by the FSS
            examiners and the Governor of the FSS, may provide significant recommendations related to the integrity
            of those functions, investor protection and the adequacy of exchange management and supervision. The
            FSC requests the opening of the examination of the exchange, which is a unique type of examination
            with different procedural requirements than the on-site inspection of a financial investment business

              entity. The planning for the examination for which files were reviewed took into consideration monthly
              and other business reports, complaints, market information, and unofficial sources.

              The documentation for the examination conducted in 2010 consumes eight volumes. The focus of the
              examination included: adequacy of personnel, rules for trading and listing, operation of the market
              surveillance system, governance, and specific issues including listing of Chinese companies. Transcripts of
              certain of the interviews conducted are maintained. The overall examination took 24 people over 15
              business days. The post examination report goes to the Senior Deputy Governor in charge of the subject
              matter. Ultimately the Enforcement Review Committee and the Secretariat of the FSC review the evidence
              of the matters for which recommendations are proposed. The final recommendations are decided by the
              FSC, although some limited matters can be decided by the Governor of the FSS (see also Principles 9, 33
              and 37). In this respect, recommendations for certain improvements and follow-up were made.

              Information Technology Systems

              The FSS conducts reviews of KRX IT connections. To ensure the safety and soundness of the financial
              system, the FSS has a Management Evaluation System for financial institutions, and examinations under
              the system include an examination of IT operations. KRX indicates that it strives to provide equal
              response times to the extent possible, and that it discloses latency in links and other arrangements (see
              also the Electronic Financial Transactions Act relative to the security of IT facilities servicing electronic
              financial transactions more broadly).

              Transparency

              The KRX has an informative website that contains a variety of information about the markets it operates,
              the membership of the KRX, its rules and requirements, statistics and other data, and publications. It also
              runs KOSCOM that produces additional information. Fact books, information on contract terms and
              conditions and other information are available on the website. The KRX has a comprehensive set of
              operating, regulatory, and dispute resolution requirements available through its web site, for each of its
              markets (see also Principle 35). It however does not routinely make statistics on its member actions
              public (see Principle 36)

Assessment    Fully Implemented

Comments      More in house capacity at the FSS to monitor exchange trading and related IT support would ensure the
              continuing ability of the FSS to properly oversee the trading systems operating in Korea. This will become
              increasingly important, if more trading systems are permitted and as new, complex, and possibly more
              risky products such as inverse and synthetic ETFs are traded.

              The process for conducting the examination, while very professional, is subject to an internal review
              procedure that is difficult to parse. The structure of the different examinations and resulting exception
              and sanctioning process should be made substantially more transparent (see also Principles 2, 4 and 12).

Principle 35. Regulation should promote transparency of trading.

Description   The KRX system displays an array of bids and offers in real time to participants.

              KRX also provides prices on a deferred basis electronically. In addition it publishes daily trading volume,
              daily settlement prices, and the highest, lowest and closing prices of securities and of exchange traded
              derivatives and other information as may be specified by the FSS or by Article 364(2) of the Enforcement
              Decree of the FSCMA.

                  More specifically, the exchange rules (§101) require that the KRX makes public the market prices, etc.,
                  which correspond to the following items:

                      Current price, opening price, highest price, lowest price, and closing price;
                      Trading volume and trading value33;
                      Closing prices of the previous day or base prices;
                      Ex-dividend, ex-rights, ex-distribution or ex-interest; and
                      The quotation information and other data that are stipulated in the Enforcement Rules of the
                       FSCMA, including the expected matching price during the quotation receiving hours for single price
                       auction (e.g. open), expected best bid and offer prices, and the expected best bid and offer prices
                       during the quotation receiving hours for multiple price auction.

                  The KRX also has specific rules for block trades in the equity markets, which are placed using a block
                  trading facility during the regular trading hours and thereafter. These rules require that the price is within
                  the price band (which is 30 points). In the case of certain periods (at the open, after hours), the price
                  must be established by the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of prices produced within a certain
                  time period. Blocks are reported at the end of the trading day, but only the volume not the price of the
                  block is reported. Block sizes are relatively low: USD 50,000 for the KOSPI and USD 20,000 for the
                  KOSDAQ. According to the information received from the KRX, block volume is very low—less than one
                  per cent of overall trading value. Even with a pricing formula, this reporting model does not meet
                  international best practices with respect to transparency, because the price of the transactions is not
                  reported. Further the block size is very small and uniform for all shares independent of their liquidity,
                  which raises further questions as to the overall purpose of this trading vehicle (see also Article 78 of the
                  FSCMA).

                  Over-the-Counter Transactions

                  In addition to the bonds traded on the KRX platform, the bond trade reporting service offered through
                  KOFIA provides for a platform where all bids and offers could be displayed. Anecdotal evidence suggests
                  however that prices are reported post trade at the time trades are settled in/reported to the KSD. The
                  pricing of bonds more generally is aided by the use of four bond pricing agencies, which value illiquid
                  securities as more specifically described under Principle 23. The bond market also makes use of some
                  primary dealers. The overwhelming amount of bond trading is in government bonds. IOSCO however
                  does not have comprehensive guidance on such pricing.

Assessment        Fully Implemented

Comments          Despite the deficiencies of the block trading regime, this Principle was assessed as Fully Implemented
                  due to the low volume of block trading. However, further work should be undertaken to address the
                  deficiencies of the current block trading regime.

                  More effort could also be expended to address timely reporting of OTC bond trades, though the
                  experience in Korea is similar to that of other platforms, where dealers are reluctant to take on risk
                  pending conclusion of a trade.




 33
      How this is interpreted with respect to block trades has not been confirmed.

Principle 36. Regulation should be designed to detect and deter manipulation and other unfair trading practices.

Description     The FSCMA prohibits insider trading and misappropriation of information and requires the return of short
                swing profits (FSCMA Article 172) and reporting of significant shareholdings by executives and
                shareholders (Article 173); prohibits misuse of material non-public information (Articles 174 and 175) and
                manipulation and other unfair trading activity, such as the use of a scheme or device to defraud, and the
                introduction of false information into the market (Articles 176 and 178). See also the related Enforcement
                Decree (Article 355).

                See Principle 12 for the assessment of the effectiveness of the enforcement of the above requirements by
                the FSS, SFC, FSC and the public prosecutor’s office.

                Exchange Enforcement Rules

                However, KRX also has its own rules for members and a real time trade surveillance and disclosure
                system that can support the detection of such violations, as well as comprehensive investigative powers.
                Under its rules the KRX can take action and request its members also to take action against offending
                employees.

                Subject to review by the FSC, the exchange Enforcement Rules (see VIII § 3 and 4) prohibit a number of
                practices that the market has determined to be inconsistent with customer protection or the fairness,
                equity and credibility of the market. These include for example:

                     Front running;
                     Wash trading;
                     Banging the close;

                     Guarantees against loss;
                     Recommendations for customers directly contrary to proprietary positions taken fairly
                      contemporaneously;

                     Submitting quotations in a manner that gives a false appearance of a price;
                     Excessive quotations (and related cancellations);
                     Using a third party to improperly obtain a gain or a loss for one’s own account against a customer;
                      and
                     Providing false information to the market. 34

                The KRX is required to report violations of exchange rules that are also violations of the FSCMA, but
                according to the KRX rules, such a report would not preclude the KRX from bringing its own actions. The
                exchange can take disciplinary action for specific violations, for failure to comply with actions taken by
                the disciplinary committee pursuant to the law, for obstruction or non-cooperation with an investigation
                or inspection or refusal to provide information.




 34
   Effectively, the specification of these types of offenses (with more particularity in the actual rules) are intended to
 give more content as to what is a practice not tolerated by the market and considered by it to be detrimental to
 customer protection and equitable principles of trade.




                                                                                                                       151
REPUBLIC OF KOREA



            Sanctions by the exchange can include:

                 Expulsion from membership;
                 Suspension of membership privileges or trading privileges in whole or in part;

                 Imposition of a fine amounting a minimum of KRW 10 million and a maximum of KRW 1 billion; and
                 A warning notice or a caution.

            In 2010–2012, the exchange conducted 565 investigations in its members to ensure that they comply
            with its rules. In 112 cases, disciplinary action was taken as a result of the investigation. Four cases were
            referred to the FSS, and 453 cases were closed without action.

            Insider Trading and Manipulation Case Referrals

            In case of suspected insider trading or market manipulation, the KRX does not take disciplinary action
            itself, but refers the cases to the FSS due to the penal nature of violations that can involve non-exchange
            participants as well as exchange members. In 2010–2012, the number and types of cases referred were:

              Cross-Border and Cross-Market Arrangements

              The FSC and FSS jointly are signatories of the IOSCO MMoU and 20 bilateral MoUs (see Principle 14) and
              the KRX itself has executed MoUs with other markets, for example, the Boca Declaration and
              arrangements with NYSE-Euronext. It also has surveillance arrangements pursuant to its links with the
              CME and Eurex to monitor position limits among other things and its Market Surveillance Committee has
              within its mandate overseeing relationships between the cash and derivatives markets.

              The KRX operates both the Korean derivatives and equity markets. In consequence there is coordination
              among other things of circuit breakers and other trading halts and information sharing on related risks.

Assessment    Fully Implemented

Comments      The deficiencies of the criminal enforcement process have been addressed under Principle 12 and have
              impacted the rating of that Principle.
              KRX could expand its powers over employee traders of members by requiring them to have some type of
              membership or other contractual obligation to follow the rules of the exchange.

Principle 37. Regulation should aim to ensure the proper management of large exposures, default risk and market
              disruption.

Description   Exchange-based Programs for Monitoring Exposures and Short Positions

              The exchange has multiple arrangements to monitor for, and to address, material exposures:

                  Real time trade monitoring;
                  Reports on short interest, in particular net short positions in excess of 0.01 percent of total issuance
                   (within three days of acquisition);
                  Up-tick rules;
                  Position limit requirements for derivatives;
                  Symmetric (up and down) individual security price limits;
                  Market wide circuit breakers;
                  Ability to call a trading halt;
                  Process of novation (which results in the exchange becoming the central counterparty);
                  Back-up systems of financial/liquidity support to address fails to deliver securities or to meet
                   obligations, such as margin, to the market;
                  Pre-funding of accounts and automatic liquidation for insufficient margin;
                  The ability to close out positions if a market participant refuses information to the exchange; and
                  Limitation of margin lending by brokers.

              The means for aggregating exposures is not however documented.

              Short-selling

              Beyond required notifications of net short interest, the law restricts naked short sales (FSCMA Article
              180). There is also an uptick rule. Short sales notifications are monitored and follow up procedures can
              limit a broker’s taking of short positions. There are exceptions for arbitrage activities and market making.




                                                                                                              153

            Rules 17 and 18 of the KRX business regulations provide more detail, particularly with respect to what is
            deemed “covered,” for which the stock must be subject to an “agreement to borrow.”

            Default Procedures and Resources for Redress of Defaults

            Exchange rules and the FSCMA contain the requirements as to the composition and valuation of member
            contributions to the compensation and fidelity funds (see Principle 32), the inability to encumber
            deposits (to create a security interest prior to that of the broker and the exchange) and the waterfall of
            resources and the order of their application in the event of default. However, this information is not
            readily accessible by reviewing the websites of the exchange, the KSD or the regulatory authorities and
            the definition of what constitutes a default is implied rather than stated. In this connection, the FSCMA
            and related KRX rules do provide that a clearing member is accountable to the KRX for its customer‘s
            default, and that the KRX members as a whole may be accountable under a common bond arrangement
            (the agreement to contribute to make up the short-fall in a specified percentage related to trading
            volume and size of the participant) to support the conclusion of settlement where an individual member
            is unable to do so.

            One issue that was raised by market participants was the risk management arrangement whereby KRX
            limits its risk to margined transactions (which can be undertaken with 30 percent deposit of the value of
            the security) via a process in which purchased securities are automatically sold if the margin is not timely
            paid. In their view, under certain adverse circumstances such sales could precipitate a price cascade that
            even with price limits and circuit breakers could be destabilizing. The Exchange and the FSS though
            believe that there would be means to take action in a crisis to stage such a sale if necessary.

            The following summarizes the distribution of clearing and settlement functions by product:

            Proprietary and customer denominated accounts. The underlying ownership of customer securities is
            only determinable from the books of the Investor Account Book managed by the broker. Similarly

                                                                                                        REPUBLIC OF KOREA



                   pledges of clients and participants are marked on the books of the participant for purposes of the KSD. If
                   such obligations are not properly recorded by the participant clearing member, this could raise issues as
                   to the ultimate ownership of securities, including pledged securities, and also potentially permit misuse.
                   The prohibition or risk management of intra-cycle trading is not expressly treated in the rules though the
                   new procedures for continuous net settlement (CNS) referred to below may mitigate some of these risks.
                   Not all shares and longer tenured bonds are in a dematerialized form, and though securities are required
                   to be accounted for in the true name of the broker and the underlying customer, anecdotally there have
                   been some issues related to the use of “extra-legal” nominees. This factor can also affect the ability to
                   completely identify exposures.

                   In 2012, the KSD introduced a CNS system, which has been subject to testing over a three month launch
                   period. This system is still in the initial implementation phases. Fails are permitted for delivery of shares,
                   but not for derivatives. Transactions in foreign securities must pass through a Foreign Member
                   Information System35 to permit the authorities to evaluate the extent of exposure to foreign currency.
                   Foreign securities must be held through accounts at the KSD opened by a local custodian of certain
                   approved international depositories, such as Euroclear and Clearstream.

                   Legal Powers

                   Legal practitioners indicate that the relatively new Act on Rehabilitation and Bankruptcy of 2007 provides
                   support for settlement finality and reinforces exchange protections. Further the Deposit Protection Act
                   provides USD 50,000 of protection for each account held in a separate capacity for any financial
                   institution which maintains accounts, including investment brokers and traders.

                   Under Article 416 of the FSCMA, the FSC can issue orders relative to the management of proprietary
                   property and the handling of the custody of customers’ funds. If it finds that “transactions cannot be
                   normally made” because of a natural disaster, warfare, disturbance, sudden and significant change in
                   economic conditions or other incidents, it can order the suspension of transactions, temporary closing of
                   securities markets, alteration of hours or other necessary measures (Article 413).

                   There is also an Act on the Structural Improvement of the Financial Industry that permits the authorities
                   to take corrective actions. In some cases, there is provision for up to six months or more to return to
                   compliance with applicable financial soundness regulations pursuant to a financial performance
                   improvement program (in this regard, see also the discussion under Principle 32).

                   Practice

                   The FSS also reviews off-site reports and material event reports on those exchange members that are
                   authorized financial institutions, as well as receives early warning notices and results of financial
                   inspections. The process for two-way sharing between the FSS, KRX and KSD with respect to managing
                   early warning information and financial fall-out related to excessive exposures or financial deterioration
                   at a member firm is not documented.

                   There is also no specific program to identify concentrated open exposures or to integrate market and
                   financial information.

Comments       Although KRX rules and regulations provide the legal basis for the management of a default, some key
               aspects could be articulated in a more extensive way, such as (a) the actions that an FMI can take when a
               default is declared; (b) the extent to which such actions are automatic or discretionary; (c) potential
               changes to the normal settlement practices, should these changes be necessary in extreme
               circumstances, to ensure timely settlement; (d) the management of transactions at different stages of
               processing; (e) the expected treatment of proprietary and customer transactions and accounts; (f) the
               probable sequencing of actions; (g) the roles, obligations, and responsibilities of the various parties,
               including non-defaulting participants; and (h) the existence of other mechanisms that may be activated
               to contain the impact of a default (see also Principle 32).

               The sufficiency of these measures should be kept under continuous review. In particular, the FSC and FSS
               should closely monitor the operation of the newly implemented CNS and intra-cycle trading, particularly
               to test various stress assumptions and to determine the extent to which failed trades or other failures
               could result in market disruption or exhaust pre-deposited resources and lending facilities requiring a
               draw on the common bond. The proper allocation of securities to customer accounts and the operation
               and security of pledging of securities should also be kept under review (see Principle 31). Any
               recommendations developed pursuant to the assessment of implementation of the Principles for
               Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) conducted separately at the KRX should also be taken into
               account. The securities settlement system should also be assessed for compliance with the CPSS-IOSCO
               PFMIs.

               The FSS and FSC should consider how to integrate information received off-site and on-site with respect
               to the financial condition of firms doing business in the capital markets with information on market
               volatility and changes in overall system liquidity developed as part of KRX market surveillance measures
               and any protocol for the analysis of systemic risk and related information sharing among sectors. More
               clarity of, and greater accessibility to, the description of events of default and compensation and redress
               of resource arrangements would assure the public and the direct clearing members are properly
               informed.

               Acceleration of plans to dematerialize all securities should be pursued.

               The time frame for resolving deteriorating financial institutions involves a period of forbearance that
               appears excessive for financial investment business entities that operate in the securities and futures
               markets, where continuing and immediate capacity to perform obligations to the market is critical (see
               also Principles 30 and 32).

                                   Principles Relating to Clearing and Settlement

Principle 38. Securities settlement systems and central counterparties should be subject to regulatory and supervisory
              requirements that are designed to ensure that they are fair, effective and efficient and that they reduce
              systemic risk.
