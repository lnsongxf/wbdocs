trycompetitiveness, and asset allocation, among
other things. Recent studies show that technology
is behind the separation of growth and gain in the
United States, called “decoupling,” where produc-
tivity growth has continued but employment has
stalled or declined as technology has reduced labor
needs.20 Similar conditions were found in the United
Kingdom.21 This situation is impacting labor mar-
kets beyond the traditional substitution of physical
jobs. Routine cognitive jobs are being eliminated in
the economy and substituted by technology and au-
tomation of tasks, not only in developed but also in
developing countries.22 A recent study shows labor
share of income has steadily declined in the econo-
my across both developed and developing countries,
including labor-intense countries (for example, China,
India, and Mexico which is being substituted by cap-
ital investment in technology).23

Changes in countries’ competitiveness and trade
patterns will affect labor-intense and developing
countries the most. Countries less prepared to adapt
to these structural changes will suffer in their com-
petitiveness. Seventy to 80 percent of the productiv-
ity gap between developed and developing countries
that we still see today can be explained by the lag in
transitioning to technology-led changes from previ-
ous economic restructuring processes (for example,
the 18th- and 20th-century industrial revolutions).24
If these technology-led trends continue and expand,
then developing countries’ recent competitive gains
from lower labor costs will decrease. Knowledge-in-

B/ Policies to prepare for the technology-led
transformation in the economy
Countries need to take action to adapt to this new environment. Similar to what happened in prior technol-
ogy-led economic transformations, countries that embrace and adapt to the transforming economic struc-
ture will be more prepare to increase their productivity and competitiveness more than those that do not.
Some countries are starting to react to the new economic changes, but most of them are developed coun-
tries, including the United States and some EU countries. If other countries want to remain competitive, they
will also need to proactively adapt their economies to a predominately knowledge-based economy, where
innovation and networks of open collaboration multiply economic effects.

The main policy areas, which leading countries are focusing on, are the following:

• Adapting education to provide practical skills for a predominately knowledge-based economy
• Promoting the development of local innovation ecosystems
• Fostering entrepreneurship that creates new sectors and businesses
• Creating innovation networks and collaborative environments (for example, innovation labs) for existing
  core and traditional industries to remain competitive.

Infrastructure to support these policies will also be critical, as broadband connectivity becomes an enabler
of the digital economy. However, these four policy areas can be addressed even with limited nationwide in-
frastructure, as long as there is enough connectivity to knowledge and open collaboration networks in key
hubs (box 1). In the following paragraphs, this paper describes these policy areas and the emerging trends
and policies adopted in each of them.

(R&D) facilities, traditionally hosted by governments
or large corporations, to ecosystems where collab-
oration and cumulative inventions thrive and rapid
prototyping and adoption happens.71 The following
are crucially needed to foster and strengthen the for-
mation of these ecosystems: hubs connecting multi-
ple stakeholders; networks of innovation; dynamics
creating interdisciplinary approaches; and environ-
ments for rapid testing, prototyping, and adoption.
Moreover, these assets increase the return on inno-
vation.72 Companies have been adapting to this shift,
and many have adopted open innovation practices.
A recent survey of almost 3,000 firms with reve-
nues over US$250 million in the United States and
Europe found that almost 80 percent of them are
using some kind of open innovation. Some compa-
nies are integrating tech shops into their facilities to
develop internal open innovation and rapid prototyp-
ing.73 However, most of these practices are internal
and are more prevalent among large companies and
technology-driven sectors.74 Traditional industries
are slower to adapt to the new models of ecosystem
innovation, and there is a slow rate of collaboration
with multiple players and broader ecosystems.

If existing and traditional industries do not move to-
ward an open collaboration environment in order to
generate and incorporate innovation, they will lose
competitiveness. Governments can help foster an
environment for open collaboration and create or-
ganic networks of innovation. Some countries are
supporting collaboration networks through spaces

2. As an example, in Europe, urban population almost doubled from 8.2 percent in the year 1700 to 15 percent
in 1870. The increase was higher in Northern Europe, which further absorbed technologies from the industrial
revolution, going from 13 percent to almost 28 percent. See Malamina and Volckart. For agriculture data, see

4. Comin and Marti estimated that between 70 percent to 80 percent of the productivity gap between de-

platforms (Apple IOS, Google Play, or Android platforms), access a global market from almost any location
in the world. See Manyika, James, Jacques Bughin, Susan Lund, Olivia Nottebohm, David Poulter, Sebastian

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzlX5iYW8kE. Dynamics that emphasize adoption and user-centric in-
novation are crucial to maximize results from innovation. The highest return from innovation comes from
business model innovation, ecosystem orchestration, user-experience innovation, and brand innovation. See

79. Open-source hardware refers to hardware whose design is made publicly available and can be freely
modified, made, distributed, and sold. Arduino boards are the most prominent open-source hardware. See
http://www.oshwa.org/definition/ and http://www.arduino.cc/.
80. Fablabs’ minimum equipment includes “a laser cutter that makes 2D and 3D structures, a sign cutter
that plots in copper to make antennas and flex circuits, a high-resolution NC milling machine that makes
circuit boards and precision parts, a large wood router for building furniture and housing, and a suite of elec-
tronic components and programming tools for low-cost, high-speed microcontrollers for on-site rapid circuit
prototyping.” See http://fab.cba.mit.edu/about/faq/ and http://www.fabfoundation.org/fab-labs/.
