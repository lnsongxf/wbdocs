 OVERVIEW
 Extreme natural events such as droughts, floods, earthquakes, tropical
 cyclones, and pandemics can threaten lives, livelihoods, and even
 entire economies. Disaster risk finance aims to increase the resilience
 of vulnerable countries to the financial impact of disasters as part of a
 comprehensive approach to disaster risk management. By increasing
 resilience, disaster risk finance offers the promise of protecting and
 promoting development.

 But does it actually work in practice?

 Critics of disaster risk finance often argue that investing to avoid or reduce
 risk is more cost-effective than investing in post-disaster expenditures.
 They also argue that insurance and other risk transfer instruments can be
 opaque and expensive, providing poor value to governments.

 Generating the evidence to better-guide investments in sovereign
 disaster risk finance programs, to maximize their expected humanitarian
 and development impacts, and to ensure that public investments deliver
 value for money requires robust methodologies—ones that rigorously
 monitor and evaluate existing schemes and new products.

 Since 2013 The World Bank Group has partnered with the Global Facility
 for Disaster Reduction and Recovery and the U.K. Department for
 International Development to address some of these gaps in evidence
 and methodologies. The Disaster Risk Finance Impact Analytics Project
 has made significant contributions to the understanding of how to
 monitor and evaluate existing or potential investments in disaster risk
 finance from a development perspective, and to the evidence base for
 where such investments have development impact.

 This note summarizes the findings of this project, presenting the key
 messages of a book, a technical report, and 14 research papers, categorized
 into four themes.

 Increasing Commitment Through Disaster Risk Finance. Independent
 central banks can, it is widely understood, resolve a commitment
 problem in macroeconomic policy—if governments allow themselves full
 discretion to set interest rates, short-term political incentives will tend
 to lead to interest rates that are too high, at a huge cost to the economy.
