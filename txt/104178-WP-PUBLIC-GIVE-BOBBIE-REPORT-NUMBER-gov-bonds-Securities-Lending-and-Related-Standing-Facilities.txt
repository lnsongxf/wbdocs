Background Note1
This note is part of a series of background notes produced under the World Bank Group Government Bond Markets
(GBM) Advisory Services Program as a by-product of its strategy to support the development of liquid local currency
bond markets. Selected topics have been a key focus in the areas of work of the Advisory Services because of their catalytic
impact on debt market development. They include primary market organization through primary dealers and liability
management, repo markets, securities lending, price dissemination, and clearing and settlement arrangements.2
Securities lending can make significant contributions to bond market development, as it promotes secondary market
liquidity by helping market participants avoid delivery fails and conduct market operations. Specifically, securities lending
facilities (SLFs) can be particularly useful for primary dealers that must comply with quoting obligations and often engage
in short positions as part of their daily market-making activity. This background note provides some guidance on how
to design an SLF, reviewing different types of financial instruments and SLF structures that can be used as well as the
preconditions. Various elements and procedures related to putting an SLF in place are illustrated with country examples.
Production of this background note was led by Olga Akcadag. Baudouin Richard was the primary author, working in
collaboration with Anderson Caputo Silva, Olga Akcadag, and Indhu Raghavan, all of the World Bank Group Government
Bond Markets Advisory Services Program Team.
The authors wish to thank Thordur Jonasson, Senior Financial Sector Expert, MCMDM, IMF, and Mike Williams, Senior
Consultant, WBG, for reviewing the note. A special thank you to country questionnaire respondents,3 David Anderson,
who edited this background note, and Aichin Lim Jones, who provided the design and layout.

           1. Introduction



Thesis aim of this draft background note is to provide public debt managers with an
overview of the matters that need to be considered by debt management offices (DMOs)
planning to provide a securities lending facility (SLF) to their primary dealers (PDs).
“SLF” as it is used in this note means “a procedure put in place with a view to facilitating
the borrowing of some specific securities in some specific instances, whether by way of a
straight borrowing or a repo or a sell and buy back transaction.” The main providers of
SLFs are clearing systems and DMOs. Clearing systems provide an SLF to their members
to avoid delivery fails. DMOs provide an SLF to their PDs to enhance the liquidity of
the secondary market in government securities by helping PDs to comply with their
commitment to quote firm two-way prices.
The provision by a DMO of an SLF to its PDs is not a requirement for a well-functioning
secondary market. As an illustration, the US Treasury conducted in 2006 a market survey
to establish whether it should establish a securities lender of last resort facility.4 The Bond
Market Association responded by arguing that ensuring the ability of PDs to borrow
securities in case of need is a responsibility of the market that the Treasury should not
undermine.
Yet a well-structured SLF provided by DMOs to their PDs is a powerful instrument to
enhance the liquidity of the secondary market. Almost all mature markets with a PD
system have an SLF in place. An increasing number of emerging markets are putting or
planning to put an SLF in place.
An apparent paradox is that an SLF is best little used. The explanation is that an SLF has to
be a last resort mechanism. PDs should first try to cover their short positions by borrowing
securities from the market. An SLF should be provided only as a safety net. If not, it would
impair the development of the repo market.

         2. Securities Lending



2.1. Definition and Objectives
Securities lending is a transaction whereby a market participant borrows a security for a
certain period.5 The objective of the securities borrower is to avoid a delivery failure6 or to
cover (or create) a short position in the security in question. The objective of the securities
lender is to earn a commission, thereby increasing the return on its securities portfolio.

2.2. Link between Securities Lending and PDs’ Quoting Obligation
PDs are committed to make markets for government securities. A trader who quotes two-
way prices may be selling a security that it does not hold in inventory. It may not always be
able to buy that security immediately in the market to cover its short position. It then needs
to borrow the relevant security to deliver it to the buyer. Thus, a PD can make markets only
if it is confident that it will be able to borrow the securities that it might need in the process.
The primary objective of an SLF is thus to lower the risks incurred by PDs in complying
with their market-marking commitment.7 In mature markets, this includes protecting PDs
against the risks generated by a “market squeeze.” A market squeeze occurs when a trader
holding a large portfolio of a certain series of securities takes advantage of its dominant
position by selling or lending the relevant security at an artificially high cost to the other
market participants. An SLF allows a DMO to mitigate a market squeeze by offering PDs
the possibility to borrow the securities in question at a normal cost. Countering a market
squeeze is the only instance in which the cost of borrowing securities under an SLF should
be below the cost of borrowing the securities in the repo market (see section 3.3).


5
  “Securities borrowing” is used in this note in its generic sense of temporary transfer of the legal
ownership of a security, whether by way of a straight borrowing, a repo, or a sell and buy back
transaction (see section 1).
6
  This is a settlement failure in the clearing house resulting from the inability to deliver the securities to
be transferred.
7
  As a result, it is beneficial to have a SLF put in place by a DMO when the market is mature enough to
allow imposing a quoting obligation to PDs but not so liquid that compliance with this quoting obligation
raises no issue for PDs. A way to assess the status is to ask PDs “Do you feel comfortable quoting to
investors firm selling prices for securities that you do not hold in portfolio?”

    2.3. Securities Lending Instruments                                        In general, repos are used as an instrument to borrow
    Three different financial instruments can be used to lend                  cash. They protect the lender against credit risk on the
    securities: a straight loan, a repo, and a simultaneous                    borrower. In this case the type of security provided as
    repo and reverse repo. In the last two cases, the same                     collateral by the cash borrower is indifferent provided
    financial result can be achieved by concluding buy and sell                the securities in question meet some general eligibility
    transactions instead of repos.                                             criteria. Thus, these repo transactions are referred to as
    1.	Straight loan: The lender transfers the securities to the               general collateral (GC). By contrast, the repo transactions

       by a commission. The commission is expressed as a                       collateral” done by a securities lender can be matched
       certain amount of cash.                                                 by a reverse repo GC done by the party borrowing the
    2.	Repo: The lender sells the security spot, and he or she                 securities. If the two parties charge one another the

        rate below market, the difference representing the fee.                cash it has lent.
        The commission of the securities lender is thus expressed
        as an interest rate margin. The width of the margin is a
        function of the availability of the relevant security. The
        less available the security is in the market, the lower will
        be the remuneration of the funds.

    liquidity.

      Although the lender is protected by cash collateral, it is worth noting that as market valuation change, the initial haircut may not be
    sufficient and collateral must be monitored by the securities lender.

        3. Securities
        Lending Facility


3.1. Securities Lending Procedures
There are three different kinds of securities lending (SL) procedures. SL is generally done
in the framework of a bilateral agreement between a lender and a borrower that are trading
with one another in the market. This is the “normal” way of borrowing securities. By
contrast, an SLF is a procedure put in place with the intention of facilitating the borrowing
of securities by a number of counterparties but in some specific cases.
There are two kinds of SLFs: the “automatic securities lending facility” (ASLF) provided by
a clearing house to its members and the “special securities lending facility” (SSLF) provided
by a DMO to its PDs.

3.2. Automatic Securities Lending Facility Provided by a Clearing
House to Its Members
An automatic securities lending facility (ASLF) is an agreement between a clearing house
(CH) and its members, the objective of which is to avoid delivery failures. It is sometimes
referred to as “optional lending, compulsory borrowing.” On the one hand, the CH
members authorize the CH to lend certain securities booked in their account on their
behalf. This is the optional lending. On the other hand, at the closing of the clearing
session, the CH automatically—this is part of the design of the system—lends securities
to any clearing member that needs them to avoid a delivery failure. This is the compulsory
borrowing.
The securities are generally lent on an overnight basis against the pledge of securities
collateral. The borrower of the securities pays a commission that is split between the CH
and the securities lender. The availability of the needed securities cannot be guaranteed.
First, the lending is optional. Second, the parties, having opted to participate in the ASLF
scheme, might not have the needed securities in portfolio.

    3.3. Special Securities Lending Facility                                   An SLF offers two ancillary advantages to DMOs. First,
    Provided by a DMO to its PDs                                               an SLF can be used as a tool to motivate PDs to perform.
    The objective of a special securities lending facility                     This is achieved by offering the SLF on more attractive

    that PDs support the liquidity of the secondary market.                    turnover on the secondary market). Second, the SLF
                                                                               provides DMOs with an additional (although typically

                                                                               simple for the DMO. Its drawback is to overstate the
                                                                               DMO’s funding needs. This can weigh on the market.

    10
       Another incentive that can support market making is for the DMO to offer PDs the right to submit at the auction some noncompetitive
    bids at the weighted average auction price. This guarantees that market makers will have in their portfolios at least some supply of the
    securities for which they are committed to quote. This incentive is costless to the DMO.
    1
       As a result, a SSLF can be particularly beneficial in countries (e.g., Costa Rica) where repo collateral cannot be “rehypothecated,” i.e.,
    disposed of by the securities buyer, thereby preventing repos from enhancing the liquidity of the secondary market. The rationale for the
    prohibition of “rehypothecation” is the risk of the buyer being unable to return the borrowed securities because of the illiquidity of the market.
    This risk disappears with a SSLF.
    12
       n most countries, the SLF is used very little in normal market conditions. In Turkey, the SLF has not been used since 2002. Portugal
    mentions a very small number of securities borrowing transactions in its 2009 debt management report (only 21 transactions in 2009 and
    39 transactions in 2008, mostly T-bills).
    13
       For example, larger amounts or higher interest rates on the funds placed with the DMO. Mexico extends the SLF on more attractive terms
    to its best performing PDs. When putting an SLF in place, it may be efficient, however, to keep the SLF simple at the start and to use the
    SLF as a motivation tool for PDs only later.
    14
        The banks active in the German government securities market—Germany has no PDs—are not supportive of this procedure. The
    corresponding unscheduled supplies of securities to the market create an additional element of uncertainty when trying to forecast the level
    of yields in the secondary market.

    available for lending by giving them the assurance that the loan will be repaid at maturity, without a delivery failure.

          4. Accounting Principles



The following principles are generally applied:
1.	The securities that have been temporarily created for on-lending are booked in a special
   account, distinct from the issuance account that is used when securities are created in the
   framework of an auction.
2.	The securities booked in this special account are merged with the issuance account to
   report the amount of the debt in official documents. Temporarily created securities
   (TCSs) increase the gross amount of the public debt, the same as any other government
   security.21 However, the net debt is not affected as long as the TCSs are held in portfolio
   by the DMO. In this case, the government debt owes (and services, as the case may be)
   the debt to itself.
3.	When the DMO sells TCS on a repo basis against a cash collateral, the repo creates a new
   debt: the DMO has borrowed cash. The amount of net debt increases by the amount
   equal to the proceeds from the sale of the securities.
The impact on the amount of debt of the sale of TCS is neutralized when the proceeds
from the sale are used to repay another debt of the DMO. The increase in the debt is
then offset by a matching decrease in the liability side of the balance sheet. In mature
markets, the decreased liability is typically reduced overnight borrowing, or when there is
an offsetting reverse repo, increased overnight lending. In an emerging market, it could be
a lower overdraft (if allowed) in the DMO’s account with the Central Bank. The impact of
the repo on the amount of gross debt is not neutralized if the DMO reinvests the proceeds
of the sale in a reverse repo or an interest-earning deposit. The impact on net debt depends
on the definition of net, which can be country specific.

 This is the reason why the U.K. DMO has provided in the terms and conditions of its overnight standing
repo facility that no gilt created under this facility shall be eligible for inclusion in the calculation of FTSE
or iBoxx gilt indices.

     be made for arguing that the net debt of the DMO is not
     increased in this case: (1) the collateral held by the DMO is
     a claim against itself; (2) on a net basis, the DMO has not
     borrowed any cash. In fact, the cash transfers are only a way
     to link the collateral (S2) to the trade being collateralized
     (S1). Again, however, the impact on net debt depends on
     the definition of net, which can be country specific.
     Conclusion: The above analysis suggests that cash and
     securities collateral each have their respective advantages
     and drawbacks (see table 4.1).

         5. Putting a Securities
         Lending Facility in Place


5.1. Background
Putting a securities lending facility (SLF) in place is a technical initiative that raises only
minimal risks for the government. Securities are lent for small amounts22 and with a short
maturity. The procedure and the terms of the transactions (amount, maturities, cost, etc.) can
be adapted by the DMO, at any time and at its full discretion, to adapt them to the experience
gained from practice. The fact that the counterparts of the DMO are PDs only further limits
the risks. PDs are well known to the DMO. If the relationship has been well managed by
the DMO, PDs should be eager to please to retain their status. Risks exist nonetheless, for
example, credit risk (collateral depreciation), legal risk (recharacterization of the transaction),
execution risk (misunderstanding about some provision of the repo agreement), or operational
risk (nondelivery of the collateral because of the absence of, or a failure in, the DVP system).
A robust contractual arrangement (global master repurchase agreement [GMRA]) and a
careful collateral management policy are required to minimize these risks.
The MoF might wish to keep the procedure as simple and straightforward as possible at the
beginning. This makes it easier to get started. The procedure can be refined later on with
the experience gained from practice. Possible simplifications in the standard procedure are
listed in section 5.4.

5.2. Prerequisites for an SLF to Be Put in Place
Three prerequisites should be checked at the outset before an SLF can be put in place.
1.	Is the DMO legally empowered to issue securities for on-lending to its PDs? Public debt laws
   often empower the MoF to issue securities only to meet the financing needs of the government.
2.	Can securities be temporarily created? This is not the only way to supply an SLF with
   the needed securities (see section 3.4). Yet it is worth checking because it seems to be the
   most efficient way. This is a technical issue, but a procedure for it needs be put in place.

22
   The SLF is linked to the PDs’ quoting obligation. PDs need to be protected only against the risk of
being unable to cover the short positions incurred in the framework of their market-making activity. The
amount of securities that PDs need to be given the ability to borrow should therefore be a small multiple
of the minimum amount that they are committed to quote. A maximum multiple of six for each PD
would protect PDs against up to two uncovered quotations for three different maturities each. In normal
circumstances, PDs’ short positions seem unlikely to exceed these amounts.

        series and globally, and/or a limit for all PDs together                provisions of the manual. Alternatively, the document can
        per security series and globally.30                                     be structured as a bilateral agreement.

        See section 3.6.
     24
        If an agent is used, a memorandum of understanding should be in place.
     25
        A straight loan collateralized by a pledge of securities has not been included in the list. This procedure is frequently used for an ASLF (see
     section 3.2). A CH is unlikely to have the use of the cash generated by a repo. However, a straight loan might not be the best procedure for
     an SSLF. DMOs want to encourage the use of repos, and they can use the generated cash.
     26
        DMOs always remunerate the collateral funds received from the borrowing PD at a spread below market. The objective is to ensure that
     the SLF is used by PDs only as a last-resort measure. The spread also remunerates the DMO for the administrative work performed. In the
     euro zone, the spread below the market rate for overnight borrowings (EONIA) ranges from 0.25 percent up to EONIA itself (this applies in
     exceptional cases only, because the funds are then effectively placed by the relevant PD at 0 percent).
     27
        Securities tend to be increasingly less liquid as their maturity is getting nearer. In any case, the security cannot have a maturity shorter
     than that of the repo.
     28
        The payment of the coupon decreases the value of the collateral.
     29
        Market practices vary considerably. They are country specific, and there is no standard solution. The policies followed by DMOs seem to
     be a function of their degree of concern regarding short positions and the risk of market speculation. Some DMOs consider that their ability
     to increase the cost of borrowing the securities in case of need is enough of a deterrent, a formal limit on the authorized amount of the loan
     being therefore not required (e.g., Iceland, South Africa, and the United Kingdom). A majority of DMOs find it safer to limit the amounts that
     can be borrowed. Some DMOs have very large limits (e.g., the Netherlands, or to a lesser extent Belgium). Other DMOs prefer to begin with a
     simple SLF system imposing small limits (e.g., Morocco), with a view to refining it thereafter with the benefit of experience.
     30
        An SLF offered by a DMO is meant to avoid a situation where a market maker is put under pressure to cover a short position at any cost
     when under a timing constraint. The SLF is not meant to enable a PD to carry a short position indefinitely. The horizon is thus definitely
     short term.

        6. Conclusion



It should be possible for an SLF to be put in place within a short time frame (tentatively
estimated to be between three and six months) provided the required prerequisites are
met (section 5.2), and that the SLF of the MoF is developed independently from the
development of an ASLF in the CH. The time frame could be shorter depending on
legislation and on the time required for the recommended market consultation before
putting the SLF in place.
The launch of the SLF is an initiative of a technical nature, which raises only minimal risks
for the government.

                       The objective of this appendix is to illustrate of how an automatic SLF can work in
                       practice. The following summarizes the main provisions of the agreements signed between
                       the Belgian Clearing House (CH) and the clearing members interested in either borrowing
                       or lending fixed income securities settled in the CH.

                       1. Automatic lending
                       1.1. The lender commits to the CH to lend certain securities it holds in portfolio.
                       It indicates which securities it is willing to lend. It guarantees it is the owner of the
                       relevant securities or to have been duly authorized by their owner to lend them. It can
                       limit to a certain percentage of its holding (minimum l0%) the amount of securities
                       that can be lent.
                       1.2. The CH commits to the lender to lend the securities in the CH’s name but on
                       account of the lender. At the end of each day, the CH determines the global amount
                       that needs to be borrowed for every security to avoid delivery failures (“A”) and the
                       global amount that is available for lending (“B”).
                       If A < B, the CH uses a formula to determine which account(s) will be selected as lenders.
                       For every lending account, the CH does the following calculation. The global amount that
                       has been lent by the relevant account since the beginning of the year is calculated first.
                       The global amount that has been available for lending in the relevant account every day
                       that a borrowing need has arisen since the beginning of the year is calculated next. Both
                       aforementioned amounts are expressed as a logarithm to the base 10. The ratio amount
                       lent/amount available for lending is then calculated. The selected lending accounts are
                       those of which the coefficient is lowest.
                       If A > B, the CH allocates the securities between the borrowers. The borrowers who need
                       the securities to pay back an outstanding loan of securities are served first. The remaining
                       borrowers are served in the chronological order of the matching of the notifications that
                       have created the borrowing need.

         Appendix 2. SLF:
         Determining the Appropriate
         Amount and Rate

The issue is to determine the amount and the rate that can be offered without (1) impairing
the trading activity in the repo market by causing the rate of the repo facility to become
the market rate and (2) encouraging market speculation by making it too easy to carry a
short position.
The answer is country specific. DMOs hold diverging views on this point. Some DMOs32
consider that a securities facility can be used for large amounts because it enhances market
liquidity. Other DMOs33 consider that the amount of securities that can be borrowed
should be limited—for two reasons. First, an SLF should be a last resort measure used only
for small amounts. If not, it damages the interbank repo market, which should remain
the main avenue for borrowing securities. Second, DMOs should beware of the risk of
unwillingly supporting market speculation by providing PDs with an easy way to short
the market. This risk can be addressed by lowering the repo rate. However, emergency
measures are best avoided in the context of market speculation.
Irrespective of country specifics, the conclusion should rest on a review of how the
three main functions of the repo market could be affected by the implementation of the
contemplated procedure. The three main functions of the repo market are the following:

1. To enable market makers (MMs) to carry their position (long or short) until
they can match it.
This is the primary function of the repo market. An efficient repo market is a prerequisite
for a liquid securities market. A MM who systematically covers his or her position with a
mirror trade provides no liquidity to the market. He or she is effectively a market taker.
To fulfill this function, the repo market must not be subject to squeezes.34 The MMs then
stop quoting unless they hold the squeezed securities in portfolio.

32
   For example, Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands. As an illustration, the total amount of the
securities that PDs can borrow from the Dutch DMO for any given maturity is “benchmark size”
(currently €10 billion) minus the actual amount issued. In this way, benchmark securities have from
their first issuance onward the same liquidity as they will have on the day that they are issued no longer.
33
   For example, Belgium and France.
34
   The impossibility to either borrow a security or do so against a reasonable price.

     2. To enable repo traders to make a profit by taking
     positions in the money market.
     To fulfill this function, the repo market has to show some
     level of volatility. No trading is done when nothing moves.
     A certain level of volatility in the repo market is also
     positive for the securities market: fluctuations in the repo
     rate have an impact on the securities price, triggering some
     additional trading as a result.
     This function of the repo market assumes the existence of
     a market for repo term maturities. For repo traders, the
     overnight repo market can be a trading market only to
     the extent that the overnight trade is one leg of a deal of
     which the other leg has a longer maturity. For securities
     dealers, the overnight repo market can likewise be a trading
     market only if their (undesirable) objective is to artificially
     engineer a squeeze (thereby causing the securities market
     to become illiquid).

     3. To enable any market participant to avoid a
     delivery failure.

Foreword
1. The purpose of the securities lending facility (SLF) is to support the market-making
activity of the primary dealers (PDs) by enabling them to borrow government securities
when they are not readily available from other sources in the market. The SLF is available
only to the PDs.
2. The purpose of this procedure manual (PM) is to determine the terms and conditions
subject to which the SLF is made available to the PDs. These terms and conditions are
accepted by a PD by virtue of concluding a securities lending transaction with the Ministry
of Finance (MoF).
3. The MoF reserves the right to amend the provisions of the PM in light of changes in
regulations, market conditions, and/or market practices. Such amendments are published
on the website of the MoF. The publication indicates the date from which an amendment
is effective.

Securities Lending Instrument
5. The SLF is operated through a Repurchase Agreement (“repo”) whereby the MoF sells
the loaned securities to a PD and agrees to buy the loaned securities back at a certain future
date.
6. The repurchase agreements concluded by the MoF with PDs are governed by the
provisions of … (specify which repo agreement).

Authorized Securities and Minimum and Maximum Nominal Values
7. The SLF applies to the government securities designated by the MoF after consulting
with the PDs.

     premium of _____ % over the asked price of the relevant
     security at the time the securities loan is concluded.




     37
        Note: Another possibility is to allocate the available amount pro rata between PDs in case the global amount requested exceeds the limit.
     This is a less flexible procedure, however. The allocation can then be made only when all PDs have submitted their borrowing requests, i.e.,
     at the cutoff time.
     38
        The period deadline is to be determined as a function of the deadline set by the CH to be forwarded the transaction details for a settlement
     in T+0. Some time must also be allocated for the MoF to process the securities borrowing transactions.

         1. Brazil
         General remarks: The Central Bank of Brazil is the operator and lender of securities under
         the Brazilian SLF. Its main objectives are to help PDs comply with trading obligations by
         enabling them to temporarily cover the short positions incurred in the framework of their
         MM activity, especially of on-the-run securities, and to increase the general liquidity of the
         market by enabling market participants to take short positions. This is a non-PD exclusive
         system that can also be accessed by banks, mutual funds, and brokerage firms.
         The securities lending transactions are structured as cash-matched repos.
         Loaned securities: The securities lent are held in the bond portfolios of the Central Bank.
         The securities borrowed can be fixed rate bonds (LTN and NTN-F), floating rate bonds
         (LFT), and inflation-linked bonds (NTN-B). According to the Brazilian authorities, the
         securities lent increase the gross public debt (local convention).
         Lending limits: The total amount lent per security and for all securities and for all PDs has
         to be lower than the total amount offered in the six-month repo market.
         Drawdown procedure: Requests to borrow securities can be submitted on Fridays between
         12 and 12.30 P.M. for a period of six months and value date T+1.
         Collateral and valuation: The cost of borrowing will be the six-month repo rate as
         determined by the weekly repo auction held every Friday.
         Sanctions: There have been no instances in which the securities have not been delivered
         at maturity. According to the Brazilian authorities, there was a work group, composed
         of the Brazilian Treasury (BT), the National Association of Financial Market Institutions
         (ANBIMA), and the BMF&BOVESPA (clearing house), to discuss the participation of
         the BT in the Security Lending Process of Public Bonds, to improve the number of the
         investors on this market. The idea was to guarantee that the borrowed bond would be
         returned to its owner at the end of the contract.

securities together the limit is 5% of the total issuance of
all benchmark securities.
Drawdown procedure: The loans can have a tenor of 1
week, 2 weeks, 1 month, or 3 months, and the orders can
be submitted between 11 A.M. and 12 P.M. and 1:00 and

Collateral and valuation: The Central Bank determines a
fee to be paid for the transaction. The initial margin is 120
percent of the net amount of the transaction, and there is a
5 percent margin maintenance provision.
Sanctions: The collateral provided is used to cover
nondelivered securities. If the collateral does not cover the
nondelivered securities, the Treasury issues the noncovered
amount. In addition to this, the bank that does not deliver
securities at maturity will be charged twice the fee for
future lending. Moreover, the Central Bank has the right to
take action on the accounts of the bank at the Central Bank
that does not deliver the securities at maturity. Finally,
the bank’s right to participate in the market or other
markets under the Central Bank could be temporarily or
permanently cancelled.
