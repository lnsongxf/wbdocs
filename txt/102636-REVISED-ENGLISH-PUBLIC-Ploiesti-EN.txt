0.1. The need and objectives of the Integrated Urban Development Plan

In 2012, the World Bank signed five agreements with MRDPA for advisory services, out of which one relates to
the growth poles policy and to its improvement for the programming period 2014-2020. This agreement has three
components: 1) an analysis of the growth poles policy, 2) energy efficiency studies for each growth pole; and 3) a
review of the Integrated Development Plans prepared by the growth poles for the period 2007-2013.

In this context, South Muntenia Regional Development Agency, through the coordinator of Ploiești Growth Pole,
requested the World Bank, under a project funded by ERDF through the Technical Assistance Operational Programme
2007-2013, to support the Growth Pole in implementing the recommendations stemming from the previous analysis
with: 1) updating the Integrated Development Plan for 2014-2020; and 2) proposing an improved institutional
framework for coordinating the planning, implementation and monitoring of projects under this plan.

The current document of the Integrated Development Plan
belonging to Ploiești Growth Pole was developed during the period
2008-2009 and approved / submitted to South Muntenia RDA in
April 2010. It contains a total number of 93 projects with a total
value of RON 5,136,143,583.91, out of which 762,515,322.81 are
EU funds, and the remainder comes from the national budget and
the beneficiaries’ own contribution1. In the process of updating the
plan, the implementation status of these projects will be studied
further, and attention will be also given to unimplemented projects
in order to see whether they will be included in the documentation,
depending on their response to the new development conditions
of the growth pole.
Distribution of projects’ by intervention areas / sectoral targets and funding, as well as the current status of project
implementation (as of March 2015) are detailed in Annex 1, as follows:

0.1.2. Objectives, principles, and methodology
The Integrated Development Plan aims at coordinating program and project packages with the existing territorial
issues and with the Growth Poles’ development trends in the regional and national context. Specifically, the objective
includes: (1) Coordination of finalized sectoral strategies; (2) Creating a methodological and technical instrument, by
which sustainable development priorities of the growth pole should be established in partnership with the local councils,
Prahova County Council, South Muntenia Development Agency, and the private sector, with the following goals:
(i) Consistently develop the competitive advantages gained so far through the implementation of EU-funded projects;
(ii) Maintain on the concerned territory the most of the added value achieved through capital investment and services
financed from various public and private funds over the period 2014-2020;
(iii) Reduce regional disparities in terms of equipping the territory and access to public services of general interest.

By its content, the plan aims at providing a sense for the growth pole’s development direction based on the existing
territorial attributes and those to be achieved through development investments. The specific objective is to identify
measures that will contribute to strengthening territorial cohesion and to developing the urban character of the area.
The main directions for the implementation of this objective aim at a balanced and integrated development by:

• Increasing transport capacity and mobility by reference to the European transport network TEN-T and therefore the
 network of localities;

• Reducing regional disparities so as to pave the way towards equal access to infrastructure services, facilities and
 knowledge;

• Managing the natural resources in a responsible way and protecting natural resources and protecting the natural
 and built environment of the area;

• Identifying and developing new types of urban-rural relations to increase the functionality of the area.
The IDP was prepared according to the following principles:

1. Lawfulness and Coordination. Abide by the powers conferred by law and by European and national regulations
   with respect to the programming period 2014-2020, without restricting the rights regarding the exercise of
   responsibilities that determine the increase of territorial competitiveness in the area.

2. Autonomy and Subsidiarity. Ensure local autonomy, representativeness, identity, interests, and diversity of local
   communities in the area, using tools and techniques for involving citizens in decision-making during the formulation
   and implementation of the plan.

3. Continuity and Cooperation. Horizontal and vertical cooperation between levels of government in order to: (1)
   promote a competitive, green, and sustainable economy, with high degree of employment that is based on the
   rational use of natural resources; (2) reduce existing territorial disparities between territorial-administrative units
   in the area.

The IDP was prepared according to the methodology for strategic planning, which included the following key
activities: information, consultation, debate and admission / approval. The main stages of the process correspond
to the methodology for drafting the Integrated Development Plans for 2007-2013 and included:

1. Analysis of development sectors at the current moment and as a result of projects’ implementation during the
  period 2007-2013;
2. Analysis of integrated results, obtained by diagnosing the existing situation and trends of development (SWOT
  analysis);                                                                                                  13
3. Formulation of the framework with respect to future development (vision, strategic goals and specific / sector
  objectives);
4. Ensuring the implementation modalities of the Strategy 2014-2020 through programs and projects;
5. Preparing the institutional framework for the implementation and monitoring of the strategy.

The analysis of the documents (data, strategies, action plans, programs, reports, and expert studies) provided by
Prahova County Council and the Local Councils of territorial-administrative units within the growth pole has played a
significant part. As well, information was collected through field surveys based on interviews with local stakeholders
regarding development and investment priorities for the short and medium term. The results from various phases
were debated in view of including opinions of local communities as well, thus increasing the acceptability of proposals.



0.1.3. Coordination with European, national, and regional strategies

0.2.1. National inertia and adjusting expectations
As it is known from the literature, the fate of a city depends not only public authorities and the private sector.
There is a certain history-related and geography-related

of a city. For example, Bucharest has a privileged position          7
in Romania since by 1989 it had a population of over
5 times higher than the second-placed city. As such, it
                                                                   6.5

the start, attracting in recent years a large part of the

Currently, even if it has only 10% of the population,
Bucharest generates 25% of the GDP. Similarly, cities
                                                                                    5.5
like Timișoara and Cluj-Napoca are favored by their
proximity to Western rich markets and have witnessed
more striking economic dynamics than cities with a                                   5

the western border (e.g. Iași and Craiova).

the urban systems are distributed in a balanced way.

rank of a city and its position in the national hierarchy.                          6.5
Usually, there is a single city that is included in the first
rank (like Bucharest) and its position in the national

1-2 second-rank cities, with populations that amount                                5.5
to approximately half of the first-rank city’s number
of inhabitants. These cities are in turn followed by
2-3 third-ranking cities with populations that amount                                5

Both at national and international levels, there are many examples of cities that have managed to perform better
than prescribed by Zipf distribution. Mostly, this analysis takes into account what local / regional authorities in
Ploiești can do in order to ensure a sustainable development of Ploiești Growth Pole.

The geographical position, historical evolution, existing population, and economic base of Ploiești will play an important
part on the future development of the city and must be recognized and understood as such. In what follows we
discuss the importance of the proximity of Ploiești to Bucharest and Brașov.



0.2.2. Regional integration
Bucharest is the most important economic pole of Romania. This is well known. What is less known is that Bucharest’s
economic development has encouraged the rapid development of communities located close to the capital city.
Ploiești itself took advantage of this proximity and it is important to do so in the future as well.

In order to map these regional synergies, the World Bank included in the Competitive Cities report an economic mass
gravitational model (see figure below). Gravitational models are based on the physics principle according to which the
attraction between two bodies becomes greater as the distance between them gets smaller and their mass becomes
larger. In order to develop the economic
                                            Map 1. Economic mass gravitational model for Romania
mass gravitational model, we calculated
the road distances between cities in
Romania and we used the firms’ revenues
at the city level as economic mass.

The first map in the right represents the
economic mass gravitational model. As
shown in this map, the area of influence
of Bucharest, which extends up to Ploiești
and Pitești is the leading development
area in Romania. Moreover, the firms
operating in the area surrounding
Bucharest, i.e. up to one hour of driving
from the city, generates more than 50% of
the national income2. This is of paramount
importance for the way in which public and
investment policies in Ploiești Growth Pole
will be designed. Basically, any economic
                                            Map 2. Demographic gravitational model for Romania
development strategy cannot ignore the
strategic position of Ploiești within the
most dynamic economic area of Romania.

The better this area will be interconnected,
the greater the economic benefits will
be. On the one hand, better connectivity
will require investments in the large
infrastructure along the corridor Bucharest
– Ploiești – Brașov, namely completing
the A3 highway section from Bucharest
to Brașov, and operating a fast train on
this section. On the other hand, a better
connection between Ploiești, Târgoviște,
and Pitești could help this economic area
coagulate.

Interestingly, the Bucharest-Ploiești-Târgoviște-Pitești is not only the most developed area in the country, but also
the densest area in terms of demography. As shown in the above demographic gravitational model (where population
is taken as demographic mass), this area of Romania has the highest population density. Basically, in the one-
hour access area around Bucharest live about 4 million people – i.e. 20% of the population, or more than twice the
population of Bucharest. This is also one of the areas with the highest potential for urbanization, which will be
discussed in more detail in the next section.



0.2.3. Ploiești: Urbanization pole
As discussed in the Competitive Cities report, economic development goes hand in hand with urbanization, and there
is no developed country in the world that is not highly urbanized. Currently, Romania is one of the least urbanized
countries in the EU and one of the most underdeveloped.

The greatest part of the economic development is played by a few dynamic cities and in order to operate as economic
engines, they must increase both their economic mass and demographic mass – that is to continue their urbanization.
Ploiești is one of the most important economic engines of Romania and its further development implies continuing
the urbanization of the region to which it belongs. Basically, the most people possible in Ploiești Growth Pole area
should have easy access to the opportunities that the pole offers; on the other hand, firms from the pole should have
the easiest possible access to skilled workforce in the region.

The analysis presented in Competitive Cities report of the World Bank shows that Ploiești is part of an area with
great potential for urbanization (see picture below). Specifically, Ploiești municipality is surrounded by a number of
communes with high population density and rapid development dynamics. This means that the development policy
of Ploiești should be thought at the metropolitan level and not only at the level of the territorial-administrative unit.

Ploiești municipality has an area of over 58 km2 and a stable population of 209,945 inhabitants, being the 9th largest
city in Romania. It is located at the intersection of the main transport corridors in Romania and at just 60 km from
Bucharest, having the potential to form an urban system with Bucharest, but also with Târgoviște.

                                The Intercommunity Development Association (IDA) “Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole”
                                was established on 9 June 2009, pursuant to: Government Ordinance no. 26/2000 on
                                associations and foundations (approved by Law no. 246/2005), Law no. 215/2001 on the
                                local public administration, (as amended and supplemented), and Law no. 151/1998 on
                                regional development in Romania, (as amended and supplemented). The IDA operates in
                                accordance with the Constitutive Act, the Statute, and the applicable Romanian legislation
                                in force. The founding members of the Association are the following: Ploiești municipality, the
                                cities of Băicoi, Boldești-Scăeni, Bușteni, Plopeni, and the communes of Ariceștii Rahtivani,
                                Bărcănești, Berceni, Blejoi, Brazi, Bucov, Dumbrăvești, Păulești, Târgșoru Vechi and Valea
                                Călugărească. In 2011, Bușteni city joined the Association, but given its isolated position in
                                the northwestern limit of the county, the city is a member of the Association, but not part
                                of the growth pole area.

The purpose of the Association is to facilitate cooperation between the member territorial-administrative units in view
of exercising jointly their competencies, complying with the following principles of sustainable development:

• social progress consistent with community needs;
• effective protection of the environment;
• rational use of natural resources;
• maintaining a strong and stable level of economic growth and employment.

1.1.2. Spacial and functional profile

Ploiești is one of the nodes of Brașov – Ploiești – Bucharest – Giurgiu territorial development axis, which shapes the
development of the southern part of Romania. This axis links the listed urban poles with the surrounding region and
the main development and transport axes across the territory of Romania – Danube Valley, Prahova Valley etc. It also
forms an urban system in the direction of Bucharest – Ploiești – Târgoviște, with a population of about 3 million people.

Ploiești is situated at a distance of only 60 km from Bucharest, Ploiești Growth Pole and Bucharest’s (designed)
metropolitan territory being adjoined in the south of the Prahova county and functionally integrated through intense
commuting, economic and transport flows between the two urban poles. However, the competition between Ploiești and
Bucharest is asymmetrical, as the size difference is about 1:9; this narrows the polarization area of Ploiești at a few
localities in its immediate proximity.

Ploiești Growth Pole has a total area of 609.04 km2, of which 163.25 km2 belong to urban areas, and 445.79 km2 to rural
areas. Of this, 79.9% is privately owned land, and the rest of 20.1% is in public ownership. As regards the use of land,
70.4% of it has an agricultural destination, most of it being arable land (54.4%), pastures and hayfields (9.7%), vineyards
(3.6% ), orchards (2.6%), forestry (9.1%), waters (2.2%), constructions (13.1%), communication ways (4.2%), and degraded
and unproductive lands (0,9%).

Compared to 2007, there is a decrease by 3.9% of agricultural land (1,700 ha) in favor of construction areas, both
residential and economic (industrial parks, logistics, shopping centers, etc.).

The phenomenon of suburbanization, coupled with the population decline and with internal and external migration
(especially to Bucharest) led to a dramatic decrease in population density in Ploiești municipality. While in 1992 Ploiești
had a density of about 83 people per hectare, in 2002, the value dropped to 76 people/ha, and in 2012 to 61 people/ha –
this means a density reduction of about 27% between 1992 and 2012. This trend has and will have an important impact
on public services such as public transport, drinking water and sanitation, waste collection, street lighting, or centralized
heating.

The functional zoning of the built-up area of Ploiești municipality was established in the General Urban Plan, approved
in 1999 and currently being updated. The zoning is represented in the figure below.

Even new residential areas (“infilling” type) have their problems: the buildings are modern, have all the required equipment
and annexes specific to quality housing, but are heterogeneous in terms of architectural style and materials used, and
also interfere with other incompatible functions (e.g. industrial). Moreover, they are short of access infrastructure and
technical and urban utilities, their development being generally insufficiently regulated and planned.

  The Growth Pole’s Profile




                           I                                                                52
Recently, new shopping centers have developed in all the areas of the municipality, especially in the west (Auchan,
Selgros, Kaufland, Billa, West Mall, Balif City), in the north (Kaufland, Baumax, Metro, Praktiker, Carrefour, Ploiești
Shopping Center), but also in the eastern part (Dedeman, Afi Palace).

The industrial, storage, and transport zone is very large, being disposed radially around built-up areas in the suburbs of
the city. The 4 major industrial sites in the town are:

• Ploiești East-Teleajen platform – where the Teleajen refinery, currently owned by Lukoil, is located; other industrial
companies (Feroemail, Uztel), but also trade, services, and transport companies are also placed there.

• Ploiești South industrial zone – hosting oil sector facilities, machine building facilities, etc.
• Ploiești West-Crâng industrial zone – with a more diversified profile (food industry, chemical industry, building
materials, the metalworking, storage, trade, services, etc.).

• North industrial zone – where Vega refinery and Rompetrol company are located.
In addition to these well-defined platforms, in the city there are also isolated units, scattered in the territory – the North
Station area is an example. Most of these industrial sites, which cover 1,000 ha, are currently partly used, Ploiești being
among the growth poles with the largest brownfield sites areas in Romania, given its pronounced industrial profile. These
areas, which are generally privately owned, have the potential to be rehabilitated and functionally reconverted so as to
prevent the expansion of the municipality and promote the model of the compact city. Such an approach is imperative,
especially given that the extension of built-up areas is limited by natural and anthropic barriers (rail network, Dâmbu
creek, ring roads, industrial zones). The targeted areas with reconversion potential include: Romanian Astra refinery
(northern and southern buildings), Upetrom May 1 platform (partially), Grivco platform, Teleajen platform (partially),
Dorobanţul platform. Depending on the specific characteristics of each of these areas, the change of their destination
could include: the development of planted areas, the construction of housing, public services, shopping areas, etc.

After 1990, the industrial zones were extended mainly to the west with the construction of a new industrial park of
over 160 ha, plus several other private parks on the territory of Ariceștii Rahtivani commune, of over 300 ha in size.
They turned into the main business pole of the city, attracting important foreign and local investors (Yazaki, Cameron,
Kaufland, Johnson Controls, Calsonic Kansel, etc.) and creating thousands of jobs.

Green and recreation areas occupy a quite limited space (only 2% of the urban area) that – besides the fact that the
city is located in a plain area, which lacks extensive natural or woodland surfaces and has instead large industrial zones
and heavy traffic – represent one of the main problems of the community. The average area of green space per capita
is about 7 m2 per inhabitant, in contrast to the other Romanian growth poles, with an average of about 20 m2, and to
international standards of 25-30 m2 per inhabitant. Of these, 15.4 ha are public gardens, 55.7 ha are recreational parks,
10.4 ha consist of other kinds of green spaces, and 16.2 ha are sports areas. The largest park in the municipality is
Tineretului Park. Besides this, the municipality has several other smaller parks located near the West Railway Station,
the South Railway Station, along Independenței Boulevard, Republicii Boulevard, within Ploiești North district, “Mihai
Viteazu” Park, “I.G. Duca” Park, “Nichita Stănescu” Park, the park in front of the House of Unions, the Central Markets,
the Administrative Palace, etc. Currently, the West Municipal Park is undergoing landscaping works, financed with
European funds worth over EUR 20 million; at the end, it will have an area of 58 ha and will increase the average area of
green spaces at more than 9 square meters per inhabitant. As well, the municipality has many stadiums, sports grounds
and a hippodrome, the only one in Romania that enables horse trot.

The municipality’s spatial development trends are also illustrated at the level of the Zonal Urban Plans (ZUP), prepared
during 2007-2014. The list in Annex 1.1 gives an insight into the relatively low investment dynamics in this period:

•  20 of the 180 ZUPs were initiated by the public sector (most of them by Ploiești municipality) and refer to changes
at the level of land use / land occupancy indicators for municipal investments, parceling for housing, accessibility, etc.
With the exception of the ZUPs for housing construction via the National Housing Agency (ANL), most investment
refers to infrastructure projects contained in the IDP 2007-2013 - covering the investment capacity of the local public
administration to a significant extent.

•  The documentation initiated by the private sector – individuals and companies – generally refer to housing, offices
/ company headquarters, or extension thereof. Many ZUPs envisage changes of urban indicators for these functions,
which prove not necessarily an increase in investment, but the need for the current regulations to be reconsidered in the
new GUP that is currently under development.

1.1.3. Location, natural features, and brief history

Ploiești Growth Pole (GP) is located in the 3rd Development Region – South Muntenia. Ploiești municipality, which is
the residence of Prahova county, belongs to the most urbanized county in the country, with two municipalities and
12 towns. It is located at 60 km from Bucharest, at 30 km from the “Henri Coandă” international airport, and in the
vicinity of major transport corridors: Bucharest-Brașov railroad thoroughfare, TEN-IV and TEN-IX corridors.


Map 12: Locating Ploiești Growth Pole




In terms of morphological units, the GP is located in a plain area, Ploiești Plain, which is situated in the Prahova river
basin, with its main tributary, Teleajen river. One of its tributaries is Dâmbu, with an area of 190 km2 and a length of

1.1.4. Demography and migration

At the General Population and Housing Census in 2011, the administrative-territorial units belonging to Ploiești
Growth Pole had a total stable population of 327,309 inhabitants, of which 209,945 resided in Ploiești municipality.
This represents 44% of the total population of Prahova county, 10% of the South Muntenia region, and 1.7% of
Romania’s population. In terms of geo-demographical size, Ploiești municipality is the ninth largest city in Romania,
and Ploiești Growth Pole is the eighth largest agglomeration. The average population density on its territory is of 539
inhabitants/km², about three times higher than that of Prahova county and about 6 times higher than the national
average, which indicates a large population concentration in this area from the nineteenth century onwards.

From the perspective of population dynamics between the last two censuses, between 2002 and 2011, the population
of Ploiești municipality fell by 9.7% and that of the Growth Pole by 7.5%. As can be seen, the population fell faster in
the urban nucleus than in the Growth Pole, which suggests a phenomenon of suburbanization and of migration from
Ploiești to neighboring localities, where the cost of living is lower, as it is the price of land or housing, and where the
surfaces are large enough for the expansion of residential areas.

Even at the level of the Growth Pole, the population dynamics were different in the past decade. The small urban centers
around Ploiești (-10.2% in Băicoi, -19.7% in Plopeni, -3.1% in Boldeşti-Scăeni) have witnessed significant decreases of
the population, which was affected by the restructuring process and the economic reorientation, especially in the
secondary sector, given that these towns didn’t have a diverse economic structure, but rather a mono-industrial
profile. On the other hand, a number of communes adjoined to Ploiești municipality registered a positive growth of the
population, especially those in the north and west (Păuleşti: +13.8%, Blejoi: +8.2%, Târgşoru Vechi: +6%). Other localities
in the Growth Pole recorded either a stagnation of the population (Bărcăneşti, Berceni, Bucov, Valea Călugărească) or
a decline of it (Brazi, Dumbrăvești, Ariceștii Rahtivani), being less involved in the process of suburbanisation, primarily
on account of a longer distance to the urban core and lower accessibility.

The causes of this demographic decline is primarily related to internal migration (80% towards Bucharest and Ilfov
county) and external migration (mostly to Italy, Spain, UK, France, Germany), but also to the negative natural growth.
As well, in the last 15 years there is a phenomenon of return migration, especially in the case of pensioners and the
unemployed, who prefer to come back to their home areas, usually rural, and to avoid the high costs of living in the urban
areas. Once returned to those areas, they get to practice even subsistence agriculture for self-consumption.

Compared to other growth poles in Romania, Ploiești Growth Pole registered a more pronounced demographic decline,
being exceeded only by that of Craiova. Moreover, despite the unfavorable demographic context nationally, there is clear
evidence of three urban poles (Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, and Timișoara), which continue to attract residents due to strong
economic development – especially within the services sector – and increasing employment opportunities. In contrast,
Craiova, Ploiești, and Brașov recorded a phenomenon of de-concentration on account of the reduced distance from the
capital, which significantly limits the polarization area, but also because of a still industry-dominated economic profile.

In terms of gender structure, there is a tendency towards feminisation of the population, females representing in
2011 52.3% of the total population in the Growth Pole and 53% of the total population in Ploiești municipality. This
phenomenon is caused by the higher male death rate across most age groups (women’s life expectancy is about seven
years higher than that of men) and greater male workforce migration following the employment decline in heavy
industry sectors, where most jobs are intended for men.

In terms of ethnic composition, 97.4% of the people in the Growth Pole and 97.1% of those living in Ploiești municipality
have declared themselves Romanian at the census in 2011, this percentage being higher than the national average,
situated below 90%, other ethnic groups being underrepresented. Of these, the Roma group still stands, representing
2.3% of the population. However, the actual number of Roma inhabitants is higher, many of them declaring themselves
Romanian at the Census. A higher proportion of Roma population is recorded in the communes of Dumbrăvești (8.8% of
total population) and Bucov (5.3%), as well as in Boldești-Scăeni (5.3%) city.

The religious structure of the population is also homogenous. Thus, 96.8% of the people in the Growth Pole and 97.2%
of those living in Ploiești municipality declared themselves in the 2011 census as being Orthodox; they were followed
from afar by small groups of Christian Evangelists (0.8%), Pentecostals (0.6%), Seventh-day Adventists (0.5%), Roman
Catholics (0.3%), Evangelicals (0.3%), Baptists (0.1%), and so on. The only localities where the share of the Orthodox is
less than 95% are Târgşoru Vechi and Brazi, both having large communities of Christian Evangelists (representing 7.3%
and 4.9% respectively of the total population) and Pentecostals.

As regards the structure of the population by educational level, 20.8% of the inhabitants of the Growth Pole graduated
from higher education systems, 5.8% have completed post-secondary and foremen studies, 29.2% have graduated from
high school, 14.6% from technical and vocational schools, 18.8% secondary schools, 9.8% primary schools, and 1.8% have
not completed their studies. Even though the percentage of graduates has increased by nearly 10 percentage points
compared to 2002, it is lower compared to the other growth poles in Romania. This is explained by the migration of
highly skilled workforce to Bucharest or to other countries, where employment opportunities for university graduates
are better.

The total migratory balance of Ploiești Growth Pole is negative, and the balance of domicile changes during 2007-
2013 reached -3.177 people; this contributed by about 40% to the reduction of the number of inhabitants. However,
migration is under-represented in official statistics of the NIS, because a simple comparison between the stable
population (with the actual residency in the area) of the territory concerned and the legal population (with the
domicile in the area) shows a deficit of about 35,000 people, of which 30,000 are found only in the municipality,
which represents around 10% of the total population. These are people who actually live in another town in Romania or
in another country, but who still have the domicile in one of the territorial-administrative units that belong to Ploiești
Growth Pole. During the 2011 census, data could be collected only from about 18,000 of these people, which indicates
that around 80% have been living abroad for a long time. As well, a significant number was residing in Bucharest and
Ilfov county, the capital attracting a significant number of young people for studies or for better paid jobs in different
areas of interest.

External migration phenomenon is the most intense in Plopeni (about 9‰ of the domiciled population), a town that
has a large workforce and that witnessed a massive wave of dismissals in the last two decades, on account of its
single-industry character acquired before 1990. As well, emigration rates above 5% of the population domiciling in
the city are registered in Băicoi city, Dumbrăvești and Bucov communes, which witness reduced local employment
opportunities as well.

Inside the Growth Pole, one can observe a phenomenon of suburbanization. Thus, while in the cities of Ploiești and Plopeni,
negative values of internal migration are recorded, in the rural areas around the municipality (Păuleşti, Blejoi, Târgşoru
Vechi, Bucov, Bărcăneşti) there are positive values of migratory movements due to the people who move mainly in Ploiești.
However, these internal migration flows are offset by the growing intensity of external migration, determining a slow
growth of the stable population in these communes (by less than 1% per year).

According to the values of the Local Human Development Index (LHDI), computed by Prof. Univ. Dr. Dumitru Sandu
at University of Bucharest for the World Bank Report “Competitive Cities. Reshaping the Economic Geography of
Romania”, Ploiești municipality is among Romania’s developed urban centers thanks to its complex functions and its
infrastructure, which serves both the county and the region. Still, the performances of Ploiești are placed under those
of other Romanian growth poles, such as Cluj-Napoca, Bucharest, Timișoara, or Iași, which benefit from more complex
infrastructure and social services, Constanța Growth Pole being the only one that is overtopped by Ploiești from this
point of view. These development gaps have widened over the period 2002-2011.

                            Marginalized urban communities in Ploiești Growth Pole

Urban marginalization becomes visible through spatial concentration of deprived population in communities located in
certain areas within urban settlements. Therefore, in order to analyze this phenomenon, the study should be done at a
level that is as confined as possible and not at the territorial-administrative level. The data collected during the 2011
census provides a unique opportunity to conduct such an analysis at the level of smaller territorial units, i.e. census
sectors.

The smallest geographical area for running a census is the census sector, which usually comprises around 200 people.
Thus, the micro-data from the census of 2011 and aggregated at the census sector level were used for analysis. The
main limitation of this analysis is that the overlap between marginalized communities and census sectors is only
partial. Marginalised communities are not always entirely concentrated in one census sector, therefore community
characteristics cannot be always analyzed at this level.

Figure 20 shows some typical examples for this. Example 1 illustrates a situation in which a large community covers
several census sectors. Example 2 describes a situation in which a community covers parts of two or more census
sectors. Example 3 corresponds to a situation in which a small community is located in a census sector along with other
population groups. And finally, Example 4 shows a community that is located on the outskirts (e.g. improvised shelters
located near landfills), partly inside, partly outside the town. Census data are not best suited for identifying similar
situations for the last example. In such areas, some locals did not take part to the census, and those who did were
assigned to the census sectors located nearby. So, by using aggregate data at the census sector level, communities of
this kind can be identified or reconstituted only partially.

                                                                                            (1) human capital (i.e. education, health, and demographic behavior); (2) employment; and (3) housing quality. For each of
                                                                                            these dimensions one can assign a set of indicators for which data from the 2011 census are available.

                                                                                            The initial typology, which resulted from the literature review, was based on a set of 13 indicators for the identification
                                                                                            of these areas through quantitative research methods. Afterwards, the set of indicators was reduced to seven key
                                                                                            indicators. Three indicators correspond to human capital, three other refer to housing, and an indicator is related to
                                                                                            employment. By using data from the 2011 census, the values corresponding to each of the seven key indicators were
                                                                                            computed for each urban census sector. Likewise, for each of the seven key indicators, the threshold above which it was

                                                                                            level.

                                                                                            dimension. In this way it can be seen whether a specific census sector is characterized by low levels of human capital,
                                                                                            by limited employment in the formal sector, or by precarious housing.

                                                                                            A census sector is considered as having a low level of human capital if any two of the three indicators have values that
                                                                                            exceed the correspondent urban threshold, established at the national urban level. In other words, a census sector is
                                                                                            considered disadvantaged in terms of human capital if it is characterized by a concentration of the following categories

In this context, the situation in the particular case of Ploiești municipality is as follows:

• For the 2011 census, 930 census sectors were delineated in Ploiești, with an average of 226 people each. The size of
census sectors varies significantly, from a minimum of 2 people and a maximum of 1915 people.

• Of all census sectors, 1.8% are very small (less than 50 people), while 3.1% are large (at least 500 inhabitants).
• Depending on the methodology for identifying marginalized areas, the 930 census sectors in Ploiești are distributed
as follows:




                       Zone type                                  Number
                 Non-disadvantaged                                   762
        Disadvantaged in terms of housing                             51
     Disadvantaged in terms of employment                             31
    Disadvantaged in terms of human capital                           47
                     Marginalized                                     16
                      Other case*                                     23

* Other case relates to census sectors with less than 50 inhabitants and those
with various institutions (e.g., pensions, retirement homes, prisons, convents, etc.)
without or with a very small number of households.


The disadvantaged zones in terms of housing (according to the Atlas of marginalized urban areas) are districts in which a
significant part of the population lives in inadequate dwellings, and may be characterized by a low education level or not,
but in which most part of the population has a job in the formal labor market. This category includes the urban areas
with poor infrastructure and old quarters of houses located on the outskirts of cities, also with poor or no infrastructure.
It also includes areas of blocks or houses built mainly in the 60s-70s, which are in a poor condition and with residents
not having the required resources for improvements and renovations. These areas are heterogeneous with respect to
population. The houses might be owned by elderly people with chronic health problems. In this category are included
the urban areas with many young tenants, who have a good education level, but who cannot afford to buy their own
dwellings (for instance in Bucharest and in major university centers). In conclusion, a disadvantaged urban zone in terms
of housing is a census sector in which the conditions of living are precarious, but the level of employment in the formal
sector is not low, and there may be low education levels or not.

In Ploiești, the state of facts is as follows:

• There are 31 census sectors with an average number of 222 people each (min. = 79 persons/zone; max. = 366 persons/
zone).
• 6,907 people, of which 1,198 (17%) are children, live in disadvantaged zones in terms of employment.
• 336 people self-identify as Roma (5%).
The disadvantaged zones in terms of human capital (according to the Atlas of marginalized urban areas) include people
with low levels of formal education, who may have a job or not, but whose living conditions are considered standard for
urban areas in Romania. These urban areas are inhabited by unqualified persons working in agriculture, constructions
and other sectors, in many cases informally. The level of employment in the formal sector is typically low, but this is
caused by low levels of human capital. Therefore, interventions in such zones must be focused on workforce qualification.

In Ploiești municipality, the state of facts is as follows:

• In the 16 census sectors identified as marginalized are living 5,130 people (2.4% of the population of Ploiești).
• The average number of people living in a marginalized census sector is 321 (with a min. of 92 persons/zone and a
max. of 532 persons/zone);

• Of the 5,130 people living in marginalized areas, 23% (1,199) identify themselves as Roma, compared to only 0.92% of
people in the total population of the non-marginalized census sectors who declare themselves as Roma;

• Of the total population living in marginalized areas, 30% are children; the percentage is double compared with the
proportion of children in the population from non-marginalized census sectors.

The most socially vulnerable zones identified in Ploiești municipality are located at the periphery, especially in the south
and east of the city: Mimiu, Râfov, Pictor Rosenthal, Moțoi, Bereasca, the first of them standing out by the complexity
of housing, employment, and human capital problems, which require the implementation of such measures as those

All the three groups of upper developed localities in the county are located along major traffic corridors: Ploiești –
Brașov (E60), Ploiești – Vălenii de Munte – Brașov (A1) and Ploiești – Buzău, via Urlaţi and Mizil (E577). Poor communes
(see table below) are located mostly in the eastern part of the county, towards the border with Buzău. The maximum
level of poverty is reached in the Tătaru and Călugăreni communes (in the vicinity of Năeni, another commune just as
poor, located in Buzău) and in the south, at Sălciile. All are small communes: Tătaru with less than 1,000 inhabitants,
Călugăreni with less than 1,300 inhabitants, and Sălciile with less than 2,000 inhabitants. The state of fact at Sălciile
proves the best4 what cumulative poverty means in Prahova.

Their poverty is generalized to all types of resources or capital considered – educational, material, health state, and
working age. In terms of severity, structural poverty is closest to generalized poverty and resides in pronounced
deficiencies in terms of education, housing infrastructure, and working age population (but scoring fairly well with
respect to health). Of the 11 communes from this category, the most part are located in the east of the county, in the
proximity of Buzău. The communes that are typical for structural poverty are Lapoș, located in the central-eastern part
of the county, Boldești-Grădiştea in southeast, and Poenarii Burchii in the south of the county. A thorough research on

Nationally, urban connectivity – both as human connectivity and regional accessibility to surrounding towns – represents
a major precondition for local development. The Local Human Development Index (LHDI) tends to be greater as the
reference locality records a higher index of urban connectivity (URBCONECT), has more people that commute for
working outside the locality, reported to 1,000 inhabitants (COMMUTERS), and a greater number of people that moved
in the locality after 1990 (IMMIGRANTS)5.

At the level of Prahova county6, urban connectivity is by far the most important predictor of development
– to an extent far greater than at the national level. The communes of Blejoi, Bănești, Bucov, and Cornu,
for instance, have maximum connectivity through urban accessibility, and, consequently, very high human
development (see figure below). In contrast, communes with very low urban connectivity – Sălciile, Tătaru,
Călugăreni and Boldești-Grădiștea – have also a maximum level of poverty in the context of the county.

NotE: Human development and urban connectivity indices for the localities of Prahova.
In order to avoid overloading the diagram, we did not include all the locality names of Prahova county.
The increase by one unit on the urban connectivity scale tends to lead, on average, to an increase in local development by 7 units on the LHDI scale. If other
development factors, such as those included in the development regression equation for Prahova county localities, are kept under control, the previously
mentioned coefficient is lower, of about 6 units.

As throughout Romania, Prahova cities tend to systematically have a higher level of development than communes. Cities
like Sinaia and Breaza have a consistently higher level of development than it would be expected to have based on their
urban connectivity. Their touristic profile largely explains this fact.

Prahova’s developed localities also tend to have higher rates of immigrant population coming from other localities after
1990. In this case it is about a two-way relationship. On the one hand, local development attracts a greater number of
immigrants and, on the other hand, the immigrants’ educational structure, age structure, and professional structure are
by themselves local development factors.

The practical implications of these findings related to the context that determines development lead to the idea that
stimulating development in the county and implicitly reducing poverty in some relatively isolated county areas can be
effectively done by enhancing urban connectivity and the localities’ capacity to attract migrants and commuters. This
link between local development and urban connectivity is of particular importance in managing and developing projects

 The multiple linear regression model that supports the allegations from the paragraph is:
LHDI2011=13.85+1.29*URBCONECT+3.44*COMMUTERS+0.84*IMMIGRANTS+8.93 *URBAN, R2=0.43. All regression coefficients are significantly
greater than zero. A locality has an increasingly higher index of urban connectivity as it is closer to a small town of 30-50 thousand inhabitants,
a medium town (50-100 thousand inhabitants), large city (100-200 thousand inhabitants) and a very large city (over 200 thousand inhabitants).
6
 LHDI 2011=6.47+6.01*URBCONECT+1.58*COMMUTERS+2.26*IMMIGRANTS+10.18*URBAN, R2=0.64. The coefficient for urban connectivity is
statistically significant for p=0.01. The coefficient for COMMUTERS is not statistically significant, and that for IMMIGRANTS is significant for
p=0.06.

                                                                                            This has important implications in terms of prioritizing investments regionally, especially with respect to the connective

The migratory attraction of Ploiești is very high (97 arrived per 1,000 inhabitants) compared to the levels registered in
other cities of over 200,000 inhabitants in Romania. This growth pole (see table below), which scores very well in terms
of immigration, is in a similar situation with respect to commuting for arriving in the city (i.e. those who commute in
order to work in Ploiești).

                                  Development effects of territorial mobility networks

The communes located in Prahova county tend to be more developed as the commuting flows for work go to more developed
localities. The relationship also applies at the national level for all communes. In other words, for the development of
the village of origin, not only the activity of commuting for work by itself matters, but also the development level of the
locality in which people go to work.

Although at a lower level, the same goes for commuting in cities, both in Prahova and the rest of Romanian cities. The
practical implication of these series of findings sends to the idea that facilitating commuting to work is beneficial
to localities of origin, especially in the cases in which commuting is oriented towards destinations with a high level
of development. In other words, facilitating commuting for Prahova inhabitants to Ploiești and the metropolitan area
of this city, to Bucharest and the tourist towns from Prahova Valley can contribute to the development of Prahova
localities.

Note: Of about 114,000 Prahova inhabitants leaving for work in other localities in the country, specified in the 2011 census data, approximately 82% go
towards the 18 localities mentioned in this table.

The importance of the development triangle Ploiești – Bucharest – Prahova Valley tourist cities for the development
of Prahova is evident by simply mapping commuting and migration flows in the localities of Prahova since 1999 (see
figures on the next page).

Labor commuting flows between Ploiești and Bucharest generates residential counter-flows from Bucharest to Ploiești.
The processes are similar on the other two axes of human connectivity triangle mentioned above: the migration counter-
flow from Bucharest to Prahova Valley corresponds to the commuter flows from the Prahova Valley tourist cities to
Bucharest, and migration from Ploiești to Sinaia-Bușteni is counter-flow to commuting from tourist cities to Ploiești.
In fact, the relationship between commuting and residential migratory movement is complex, with multiple interactions
over which we should not insist in this context. What matters is emphasizing the idea that local development effects
don not belong to one or another of the cities mentioned in the analysis, but to a cross-county urban network.

Of course, urban networks that lead to development cannot be created overnight. They are the effects of long-term
cumulative processes. In line with local and regional development policies, actions for rural non-agricultural activities
development can be envisaged; these may function as a substitute for the established urban networks. Similarly,
connectivity between communes, given the proximity to each other, can be enhanced by developing efficient transport
networks.

  For rural areas in Prahova we have: IDUL_orig=53.53 + *0.024 * IDUL_dest – 5.138 * ln(Distance to city with more than 200k inhabitants). R2=0.34.
The shaded coefficients are significantly different from zero for p=0.05. N=4009 commuter flows between the communes in the county and target
sites, wherever these targets may be situated. For the towns in Prahova the regression coefficients are similar to those for communes, but are not
significantly different from zero. Given that the analysis is done for all 1500 commuter flows leaving from localities in Prahova, the significance
level is conventional. The direction of these relations should be taken into consideration. For all communes in Romania we have: IDUL_orig=45.18 +
*0.033 * IDUL_dest – 2.55 * ln (Distance to city with more than 200k inhabitants). R2=0.09. N=72758 origin-destination commuter flows.

Ploiești municipality remains one of the most important urban agglomerations in Romania and the largest in the South
Muntenia region, playing a key role in the overall development of the country. For this reason Ploiești obtained in 2008
the status of urban growth pole.

The municipality is part of an urban system with a population of over 4 million people and which generates about 50% of
the income of companies, together with Bucharest and Târgoviște, and belongs to Braşov – Bucharest – Ploiești – Giurgiu
development axis, which is the most important transport and development corridor in Romania. These agglomeration
phenomena generate the prerequisites for the Growth Pole’s further development.

For Ploiești, the proximity to Bucharest has antagonistic effects: on the one hand, the unequal competition between the
two cities has limited the development resources and the polarizing area of Ploiești; on the other hand, it has become,
especially in recent years, an economic and logistical hub for relocating of activities.

Ploiești Growth Pole includes localities with different functional profiles (complex, industrial, agricultural, etc.), which
are also complementary. The pole is located in a plain area, with pedo-climatic conditions favorable to agriculture,
particularly viticulture and fruit growing, and traditional activities. Therefore, in terms of how the land is used, agricultural
land occupies 65% of the growth pole. However, recent years have seen a growing trend in occupancy of land with
constructions (residential, industrial, communication infrastructure, etc.) at the expense of agricultural areas, especially
in the suburban area, although the housing and population dynamics in Ploiești were much lower than in other growth
poles in Romania. The area also faces a shortage of woodland, especially in the south.

Regarding the zoning of the built-up area, the central part of Ploiești municipality is the place where we find most of
the public services of general interest and attraction points, being surrounded by residential districts developed radially,
consisting either of individual housing or assemblies of collective housing (blocks), constructed especially during the
communist period. Both types of residential areas face specific issues that affect the quality of housing and public
spaces. In addition, many public and residential buildings face seismic risk and require major consolidation works,
Ploiești being among the most exposed areas in the event of an earthquake of high magnitude.

The industrial areas of the municipality occupy large surfaces, consisting of platforms built in the interwar period and
during the communist regime, some located in semi-central areas, totally or partially abandoned today (brownfield sites).
There are also new industrial parks, located in peripheral areas and having developed substantially in recent years, here
being located most of the major investments attracted by the municipality. Besides these, there are the major shopping
centers, developed in peripheral areas, sometimes even by the conversion of former industrial sites.

Green, recreational, and sports zones occupy a small surface at the growth pole level, compared to residential and
industrial areas, this being one of the major community problems, especially because there are major anthropic pressures
on the environment and high traffic values, besides the fact that the municipality is located in a plain area, thus lacking
extensive natural fields.

The last two decades have seen a sharp decline in the population trend, which is more pronounced than in the case
of other growth poles. The causes lie in the high intensity of internal migration (especially towards the capital city),
external migration (especially of the young and highly qualified population), and negative natural growth. In spite
of the demographic decline, localities in the peri-urban area of the municipality have benefited from a phenomenon
of suburbanization, which has led to the emergence of new residential areas with a better quality of living and the
relocation of some economic activities as a result of real estate, environmental, and urbanization pressures in the urban
core. This has had a positive effect on the localities concerned, which now record a higher urban development index than
the localities that are more remote from the city.

Considering the human development index, Ploiești ranks high in the the national hierarchy of urban settlements, but
lags behind many growth poles, the development gap between them having widened in the last decade. Locally, there
are major development disparities between Ploiești and the other localities, but also between city districts, where live
disadvantaged communities in terms of access to employment, housing and services of general interest, and which
require integrated investment under the coordination of the local community.

Working-age population continues to represent approximately 2/3 of the Growth Pole population, but the aging trend
of the local workforce is becoming more and more pronounced, the internal and external migration playing a significant
part in this respect. The same implications are to be found in terms of population structure by educational level, the
phenomenon of „brain-drain” (migration of highly skilled personnel) leading to a lower share of university graduates
compared to other growth poles. This vicious circle is a disadvantage for Ploiești Growth Pole in the competition for
attracting the necessary workforce with secondary education for industry and services.

Of all the growth poles in Romania, Ploiești has the greatest capacity to attract workforce from surrounding areas,
mainly due to the proper connectivity of the city and it’s positioning in an area with a high density and a yet significant
share of rural population with limited employment opportunities in the localities of residence. Harnessing this competitive
advantage by stimulating commuter flows (e.g. through investment in infrastructure and transport services) will have a
positive impact on the development of the Growth Pole.

Also, the structure of local economies varies significantly from one growth pole to another. Thus, in cities that were
the most economically dynamic in the last 10 years (Bucharest and Cluj-Napoca) the economy is dominated by the
tertiary sector (the service sector)2, which has – traditionally – the highest added value, the highest salary level and
offers the best prospects for development. By contrast, there are a number of less dynamic cities, with low economic
performance, such as Craiova and Ploiești, where the industrial sector continues to generate over half of the output
of the local economy. The exceptions to this rule are Timișoara, with a high share of the industry, but with a shift
towards more technologically advanced branches (automotive, electrical and electronic equipment, etc.) and a very
high level of foreign investment, which have continued to perform well over the last few years, and Constanța, with
a well-established service sector, especially in transport, but with lower economic performance. Therefore, in addition
to gearing its industrial sector towards more high-tech branches striving to become more competitive globally, the
Ploiești municipality must diversify its local profile by supporting the service sector.

In terms of entrepreneurial dynamics, expressed by the number of active businesses per 1,000 residents, the Ploiești
municipality has the weakest performance of all 8 Romanian growth poles; the local economy is dominated by large
companies with foreign capital, to the detriment of a solid local class of entrepreneurs. In this context, measures are
needed to support the residents’ business initiatives, which may prove more beneficial for the local economy in the
medium and long term.

Despite this negative dynamics, Ploiești Growth Pole continues to pool 64.6% of the active companies in Prahova county,
19.3% of those in the South Muntenia region, and 2.1% of those in Romania.

The suburbanization phenomenon occurring over the last few years around Ploiești has affected not only the residential
sector and the population, but also the businesses. Thus, the adjoining localities of Ploiești have attracted many investors
over the past few years – either newly established or relocated from the urban core –, pressured by urban planning and
environmental regulations and especially those related to the real estate market (the availability and price of land, the
level of taxes, the cost of utilities), so much so that some record a larger number of companies per 1,000 inhabitants
than the municipality itself (e.g. the Păulești and Blejoi communes).

Of the more than 10,500 active companies in Ploiești Growth Pole that submitted their financial statements for the
financial year 2013, 99.6% are SMEs, which are the engine of the local economy. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that
36.2% of these businesses have no employees and about 15% had no revenues in 2013. With this in mind, we can say
that the economy of the area is based on approximately 6,000 enterprises with a turnover that exceeds 25,000 EUR/
year. Compared to 2007, the number of microenterprises has decreased by 14.6%, the number of small enterprises – by
1.8%, the number of medium enterprises – by 8.1%, and the number of large enterprises – by 26.7%, some of the latter
having undergone significant personnel lay-offs since 2008. Therefore, we can say that small and medium enterprises
have adapted best to the unfavorable context of the economic crisis, as they are the most flexible.
                                                                                                                   99

In terms of the stakeholder age, we notice that 9.86% of the young people aged up to 29 own companies in Prahova
county, compared to an average of 10.79% nationally; the situation is similar in the case of people aged 30-39 (25.85%
compared to 28.15%). By contrast, the percentage of shareholders aged 40 and over is higher at the county level.

After 1989, Ploiești municipality and Ploiești Growth Pole underwent several cycles of restructuring and shifting /
adaptation regarding the local economy. Thus, some of the large enterprises built during the communist period reduced
their activity or disappeared, as they could not adapt to the conditions of the market economy, such as Plopeni
Mechanical Plant, “Romfosforchim” Chemical Fertilizer Undertaking in Valea Călugărească, “Astra Română” Refinery, “1
May” Oil Equipment Plant, “Intex” Textile Enterprise, “Cablul Românesc” Enterprise, “UZTEL” Plant, etc.

On the other hand, over the last 20 years, and especially over the last decade, a number of investors have come to this
area, developing new areas of activity and generating jobs, partially offsetting the disappearance of the large industrial
units built in the communist period: Coca-Cola, Unilever, Bergenbier, Alexandrion (food and beverage industry), Unilever
(chemical industry), OMV, Rompetrol and Lukoil (energy and petrochemicals industries), Calsonic Kansei, Yazaki, Johnson
Controls, Honeywell (automotive parts), British American Tobacco (tobacco), Lufkin, Cameron (equipment for the oil
industry), Timken (bearings), Dekomte de Temple, Ottorose, Beaulieu, Oztasar (textiles and clothing), Toro (machinery for
irrigation systems), Xella, Adeplast, Bauelemente (construction materials), Terqua (steel constructions), etc.

In addition to the shifting of the industrial sector, over the last two decades, the service sector has also developed; it
has come to generate over 40% of the turnover and over 50% of the number of jobs in the growth pole, especially in
the field of modern trade – as several large international networks (Kaufland, Carrefour, Billa, etc.) entered the local
market in transport, information and communications technology, scientific, technological and professional activities,
etc. However, the service sector in Ploiești is less developed than in other growth poles, due to the polarization of the
area by Bucharest, which is just 60 km away.

According to the Romanian National Tourism Office (ANT), of the total number of tourist accommodations in the
Growth Pole, 4.9% are one star places, 32.2% – are two-star places, 61.1% – are three-star places and 1.8% – are four-star
accomodation places. In Ploiești municipality there are only 13 beds classified as four-star (in one guest house), while
64% are three-star beds.

In 2014, in terms of tourist flows in the Growth Pole, 62,768 tourist arrivals were reported, which is 1.7% less than in
2007. This negative dynamics can be attributed to the global crisis, which has also affected the tourism market since
2009. During this period, the number of tourists accommodated increased in Ploiești municipality (+ 7.1%), in Boldești
Scăeni and Plopeni towns, and in Blejoi, Păulești, Târgșoru Vechi, and Valea Călugărească communes; numerous new
accommodation establishments were opened there.

Between 2007 and 2013, the number of nights spent in accommodation establishments decreased by 7% down to
149,134, both due to the decreasing number of tourists and to the average length of accommodation, which fell from 2.51
to 2.37 nights/tourist (even less in Ploiești – 2.36 nights). Of the total number of overnight stays, 71.8% were registered in
hotels, a percentage that rises to 90% in the specific case of Ploiești, where business tourism prevails in the local market.

The unemployment rate decreased significantly over the past decade, going from 14% in 2002 to 8.8% of the active
population in the 2011 census, nearly double the rate of about 5% communicated by the National Employment Agency,
which only reports jobseekers registered in its records. The increased local labor mobility had an important contribution
to the reduction of unemployment in the area, even despite the onset of the global crisis, due both to people commuting
to Bucharest and the temporary or definitive external migration, which reduced the pressure on the local labor market.

Regarding the net average wage in Prahova county (the most detailed territorial level for which the NIS collects statistics
on wage levels), in 2013 it was 5.4% higher than the regional average, but 3.3% below the national average. In the 2008–
2013 period, the net average wage increased by 16.6% in nominal terms, which in real terms meant an increase of about
5%. This rate was lower than the growth rate at the national (+20.6%) and regional level (+19.9%) for the same period.

Compared to other Romanian counties where growth poles exist, the net average monthly wage in Prahova is higher than
in Iași, Brașov, Constanța, and Dolj, but about 10% lower than that of Timiș and Cluj, and 33% lower than the average
wage in the capital city, which explains the intense and temporary migration of the local workforce to Bucharest.

processing capacity of over 8 million tons of crude oil per year, far exceeding domestic production (4 million tons/
year). They are operated by multinational groups and have benefited from massive investments for retrofitting; in
Petrobrazi alone, investments worth over 600 million EUR were completed in 2014, and the refinery became one of
the most modern in Europe. The refining industry currently employs about 3,500 people, i.e. 10% of the total workforce
employed in the industry.

For nearly two centuries, the development of Ploiești city was closely linked to the progress of the hydrocarbons
extraction and processing industry, Ploiești being the center of Romania’s oil sector, located in the middle of very
productive oil fields. As early as 1857, when the first refinery in the world became operational (Marin Mehedințeanu’s
gas factory), four oil refineries were built in Ploiești area, with a processing capacity of over 10 million tons/year,
processing both domestic and imported raw material. A genuine conglomerate of horizontal and vertical activities
developed around the oil industry (production of machinery and equipment for extraction, engineering and design,
construction and maintenance, pipeline transport, education and training, domestic and foreign trade, etc.), which
pooled together more than half of the local workforce, including during the communist period.

After 1989, with the decrease of hydrocarbon reserves, the negative dynamics of the national economy and the
restructuring and retrofitting process, the importance of the oil sector in the economy of the Growth Pole decreased
significantly; the Growth Pole became more diversified by attracting investments in industries such as food, textile,
automotive, services, etc. Currently, about 6,000 people are still working directly in hydrocarbons extraction and
processing, accounting for less than 5% of the total working population, given that, for example, one of the refineries
(Astra Română) is no longer operational and the other three operate below their maximum capacity. However, if we
include the related industries mentioned above, the number of employees directly or indirectly dependent on the oil
sector reaches 20% of the local workforce.

Thus, despite the declining importance of the oil sector, it remains the main field of local economic specialization.
The oil sector-related industries are volatile and heavily influenced by the evolution of the international oil prices,
which could have a domino effect on many local businesses; this is one of the key vulnerabilities of the Growth Pole’s
economy. However, the prospects are favorable, given that currently there are endeavors to exploit new hydrocarbons
resources in the Black Sea and in the Caspian Sea, for which Ploiești is the most appropriate resource center. They
could also contribute to an increase in the use of production capacity of the three refineries in operation (controlled
by OMV PETROM, LUKOIL, and ROMPETROL groups), which can process twice the domestic production annually.

The food industry also has good prospects for development in Ploiești area due to the strength of the local companies
operating in this sector, the proximity to the outlet market of Bucharest and its environs, but also from but also
thanks to the important agricultural resources in the area (e.g. vineyards, orchards, livestock, etc.).
The automotive parts industry will also continue to develop, as the industrial parks in Ploiești area attract a growing
number of investors in the field, attracted by the presence of DACIA RENAULT in the region.

In order to determine the industrial branches for which Ploiești area holds a significant competitive advantage
for export activities, we determined the Balassa Index of Revealed Competitive Advantage. It indicates that the
industry of machinery, electrical appliances, and equipment is the most competitive sector on foreign markets,
being strongly influenced by the fact that automotive components (e.g., wiring) manufacturers and oil producers
(YAZAKI, CAMERON, LUFKIN, etc.) are established in this area. Also, the textile and the automotive parts industries
are relatively competitive on foreign markets, although the former is competing with Asian products. Despite its
good local development, the petrochemical industry is still deficient in terms of competitive advantage, given the
significant imports of petroleum products that are processed in Ploiești refineries. Moreover, food imports are still
higher than the exports; the domestic agriculture and processing industry fail to fully cover domestic consumption,
despite very high-quality agricultural resources.

 The “questionable winners” are those economic sectors recording an increase in the number of local employees against
 a backdrop of nationwide declines in these sectors. The biggest questionable winners include: distribution of electricity
 (2,073 employees); manufacture of metal structures (1,642 employees); plumbing, heating, and air conditioning (1,267
 employees); repair and maintenance of other transport equipment (646 employees). Basically, these sectors are service
 sectors without a clear competitive advantage nationwide.

 The “big losers” are the economic sectors which suffered a decrease in workforce against a backdrop of positive
 performance of the same sectors at national level. The biggest losers include: manufacture of automotive parts (3,804
 employees); road freight transport (3,701 employees); engineering and consultancy activities (2,524 employees);
 collection, purification and distribution of water (1,440 employees); retail sale in non-specialized stores (1,419
 employees); manufacture of bearings, gears, gearing and driving elements (854 employees); electrical installation work
 (773 employees); manufacture of other special-purpose machinery and equipment (684 employees); transport by taxi
 (507 employees). Some of these sectors are low value-added and have no competitive advantage at national level (for
 example, trade). But others – namely the manufacturing of automotive assemblies – are sectors with a strong national
 competitive advantage.

 The potential for smart specialization of the local economy can also be assessed by comparison to the other Romanian
 growth poles, which are the engines for the development and growth of Romania’s economic competitiveness, as shown
 in the study on Growth Poles developed by the World Bank. Ploiești Growth Pole has important competitive advantages
 in the extraction and energy industries, being the most attractive of the Romanian growth poles (except for Bucharest
 municipality) in terms of geographic positioning of such activities. This is due to the fact that Ploiești has always been
 a traditional center for resources and skills in oil extraction and processing, but also to the investments made in recent
 years in the energy sector, such as building the largest and most modern power plant in Romania – OMV PETROM’s
 plant in Brazi, following an investment of over 500 million EUR, completed in 2011. It has the potential to generate 10%
 of Romania’s electricity needs.

 As well, Ploiești has average competitive advantages in the following industries: manufacturing industry (namely in these
 branches: petrochemistry, machinery and equipment, food and beverages), transport and logistics, as it is becoming more
 and more a logistics center serving both the South region and the Bucharest market (the platforms: AQUILA, KAUFLAND,
 LIDL, BILLA, PROFI, AHEAD) and in IT&C – some major companies are located here, such as TEAMNET INTERNATIONAL,
 ELETTRA COMMUNICATIONS, ROMCAP CONDENSATORI, 2K TELECOM, ASESOFT, SUNSMART INTEGRARE, INFRATEL
 NET etc.

 The Growth Pole’s Profile

1.2.5. Research and development, and support infrastructure for
companies

The research, development, and innovation activity (RDI) in Ploiești Growth Pole is underdeveloped compared to the
national level and is dominated by the public sector. The areas of specialization of the local RDI units are closely linked
to the area’s economic profile and are specialized in oil extraction and processing, oil equipment and viticulture.

Thus, the Research and Design Institute for Oil Drilling Equipment (IPCUP) is the only research nucleus in Romania
for oil equipment, drilling rigs, tools and devices in the field, ensuring – throughout its 60 years of activity – scientific
results that have propelled Romania among the top players in the world in this sector, ranking third after Russia and US.
In recent years, the institute, which is subordinated to the Ministry of National Education, has faced a dramatic decline
in demand for services, due to the privatization of the companies in the sector, which have their own RDI departments,
and has accumulated significant debt to the state budget, which has prevented them from paying the wages on time to
its specialized staff. Therefore, it currently has only about 50 employees, half of whom are university graduates and who
were transferred to the National Institute for Research and Development in Electrical Engineering (ICPE–CA) in 2013,
when the activity revived. In addition to the actual research and design, and technical inspection activity, the Institute
also performs technology transfer activities within its small production workshop. The customers of the institute are
mostly local companies in the oil equipment production and hydrocarbons extraction sector, but also some foreign
companies.

ICERP S.A. Ploiești is a company with double specialization – research and production, and has over 45 years of
experience in lubricants and additives. The company products (additives, greases, protection fluids, metal processing
fluids, industrial and engine oils, detergents, biocides, corrosion inhibitors) are marketed under the brands ADIROL,
LUBRICERP, and PROTICERP. All these products are the result of the research carried out in ICERP’s own laboratories;
over the last few years alone, more than 40 new products have been registered at the State Office for Inventions
and Trademarks (OSIM). This privately owned company is also facing a slump in demand; it is currently undergoing
reorganization and it has only 30 employees, one third of whom are university graduates.

IPIP S.A. (the Engineering and Design Institute for Oil Refineries and Petrochemical Plants), established in 1950,
is the leading provider of design services for refineries and the petrochemical industry in Romania. The company,
currently privately-owned, has nearly 300 employees and its annual turnover amounts to 10-20 million EUR. Other
local companies providing design, engineering, core taking, and research services in the oil sector are PETROSTAR,
WEATHERFORD ATLAS GIP, JCR CHRISTOF CONSULTING, COMPROIECT 92, TECON ENGINEERING, etc., with a total
turnover of over 65 million EUR and 1,100 employees in 2013.

IC-DVV (Institute for Research and Development of Viticulture and Winemaking) Valea Călugărească, subordinated
to the “Gh. Ionescu-Șișești” Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences, is one of the most important research
centers in the field of viticulture and winemaking in Romania. A variety of activities are carried out here, such as the
creation of plant propagating material from new varieties with high biological value, chemical analyses and quality
wines from the following varieties: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot noir, Fetească neagră, Sauvignon, Fetească regală,
Riesling, Distilate. The institute has modern research laboratories endowed with cutting-edge equipment, experimental
polygons (16.8 ha), pilot microvinification station, ampelographic collection of vinifera varieties and rootstocks with more
than 1,100 varieties and clones of the national and global range (5.2 ha), plantations of rootstocks (2.71 ha), nursery
vines (5.0 ha), pilot farms (around 150 ha), and a grapes winemaking undertaking, where the technologies in viticulture
and winemaking developed by the research sector are tested under production conditions. In terms of information
technology, the institute has modern means of communication (telephony network and optic fiber internet, high-speed
Internet, advanced computers and state of the art specialized software: ArcGIS, Arc Editor 9.1., etc.) and the possibility
to implement an INTRANET network. Like other public research units, the activity of the institute was affected by the
reduction of the allocations for research from the state budget and it has reduced its staff to about 100 people.

departments belonging to the five faculties of the university:

• Hydrocarbon deposits engineering;
• Modern and environmentally-friendly drilling and extraction technologies;

Regarding the protection of intellectual property rights, the statistics of the State Office for Inventions and Trademarks
(OSIM) indicate the following positioning of Prahova county in the national context, in the 2001-2013 period:

• 9th place by number of patent applications per 100,000 inhabitants (28), surpassing only Constanța among the
growth poles;

• 9th place by number of applications for the registration of designs per 100,000 inhabitants (15), surpassing Dolj,
Timiș, and Iași counties;

• 10    th
             place by number of applications for registration of trademarks per 100,000 inhabitants (240), surpassing only
Dolj.

When it comes to business and innovation support infrastructure, Ploiești Growth Pole ranks first among the
Romanian growth poles when it comes to the area occupied by industrial parks. Thus, there are eight authorized
industrial parks, four of which are public and four are private.

The industrial parks owned and managed by the local public authorities are the following:

•  Ploiești Industrial Park – covering an area of 163 ha and with an occupancy rate of 100%, it is a greenfield park
located in the western part of the city and has access to to DN (National Road) 72, the railway and the whole
range of utilities (electricity, water, sanitation, gas, telecommunications) and internal access roads. Currently, the
park accommodates about 40 companies, which have invested about 300 million EUR and have generated more
than 7,000 jobs, some of them resulting from significant foreign investment attracted in recent years (YAZAKI,
CAMERON, ALKA, CALSONIC KANSEI, KAUFLAND, JOHNSON CONTROLS, BERICAP, etc.). The park is managed by a
company subordinated to Prahova County Council, like the other three publicly owned industrial parks in the Growth
Pole.

• Plopeni Industrial Park – with an area of 76 ha and an occupancy rate of 100%, it is a brownfield park developed on
the abandoned production areas of the former Plopeni Mechanical Plant, having access to the full range of utilities. At
present, more than 25 companies operate here, with about 600 employees. They carry out various activities: plastics,
manufacture of wood and furniture, metallurgy and machining, machinery and equipment, trade, construction.

• Brazi Industrial Park – with an area of 46 ha, it hosts about 20 companies with 245 employees; its occupancy level
is of 75% for land and 12% for buildings. This park also needs additional investment for the demolition or conversion
of several abandoned buildings on its territory.

• Bărcănești Industrial Park – covering an area of 91 ha (with the possibility of expanding by another 80 ha), it is the
most recent industrial park in the area (2013), located on the land of the former Tătărani greenhouses, thus having
an occupancy rate of only 2%. The park infrastructure is poor, much of the land requiring disposal of the existing
constructions and installations. In this respect, a master plan was developed for investments worth about 8.4 million
EUR, and a Zonal Urban Plan. The proposed specialization of this park is agri-food.
                                                                                                                      129

                                                                               • Ploiești West Industrial Park – it covers an area of 290 ha, being the largest private industrial park in Romania,
                                                                               and is developed by the Belgian company ALINSO GROUP in the western part of the town, near the industrial park
                                                                               owned by Prahova County Council. It has areas for SMEs logistics, cold stores, and an intermodal freight terminal.
                                                                               The total investment in this park, estimated at 750 million EUR, was only partially implemented. By 2016, it is
                                                                               estimated that up to 20,000 jobs will be created. Among the renowned clients of the park there are international
                                                                               companies such as TORO, LUFKIN, UNILEVER, HONEYWELL, SCHLUMBERG, BAT, and HALLIBURTON. So far, the
                                                                               park’s occupancy rate has reached 30%, with investments of about 200 million EUR.

                             Map 41. Structure of Economic Activities (Romania)




Ploiești Growth Pole has a tendency of converging – in the long term – with the economic performance of other cities
and regions in the European Union. However, this tendency was temporarily interrupted by the global crisis, so that
the GDP/capita at current prices remains below 40% of the EU-28 average and below the level reached by more
dynamic growth poles (Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara) during the last decade.

The current economic structure of the Growth Pole is unfavorable for smart economic specialization and better
living standards; the high value-added service sector (ICT, financial services, professional, scientific, and technical
activities, etc.) is underdeveloped compared to other growth poles in Romania. Thus, Cluj-Napoca and Constanța
have an economy dominated by the tertiary sector, in contrast to Craiova and Ploiești, which display lower economic
performance and where the industrial sector continues to generate over half of the output of the local economy.
Timișoara is an exception to this rule, as it has a high share of the industry, but also shifts towards more technologically
advanced branches.

During 2011, 68.71% of the measurements showed values that were higher than the limits established by STAS 10009/88.
Noise measurements targeted areas that may pose health risks to the exposed population. The noise level is mostly the
result of road traffic affecting the population of Ploiești, rail traffic on the lower sections along railways and industrial
activities.

The figure above shows that in Ploiești, the values recorded exceeded 75 or even 80 decibels, on the north-south axis,
near the railway stations, in industrial areas and on streets crossed by trams routes or open to heavy-duty traffic.

According to an audit conducted by a private company in the field of acoustic measurements (ENVIRO CONSULT), the
most polluted growth pole in terms of noise is Bucharest (85% of the population is affected), followed by Constanța
(76%), Cluj-Napoca (64%), Brașov, and Ploiești (61%).

Climate change is a multi-sector issue, therefore most adjustment and improvement measures will be specific to each
sector. For example, the industrial, transport, and energy fields should take measures to reduce GHG emissions, e.g.
by making efforts to promote energy efficiency as specified in local recommendations on energy efficiency (LREE),
by using renewable energy in private and public sectors, by investing in the development of a low carbon transport
system, and by improving the efficiency of industrial entities and public utilities. As for reforestation, it is covered
by the biodiversity sector. Climate change adjustment measures are also sector-specific and must be integrated into
sector-specific activities, such as flood protection in rural areas and climate-resilient farming practices.

In Prahova county there are 14 operators that hold greenhouse gas emission permits for activities in facilities covered
by Law no. 278/2013 on industrial emissions. The procedure for issuing greenhouse gas emission permits for the
period 2013-2020 is laid out in Order no. 1897/2007, as amended and supplemented by Order no. 2069/2010 and
by Order no. 3420/2012.

                              Urban Heat Islands (UHI) in the city of Ploiești

The continuous urbanization of major cities worldwide and the climate effects induced by this process are, at present,
a major issue addressed in urban development studies. The main consequence of the enlargement of urban areas is
the intensification of urban heat islands (UHI) above medium-sized and large cities.

The study for detecting the urban heat island of Ploiești is based on two different approaches: detection of UHI by
direct measurements made at 1.5 m above the ground, for determining air temperature variations in the breathable
layer (atmospheric urban heat island - AUHI); and detection of the surface urban heat island (SUHI), identified based
on remote-sensing satellite imaging systems. The results of the two approaches are structured in two parts and
detailed below.
As shown, there are green areas, which lead to a temperature decrease in both cases, while the increase in the density
and height of both residential and industrialbuildings determines a temperature increase, especially if the roof color
and material allow heat retention at their level. As well, on both profiles, the urban heat island dome is well evidenced
compared to the peripheral rural area. In some cases, the high values of surface temperatures are counterbalanced in
the central part of the city by the existence of green areas with temperatures that are as much as 5°C lower than
those registered on surfaces (asphalt, concrete, etc.).

As for apartment buildings, the heat loss from inside to outside in the cold season leads to an increase of air temperature.
It is likely that the AUHI intensity will increase in the warm season, leading to an increase in the breathable air
temperature and generating a thermal discomfort for the human body.

The national roads that ensure access to Ploiești are generally in a good and very good condition, the best traffic
conditions being encountered on DN 1 (Ploiești – Câmpina – Comarnic section, including Ploiești West Ring Road) and
on A3 Highway. In contrast, DN 1A Bucharest – Cocorăşti – Colț segment is in a poor state.

In recent years, the national administrator of motorways and national roads (CNADNR) has conducted the following
major investments in the area:

•  enhancing the circulation on Ploiești West Ring Road – through an investment of about 40 million EUR, from the
state budget;

• infrastructure modernization for traffic safety on DN 1 in linear villages and black spots – through an investment of
about 20 million EUR, financed from SOP TRANS 2007-2013.

The table below indicates the county roads that provide access to the Growth Pole and the links betweenlocalities
therein. Appendix 1.4.1 includes a series of maps summarizing this information.

As it can be observed, over 95% of the county roads in Ploiești Growth Pole are upgraded, but many of them have not
been completely rehabilitated, undergoing only maintenance and repair works.

In terms of traffic volume, the highest daily averages are recorded on DN 1, from Bucharest to Ploiești (30,000 to
40,000 vehicles per day, depending on the section) and from Ploiești to Comarnic (25,000 – 30,000 vehicles day), this
being in fact the motorway with highest heavy traffic in Romania. Although DN 1 has 4 lanes and bypasses the main
urban settlements in the area (Ploiești, Băicoi, Câmpina), and despite the fact that A3 motorway linking Ploiești to
Bucharest Ring Road has been recently opened, on this highway there still are traffic jams, especially on weekends and

The rate of victims in accidents (the number of victims reported to the number of accidents) in Ploiești municipality is
of 1.18 victims per accident, significantly lower than the national average of 1.34 deaths per accident. In Romania, the
average number of deaths per accident (fatality rate) was of 0.777, while in Ploiești this rate was much lower, namely
0.016 deaths/accident. As regards the rate of vehicles involved in traffic accidents (number of vehicles relative to the
number of accidents), the state of fact in Ploiești (1.47 vehicles per accident) is equivalent to the national average,
namely 1.49 vehicles per accident.

If we were to compare the main cities and municipalities nationally, we can say that by far the most delicate situation
is found in Bucharest, where in the last 5 years there have been 18,691 accidents resulting in 21,926 victims, of whom
16,860 were slightly injured, 4,079 were seriously injured, while 407 died. As can be seen in Fig. 1 (hotspots of the victims,
made using KDE), dramatic situations are found in the cities of Constanța (3,635 accidents, 4,355 injured, 128 dead),
Cluj-Napoca (2,350 accidents, 2,763 injured, 64 dead), Brașov (1,983 accidents, 2,385 wounded, 79 dead), Craiova,
Iași, Galați, Oradea, Timișoara, and Sibiu. As it can be seen from the figure below, DN 1 Bucharest – Ploiești – Brașov,
which transits Ploiești Growth Pole, is the most visible traffic accidents hotspot in Romania. Moreover, Prahova county
ranks second at the national level with respect to the recorded number of road accidents; the fact that most accidents
occurred outside the county capital is atypical.

Public transport services are provided exclusively in Ploiești municipality by a company subordinated to the Local
Council – S.C. TRANSPORT CALATORI EXPRES S.A. (TCE), with a tradition of over 80 years. The company operates two
trolley routes with a length of 25.3 km, two tram routes with a length of 24 km and 41 buses. About 75% of company
revenues in the first semester of 2014 were subsidies, the number of employees being over 1,000. The company faces
chronic financial problems, which require urgent measures to streamline its activity.

The company currently operates a total of 33 trams, 42 trolley buses and 183 buses and minibuses, the buses and trams
fleet being on the decrease compared to 2007 following the cassation of used vehicles, while the number of trolley bus
has increased, following the purchase of new vehicles.

The vehicle fleet of TCE is extremely outdated, resulting in high maintenance costs, long waiting times at stations
and limited passenger safety. The newest buses in the TCE fleet are the 50 9-year-old BMC units, while the oldest are
about 40 years old. As regards trolleys, the newest 24 Neoplan units were purchased in 2009. The fleet of second-hand
trams was purchased 13 years ago from the German town Potsdam, the wagons having been manufactured between
1977 and 1985. Besides, the vehicles do not have, in general, air-conditioning, which affects negatively the comfort of
passengers.The ticket price for a trip is 2 lei, which is similar to other growth poles in Romania. From the fall of 2014
until the end of 2015, the trip by public transport will be free for the citizens with incomes lower than 3,000 lei in order
to compensate for the inconvenience related to works at the tram infrastructure and other objectives, objectives such
as the passage at the West Railway Station. In 2012, a pilot project for introducing the electronic ticketing system on
trolleys in the city was implemented, but it did not cover the entire network, and in 2014 the payment of tickets by
SMS was introduced too.

A World Bank analysis regarding the energy efficiency in Romania’s growth poles has revealed that only about 30%
of the residents’ daily trips are made by public transport means; this percentage is one of the lowest of all growth
poles and similar cities in Eastern Europe. However, the number of passengers who use public transport in Ploiești has
increased in 2007-2013 by 12.1%, and up to 82.2 million in 2014. Of these, 55.7% opted for buses and minibuses, 23.6%
for trams, and 20.7% for trolleys. Compared to 2007, there is an increase in the number of passengers who used trolleys
(+ 126.5%) and trams (+ 11.9%) over those who opted for buses (-5.5%).

The electricity distribution network is currently operated by S.C. ELECTRICA through its distribution branch, Muntenia
Nord Distribution S.A. The main activity of Ploiești distribution branch is the electricity distribution, but also the
exploitation and development of distribution systems, PRAM, telecommunications, and information technology.
It owns electricity distribution facilities at the level of Prahova county, in the south-eastern part of Romania, as follows:

• 834.84 km lines of 110 kV (circuit);
• 3,397.152 km medium voltage lines (circuit);
• 10,583.82 km low voltage lines (circuit);
• 46 transformer stations (of which 30 of 110 kV and 16 of medium voltage);
• 2,088 transformer substations.
Of all the power lines, only 16.6% were underground power lines (UPL), the rest being overhead power lines (OPL).
The lack of an underground canalization system for all types of OPL is one of the most pressing issues that Ploiești
municipality faces currently; this affects apartment blocks façades and architecturally valuable buildings frontages,
determining an unattractive urban look.

In addition, some stations and substations in the city are undersized and outdated, so they need to be replaced in view
of avoiding problems at the level of customer supply continuity.

registered in other similar cities, like Pitești. However, compared to the most recent years for which statistical data are
available, it is very likely that the number of fixed telephone stations have fallen to the detriment of mobile telephony,
which reached a penetration rate of over 90% of the population. Similarly, the number of high speed Internet connections
grew continuously compared to 2008, and the connection rate is approaching 50%.

areas
                                             Map 70. Regional accessibility




Ploiești Growth Pole has a favorable geographical position in terms of accessibility at the national and European levels,
being situated at the crossroads of major road and rail transport corridors in Romania, part of the TEN-T core network.
The largest airport in Romania (“Henri Coandă”, Otopeni-Bucharest), with over 8.3 million passengers and 100,000
landings/take-offs, is very easy to access, as it is 40 minutes away, providing satisfactory connections to most internal
and external destinations.

In what regards the connection with Transylvania and Moldavia, the lack of rapid transport links with Brașov and Buzău
municipalities, as well as with Târgoviște area limits accessibility. Hence, national roads connecting these urban poles
record high traffic values, as well as congestion and accident risks. For instance, the transport axis Bucharest – Ploiești
– Brașov records the highest traffic values in the country, especially on weekends and during peak tourist seasons on
Prahova Valley, and still does not have a highway yet. As well, the upgrade of DN 1 and the construction of A3 segment
that connects Bucharest to Ploiești have ensured only a partial decongestion of DN 1, as there is no direct access to the
capital on a distance of about 10 km.

                                                                                                                      183

                                                                                    Romania are in good condition, as they benefited from modernization and maintenance investments. The high traffic

In addition to the parks mentioned above, there is a series of traffic squares, the largest ones being in the central
area (Central Halls – Central Square – Toma Socolescu Square, Civic Center Esplanade, and I.L. Caragiale Square),
places for locals’ and visitors’ promenade, as well as places around objectives of public interest (e.g. traffic squares in
South Rail Station, West Rail Station, and North Rail Station). The central area of the city was also covered by the
CIVITAS - SUCCESS transnational project, which led to the creation of a 1 km2 of controlled roadway area dedicated to
pedestrians, cycle lanes and pedestrian tracks, public transport stations, etc.

As it can be seen, water supply and sewerage systems were given in concession by the local authorities to various
private companies. This is the case with Ploiești municipality, Boldești-Scăeni city and Berceni, Blejoi, Bucov, Valea
Călugărească, Bărcănești, and Păulești communes. The concession procedure targeted exclusively the management of
the existing infrastructure and property, their upgrading, rehabilitation and maintenance, the performance of investments
and network operation in exchange for annual royalties, while territorial-administrative units remained the owner of
the infrastructure. For example, in the case of Ploiești municipality, the extension of the water and sewerage network is
made by the municipal authority, the operator having an advisory and consultative role, while the responsibility for the
connections lies with the operator or consumer, as appropriate. Therefore, they can still access funds for investments
in water and sewerage infrastructure, less EU-funded programs that require the existence of a regional operator, such
as SOP ENVIRONMENT 2007-2013. The only operator with this status is S.C. HIDRO PRAHOVA S.A., which is currently
implementing a project with a grant from this program.

At the end of 2013, the simple distribution network of drinking water from Ploiești Growth Pole was 1,043 km long,
increasing by about 115 km (+12%) as compared to 2007. The most important water network expansions were recorded
in Băicoi city (+26 km) and in Blejoi (+21 km), Berceni (+20 km), Păulești (+18 km), Ariceștii Rahtivani (+15 km), and
Bucov (+14 km) communes. On the other hand, in the Târgșoru Vechi commune, network length has been reduced by
14 km in the same period, and in the Plopeni city, by 6 km, the reasons being related either to the decommissioning
of pipelines, due to their age, or of administrative nature. However, Ploiești continues to hold the largest distribution
network of drinking water, with a total length of about 417 km, of which 20 km is the water feed network. Out of the
882 streets in Ploiești municipality, 817 are fully connected to a water supply network, 43-partially connected, and 22-
not connected at all. Also, some areas of the city, such as Vega and Teleajen colonies, are to utility networks belonging
to local operators, which have their own wells, and not to the public network, since the municipal authority could not
make any investment here on reasons of land ownership-related restrictions. In this context, cadastral works must be
completed to clarify the regime of land ownership, which also affects future investment in public utility network. Also, it
should be borne in mind that in some areas there are no connection requests from individual consumers so as to justify
significant investments for the expansion.

 The total length of the simple water distribution is the length of tubes and pipes installed in the respective locality for the transport of drinking
water from the feed pipelines or pumping stations to the consumers’ connecting points. The length of the distribution network will be recorded as
a simple network, taking into account that, if there are two or more pipes installed on the same street, their aggregate length will be considered.
Both service networks and the distribution main and secondary roads will be included. The length of the connection pipes or the length of the
feed pipelines is not included in the length of the distribution network. The length of the feed pipeline is not included, even if there are consumers
connected to it.

Annex 1.5.1. covers the regional master plan on water, including the designation of water systems and conurbations/
clusters eligible for investment. They concern in particular, the extension of the sewerage network in rural localities that
still lack such a public network, but also the extension of the drinking water network.


1.5.3. Waste management
Based on the Environmental Report (EPA 2013), two documents on waste management were drafted in Prahova County:

County Waste Management Plan (CWMP 2008), approved by the Decision of the County Council no. 113/30.09.2008,
which provides the framework for the development of of EU-funded municipal waste management projects. As well,
it optimizes investments and operational costs of municipal waste management at county level and ensures, in the
medium and long term, the development of integrated municipal waste management systems, with positive effects on
the environment and human health.

The most important objectives of the CWMP are the following:

• extension of waste collection in rural areas that currently lack sanitation services;
• development of separate waste collection systems in order to achieve the recycling targets for packaging waste,
electrical and electronic equipment waste, end-of-life vehicles;

•   construction of waste treatment plants in order to achieve the targets for reducing the amount of biodegradable
waste discharged in the storage facilities;

• closing the non-compliant storage facilities and the ecological rehabilitation of the sites;
• construction and operation of new compliant storage facilities.
Long Term Investment Plan for the period 2008-2038 on the Integrated Waste Management in Prahova county
identifies the measures, for a period of 30 years, to be taken for the development of an integrated solid waste
management system in Prahova county, in accordance with the legal obligations, by:

• defining a phased program of long-term investments in waste management for the county of Prahova;
• the development of adequate integrated waste management systems to ensure compliance with EU Directives;
• drafting support documents for funding applications;
• drafting procurement plans and tender documentation in accordance with national legislation on public procurement;
• increasing local capacity in the preparation and implementation of projects.
The plan assumes that the rate of waste generation will increase in urban areas by 2020 (from 1.21 kg to 1.32 kg mixed
collected waste/inhabitant/day) and will decrease in rural areas (from 0.64 kg to 0.45 kg/inhabitant/day), and the
increase of the connection level of the population to sanitation services up to 100% will generate a significant increase
in the quantity of waste collected for all categories (household waste collected from population and economic operators,
municipal waste, bulky waste from parks, gardens, markets, streets). As regards their composition, it is expected that
the share of biodegradable waste will decrease from 58% to 48%, concomitantly with the increase of the plastic one
(from 8% to 10.5%), paper and cardboard (from 9 to 10%), mineral, composite, and fiber (15% to 22%), especially due to
the wide-scale implementation of selective collection.

The plan proposes, among other things, the following investment objectives relevant for the Growth Pole Ploiești:
• construction of a new storage facility in Ariceștii Rahtivani - Florești area;
• construction of a composting plant in Ploiești (on the location of the former non-compliant storage facility);
• construction of transfer stations at Brazi, Bușteni, and Urlați, including sorting and recycling plants in the last two.
The new storage facility would serve most of the county, less Vălenii de Munte area, Brazi transfer station, Brazi,
Berceni, Bărcănești, Târgșoru Vechi communes, Urlați city and Valea Călugărească commune, while the rest of localities
of the Growth Pole (Ploiești, Boldești-Scăeni, Plopeni, Bucov, Ariceștii Rahtivani, Dumbrăvești, Păulești, Blejoi) are due to
transport waste directly to the Aricești-Florești storage facility, which is equipped with a sorting station.
                                                                                                                        205

As regards waste collection, a dual selective collection system is proposed for 90% of the population, supplemented
with voluntary submission points eqipped with 3-bin recyclable fractions. Dual selective collection assumes the
implementation of a 2-bin system (a dry one for recyclable waste, a wet one for biodegradable and recyclable waste of
poor quality), operating under the “door-to-door” recycling regime. Mixed collection will be allowed only in central areas
with high concentration of population. In addition, in rural areas, voluntary submission points of recyclable fractions will
be of the “bring centers” - type, with 3 bins, individual composting in households being projected to reach at least 30%
of household waste. Mixed collection will be accepted only in very small villages. Waste collection will be done will be
done in 120 l and 240 l bins for single and multi-family collection points, 1,100 l containers for multi-family collections
points and for institutions and economic operators, 660 l containers for institutions and economic operators with
small amounts of waste generated, bell containers for voluntary collection of glass, 1,100 l containers for the voluntary
collection of paper and paperboard. The recommended means of transport are the dump trucks of 4 t and 8-12 t.

However, it should be noted that these investments, projected for a more distant time horizon (2038), have changed
after the approval of the Plan, since, for 2007-2013, the funds allocated from SOP ENVIRONMENT were assigned to
other objectives subordinated to the Integrated Waste Management System (IWMS) Prahova, which are detailed below.

Waste collection is not widespread in the county. In 2013, local authorities and sanitation operators collected household
waste from 90% of the urban population and 44.86% of the rural population, which, at the county level, represents an
average of 67.43% (according to the preliminary data reported by sanitation operators in the county).

The municipal waste collection is performed by a private company - Rosal. In turn, Boldești-Scăeni landfill (in Ploiești
Growth Pole) is administered by another private company - Vitalia. The amount of waste collected in Ploiești in 2012
was about 300 kg/person - the lowest value of the 7 growth poles in Romania. This is the result of several possible
causes, such as the low level of socio-economic development, which is directly proportional to the waste generation
index, incomplete collection of all the waste or differences in how waste was weighed.

Vitalia operates the ecological landfill using 6-8 trucks, including a compactor and some large machinery. Currently,
there is no sorting station. Such a plant is included in the master plan on solid waste and is to be built near the landfill,
with funding from SOP ENVIRONMENT 2007-2013. The landfill has a plant for leachate treatment by reverse osmosis -
allowing water treatment - in which the operator has invested about 650.000 EUR, excluding VAT. Leachate treatment
plant has a processing capacity of 3 m³/h and a recovery rate of 70%, the remaining 30% being re-injected.

The Prahova integrated waste management system is a complex project of approximately 36 million EUR (excluding
VAT), financed by the European Union through the Operational Program Environment 2007-2013. The contract for the
solid waste plan was signed in 2013 and includes the following components:

• closing the non-compliant storage facility in Ploiești, with an area of 31 ha, and building waste transfer stations in
Bușteni/Sinaia and Urlați.

• building a recyclable waste sorting station in Boldești-Scăeni, with a capacity of 45,000 tons/year;
• building a mechanical and biological treatment plant for biodegradable waste in Ploiești, near the former non-
compliant storage facility;

•   purchasing IWMS-related equipment to equip member TAUs of IDA with 2-fraction bins, containers for selective
collection, composters, etc.;

•  procuring technical assistance services for project management, supervision, and checking of works, auditing,
advertising.

The system will include components that were completed previously from other funding sources, such as pre-sorting
plant in Drăgănești.
These works started in 2014 and will be completed during 2016-2017. Investments made under the project will be
accompanied by investments from sanitation operators’ own funds, targeting mainly the purchase of collecting
equipment and the rest of the bins (20-30% of the total).

Once the investment is completed and the sanitation operators are designated in each area of the county by auction,
the solid waste management policy will require that collection and storage charges are accessible to the population, and
thus they will be established considering a maximum value. Ploiești Growth Pole is located entirely in zone II of IWMS, so
that a single operator will provide sanitation services for a period of 10 years, and the contracts of each local authority
with various subordinated or private operators will be terminated.

By 2025, the disposal of waste collected in Prahova county will be done at the two compliant storage facilities in
Boldești-Scăeni and Vălenii de Munte, operated by the private company Veolia, respectively by the Company of Public
Services and Renewables, a state company subordinated to the county administration. The latter manages the other
ecological landfill in the county, located in Vălenii de Munte and established in 2005. This landfill serves less than a
quarter of the county population, 48,000 tons of solid waste being deposited there annually. It is equipped with an
installation that produces a small amount of energy by the gasification process, but, because the mud flow is not
constant, the gas concentration is not very high. The obligation to recover recyclable waste lies with with the operator
managing the sorting plants.

For the period 2014-2020, investments for the completion of IWMS are expected, aimed primarily at biogas recovery
from the waste mechanical and biological treatment plant in Ploiești. As well, the following could be considered:
implementation of the system of underground bins in urban areas, provision of new equipment, and solving the waste
disposal problem after 2025, when the storage at Boldești-Scăeni will reach its maximum capacity. Another local
problem is the lack of inert waste storage facilities, which could be acquired through public-private partnership.

Public-private partnership (PPP) in the field of solid waste in the county of Prahova is an example that such mechanisms
can work in Romania. However, there is more to be done to further improve this area. The PPP model is not working as
it should, because the legal framework is deficient and contains provisions that do not clearly define the role of public
and private companies and how they should interact. On the other hand, the most challenging factor is the duration of
the partnership and its operating period. Banks are not willing to lend money for short-term projects, of 3-5 years, and
prefer programs that are spread over a longer period of time.

1.5.4. Heating system
The heating system in Ploiești is managed by Dalkia Termo Prahova, a private company that owns 87.2% of the Dalkia
Romania shares, part of French group Veolia. The remaining 12.8% of the shares are distributed equally between the local
authority of Ploiești and Prahova County Council. Dalkia has been responsible for managing the heating system in the
city since 2004, when the company signed a 15-year concession agreement with the two institutions mentioned above.
The contract, which resulted from and is based on indicators which do not take into account the losses on the network,
is valid until 2019 and may be extended after the expiry of the initial period. The company is responsible for the entire
process, from production to distribution of heat through a mixed system of electricity and heat. The plant is located in
Brazi, 10 km from Ploiești, and, along with the central primary network, is owned by the county administration, while
the secondary network is owned by the municipality.

According to the contract signed in 2004 with the local government, Dalkia has to invest 25 million EUR in network
modernization and equipment to increase the efficiency of the system. By 2015, the company had already invested
27 million EUR in this regard. For example, the new gas turbine of the Brazi plant was commissioned in 2010, as part
of projects worth 53 million RON aimed at increasing the efficiency of heat production. Here are the values of such
investments by objectives:

• RON 14 million for investment in the secondary network;
• RON 16 million for investment in the primary network;
• RON 2 million for investment in environmental compliance;
• RON 20 million for investment in improvement;
• RON 30 million for investment in security.
Dalkia supplies heat and hot water for about 57,800 flats in blocks (85% of all apartments in Ploiești) through a number
of 2,287 connections, and serves over 100,000 people, i.e. nearly half of the city’s population. In addition, Dalkia supplies
heat for more than 30 municipal buildings and about 700 economic operators. Dalkia customer structure is as follows:
66.9% residential customers, 31.65% economic and industrial operators, and only 1.38% public buildings. The company’s
industrial customers include prestigious companies, such as OMV Petrom and TIMKEN.

The plant in Brazi has 2 steam turbines x 105 MW, a 50 MW steam turbine, a 25 MW + 29 MW gas turbine, a 1 MW
gas engine and 2 MW steam turbine. Usually, turbines operate, on average, 9 months per year and use 600,000 m3
of natural gas for hot water production. In addition, heating units (substations) in Ploiești can produce 475 MW heat.
Plants use both natural gas and coal and can use a mixed technique, given that they have the ability to simply switch
from one fuel type to another. In winter, natural gas consumption is three times higher than in summer. It should
be noted that Brazi plant is directly connected to TRANSGAZ distribution infrastructure and has its own plant for
regulating and metering gas pressure.

The length of the primary network is 62 km, of which 62% is underground and 38% is at surface. The length of the
secondary network is 92 km. Most of the network was built in the 60s. So far, half of the 88 substations in the city
were modernized with EBRD financing.

Replacing eight kilometers of pipelines in 2004 contributed to the significant improvement of the efficiency of the
system starting with that year, requiring 30% less natural gas. Before finalizing the program for increasing system
efficiency, 300 m3 were needed to produce one Gcal of heat, compared to only 200 m3 currently required. It also
reduced the consumption of water and electricity. From 2005 to 2010, hot water consumption decreased by 50%, from
250,000 tons/year to approximately 100,000 tons/year. Similarly, electricity consumption has reduced significantly,
from 100,000 MWhe in 2005 to 60,000 MWhe in 2010.

Energy savings and low fuel consumption contributed to the improvement of the heating system performance, including
the boilers and turbines. For example, turbine performance in the cold weather increased from 36.8% in 2004 to 43%
in 2010, while thermal power supply increased from 94.02% in 2004 to almost 100% in 2011. At present, the central
heating system can lead to an efficiency of 75% when outside temperature is 0°C, and 76% when the temperature
increases to 4°C. The maximum temperature of hot water is 110°C.

However, despite the efforts to improve efficiency and maintain heat price at the lowest level in Romania, Ploiești
heating network is facing a number of difficulties. The main problem is the heat loss due to leakage of hot water from
the network. At present, technical and commercial losses in the network are estimated at 25%. However, compared to
most cities in Romania, including other growth poles, such as Brașov and Cluj-Napoca, Ploiești is doing much better in
this respect.

Heat losses affect the collection of heat and hot water bills. The main losses are those in the network and are caused
by the age of the pipes. Although the network has an average age of 32.3 years, a younger age compared to other
systems in the country, the pipes are made of low quality materials. Although the company has invested millions of EUR
in various programs to improve the efficiency of the system, the problem of network losses is still unresolved. Dalkia
Termo Prahova has implemented a SCADA system, but this tool cannot identify network problems. Last evaluation of
losses in the pipelines was performed in 2010.

Although locally there are only about 300 official disconnections from the centralized network/year, they increase
environmental risks and overcharge the bills of the other residents who remain connected to the system, due to thermal
imbalances, given that the current legislation does not impose restrictions regarding the disconnection from these
systems.

In this context, an investment plan for the
district heating network in Ploiești has been
developed for 2025, targeting projects worth
more than 100 million EUR for the modernization
of the primary and secondary heat network.
Other solutions using biomass and similar
renewable resources for the production of heat
and electricity could be added.

1.5.5. Completed / ongoing projects
During 2007-2013, works for the extension and rehabilitation of the water and wastewater (including treatment)
infrastructure were started in Băicoi and Plopeni agglomerations. They amounted to more than EUR 20 million and
were co-financed through SOP ENVIRONMENT 2007-2013. In addition, funds from the government and from private
operators were allocated for the same purpose for the cities of Ploiești and Băicoi, but also for a part of the rural
areas. Ploiești local authority has performed with its own funds works for the expansion and modernization of the
water supply and sewerage network in several areas of the city, most of them being directed to the following districts:
Bereasca, Mihai Bravu, Peneș Curcanul, Malu Roșu, Gh. Doja, Râfov, and Găgeni,

For the period 2014-2020, the Master Plan for Water-Sewerage of Prahova county provides investments for the
expansion of the related infrastructure, especially in the rural parts of the Growth Pole that lack water and sewerage
networks or where such networks cover their area only partially, so that all agglomerations of over 2,000 p.e. should be
connected by 2018. In this respect, the European funds will be accessed through LIOP 2014-2020, NRDP 2014-2020,
but state-budget funds will also be available through programs as NLPD.

In the field of integrated waste management, investments of around EUR 43 million, including EU co-financing through
SOP ENVIRONMENT 2007-2013, are currently under implementation. They are targeted towards the construction of
transfer stations (Boldești-Scăeni), sorting stations (Boldești-Scăeni), garbage composting plants (Boldești-Scăeni),
mechanical and biological treatment plants (Ploiești), greening of the former non-compliant storage facility in Ploiești
, and the purchase of equipment and vehicles for waste collection. In parallel, sanitation operators have invested in
the improvement of transport and collection infrastructure and in the implementation of selective collection, and the
company that owns the compliant storage facility in Boldești-Scăeni invested capital in order to use better the waste,
including for energy purposes (biogas). During 2014-2020, the County Master Plan in the field of waste is aimed at
additional investments supplementing the integrated system with new stations for water transfer and compaction, new
storage facilities, purchase of equipment for increasing the share of waste collected selectively.

Currently, an investment for the establishment of the West Municipal Park, worth over RON 50 million and co-financed
from ROP 2007-2013, is under implemented. At the end of the project, the park will have an area of 50 hectares and
will become a major attraction for the residents of the Growth Pole. As well, the municipal authority allocated annually
from the local budget considerable amounts for planning, modernizing, and maintaining green areas, most of them
being directed to to “Constantin Stere” Memorial Park from Bucov (over EUR 2 million after 2007), and Tineretului
Park, “Toma Caragiu” Park, Câineni Park, etc. Moreover, significant funds from the local budgets were allocated for the
development and upgrading of playgrounds (streets: Cameliei, Mărășești, Sala Sporturilor, București Blv., Dendrological
Park, Cibinului Str., Mihai Bravu Str., Malu Roșu area, Modern Park, Republicii Blv., etc.).

The public lighting system has undergone a comprehensive upgrading after 2000, when about 75% of the infrastructure
(poles, lamps, consoles, overhead lines, flash points, etc.) were replaced with local-budget funds by the operator that
received in concession the management of the system from the municipal authority.

The private operator managing the municipal district heating system has invested in the last 15 years more than EUR
27 million in Brazi plant, but also in primary and secondary networks, these amounts being allocated from its own
budget. Future plans aim to replace the very old network, which generates significant losses.

increase was due to the building of new, more spacious dwellings (mainly new, detached houses), and to the extension
and modernization of existing homes.

With regard to the building materials of outer walls, one may notice that most of the residential buildings that are made
of low-quality and hazard-vulnerable materials are found in rural localities (Dumbrăvești, Valea Călugărească, Bucov),
as well as in the towns of Boldești-Scăeni and Băicoi, with a relatively old housing stock, mainly consisting in dwellings
constructed in the first half of the 20th century. On the other hand, dwellings that are made of durable materials
(concrete, concrete prefabricates, brick, stone) are prevalent in localities with new housing stocks built either during the
communist or post-revolution period, such as Ploiești, Plopeni, Bărcănești, Blejoi, Brazi, Târgșoru Vechi, Păulești (more
than 60% of the buildings). Altogether, 24.1% of the residential buildings in Ploiești Growth Pole are built with low-quality
materials, this share being lower for Ploiești municipality (16.8%).

Out of the total current residential buildings of Ploiești Growth Pole, 3.1% have been built before 1919, 12.5% between
1919 and 1945, 20.7% between 1945 and 1960, 21.5% between 1961 and 1970, and 42.2% after 1970. Thus, the average
age of residential buildings in this area is more than 50 years. Moreover, 65.5% of these buildings were built before the
1977 earthquake, meaning they were not designed to resist to large-magnitude earthquakes, particularly as Ploiești
municipality lies in the most earthquake-prone area of Romania, next to the cities of Buzău and Focșani, which however
have a newer building stock.

Overall, one may say that the advanced age of the Growth Pole housing stock raises living quality and safety issues and
requires consolidation works, particularly for the pre-1977 buildings, whether houses or blocks of flats.

On the other hand, the 2011 census further showed that 90.1% of the dwellings in Ploiești Growth Pole were connected
to the sewerage network, out of which 68.8% to the public network, and 21.3% to private networks. The highest share of
dwellings not connected to a sewerage system is found in the communes of Dumbrăvești (59.8%), Valea Călugărească
(43%), Berceni (42.8%), Ariceștii Rahtivani (37.5%), Târgșoru Vechi (34.3%), Bucov (33.1%), and Brazi (31.4%). A total of
more than 13,700 dwellings in the Growth Pole are not connected to a sewerage system. Due to the lack of central
sewerage networks, private sewerage networks prevail in most of the Growth Pole localities (e.g. based on septic tanks),
the only exceptions being Ploiești, Boldești-Scăeni, and Plopeni. Ploiești had a number of 2,407 dwellings without
sewerage facilities, i.e. 2.7% of the total housing stock, located mainly in suburban districts (such as Mitică Popescu),
plus 5,405 dwellings connected to private networks. A total of 81,235 dwellings were connected to the public sewerage
network (90% of all city dwellings).

In terms of electrification, Ploiești Ploiești Growth Pole has 836 dwellings not connected to the power network, i.e. only
0.6% of the total housing stock. Most of these dwellings are found in Ploiești (296), Bucov (80), Valea Călugărească (65),
Brazi and Berceni (55), Blejoi (49), and Târgșoru Vechi (43). In most cases, these were due to voluntary disconnection
determined by the owners, the power supply network being developed in all these locations. However, the electricity
distribution network is considered for expansion in localities with widespread newly-built residential areas, such as
Blejoi or Păulești.

As regards the energy efficiency of the buildings the 2011 census data shows that only 40.8% of the dwellings in
Ploiești Growth Pole have been subject to thermal rehabilitation, while more than 80,000 dwellings (58.6% of the total)
require such works. The extent of thermal rehabilitation is slightly larger in Ploiești municipality (44.6%), but there still
are approximately 50,000 dwellings, both apartments and detached houses, which require thermal insulation and even
structural rehabilitation works.

1.6.2. Education
In the larger context of the wider objective of the Regional Operational Programme (ROP) to reduce economic and social
development gaps between developed and least developed areas, the education and professional training component
plays an important role in driving a sustainable economic growth in Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole. Furthermore, this
objective is compatible with and contributes to the final objective of the Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable,
and inclusive economic growth for Romania.

The Romanian education sector is an integral part of the Government’s Strategy to achieve the Europe 2020 objectives
and targets, which largely focus on improving educational standings and preventing school dropout. For this purpose,
the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research (MECS) drafted three Education Strategies under the ex-ante
conditionalities required by the European Commission (EC) for the next financial programming period 2014-2020,
targeted at three specific objectives, namely:

• Reduction of early school dropout rates (ESD);
• Increased participation to tertiary education (TE);
• Increased adult participation in lifelong learning (LL).
The population decline of the last two decades demands the correlation of education policies with economic and social
policies to ensure a sustainable and inclusive growth. A development strategy for 2014-2020 should envisage actions
and interventions which support and drive the achievement of such targets. However, as regards the South Muntenia
region, it has to be reminded that Prahova county recorded a lower rate of rural population decline between 1990-2010,
i.e. -1.5%, than Ialomița and Teleorman counties, where these rates are significantly higher, namely -15% and -14%. On
the other hand, Prahova county has higher rates of urban population decline (-9.5%).

Moreover, some of the general findings of the analysis of demographic processes occurring in Romania and the entire
South Muntenia region between 1990 and 2010 showed the short-, medium- and long-term negative impact of population
decline on active population ageing, as well as on school population. In addition, the number of children born by very
young or single mothers is on the increase, which leads to a higher risk of school dropout for such children (ADR South
Muntenia Study, page 29).

As compared with 2007, the total school population decreased by 8.7%, mainly due to the steep decline of birth rates
over the last two decades, and secondly to school dropout and the internal and external migration of the population, as
most of the high school graduates in Ploiești enroll in Bucharest universities. This decrease has left a significant mark on
vocational education (-89.7%) due to the reorientation of pupils to technical high schools, and on the number of students
(-31%) against the background of low pass rates of the Baccalaureate and the competition from other universities.
Significant increases occurred in the number of pupils enrolled in post-secondary schools (+221.8%), which became an
appealing alternative for those unable to attend university courses, as well as in the number of primary school pupils
(+24.7%), following the introduction of the Zero Grade.

The main education institution in the field of higher education is the Petroleum and Gas University (PGU), established
in 1948, which trains specialists for the Romanian oil and gas industry. In the last two decades, the educational offer
of the university was supplemented with humanistic and economic studies, at 5 faculties. The University campus
comprises around 80 seminar and lecture rooms, 140 laboratories, 9 amphitheaters, one auditorium, one library, an
Internet-connected computer network, servers, one gym and sports fields, 7 student dorms with 1,600 places, one
cafeteria, medical and dental offices, a student’s club, etc. According to the classification of the Ministry of National
Education, the Petroleum and Gas University is a 3rd category „education-focused university”, and was granted a high
level of trust by ARACIS. However, the scientific performances of the university trail significantly behind those of
traditional universities, such as Bucharest, Iași, or Cluj-Napoca.

Owing to its unique position at the national level and good external reputation, the Petroleum and Gas University
attracts more than 400 foreign students each year from countries such as Ukraine, Republic of Moldova, Angola, Ivory
Coast, Iraq, Syria, Vietnam, Turkmenistan, etc. Moreover, student and professor exchange programs are being carried out
with other European universities under the ERASMUS Program. The students of this institution take part in internships
at local companies in the industry, with some receiving even employment offers before completion of their studies. The
University cooperates with the private sector for research projects as well, as it owns state of the art equipment and
facilities purchased under POS DRU and POS CCE 2007-2013, although the promotion of its offer of services is still not
at its best. Such an approach is needed particularly against the backdrop of falling student numbers and insufficient
education funding resources from the state budget.

                    Social measures in the education field – social and support programs

The Ministry of Education is implementing a series of measures to support and assist the pupils enrolled in the public
education system, such as Cornul și Laptele (the Roll and Milk), Fructe (Fruits), Bani pentru Liceu (Money for High
School), Bursa Profesională (Professional scholarship), and EURO 200.

Commuting to school is frequent in Ploiești Growth Pole. The educational facilities in Ploiești municipality attract 6,726
children and pupils from other localities, some from significant distances (30-50 km), most of them choosing the high
schools in Ploiești, as most of the rural localities and small towns either do not have such facilities, or their current
education offer is limited. The number of commuting children and pupils is less than 500 in other localities of Ploiești
Growth Pole, more significant numbers being only reported for the communes of Valea Călugărească and Bărcănești,
respectively the towns of Boldești-Scăeni and Plopeni, with high schools that attract pupils from neighboring localities.
School mini-buses have been purchased under a MRDPA program in 2014, the communes such as Brazi, Berceni, Târgșoru
Vechi, Ariceștii Rahtivani, Valea Călugărească being among the beneficiaries. However, many pupils still travel to city
schools with public transport means or their parents’ vehicles, a fact that requires further investments in the expansion
and modernization of connecting roads and public transportation for fast and safe travel.

The total numbers of the teaching staff working in educational facilities of Ploiești Growth Pole was 3,712 in 2013
(2,700 in Ploiești municipality), of which 492 in the pre-school education, 637 in primary education, 922 in secondary
education, 1,274 in high schools, 84 in post-secondary education, and 303 in higher education.There is a 11.6% drop in
the number of teaching staff as compared with 2007, higher than the drop in school population (of approx. 9%), which
indicates that the number of students per teacher increased slightly from 16.9 to 17.5. One reason is the migration of
teaching staff to other fields or cities/countries following the low wage rates, which make teaching unattractive for
young graduates. Thus, many educational facilities have to resort to less qualified teaching staff or even substitute
teachers, a situation particularly prevalent in rural areas.

The local medical infrastructure is generally overused and obsolete, despite some investments (for instance, in 2014
alone, Prahova County Council allocated 10 mil. Euro for investments in the three hospitals under its management, plus
6.5 mil. lei for equipment in 2015) in the rehabilitation of facilities and endowment with modern medical equipment in
recent years. Thus, the Pediatrics Hospital is housed in inadequate premises, a situation which will be addressed by the
reconversion and furnishing of a new building donated by OMV Petrom, with an area in excess of 14,000 m2. Moreover,
Buna Vestire branch of the Emergency County Hospital, which currently serves the dermatology, gastroenterology,
internal and endocrinology wards, was found in an advanced state of disrepair and was proposed for closing by the
Ministry of Health in 2013. The Municipal Hospital and the Obstetrics-Gynecology Hospital are however in a better
shape, as they benefitted from significant rehabilitation, modernization and endowment funds from the local and
county budgets and the BEI, as well as the Medical-Social facility of Boldești-Scăeni, which received funding from the
Ministry of Labor. Furthermore, the Emergency County Hospital, the Municipal Hospital and the Băicoi Hospital received
grants for the implementation of integrated IT systems. The former Plopeni Hospital, closed down by decision of the
Ministry of Health in April 2011, was reopened as a private clinic a month later. All the hospital facilities and hospital-
based outpatient units in the area require new quality equipment.

As regards the medical staff of Ploiești Growth Pole, it included 694 doctors, 313 dentists, 330 pharmacists and 3,237
medium-level staff. As compared to 2007, the number of doctors increased by 12%, dentists by 87%, pharmacists by
52%, and medium-level staff by 33%, which can be attributed to the development of private medical services, as public
units are faced with acute staffing shortages due to migration to private hospitals or other medical centers in the
country and abroad. For instance, Ploiești Emergency Ward employs only 10 of the 24 doctors needed to consult more
than 250 patients per day. Similar situations occur with ATI, cardiology, neurology, nutrition diseases, etc. specialists.
The low interest of doctors for the public health sector relates to low wages and inadequate working conditions.

The emergency pre-hospital care in Prahova county is provided by the County Ambulance Service, which cooperates with
the first aid teams of of Șerban Cantacuzino Inspectorate for Emergency Situations Prahova, and with all the inpatient
units of the public and private medical care network of Prahova. The County Ambulance Service includes a hub station
in Ploiești and a substation in Băicoi. The response to major emergencies has improved in the urban environment since
2010, especially following the development of SMURD services. There are approximately 120,000 calls to the County
Ambulance Service per year (second place nationwide after Bucharest), but the staffing shortage is 75% for doctors and
37% for ambulance staff and nurses.

6.4. Social assistance and services
The social assistance policies and strategies for the welfare of children, families, single persons, the elderly, the disabled,
and any other persons in need at county level are implemented by Prahova General Directorate of Social Assistance
and Child Protection (DGASPC), a public institution with legal personality subordinated to Prahova County Council.
Its organizational structure includes specialized services / offices / departments, consisting in social assistance units
designed to provide welfare housing for children in difficulty and disabled adults, as well as alternative welfare services.

According to the 2013 Activity Report of this institution, there are 9 children welfare units and 10 adult welfare units.
At the end of 2013, 36,498 persons were registered at the Social Welfare Service for disabled persons (children and
adults). The value of the benefits paid to these people amounted to 118,133 thousand lei, i.e. 64.07% of the DGASPC
Prahova budget. As of May 2013, DGASPC Prahova included a Committee for the disabled, an advisory body tasked
with assessing the needs of disabled persons in Prahova county and proposing to the relevant institutions measures to
improve their life conditions.

The institution’s local-level records for 2014 were the following: 599 persons receiving guaranteed minimum income,
1,396 persons receiving benefits for severe disability, 433 allowances for personal caregivers of severely disabled persons,
21,000 households receiving municipal heating subsidies (16,000 apartments and 5000 houses), and more than 15,000
people being granted food aid under the PEAD Program, of which more than 9,500 disabled persons (mostly with
neuropsychological, somatic, physical, and visual impairment), 3,500 pensioners with income under 400 lei/month,
2,000 unemployed persons, 500 recipients of the guaranteed minimum income. In total, they account for around 7%
of the city’s permanent population. The number of people receiving social benefits dropped since 2007 due to more
restrictive eligibility conditions.

The Community Services Administration - Ploiești has concluded partnerships with a series of public institutions (the
Boldești-Scăeni Medical-Social Assistance Unit, the Probation Service attached to Prahova Tribunal, Prahova Prefecture,
DGASPC Prahova, Prahova Territorial Labor Inspectorate, Prahova Public Health Authority, Prahova County School
Inspectorate, County Police Inspectorate), but also with non-profit social organizations (Vasarley Life Care Association
for homeless people; St. Nicolae Barbu Establishment Association for homeless people; Princess Margareta of Romania
Foundation for dependent elderly; Youth’s Future Association for young people at social risk; the National Association of
the Hearing-impaired – Prahova branch – for persons with hearing impairment; Concordia Humanitarian Organization –
Ariceștii Rahtivani branch – children at risk of abuse; Constantin and Elena Foundation – social kitchen).

As regards the allocations for social benefits and services in Ploiești municipality, they amounted to approximately
20 mil. Euro in 2013, with the largest shares being allotted to public transportation subsidies for pensioners, pupils,
veterans, and students (34.7 mil. lei), municipal subsidies for heating (23 mil. lei), and social assistance subsidies for
the disabled (17.4 mil. lei), while the rest were oriented towards the following: social kitchen, preschool children day care
center, guaranteed minimum income, newlyweds, school medical offices, nurseries, social welfare for nursing homes,
scholarships.

Other public social services providers in Ploiești Growth pole include:

•   All town halls with departments providing primary public social assistance services, such as: assessment of social
needs, information and counselling, social assistance for children, families, single persons, the elderly, the disabled, and
all persons in need, which are tasked with resolving the community social problems in these fields;

• Ploiești penitentiary;
• Târgșoru Vechi women’s penitentiary.
Besides public institutions, there is a series of private organizations and associations accredited as social services
providers by the Ministry of Labor, Family, Social Protection, and the Elderly:

• National Association of the Hearing Impaired – Ploiești Branch;
• Constantin and Elena social kitchen – Ploiești;
• Association for the Support of Disabled Children – Ploiești branch;
• Romanian Association of the Blind – Ploiești Branch;
• Compassion & Care Association – Ploiești;
• Marcel Samaritan Foundation – Plopeni.


Despite the existence of these social associations and the conclusion of partnerships with relevant public authorities,
the contribution of NGOs to the provision of social services remains low, notwithstanding their significant potential to
increase the range of social services they provide and the number of their beneficiaries.

The housing stock dynamics in the 2007-2013 period mirrors a clear suburbanization phenomenon reflected in the
increasing number of dwellings built in the city’s surrounding communes. Thus, while the total housing stock of Ploiești
municipality increased by merely 2.3% after 2007, the growth rate in Blejoi, Târgșoru Vechi, Păulești, Bucov, and Ariceștii
Rahtivani communes ranged between 10.4% and 31.9%. These localities are part of Ploiești metropolitan area and are
relatively easily accessible, while land prices are much lower than in the inner city area, which makes them much more
attractive for building housing complexes. Moreover, these areas have plenty of available land for residential expansion
as compared with Ploiești municipality, which already has a high housing density.

A number of 54,021 dwellings have rehabilitated in this period. Currently, more than 40% of dwellings in Ploiești
municipality, Plopeni town and Blejoi, Păulești, and Brazi communes are thermally rehabilitated.

As regards available utilities, there is a significant share of dwellings without water supply and sewerage networks,
particularly in Berceni, Dumbrăvești, and Valea Călugărească communes, where more than 40% of dwellings do not have
access to sewerage facilities. In Valea Călugărească commune, 20% of dwellings do not have access to drinking water.

The educational infrastructure of Ploiești Growth Pole is comprehensive and covers all education levels, from primary
schools to postgraduate education, in both public and private facilities, with the latter on an increasing trend in recent
years.

The steep decrease of the birth rate, internal and external migration of the population, the migration of high school
graduates to other university centers, and the existence of some cases of school dropouts determined the reduction
of school population by almost 9% in the 2007-2013 period alone, a trend which is expected to continue. However, an
increase of enrolment in preschool education and post-secondary schools has been noted, the latter being an alternative
for pupils who failed to pass the Baccalaureate.

The offers of high schools in Ploiești Growth pole are diverse, consisting in fields such as sciences, humanities, vocational
and sports, technical and services. Technical high schools attract the most pupils, especially from neighboring localities,
but their Baccalaureate promotion rate is very low (sometimes below 10%), raising doubts on the schools’ capacity to
ensure sufficient numbers of secondary education graduates in the future.

Petroleum and Gas University of Ploiești has a tradition of nearly 70 years in higher education and a unique profile in
national context, offering Bachelor, Master, and Doctoral degrees at 5 faculties. In spite of this, the number of students
dropped significantly in the past years due to the increasing attractiveness of other national (Bucharest) or international
university centers, so that only 25% of the city’s high school graduates choose to continue their studies locally.

The ongoing vocational training offer is diverse at local level and covers a wide range of occupations for secondary
or higher education graduates, being provided by public institutions, NGOs, and private companies. However, with the
exception of free courses for a few categories, the number of participants to ongoing professional training activities
remains low, which in turn hampers the vocational retraining process, while many companies prefer to provide in-house,
job-specific training for new employees.

The school dropout rate remains below the regional and national average, but is still significant among vocational school
students, students from rural areas and Roma families, who are the most exposed to the risk of education exclusion.

School age commuters are highly prevalent, competing in numbers with adult commuters. Nearly 7,000 children and
pupils from all across Prahova county, but especially in a maximum 30 km radius, do their studies in Ploiești municipality,
being attracted by the diverse and superior quality education provided by local educational facilities. Although school
buses are available, many prefer to use public transport means or travel in their families’ cars, a further reason to
continue investments for the stimulation of metropolitan-wide mobility.

The local educational infrastructure has been improving in the past years thanks to investments from many funding
sources, including EU funds, but most educational facilities are still faced with major deficiencies related to inappropriate
conditions and poor energy efficiency of buildings, furnishings, school equipment and materials in classrooms and
laboratories, the inadequate sports infrastructure, etc. Future investments in the educational infrastructure should
however take into account the grim demographic outlook and the educational achievements up to now, which will
determine the closing down or restructuring of certain local educational facilities.

Life expectancy of the population in Ploiești area increased from 2007, but remains below the European average
and even that of other Romanian growth poles, the causes being, among others, the high rates of cardiovascular and
oncologic diseases due to little consideration for prevention or healthy lifestyle. These deficiencies exert significant
pressures on the local medical facilities, which often fail to cope with the demand.

The network of public medical facilities is complex and includes single specialization hospitals at county level, serving
more than 700,000 residents. However, the deficient health infrastructure and staff shortages constrain many patients
to travel to Bucharest for more complex investigations and interventions. Moreover, the private sector is rapidly growing
and provides some paid services of a better quality for patients.

Admissions in local hospitals dropped by around 20% since 2007, against the background of patient reorientation to
outpatient care services and the restructuring of the public health network. However, the hospital-based outpatient
care facilities have limited capacity and lack appropriate, state of the art medical equipment. Moreover, some hospitals
are housed in buildings unfit for quality medical services (Buna Vestire ward or the Pediatrics Hospital). Besides, Ploiești
municipality is one of the few growth poles lacking category I and II medical facilities that providing high quality and
diverse health services.

The public sector is faced with chronic understaffing due to the internal and external migration of specialists,
professionals, including to the private sector, or the unattractive working conditions and wages. The same situation
occurs at the County Ambulance Service, which faces increasing difficulties in managing the high numbers of requests
with severely understaffed personnel.

The local infrastructure of social services is complex, the most significant suppliers being the specialized departments
within city halls and the County Council. Nevertheless, the scope of social services and beneficiaries needs to be extended,
with emphasis on the non-residential component, taking specifically into account the increased number of people at
risk of social exclusion (such as dependent elderly, homeless people, children with parents working abroad, people with
disabilities, etc.).

The number of social benefits recipients has decreased as compared with 2007 due to more restrictive eligibility
conditions, but more than 7% of the city’s population meets the criteria for social welfare payments (unemployed, people
with disabilities, recipients of the minimum guaranteed income, low-income pensioners, etc.), for whom the municipality
earmarks around 20 mil. Euro from the local budget each year.

The involvement of NGOs in the provision of social services remains low as compared with other growth poles, despite
the conclusion of partnerships between relevant public institutions and such organizations.

                                                                                           •  12 museums, museum collections and sections, of which 9 are located in Ploiești municipality: County Museum

Museum, dedicated to ethnography and inaugurated in 2013). Târgșoru Vechi Archaeological Reserve, open to visitors
during the summer, and the museum collection of Ghighiu Orthodox Monastery (Bărcănești) also fall into this category.
These museums attracted over 194,000 visitors in 2013, a 79% increase compared to 2007. Such dynamics are almost
exclusively due to the Memorial Museum and the Zoo in Bucov, which attracted over 80,000 visitors following a vast
program of investments in the area, meant to modernize and diversify the entertainment facilities. Rehabilitation
works were also carried out at the Clock Museum in Ploiești, the only museum of this type in Romania, which has
approximately 4,000 items to display.

•  125 libraries, of which 11 are public, 20 specialized, and 94 belong to secondary and higher education institutions.
The number of libraries in the Growth Pole has fallen by 10 as compared to 2007, due to the closing down of some
educational establishments and communal libraries, such as the libraries in Bărcănești, Berceni, Blejoi, and Păulești.
Overall, the 125 functional libraries have over 2.39 million books (of which 1.93 million books in Ploiești municipality), and
the number of active readers in 2013 was 57,616, which accounts for approximately 17% of the Growth Pole’s population.
This number has decreased year by year, mainly due to the decline in the school population (who constitutes the major
part of the readers), but also to the growing use of online information media to the detriment of written culture. In
another respect, the libraries’ book stock is generally old and the premises are inappropriately equipped and therefore
unattractive to readers. The most important institution of this type in the Growth Pole is Nicolae Iorga County Library
- Ploiești, which was established in 1921 and operates in a single facility. It has over 502,000 books and periodicals,
of which approximately 300,000 are annually borrowed or consulted, and the number of subscribed readers in 2013
amounted to 13,722. The library has one lending section, one copies section, one documentary (rare book) section, one
multimedia section, one rotunda, one catalogues’ room, one community internet center – the BIBLIONET network, and
one reading room of approximately 90 seats. The library annually organizes over 50 cultural events (seminars, summer
schools, book launches, symposiums, etc.), as well as IT initiation courses.

•  4 cinemas: ‘Premiera’ Cinema (former ‘Patria’, administered by RomâniaFilm), City Cinema, City AFI Cinema, and
Twins Club, the last three being private units located inside shopping centers. With 12 auditoria (of which 7 are 3D) and
2,087 seats, Cinema City is the largest and most modern cinema, followed by City AFI Cinema, with 6
auditoria (of which 5 are 3D) and 1,273 seats. Twins Cinema has 85 seats in one 3D auditorium in the central area, and
‘Premiera’ Cinema, upgraded in 2011, has one 3D auditorium of 800 seats. As a result of such investments, the number
of seats in Ploiești auditoria was 2,638 in 2013 (a 206% increase versus 2007), the number of screenings reached
23,422 (a 28-fold increase), and the audience increased to 427,000 people (43-fold);

• 5 performing arts institutions, including the subordinate sections thereof – Toma Caragiu Theatre, with the Variety
Theatre and Puppet Theatre sections, and Paul Constantinescu Philarmonic, including the Symphony Orchestra and the




Folk Orchestra. In 2013, these institutions organized 354 performances and concerts, 34.4% less than in 2007. The two
institutions have 540 seats in their auditoria (of which 250 are dedicated to theatre), the number being in decline as
compared to 2007, which can be explained by the restitution of the former building of the ‘Ciufulici’ Children’s Theatre.
As the puppet section has no space of its own, it currently organizes performances in the premises of Cercul Militar (the
Military Circle) or Toma Caragiu Theatre. Works are being carried out to rehabilitate and equip a building which could
house the puppet section. The total audience of the cultural institutions in the municipality reached 44,852 people in
2013, which is 29.1% less than in 2007. The decline might be due to people’s diminished interest in culture and to the
challenges faced by the sector’s institutions (scarcity of staff and job capping, low level of remuneration, improper
equipment, etc.), which resulted in a decreased number of performances. However, the theatre and the philharmonic are
involved in the organization of cultural events with significant international standing, such such as: Toma Caragiu Theatre
Festival, Hot Jazz Summit Festival, or ‘Zilele Muzicale’ (Musical Days) Festival of Paul Constantinescu Philharmonic.

The report on the cultural vitality of Romanian cities (Centre for Research and Consultancy on Culture, 2010) analyzes
and ranks 46 Romanian cities based on a cultural vitality index, calculated as an average of 6 indicators: (1) cultural
sector infrastructure, (2) specialized human resources, (3) budget allocations to culture, (4) participation in cultural
activities, (5) creative economy, (6) non-profit sector. Ploiești municipality ranks 18, below all the other municipalities
belonging to growth poles, and also below other county seat municipalities in the South Muntenia region, such as
Târgoviște and Pitești. The largest gaps identified by the authors of the study in the local cultural sector are related to
the scarcity of staff and the insufficient activity of the relevant NGOs, whereas better outputs were found in terms of
volume of local budget allocations to culture and people’s interest in culture. The study also notes the poor development
of cultural and creative industries relative to the local economy, their share of the local GDP being around 50 times lower
compared to other growth poles in the country, such as Cluj-Napoca.

The cultural sector’s better results in other growth poles as compared to Ploiești is due to the broader social and
economic background thereof. This could be explained, inter alia, by the following: the proximity between Ploiești
municipality and the capital city, which polarizes the cultural life in the southern part of Romania; the number of
students and young people (one of the most important categories of culture consumers), which is much lower than in
traditional university centers (Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, Iași); the lower number of people having attended a
higher education institution; the local “brain-drain” phenomenon; the people’s low purchasing power, etc.

A full list of the cultural events organized in 2014 in Ploiești Growth Pole is included in Annex 1.7.2.

Associations of this type were also set up by certain educational institutions (e.g. the youth associations in the Nichita
Stănescu High School, the Pedagogical High School, Mihai Viteazul High School, I.L. Caragiale High School, Economic High
School, AIESEC association). Prahova County Council also supports the “Youth Forum – Prahova” initiative, now at its
second edition.

Despite such initiatives, the number of events dedicated to young people and their leisure, information and socializing
possibilities are relatively limited as compared with other growth poles, where the relevant associations are much more
visible (e.g. Cluj-Napoca, which is the 2015 European Youth Capital, or Brașov, which hosted the 2013 European Youth
Olympic Winter Festival).

                                     The private sector’s pyramid of needs

The private sector is a city’s source of economic dynamism, and an active local economy acts as a magnet for people.
For the local authorities it is therefore important to identify ways to address some of the key needs of the private
sector. These can be grouped in the following categories: qualified workforce; land and basic infrastructure; connectivity;
effective and efficient administration; clusters.

1. Qualified workforce. The key source of a company’s productivity lies in its people. It is people who think and design
products and services, it is people who produce these products and services, and it is people who ultimately market and
sell them. Thus, when a company decides where to locate, or when an entrepreneur decides where to start a business,
the availability of qualified workforce is one of the first things they take into consideration.
2. Land, Office Space, and Basic Infrastructure. Every business requires a place from which to operate. Some companies
simply rent or purchase an existent office space, while others require a new plot of land on which to develop their
facilities. It is therefore important for local authorities to have a good grasp of the availability of office space (i.e.
vacancy rates) and land parcels in the areas they administrate (e.g. brownfields or greenfields).
3. Connectivity. Connectivity is paramount to the private sector; it supports the access to workforce and to internal
and external markets. Easy access to a qualified labor pool implies well-developed local and regional infrastructure,
which allows easy commuting. Easy access to markets requires a modernized highway network, good airport, rail, and
naval infrastructure, as well as the availability of a proper ICT (information and communication) infrastructure.
4. Effective and Efficient Administration. Private companies require both public policies and public infrastructure
to function effectively. Some require that construction permits be made available on time, some may require a road
connection to the major road infrastructure in the area, and others may require appropriate tax policies.
5. Clusters. As counterintuitive as it may sound, private companies need other companies in the same sector to be
effective. The co-location of similar companies enables easier flow of ideas, seamless access to qualified workforce, and
higher productivity driven by local competition.



                                                Cross-cutting issues

In both pyramids, all these city development sectors have a spatial dimension, relating to the zoning of the territory,
and a demographic dimension, influencing the population dynamics. In addition to these basic components of a city’s
pyramid of needs, there are a number of cross-cutting issues that should be taken into consideration in the process of
decision-making at the city level – social inclusion and climate change.
a. The spatial dimension. As public or private investments take place on a plot of land, they influence the spatial
development of the territory. Therefore, this dimension covers aspects such as the supply and demand of land, the
advantages related to settling there, functional zoning and territorial expansion, which are critical for the development
of cities, as well as for the cooperation between administrative units in the growth pole and the protection of the
resources and natural heritage, etc.
b. The demographic dimension. The residents of a city across all age, gender, occupation, etc. groups are the essential
condition of its existence. The way they evolve – naturally or as a result of the implementation of development-related
decisions – is crucial for the future of the city. This dimension is reflected in the evolution and dynamics of the
population, as well as in the way people are attracted or not by the city, based on the response to the needs identified
in the two pyramids.
c. Social inclusion. Regardless of how developed a city is, it will always have to deal with social inclusion issues – i.e.
there will always be a part of the local population that will be directly or indirectly discriminated. Actively promoting
social inclusion not only helps achieve social desiderates, but it is also a critical tool for achieving economic goals.
d. Climate change. The more cities develop, the more they tend to pollute. In fact, cities are responsible for around 70%
of global greenhouse gases emissions. Local authorities should therefore think their projects through the lens of climate

1. Ploieşti – Prahova Growth Pole is the largest urban agglomeration in the South Muntenia Region, consisting of a
network of urban and rural territorial-administrative units (TAUs): three cities, one municipality, and 10 communes.
2. The growth pole territory is mainly rural, measuring 445.79 km2, compared to 163.25 km2 (urban territory). In
terms of property type, 79.9% of the land is privately owned and 20.1% is in public ownership.
3. The territory covered by the town planning documentation is as follows:
• 70.4% agricultural land, most of it being arable land (54.4%), and the rest mainly pastures and hayfields (9.7%),
vineyards (3.6%), and orchards (2.6%);
• Forests (9.1%);
• Waters (2.2%);
• Constructions (13.1%);
• Means of communication (4.2%);
• Degraded and unproductive land (0.9%).
4. Ploieşti Growth Pole comprises several territorial-administrative units with a varied functional profile, determined by:
• Agriculture, with added value from viticulture and fruit growing (the east-northeast area of the growth pole);
• Road freight transport and pipeline transport;
• Production and manufacturing activities involving mainly electronic and electric equipment for automobiles, mining
equipment, clothing;
• Trade and services – particularly engineering and consulting, financial services, operational in the central (mainly
urban) area of the growth pole.

1. The growth pole has 327,309 inhabitants. The average density is 539 inhabitants/km2. Between 2002 and 2011,
the population of Ploieşti municipality dropped by 9.7% and the population of the Growth Pole by 7.5%, both due to
the negative natural growth and high levels of migration towards EU countries and Bucharest city.
2. Following a phenomenon of suburbanization, Păuleşti, Blejoi, Târgşoru Vechi, Bucov, and Bărcăneşti communes have
recorded positive values due to the migration of the population from Ploieşti and Plopeni towards these areas.
3. The structure of the population by age indicates an increasingly pronounced phenomenon of demographic aging.
The degree of dependence of the population by age, expressed as a ratio between the elderly (over 60) and the young
people aged up to 15 years, is 156%.
4. In Băicoi, Ploieşti, Păuleşti, and Dumbrăveşti, there is an increase in the share of old-aged population, which
accounts for about a third of the total population in the growth pole.

1. Air quality has significantly improved in the growth pole in recent decades, due to the reduction of pollution from
industrial activities and the decrease of emissions from electricity and heat production.
2. The pollution level of surface waters and groundwater has declined in recent years, reaching values below the
maximum ones allowed.
3. There are no dangerous concentrations of pollutants in the soil samples collected.

1. Ploieşti – Prahova Growth Pole is well connected to the road and rail traffic networks by national roads in good
condition (DN 1 / E60 and DN 1B / E577, DN 1A, DN 72, DN 1D) and by the main railway Bucharest-Braşov and
Bucharest-Buzău. On road corridors the journey takes less than 40 minutes inside the pole, while outside the pole is
connected through a 60-minute isochronous line to Henri Coanda International Airport, Bucharest and the territorial-
administrative units of tourist interest -Sinaia and Buşteni.
2. The road network has been continuously modernized inside the growth pole, due to substantial investment from
various sources of funding, and the flow of road traffic has also increased (e.g. 30,000 - 40,000 vehicles per day).
3. Across Ploieşti municipality there are 1.18 victims per accident, below the national average, which reaches 1.34
deaths/accident.

                              1. The accessibility is limited by the lack of rapid transport links with Braşov, Buzău,
                              and Târgovişte municipalities; the national roads connecting these urban poles record
                              high traffic values, congestion, and accident risks
                              2. The road transport infrastructure inside the growth pole is in poor condition, causing
                              traffic congestion, reduced mobility, and air pollution
                              3. There are no intermodal terminals to ensure quick transfer from one type of
                              transport to another (rail, urban and interurban transport, bicycle and pedestrian, etc.)
                              4. There is no extensive traffic management system, especially at the level of
        Key issues            penetration roads (from the north to the south and from the east to the west), and
                              roads with limited transport capacity, due inclusively to the existence of intersections
                              with inadequate geometry and facilities
                              5. There is no integrated transport system at the metropolitan (urban and interurban)
                              level in terms of stations, transport schedules, and pricing
                              6. There are no parking spaces especially in areas with an increased flow of visitors /
                              travelers
                              7. There are areas / districts with poor accessibility (e.g. Mitică Apostol district)

                                     The manufacturing industry has remained the main employer in the Growth Pole, with a share
                                    of 24% of the total employed population, followed by trade (17%), agriculture (8%), constructions
                                                   and transport (7% each), all of which are low added value activities.
  The poor development of the         The activities with high added value and a higher level of pay (ICT, financial intermediation,
        tertiary sector             scientific, technical and professional activities) do not employ more than 9% of the population,
                                       which explains the fact that the wages in the area are kept at a lower level than in other
                                                   growth poles in Romania, with a more favorable economic structure.

                                        About 35,000 people residing in Ploieşti Growth Pole (10% of the total population) have
                                      migrated in the past two decades to other areas in Romania (especially to Bucharest) and
                                     to other countries; most of them are skilled persons, having graduated from high school and
                                    university (the “brain-drain” phenomenon). Therefore, the unemployment rate dropped to about
                                                                                   5-7%.
 A shortage of qualified middle-    The number of students in the public technical and vocational education system decreased by

                                     where (generally) less than 40% of graduates obtain the baccalaureate diploma. The number
                                       of participants in professional training programs also remains low. In this context, most
                                     companies opt for qualification at the workplace and for the recruitment of personnel from
                                                                      other localities in the county.

                                     Ploieşti Growth Pole has no category I or category II medical units, which are typically located
                                     in university centers (Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Iaşi). For this reason, a large number of patients
                                       in the area requiring more complex consultations and interventions are turning to university
                                    clinics in the capital city. The local medical infrastructure is generally old and outdated, despite
                                      the investments made in recent years; the Pediatric Hospital or the ”Buna Vestire” Section of
                                      the County Hospital do not have adequate premises. All hospital units in the area require new
                                           quality medical equipment, as do the ambulatory care units integrated into hospitals.
 The poor health infrastructure
                                      Compared to 2007, the number of hospital beds in the public sector decreased by 9%, due to
and the lack of specialized staff
                                          restructuring, which was only partially offset by the development of the private sector.
                                    Public health units (e.g. the Emergency Care Unit or the Ambulance Service) are facing an acute
                                    crisis of doctors and nurses (30-70% of the full-time positions), due to the migration to private
                                          establishments, and to the migration to other medical centers in the country or abroad.
                                     The life expectancy of the population is 75 years, 5 years below the EU-28 average and below
                                                                   the level recorded in other growth poles.

                                     In 2013, at the manual measuring stations in Ploieşti, there were recorded higher values than
                                        the maximum permissible concentrations of total suspended particulates (PM 10), sulfur
                                            dioxide, hydrogen sulphide, the main cause identified being the intense car traffic.
Noise and air pollution caused by      During 2011, in the case of 68.71% of the number of measurements for noise pollution, the
             traffic                   recorded values were higher than the maximum permissible limits. In Ploieşti, the recorded
                                     values exceeded 75 or even 80 decibels on the North-South axis, near the railway stations, in
                                              industrial areas and on the streets traveled by tram or open to heavy traffic.

                                    Seen in the national context, the research, development and innovation (RDI) activity in Ploieşti
                                      Growth Pole is underdeveloped, being dominated by the public sector. The specialization areas
                                      of the RDI units at the local level are closely linked to the area’s economic profile, which is oil
                                                          extraction and processing, oil equipment, and viticulture.
                                      The local traditional research and design institutes (IPCUP, ICERP, IC-DVV) have significantly
                                     restricted or even ceased their activity in recent years due to reduced state budget allocations
                                        for RDI activities, and also due to the development of such sections in private companies.
  Poor RDI infrastructure and         The Oil and Gas University has 13 research centers and a business and technology incubator,
  limited technology transfer          but their work is still little known to the business environment and limited in relation to its

                                    In terms of the expenses triggered by the RDI activity, Prahova county is far below the national
                                       and regional average, with less than 0.2% of the GDP, more than 10 times below the target
                                    assumed by Romania through the 2014-2020 Partnership Agreement. According to AD ASTRA
                                    statistics, Ploieşti ranks last among the growth poles in terms of scientific output, materialized

                                         As of 2011, 65.5% of the buildings (including over 100 blocks) were build before the 1977
                                         earthquake, therefore were not designed to withstand earthquakes of great magnitude,
                                          especially since Ploieşti is located in an area with the highest exposure to seismic risk
                                       (compared to the rest of Romania), along with Buzău and Focşani municipalities (0.3 g for

        High seismic risk            Although the procedure for the evaluation of buildings with seismic risk started 20 years ago,
                                     so far only 49 blocks have gone through this procedure; 31 were classified as Class I risk, some
                                      being a danger to the public and 18 were classified under Classes II-IV. Of these, only one has

                                       Climate change is the greatest environmental threat facing humanity. The past decade has
                                                        included nine of the warmest ten years in recorded history.
                                          Locally, these global phenomena are worsened by the existence of urban heat islands,
         Climate change
                                         accentuated by the low energy efficiency of the buildings, the high values of road traffic
                                                          pollution, the scarcity of green and planted spaces, etc.

                                     About 20% of the local workforce is directly or indirectly involved in the delivery of products and
                                       services for the oil and energy industry. In 2014, oil prices reached the lowest level in almost
                                      six years, and the price of gasoline is also at an unprecedented minimum. In this context, it is

                                     The GDP per capita at current prices in Prahova county was, in 2011, nearly three times lower

Following the corroboration of the results of the analysis concerning the relationships established between the
sectoral areas with the strengths and weaknesses of the SWOT analysis, a series of conclusions could be drawn and
some priority areas of intervention be identified for the strategy design:
• The cross-cutting issues are identified as development risks – the climate changes possibly triggered by the
development of productive economic activities, as well as social inclusion, by not addressing the marginalized areas
of Ploieşti municipality. These issues will have to be taken into consideration in the identification and selection of the
projects for the 2014-2020 period.
• Spatial planning at the growth pole level and demographic dynamics are identified as weaknesses. There is no land-
use plan at the metropolitan level and although there are land reserves, their development must be based on specific
urban regulations that protect the resources.
• The projects completed in almost all areas during the 2007-2014 period responded to the citizens’ need for
employment opportunities and to the private sector’s need for skilled labor. They covered infrastructure, energy
efficiency and cogeneration works, areas which generated jobs and thus boosted the development of the economic
sector.
• The investments made in accessibility and mobility had a positive impact on economic development / on attracting
investments – especially foreign investments – and on labor migration. They also had an influence on reducing road
traffic pollution in the center of Ploieşti city, on school migration and on the accessibility of marginalized areas and
leisure areas. In addition to these projects, some measures are necessary to improve public transport in the growth
pole.
• Also in terms of connectivity, energy and cogeneration projects have a multiplying effect on the economy, as well as
on the rehabilitation of the educational, medical, and social infrastructure, with a positive impact on climate change.
• The investments in public utilities have failed to meet the needs of the citizens in all component TAUs. Extending the
water supply and sanitation networks is a priority for Berceni, Dumbrăveşti, and Valea Călugărească, and for other
places where demand is not covered.
• The projects implemented mainly by the Oil and Gas University in the field of human resources development (SOP
HRD funds) are not reflected in the development of local entrepreneurship in the excellence field of the oil extraction
and processing industries or in the RDI sector.
• The investments in culture and recreation have failed to highlight the existing built and natural heritage and to
generate related cultural and tourism activities. Future interventions are needed in this area, in conjunction with
actions for the remediation of contaminated soil and with a policy for green areas.

                                                             Development Vision and Objectives
                                              According to the Integrated Urban Development Plan 2007-2013 (IUDP 2007-2013), the development vision for 2025 of
                                              Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole has taken into account “the role of the Growth Pole in establishing territorial partnerships
                                              in view of consolidating its comparative advantage conferred by its localization between the pan-European TEN-IV and
                                              TEN-IX corridors and in view of developing competitive advantages by harnessing localization factors in support of its
                                              inhabitants, business environment, and academia”.

                                              For the period 2008-2025, the vision drafted in 2009 has supported the community orientation towards permanent
                                              knowledge and performance, as a form of adaptation to the challenges brought forward by technological competition.
                                              Building on natural resources and their traditional exploitation, the growth pole has set out the objective of strengthening
                                              a community whose knowledge gained so far is the essential basis for its future development.

                                              The vision has outlined two major lines of intervention: (a) the first line deals with redefining the corporate role of Ploiești
Development Vision and Objectives




                                              municipality at the regional level, while (b) the second line is related to the development of neighbouring localities, which
                                              should become more attractive as living places and economic areas thanks to their progress and endowment.

                                              In support of the vision, the investments carried out under IUDP 2007-2013 primarily targeted aspects related to the
                                              accessibility and connectivity of the growth pole to the major European transport network, as well as aspects related
                                              to equipping the technical, public utility, education, and healthcare infrastructures, in order to eliminate disparities
                                              between the municipality and its area of influence. Furthermore, a series of projects have indirectly contributed to these
                                              objectives:

                                              • Projects aiming to support the business infrastructure, attract private investment and create job opportunities
                                              • Projects for the use of renewable energy resources
                                              • Projects aiming to strengthen human resources capacity in areas of interest for the labour market
                                              In addition to the investments carried out between 2007 and 2014, the public agenda for the period 2014-2020 includes
                                              further elements of social and territorial cohesion (through urban regeneration initiatives in disadvantaged areas) and
3                                             competitiveness (by improving the quality of life). Even though for the next programming period the structure of the
                                              vision remains unchanged, its content should adapt to the transformations registered in the economic and spatial
                                              dynamics of the growth pole, while continuing the main line of development, focusing on territorial cooperation between
The Integrated Strategy for the Growth Pole




                                              the territorial-administrative units in order to mobilize human and material resources.

                                              Consequently, the review of the vision’s content will have to take into account the following areas for which growth
                                              could simultaneously be pursued:
                                              • A pole of economic concentration dominated by clean productive activities and energy co-generation
                                              • A business partner — competitive for investors
                                              • An attractive and comfortable place to live in for all inhabitants from its component localities
                                              • A knowledge-based community where human strength and knowledge constitute the driving force of the growth pole
                                              Urban and knowledge infrastructure, improved through projects implemented in the 2007-2014 period, have laid the
                                              foundation for the development of a strong local / metropolitan economy with jobs that generate added value in
                                              the 2025 timeframe. The functioning of a mature, attractive, and competitive economy will support the sustainable
                                              development of the territory, as well as the social cohesion of the inhabitants of Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole.

                                          Development Vision
The Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole — a knowledge-based community, open to partnerships in the complex fields of
sustainable exploitation of resources and quality of life improvement for all its inhabitants.

Even if the development vision is accepted at the metropolitan level, it is still creating priority areas and differentiated
responsibilities for the municipality of Ploiești and its neighbouring towns and communes:
(a) The municipality of Ploiești will have to strengthen its polarizing role in the region, but also to make the best use of
its competitive advantages gained between 2007 and 2014, as well as to make progress with respect to value-adding
aspects such as urban regeneration or the development of cultural and recreational infrastructures, among others.
(b) The neighbouring localities shall make efforts towards the completion of works in the field of technical, public utility
and public transport infrastructures, while continuing the process of improving localization factors in order to tackle
demographic decline and to attract new residents.

In terms of increasing territorial cohesion and the efficiency in the use of natural and land resources, the partners of
the growth pole will have to coordinate economic and social development with the aim of adopting joint decisions on
the selection, localization, and implementation of development projects between 2014 and 2020; these projects should
lead to enhancing the efforts and maximizing the multiplying effects.

                                              Region1 lead to the formulation of an active development scenario based on the tandem between strengths and
                                              opportunities, in order to build on the results achieved in the 2007-2014 period in the field of accessibility and with
                                              respect to the technical, public utility, education, and healthcare infrastructures. The transition to a new development
                                              phase by enhancing the strengths and by developing areas that generate added value are reflected in the wording of the

                                               Recommendations for improving the institutional framework
                                                   at the level of Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole in the
                                                             2014-2020 programming period

                                              5.1. Background

                                              Growth poles are development engines for a particular region, as outlined in the World Bank’s Growth Poles Report,
                                              quoted in the Partnership Agreement as well. Growth Poles Policy – initiated in the 2007-2013 programming period –
                                              contributed significantly to the implementation of sustainable urban development and regional development concepts
                                              in Romania, and it should be continued and extended in the current programming period, while integrating the
                                              lessons learnt from the previous period and setting up development of appropriate coordination and implementation
                                              mechanisms.

                                              This view is also shared by the Ministry of European Funds, which mentions in the Reply Note no. 568 / 03.14.2014,
                                              addressed to the President of “Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole IDA”, that “the growth poles’ experience and activity
                                              will continue in 2014-2020” under a ROP Priority Axis dedicated to sustainable urban development (Priority Axis no.
                                              4 of the ROP). This axis will offer the possibility that the growth poles finance their integrated urban development
Recommendations




                                              strategies by “establishing a mechanism for the correlation of operational programmes in view of optimal processing
                                              of projects that are part of such a strategy”.

                                              As well, the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration mentions in the Reply Note no. 15 379 /
                                              10.03.2014, addressed to the President of “Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole IDA”, that the integrated urban development
                                              strategies will focus on “solving economic, environmental, climate, and social issues in cities”, while taking into account
                                              “the implementation at the level of the Partnership Agreement of a mechanism for the correlation of the ROP 2014-
                                              2020 with other operational programmes in order to ensure complementarity through prioritizing at the funding level

                                              In its position on the development of the Partnership Agreement and Programmes in Romania for the 2014-2020
                                              period (Ref. Ares (2012) 1240252/19/10/2012), the European Commission states that “the support given in 2007 to
The Integrated Strategy for the Growth Pole




                                              the 7 growth poles must be continued and expanded” and that “an appropriate level of delegation of management
                                              in order to assess requirements and institutional capacities should be considered”. The Integrated Sustainable Urban
                                              Development Factsheet mentions, in turn, that the various challenges that urban areas are confronted with require
                                              an integrated approach to urban development. Partnership agreements and operational programmes should establish
                                              the arrangements for ensuring an integrated approach regarding the use of ESI funds for the sustainable development
                                              of urban areas in the broader context of regional development. These investment priorities could be incorporated into
                                              the integrated urban development strategies of urban areas (Article 7 of the Regulation on ERDF), which could be
                                              accompanied by actions supported by the ESF under its investment priorities (Article 3 of the Regulation on ERDF).

                                              The implementation of sustainable urban development strategies involves a certain degree of delegation to urban
                                              authorities [Article 7 (4) and (5) of the Regulation on ERDF]. Given that sustainable urban development interventions
                                              can cover different types of cities and urban areas, as defined by Member States, this instrument allows the funding
                                              of district-level or sector-level integrated actions up to level of functional areas, such as urban regions or metropolitan
                                              areas, including neighboring rural areas. These provisions basically continue the recommendations included in the
                                              Toledo Declaration, which promotes an integrated approach towards urban regeneration and revitalization based on
                                              multiple criteria, integrated management, participatory governance, and an urban-scale approach of the area.
                                              EU Regulation no. 1303/2013 states in Article 36 that “Member States and the Managing Authorities can designate
                                              one or more intermediate bodies, including local authorities, regional development bodies or NGOs, to manage and

II
                                              implement an ITI under the fund-specific rules”.

                                              416
In addition, EU Regulation no. 1301/2013 states in Article 7 that ERDF supports urban development through “strategies
setting out integrated actions to tackle economic, social, climate, demographic, and environmental challenges
affecting urban areas, taking into account the need to promote ties between urban and rural areas”. Sustainable
urban development can be achieved through integrated territorial interventions or an operational programme with a
dedicated priority axis. Furthermore, each Member State shall establish in its Partnership Agreement, the principles
of selection of urban areas where integrated actions have to be implemented for a sustainable urban development,
as well as the indicative annual allocation for these actions at national level. In either scenario, at least 5% of ERDF
resources allocated at national level under the objective regarding investments for for growth and jobs should
be assigned to integrated actions for sustainable urban development, where cities, sub-regional or local bodies
responsible for implementing sustainable urban strategies (“urban authorities”) have to perform tasks related
to at least the selection of operations in accordance with Article 123 (6) of EU Regulation no. 1303/2013 or,
where applicable, in accordance with Article 123 (7) of that Regulation. Subsequently, the MA shall establish, after
consultation with the urban authority, the scope of tasks to be performed by urban authorities and related to the
management of integrated actions for sustainable urban development. At the initiative of the Commission, the
ERDF may support innovative actions in the field of sustainable urban development in accordance with Article 92
(8) of EU Regulation no. 1303/2013.

Regulation no. 1304/2013 states in Article 12 that the ESF can support local development strategies at the
community level in urban and rural areas, as provided for in Articles 32, 33, and 34 of EU Regulation no. 1303/2013,
as well as territorial pacts and local initiatives for employment, including young people employment, education and
social inclusion, alongside with Integrated Territorial Investments (ITI), as referred to in Article 36 of EU Regulation
no. 1303/2013. Complementing ERDF interventions, as provided for in Article 7 of EU Regulation no. 1301/2013
of the European Parliament and of the Council, the ESF may support sustainable urban development through
strategies setting out integrated actions to tackle the economic, environmental, and social challenges affecting
urban areas identified by Member States based on the principles set out in their respective Partnership Agreements.
The Partnership Agreement with Romania (Romania 2014RO16M8PA001.1.2) underlines at Section 1A that
Romania’s polycentric structure and uniform distribution of urban areas represent an advantage, “the role of urban
areas in generating and sustaining economic growth being recognized by designating the most important cities as
growth poles”. The Partnership Agreement also mentions that, although cooperation between urban and peri-urban
areas for the development of initiatives and public services has been limited due to political divergences, besides the
ineffective coordination of strategic projects at regional / county level, the basic principle of growth poles policy
is correct and this approach should continue in the 2014-2020 programming period, and its funding should ensure
coordination between financing sources.

An important contribution to overcoming these obstacles could have the Functional Working Group for New
Approaches, subordinated to the Ministry of European Funds and mentioned in Section 1B of the same Partnership
Agreement, and having the role to “harmonize approaches, guide and strengthen capacities, coordinate networks,
correlate and prioritize investments, so that interventions from different thematic objectives and programmes
jointly contribute to strategic development objectives of the territories concerned”.

The Partnership Agreement states in section 3.1.3./1131 that “the structure for growth poles coordination will
be maintained in order to ensure a better connection and correlation between ESI funds and local development
strategies and, at the same time, will try to support the improvement of the administrative capacity”.
The final evaluation report “Impact Assessment of Priority Axis 1: Supporting the sustainable development of cities
– urban growth poles”, conclusion no. 7 recommended that “in the coming period, local authorities should consider
strengthening the administrative capacity of local human resources in terms of planning and management of local
development strategies. It is also recommended that the role of growth poles’ coordinator at the regional level be
increased”, given the fact that, during 2007-2013, the integrated approach to growth poles was better than the
approach corresponding to urban development poles and urban centers, which were also supported by Priority Axis
1 of the ROP. The same highlights that the following two functions of the growth pole coordinator were particularly
positive and efficient:

•  Function of integration between public and non-public actors, i.e. leaning to connect the interests of the local
stakeholders involved in the Growth Pole and to promote cooperation and coordination;

•  Facilitation function, implemented particularly in the case of public actors, i.e. the coordinator’s role of mediation
between central and local authorities involved in the development and implementation of IDP.

                                                                                                                     417
                                              However, the report recommends the assessment of growth poles coordinators’ role in terms of three distinct types
                                              of activities, namely:
                                              a. Transversal activities, namely providing technical assistance for IUD Strategy (advocacy, monitoring, technical
                                              support for public authorities involved in the GP, mediation between Management Authority and Intermediate Bodies);
                                              b. Preparation for submission of projects, i.e. support in terms of project analysis, technical assistance in the
                                              selection, evaluation, and contracting phase (compliance and eligibility of projects); development of the project
                                              assessment report;
                                              c. Implementation phase, meaning assisting beneficiaries on all questions / requests arising during this stage.
                                              In the 1st Key Area of Intervention of the Priority Axis no. 1.1 pertaining to TAOP 2007-2013, it is emphasized that
                                              support was provided for the “functioning of the office/cabinet of the pole coordinator, which represents a horizontal
                                              coordination mechanism of the structural instruments’ interventions for growth poles”. In the same vein, TAOP 2014-
                                              2020 “aims to support horizontal issues for all OPs under the ESIF” and may finance “measures regarding horizontal
                                              issues for ERDF, CF, and ESF beneficiaries”. Based on the recommendations mentioned in the Position Paper of the
                                              European Commission services with reference to the preparation of the Partnership Agreement and operational
                                              programmes in Romania for the 2014-2020 period, integrated and efficient technical assistance should be intensified,
                                              diversified, and channeled to support ESIF major beneficiaries under the form of helpdesk-type customized guidance,
                                              dissemination of standardized and simplified documents, etc.

                                              Within the ROP 2014-2020, Priority Axis no. 12 explicitly provides for the financial support of urban poles
                                              coordinators’ structures in order to provide assistance to urban authorities (eg. for the provision of guidelines, best
                                              practices guides in matters of sustainable and integrated urban development etc.). The document notes that “direct
                                              support to both potential beneficiaries and actual beneficiaries is a precondition for the smooth implementation of
                                              the operational programme. For these reasons, extending the framework for direct support will be considered”. As
                                              well, “pole coordinators will have broader responsibilities in view of providing support to urban authorities that will

                                              implement activities corresponding to the integrated urban development axis”. The programme mentions that “in
                                              order to contribute to a polycentric development at national level, the support for the development of major urban
                                              centers and urban functional areas will be promoted, alongside with the strengthening of highly urbanized areas,
                                              while ensuring optimal basic services to serve medium-sized and small cities”. Their differentiated treatment and the
                                              identification of priorities in accordance to needs and local development potential are necessary.

                                              Since the selected thematic objectives for the urban development axis do not cover all key areas for the promotion
                                              of a sustainable and comprehensive urban development, projects that are part of integrated urban development

                                              During the implementation of this project, the World Bank team made several proposals for a possible institutional
                                              architecture at the growth pole level. These proposals were discussed with representatives of MA ROP, MEF, South
                                              Muntenia RDA, Prahova County Council, and the local authorities of Ploiești municipality. The recommendations in the
                                              sections below represent a summary of these discussions. These recommendations have also implied a continuous
                                              refinement of the initial proposals, given that, at the time of this report, the national and regional mechanisms for
                                              the implementation of Axis 4 “Sustainable Urban Development” of the ROP 2014-2020 are not established yet.

5.2. Establishment and operation of the Urban Authority at the level of
Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole

In accordance with the provisions of Article 7 (4) of the ERDF Regulation no. 1301/2013, it is mandatory to involve
the bodies who implement the Integrated Urban Development Strategy (IUDS) in the context of sustainable urban
development in the implementation and management of urban development funds. This implies that the Managing
Authority for the ROP may delegate tasks concerning the management and implementation of specific activities to
the bodies (“Urban Authorities”) who implement urban development; it is mandatory to delegate at least the duty of
selecting the operations (projects).

In accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of the ERDF Regulation and considering the method of implementing
sustainable urban development, both through the 2007-2013 ROP – ¬where Ploiești was selected as a growth pole with
financial pre-allocation under Priority Axis no. 1, and through the 2014-2020 ROP – where the eligible beneficiaries
are the county seats, the county councils or the IDAs formed around them –, the Urban Authority would most likely
be established at the level of Ploiești Municipality, with the involvement of appointed members of the Prahova County
Council and of the “Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole” IDA. Attracting the County Council and the IDA into this structure
is essential for representing the interests of all component TAUs of the association and for ensuring its organizational
sustainability.

It is recommended that the Urban Authority should include the following categories of experts (this will vary
according to the MA-ROP’s final decision on this matter):

•  8 representatives of Ploiești Municipality, nominated by order of the mayor, from various structures of the
institution;

•  3 representatives of the “Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole” IDA – nominated by order of the legal representative of
the IDA;

• 2 representatives of Prahova County Council, nominated by order of the president.
The World Bank proposal on the structure of Ploiești Urban Authority, based on the analysis of the organizational
chart of the institutions concerned, is as follows:

                                              Optionally, the following people can be invited as observers to the activities of Ploiești Urban Authority: representatives
                                              of the legal and procurement departments of the Municipality, of its subordinated units (e.g. hospitals, schools, Urban
                                              Management Services, etc.), of the public transport operators, of the utilities operators, of the sectoral IDAs (water
                                              and sanitation, waste management) and of the Urban Development Support Structure (UDSS). The members of the
                                              Urban Authority will be technical experts (officials / local elected representatives will be excluded).

                                              By delegating the project selection function, Ploiești Urban Authority will be part of the management and control
                                              system of the 2014-2020 ROP and will act as a secondary intermediate body, functioning as an economic and
                                              technical selection committee. In this context, it will enter into an agreement for the delegation of functions with
                                              the MA ROP, and the members of the Urban Authority shall receive support from the Managing Authority (or the
                                              consultants selected by it) in order to develop the project selection capacity, through training and information actions.
                                              However, the delegation of functions to the Urban Authority will not be accompanied by funds for its operation; such
                                              funds will be provided by the municipality / County Council / IDA. The World Bank has proposed the assignation of
                                              several monitoring functions for the Urban Authority, in order to ensure a permanent involvement throughout the
                                              entire implementation period, and in order to allow the offer of bonuses for working on European projects.

                                              Designating Ploiești Urban Authority as a secondary intermediate body and, thus, including it into the management
                                              and control system of the 2014-2020 ROP requires a procedure enabling the Authority to perform the functions
                                              delegated by the MA ROP (project selection / prioritization). Meanwhile, supervisory procedures will exist at MA ROP
                                              level for the function delegated to the Urban Authorities.

                                              In addition, the “Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole” IDA will also have the status of potential beneficiary for certain
                                              investment priorities under the Priority Axis no. 4 of the 2014-2020 ROP. In this regard, the Mayor of Ploiești will
                                              ensure both the involvement of various Municipality directorates and departments in the Urban Authority and the
                                              observance of the principle requiring separation of functions, in that the members of the Urban Authority will not
                                              be allowed to both prioritize and implement the same projects, according to Article 7 of the ERDF Regulation. A
Recommendations




                                              delegation agreement will be signed to this purpose between Ploiești Municipality and the MA ROP, with clear
                                              procedures for carrying out the delegated functions.

                                              The actual activity of the Urban Authority will be to develop a supporting document for the financing of interventions
                                              from the 2014-2020 ESIF, based on the Integrated Urban Development Strategy of Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole for
                                              the 2014-2020 period. The document will include an extensive list of strategic projects and project files, developed
                                              with technical assistance from the World Bank, which will be made available to the Authority by the Growth Pole

                                              The document will be structured as follows:
The Integrated Strategy for the Growth Pole




                                              a) A brief description of the approach proposed for the use of ESI funds in the 2014-2020 period: explaining how the projects
                                              / areas considered for funding under the 2014-2020 ESIF fall within the Integrated Urban Development Strategy

                                              is requested from the 2014-2020 ESIF are integrated at local or sectoral level (projects integrated from ESIF or
                                              integrated with other projects financed or considered for funding under the integrated local development strategy).

                                              b) The operational budget for the 2014-2023 implementation period: the operational budget for the identified metropolitan
                                              area TAU/IDA will be drafted based on a methodology proposed by the World Bank (about 420 million EUR for the
                                              2014-2023 period in the case of Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole).

                                              c) The shortlist of priority projects for the 2014-2023 period: preparing a list of projects for 2014-2023, whose
                                              beneficiaries are the Local Public Authorities and whose estimated value is at least twice the operational budget of
                                              Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole for 2014-2023, i.e. 2 x 420 million EUR = 840 million EUR.

                                              d) Explaining the methodology for prioritizing the projects and justifying how they were selected: prioritization of the
                                              projects should consider the available sources of funding (with a preference given to projects that can be financed
                                              from European funds) and an integrated approach (either at local level – for example, a particular neighborhood or


II
                                              region of Ploiești city, or at sectoral level – for example, mobility).

                                              420
e) The list of priority projects eligible under Axis 4 of the 2014-2020 ROP: a list of priority projects will be identified, which
could be supported by the indicative pre-allocation for Ploiești city (previously communicated by the MA ROP. The
World Bank proposed that Ploiești Growth Pole should receive an indicative pre-allocation of 41.95 million EUR), in
accordance with the investment priorities covered under this axis. A reserve list of projects will also be identified with
a total estimated value equal to maximum 50% of the amount allocated under Axis 4 of the ROP for Ploiești and in
accordance with the investment priorities covered under this axis.

f) The list of priority projects / priority areas eligible under other priority axes of the 2014-2020 ROP or other Operational
Programmes: according to the provisions of the Partnership Agreement, they will be financed with priority under other
priority axes / other operational programmes, through a mechanism of matching and prioritizing the investments set
out in the Partnership Agreement.

g) The institutional framework for the selection / implementation and monitoring of priority projects: providing information
on Ploiești Urban Authority, on the structure(s) and actors responsible for the implementation of the priority projects
in the 2014-2020 ESIF Supporting Document, including the composition of the Project Implementation Unit for each
priority project (it is recommended that there be a manager for every 10-15 million EUR), and project monitoring.

Specifically, starting from the unique prioritization methodology adopted by the Monitoring Committee of the Regional
Operational Programme (MC ROP) for all county seats and from the project list included in the Integrated Urban
Development Strategy (IUDS) of Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole for 2014-2020, each member of the Urban Authority
will apply the criteria from the prioritization methodology and will obtain an individual ranking of priority projects; the
final results will be obtained by totaling the scores given by each expert, a task that will be performed by a secretary
elected by the members. Based on the final score, various lists of projects will be drafted, to make up the Supporting
Document for the financing of 2014-2020 ESIF interventions. One of them will include the eligible projects for the
Priority Axis no. 4 of the 2014-2020 ROP. This will include projects amounting to 150% of the indicative financial
pre-allocation communicated by the MA ROP for Ploiești city. Additionally, the projects proposed for funding under
Priority Axis no. 4 will have to meet at least two thematic objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, and at least one
of them must target the reduction of CO2 emissions.

Once the Urban Authority has completed the Supporting Document, it will send it, together with the Integrated
Urban Development Strategy of Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole for 2014-2020, to the South Muntenia RDA, acting as
intermediate body, in order to perform an ex-ante evaluation of the documents to ensure their internal and external
consistency, and to check the fulfillment of the minimal admissibility criteria in the grid used by the MA ROP.

                                              the Ministry of European Funds. This option is preferable because the two documents will include projects that can
                                              be funded from various operational programmes and other sources of funding, and therefore should be designed and
                                              evaluated in an integrated manner. If during the evaluation there will be requests for amendments to the documents
                                              or clarifications from the evaluators, they will be operated by the Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole IDA and by the Urban

                                              Pole” IDA and by the MA ROP, the next step being the actual preparation of the individual projects prioritized in the
                                              document. The process of evaluating, selecting, and contracting individual projects will be similar to the one in the
                                              2007-2013 period, at least for the ROP Priority Axis no. 4; the duties will remain entirely with the MA ROP, which will
                                              delegate part of them to RDAs and to contracted external evaluators.

                                              5.3. Strengthening the administrative capacity of Ploiești
                                              Municipality to prepare and implement investment projects

                                              At the level of Ploiești Municipality there is a Directorate of International Relations, under which there is a Project
                                              Managers Department, with a total of 10 full-time positions in the organizational chart, dedicated to the management
                                              of preparations and implementation; only part of these positions are filled. In the context of the financial crisis, the
                                              recruitment of staff in the local public administration was prohibited and the salaries were reduced by 25 %; however,
                                              in recent years, the salaries have been restored to the initial amount. The municipality implements a relatively large
                                              number of projects with a small number of project managers, each managing 1-3 projects. They are poorly paid,
                                              given that the 75 % salary bonus for the staff involved in the implementation of EU funds is granted only at central
                                              government level, while at local level it amounts to 30-60%, according to salary classes, depending on the number of
                                              projects each expert is involved in.

                                              Given that Ploiești city has an operating budget of over 250 million EUR for the 2014-2023 period, we propose
                                              a functional review of the existing structures in the municipality and the establishment of Ploiești Municipality
                                              Programs Directorate, made up of:
                                              • 1 manager;
                                              • 25 project managers;
                                              • 3 public procurement experts;
                                              • 3 financial management experts;
                                              • 1 legal professional;
                                              • 2 engineers – civil constructions, public utilities;
                                              • 1 architect-town-planner.
Recommendations




                                              Ploiești Municipality Programs Directorate should have at least the following duties:
                                              • drafting tender specifications;
                                              • drafting service provision and development contracts;
                                              • organizing project-themed competitions;
                                              • solving public procurement issues;
                                              • project management;
                                              • post-implementation monitoring;
                                              • urban planning and territorial development;
5                                             • solving legal issues;
                                              • financial management.
The Integrated Strategy for the Growth Pole




                                              The World Bank proposed the following short- and medium-term solutions to strengthen the capacity of the program
                                              implementation / project management directorates, which is particularly necessary, whereas the newly established
                                              Urban Authorities will make redundant a significant number of municipality staff, due to the application of the
                                              principle of function segregation:
                                              • a functional analysis of the existing program implementation directorates / departments, in order to adapt their
                                              staff to the operational budget (financial potential for investments) of the city;
                                              • including staff expenses into the category of eligible expenditures for investment projects financed from European
                                              funds, particularly in the case of the ROP;
                                              • outsourcing some of the project implementation tasks to better paid external experts, in order to relieve their own
                                              staff, under the newly approved Law no. 64/2015;
                                              • increasing the salary bonuses to 75% for the staff involved in implementing EU-funded projects and also for the
                                              members of the Urban Authorities;
                                              • granting bonuses / related salary classes to the staff involved in the implementation of EU funded-projects and to
                                              the members of the Urban Authority, who will no longer have the right to engage in the project implementation units
                                              of the selected projects, according to the provisions of Article 7 of the ERDF Regulation.

5.4. Establishment of the South Muntenia Ploiești Urban
Development Support Structure
(by reorganizing the Ploiești Growth Pole Coordinator’s Office)

The Ploiești Growth Pole Coordinator’s Office had a sound activity in the 2007-2013 programming period, being very
supportive to the beneficiaries of ROP funds and other funds. This success is the result of continuous development
of the institutional capacity, despite the reduced number of employees, and the higher flexibility in recruiting, training
and properly remunerating its own staff, compared to the local public administration sector. From this point of view,
in order to meet the objectives undertaken by Romania in the 2014-2020 Partnership Agreement and in ROP 2014-
2020 document approved by the European Commission, it is necessary to maintain these structures and staff – who
already have a solid experience in working with local actors and in liaising with central level authorities.

The recommendation of the World Bank is to keep and reorganize these structures, bearing in mind the following
specific objectives:
• tackling the problems related to sustainable urban development for all county seats / IDAs in the region – in the
case of the South Muntenia development region, the county seats are: Ploiești, Pitești, Târgoviște, Călărași, Giurgiu,
Slobozia, and Alexandria. Ideally, the management structure of the pole coordinator’s office should remain within
the growth pole (which has a polarizing role for the rest of the region and where there is a core of already trained
and experienced staff, who could immediately take over the tasks related to the new programming period), with
representatives or local offices established in every county seat of the region. As such, it will require strengthening
the operational capacity of the existing office by hiring additional qualified staff and providing them with continuous
training, as well as the adoption by the MA ROP of working procedures for the CDUS;
• taking over some helpdesk tasks to assist the beneficiaries in the project design, implementation, and monitoring.
The South Muntenia Ploiești UDSS could help, inter alia, with the drafting of specifications and contracts (two stages
of the public procurement process that were deficient in the 2007-2013 financial period) for the projects that have
been approved for European funding (irrespective of the funding source);
• organizing an exchange of experience between the various county seats in the region and in Romania;
• the South Muntenia Ploiești UDSS will be part of the South Muntenia RDA structure, but its responsibilities will be
distinct from those of the IB ROP within the Agency. In this context, it is advisable that the MA ROP and the South
Muntenia RDA should conclude different agreements for the delegation of functions to the two sub-structures that
have a different track record and different operational characteristics and functions;
• the funding of the South Muntenia Ploiești UDSS, according to 2014-202 ROP document, will be provided from
Priority Axis no. 12 – Technical Assistance for the 2014-2020 ROP. Given the proposal that the UDSS should support
the beneficiaries in the implementation and correlation of all projects listed in the 2014-2020 ESIF Supporting
Document, we recommend that such activities should be funded by signing a quadripartite agreement between the
Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA) – MA ROP, the Ministry of European Funds –
MA TAOP (Technical Assistance Operational Programme), the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development – MA
PNDR (National Rural Development Programme), and the RDAs. Nevertheless, such a document should ideally include
all the management authorities which will implement projects at the growth pole’s level (MA-COP, MA-ACOP, MA-
LIOP).

The responsibilities of the South Muntenia Ploiești UDSS at the level of the 7 county seats in the region could include:

1. Supporting the development / updating / modification of the programming documents related to the
implementation of sustainable urban development in the 2014-2020 period
Approving the Integrated Urban Development Strategy (IUDS) for the 2014-2020 programming period and the
Supporting Document for the financing of interventions from the 2014-2020 ESIF, previously granting support to the
intercommunity development associations / county seats in drafting and updating these documents.

2. Supporting the Urban Authorities in fulfilling their responsibilities:
a) Supporting the creation, accreditation, and functioning of the Urban Authorities, including the implementation of
the annual recommendations of the audit missions.
b) Supporting the drafting of the Urban Authorities’ internal working procedures for the function delegated by the MA ROP.
c) Supporting the Urban Authorities in implementing the power delegation agreements concluded between MA ROP

                                              implementation of the Supporting Document for the financing of interventions from the 2014-2020 ESIF, including
                                              for priority projects (e.g. project status, compliance with the schedule for drafting / submitting related projects, etc.).

                                              4. Supporting the implementation / monitoring of priority funding projects related to the Supporting Document
                                              for the financing of the interventions from the 2014-2020 ESIF

                                              financing the interventions from the 2014-2020 ESIF.
                                              c) Participating in monitoring visits, as an observer.

5.5. Strengthening inter-institutional cooperation and the cooperation
of associative structures in Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole

The “Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole” IDA, although it was established as early as 2009, has a poor institutional capacity.
As we have indicated in the previous sections, during the 2007-2013 programming period this associative structure
was rather an artificial vector of investment, designed to attract grants available in the 2007-2013 period under
Priority Axis no. 1 of the ROP, without providing other services to its 15 members or to the Prahova County Council.
On the other hand, the applicant for most of the investments financed under this axis was Ploiești municipality,
even though most of the projects (such as those in the field of mobility – e.g. road passages) impacted or served
the metropolitan area. In this context, several TAUs that were members of the association chose to no longer pay
the membership fee and expressed their desire to leave this associative structure, being more attracted to the Local
Action Groups, which provided direct benefits in the form of grants, albeit of very little value.

In this context, in order to ensure the institutional sustainability of the “Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole” IDA in the
2014-2020 period, urgent action is needed to develop the institutional capacity of the executive apparatus of the
association, through measures such as:
• developing and communicating to the members a concrete action plan for 2014-2020, in order to keep them in the
associative structure;
• joining the Romanian Federation of Metropolitan Areas and Urban Agglomerations and getting actively involved
in its activities, including through exchanges of experience with the functional metropolitan areas in Romania (e.g.
Oradea, Constanța, Baia Mare, or Iași);
• preparing and implementing projects that benefit from grants (e.g. under the Competitiveness Operational
Programme, the Human Capital Operational Programme, INTERREG, etc.) for strengthening its own institutional
capacity (e.g. training courses, equipment provision, etc.) and providing services to its members (e.g. by organizing
information and training sessions, by assisting them in drafting the strategic and spatial planning documents, by
joint databases, by promoting tourism and culture, environment, energy efficiency, ICT, etc.);
• involving the IDA members in the Urban Authority in order to ensure representation of all members’ interests in the
prioritization of investment projects at Ploiești Growth Pole level;
• changing the name of the association into “Ploiești Metropolitan Area” IDA, in order to avoid any semantic confusion
and to clearly highlight its purpose.

In the medium term, with the amendment of the legislation on land and urban planning, and of the legislation on
the organization, operation and financing of the local administration, the Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole IDA could
expand its scope to cover areas such as: land use planning and urban planning, by developing and adopting the Land
Use Plan for the Regional Metropolitan Area (updating the existing Land Use Plan for the Inter-Communal and City
Territory); preparing and implementing projects supported by grants (currently constrained, in terms of infrastructure,
by ownership and subsequent operation issues); or even providing specialized consultancy services for its member
TAUs (preparing tender specifications, contracts, assistance during implementation, support for attracting investors,
etc.), operating as a genuine Metropolitan Development Agency.

Another major concern in Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole is public transport, which is set out in detail in the Sustainable
Urban Mobility Plan of the Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole, developed with the support of the MRDPA and the EBRD,
to be completed in 2015. Currently, at pole level, there is no metropolitan public transport operator; such services are
provided in Ploiești by a public operator whose sole shareholder is the municipality. In the localities of the peri-urban
area, the services are provided by various private operators which have obtained transport licenses that are generally
valid until 2019. Moreover, such operators were not selected in accordance with the EU Regulation no. 1370/2007,
which requires a public services contract (a template for such a contract was already developed by the EBRD), but in
accordance with the national law of that time, which was not completely in line with that Regulation.
Therefore, if all member TAUs of the Ploiești-Prahova Growth Pole IDA and other localities in Prahova county express
their consent, procedures must be launched for the establishment of a Ploiești Transport Metropolitan IDA, with
a view to conclude – by the year 2019 – a public service contract with a metropolitan operator, on the basis of the
transport program which will be developed and adopted. The latter will be in line with Regulation no. 1370/2007
and will set out the obligations of both the transport operator and of the member TAUs, in terms of compensation
(subsidies) provided to the operator, given that not all routes tendered for will be profitable.

                                                                                                                     427
                                              Subsequently, the duties of this IDA can be extended, following the model proposed for the Bucharest-Ilfov region and
                                              according to the legislative changes at national level, so as to include other powers:
                                              • parking lot management in the member TAUs;
                                              • supervising the taxi trade;
                                              • operation and maintenance of the transport model developed under the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan;
                                              • management of a metropolitan railway transport system;
                                              • mobility planning at the level of the Metropolitan Area.

                                              Finally, a priority in terms of interinstitutional cooperation in Prahova County is the continuation of efforts to attract
                                              investors. Prahova county has the largest area of authorized industrial parks in Romania; the local authorities –
                                              especially the Prahova County Council – have invested significant amounts in their development, and their success
                                              in attracting investors is unique nationwide. However, the recent years have seen a reduction in investor interest in
                                              the county’s public industrial parks; a case in point in this regard is the new industrial park in the county – located in
                                              Bărcănești –, which was established two years ago and has no clients at all.

                                              Therefore, it is recommended to establish and properly financially support an Investor Relations Office, either at the
                                              level of Prahova County Council or at the level of S.C. PLOIEȘTI INDUSTRIAL PARC S.A., a company managing the
                                              industrial parks subordinated to the County Council; this Office should perform the following functions:
                                              • upon request, assisting potential investors with all necessary information for starting a business in Prahova county
                                              and providing support during the implementation phase (identification of land, assistance in obtaining approvals,
                                              agreements and permits, providing access and utilities – in partnership with the owners of the utility networks, staff
                                              recruitment agencies, etc.);
                                              • proactively approaching investors by organizing business delegations within the country and abroad, cooperating
                                              with foreign embassies, with commercial and state banks, organizing investment forums, participating in specialized
                                              fairs and exhibitions, etc.;
Recommendations




                                              • cooperating with other structures at national, regional, county, and local level who have duties / powers in attracting
                                              investors (government agencies, RDAs, universities, chambers of commerce, etc.);
                                              • developing and distributing materials promoting the county as an investment destination;
                                              • call-center services for existing and potential investors;
                                              • organizing jobs fairs and vocational training courses for professions that are in demand, in partnership with schools
                                              and accredited training units;
                                              • etc.
