This evaluation of the World Bank Group’s program in Kazakhstan is a part of the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) Clustered Country Program Evaluation for
Resource-Rich Developing Countries: The Cases of the Plurinational State of Bolivia,
Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Zambia.”

This evaluation was prepared by an IEG team led by Konstantin Atanesyan, and
was conducted under the guidance and supervision of Geeta Batra (Manager) and
Nick York (Director) and the overall direction of Caroline Heider (Director-General,
Evaluation). Members of the evaluation team included Dinara Akhmetova, Lev
Freinkman, Andres Liebenthal, George Polenakis, Inder Sud, Kendra White, and
Disha Zaidi. Barbara Balaj and Barbara Rice edited the report; Corky de Asis and
Yasmin Angeles provided administrative support. The report also benefitted from
comments provided by peer reviewers William Ascher (Claremont McKenna
College), Alan Gelb (Center for Global Development); and Andrew Warner
(International Monetary Fund).

IEG is grateful to the numerous representatives of the government, private sector
entities, and nongovernmental organizations who provided valuable insights into
the World Bank Group’s program in Kazakhstan. The team is also thankful to the
World Bank Group management and country team members, including both
previous and current staff working on Kazakhstan, who provided valuable time,
information, and feedback to the evaluation team.

Overview
 Highlights
 Kazakhstan made steady progress on poverty reduction and social development during
 the review period, driven by impressive economic growth and rising hydrocarbon prices.
 Yet, the country continues to grapple with a number of systemic challenges, including: a
 lack of progress on economic diversification and anticorruption; a dominant role of the
 state in the economy; a lack of skills in the labor force; and a legacy of environmental
 problems inherited from the Soviet era.
 The quality of the Bank Group dialogue with the government was exceptionally high
 throughout the evaluation period. The Bank Group has established itself as a trusted
 adviser to the government, with a proven track record of timely delivery of high-quality
 technical and policy advice, including cabinet-level “brainstorming sessions” and the
 client-funded Joint Economic Research Program (JERP). Implementation of the JERP
 suggests that it could become a powerful tool for strengthening the partnership,
 advancing the reform agenda, and gradually building up the lending program. At the
 same time, the fully demand-driven nature of the program imposed limitations on the
 Bank in defining strategic priorities in its advisory work, disseminating findings, and
 engaging local partners. Overall, this evaluation concludes that:
        The effectiveness of Bank assistance was uneven across the engagement areas. It
         was more effective in the macroeconomic and fiscal areas, in particular, in helping
         turn the National Oil Fund into a reliable national savings mechanism and an
         effective instrument of countercyclical fiscal policy. The Extractive Industries
         Transparency Initiative (EITI) was a useful and effective instrument for
         promoting transparency and accountability. However, corruption remains a
         persistent problem. The strategy to promote economic diversification through
         sector interventions was relevant, but the effectiveness of its separate elements
         varied and the impact was not evident. The Bank Group effectively supported the
         remediation of legacy environmental issues in Kazakhstan and provided
         generally successful strategic policy advice in education and pensions.
        Looking forward, the Bank Group will need to (i) link the JERP with concrete
         sector investments and advance monitoring and evaluation (M&E) tools to track
         its effectiveness; (ii) disclose the main policy recommendations; (iii) engage local
         partners and civil society to advance transparency and accountability and build
         capacity; (iv) select and prepare of a set of analytical products independently and
         in line with the World Bank Group’s global development mandate; and (v) be
         more selective and strategic in sector engagement.


Bank Group Strategy and Dialogue                   was accompanied by steady progress
                                                   on poverty reduction and social

OVERVIEW


Recommendation 8: The Bank should
consider being more selective in
sector engagement, based on its
comparative advantages in relation to
other stakeholders and the private
sector participants, and depth of
dialogue and strategic convergence
with the government. The selection of
specific sector interventions by the
World Bank Group was generally
relevant to the country context.
However, the effectiveness of separate
elements of the Bank Group program
in these areas was highly uneven.
Agriculture is a potentially high-
impact sector for diversification in
Kazakhstan. However, the Bank
program was a combination of
unrelated ad hoc projects that were
not expanded even when they had a
positive impact. In the energy sector,
the Bank needs to reinvent its role
after a decade of fruitful cooperation.
At the same time, there is high
potential for successful scaling-up in
the transport and environment sectors,
including the possibility of positive
spill-over effects on relevant sector
institutions.

1. Evaluation Objectives and Report Structure
This Country Program Evaluation (CPE) evaluates World Bank Group (International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development [IBRD], or the Bank, the International
Finance Corporation [IFC], and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency [MIGA])
programs in Kazakhstan from FY04 through FY14. The period reviewed was covered by
two country strategies: the 2004 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and the ongoing
CPS for FY12–17.

This report is part of the clustered CPE for natural resource-rich developing countries
that covers four countries: Bolivia, Mongolia, and Zambia, in addition to Kazakhstan.
The clustered CPE exploits the learning potential of looking across countries and
regions. In addition to each country CPE, the clustered CPE also includes an
overarching report that summarizes the experiences and draws broader conclusions
and lessons across countries.

To maintain consistency across the analyses, each CPE follows a similar organizing
framework based on challenges that arise from high dependency on natural resources
and adjusted to particular features of the Bank Group program in each country. These
areas are broadly consistent with Kazakhstan’s core development challenges and
include:

      Macroeconomic stability and institutions for the effective use of resources
      Economic diversification and growth
      Human capital development and the environment.

This report has seven chapters, including this introductory chapter. Chapters 2 and 3
summarize the country background and Bank Group strategies and examine the trends
and patterns of its operations in Kazakhstan during the evaluation period. Chapters 4–6
assess the relevance and effectiveness of these operations on the three themes described
above. The concluding chapter draws lessons and recommendations for the Bank
Group’s future engagement in Kazakhstan.

2. Country Background
Kazakhstan is located in central Asia and is bordered by the Russian Federation to the
north, China to the east, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan to the south, and the Caspian Sea
and Turkmenistan to the west. The country’s territory is 2,727,300 km2 (1,053,000 square
miles, about the size of Western Europe) with 17 million people (2013 estimate). It is the
ninth largest country in the world and the largest landlocked country (by land area).
The disadvantages of being landlocked are offset by an abundance of natural resources,
including petroleum, natural gas, and minerals.

Kazakhstan was historically inhabited by nomadic tribes. By the 16th century, the
Kazakhs emerged as a distinct group, but by the mid-19th century, all of Kazakhstan
was part of the Russian Empire. The territory of Kazakhstan was reorganized several
times before becoming the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic in 1936, a part of the Soviet
Union. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan declared its
independence in 1991.


    Box 2.1. Milestones in Kazakhstan’s Political and Economic Setting, 1991–2014

       1992: Kazakhstan becomes a member of the United Nations and joins IBRD.
       1993: Kazakhstan joins IFC and MIGA; IBRD’s first loan (technical assistance) approved.
       1995: Adoption of First Constitution; first elections to the Parliament and local
        government bodies (Maslikhats) are held.
       1997: The national strategy Kazakhstan 2030 is adopted; the national capital moved from
        Almaty to Astana, placing it at the geographical center of the country, rather than in its
        largest city.
       2000: Kazakhstan becomes the first former Soviet republic to repay all of its debt to the
        International Monetary Fund (IMF), seven years ahead of schedule.
       2005: Nursultan Nazarbayev re-elected president.
       2007: Constitutional changes remove term limits for the president. Karim Masimov
        appointed Prime Minister.

of Ministers and serves as Kazakhstan's head of government. In 2007, changes to the
Constitution removed the limits on the number of terms to be served by the first
President.


Economic Development (2004–13)
Kazakhstan’s economy has expanded almost tenfold since 2002, from a gross domestic
product (GDP) of $24.6 billion in 2002 to $231.9 in 2013. Growth catapulted Kazakhstan
to upper-middle-income country status with a gross national income (GNI) per capita of
$11,5501 in 2013, very close to the current high-income country classification threshold
of $12,745. With an average economic growth of 7–8 percent over the past decade
supported by rising oil output and prices, Kazakhstan has solidified its position as a
regional economic power. Economic growth reached an all-time high of 10.7 percent in
2006. The economy emerged from the global financial crisis in the beginning of 2010
with a GDP growth rate of 7.3 percent (see figures 2.1 and 2.2, and table 2.1).

Kazakhstan was able to weather the global financial and economic crises relatively well,
thanks to large foreign exchange reserves, active interventions of the National Bank of
Kazakhstan (NBK), and relatively modest exposure to international financial markets.
However, the construction and real estate bubble that preceded the crisis left the
Kazakh banking sector heavily burdened by nonperforming loans (NPLs). According to
the most conservative estimates, NPLs amount to 30–35 percent of loans, thus making
Kazakhstan the global “leader” in this respect. The issue continues to linger, despite the
government’s clear understanding that it is serious hindrance to its private sector
development agenda.

Natural resources have been the cornerstone of the country’s push to prosperity.
Kazakhstan has many petroleum and mineral resources. It is also one of the world’s top
20 oil producers, with estimated reserves of 40 billion barrels, or about a 2 percent share
of global oil production. The hydrocarbon industry is estimated to account for roughly
50 percent of the government's revenues2. Current oil production, approximately 1.8
million barrels per day, is dominated by two giant fields: Tengiz and Karachaganak,
which produce about half of Kazakhstan's total output. The offshore Kashagan field—
estimated to contain 9 billion barrels of oil—began production in 2013. It discontinued
pumping oil shortly after but is expected to resume commercial production in 2017.
Proven natural gas reserves are estimated at 54 trillion cubic feet (British Petroleum
2014).

Kazakhstan is the world's largest uranium producer and has extensive mineral
resources (including chromium, coal, copper, gold, iron, lead, manganese, and zinc).
The development of petroleum, natural gas, and mineral extraction has attracted most
of the over $40 billion in foreign investment in Kazakhstan since 1993. It accounts for
some 57 percent of the nation's industrial output (or approximately 13 percent of its
GDP).3


Human Development and Poverty (2004–12)
Kazakhstan has made steady progress over the last decade on poverty and social
development, although some indicators still lag behind countries at similar income
levels. High income inequality, large numbers of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups,
and poor economic and social conditions in underdeveloped regions, small towns, and
rural areas remain major challenges (see table 2.2).

Although Kazakhstan’s oil-fueled economic growth during the evaluation period had
an overall positive impact on poverty indicators (poverty officially declined from 33.9
percent in 2004 to 2.9 percent in 2013), the gap between urban and rural living
standards persists (see figure 2.3). The poverty headcount ratio4 in the countryside
remains higher, at 4.9 percent compared to 1.3 percent in urban areas (although the
poverty line currently set at $2.25 per day is considered low for an upper-middle
income country).

The outcomes in the education and health sectors during the evaluation period have
been positive overall. In 2009, Kazakhstan ranked first on the United Nations
Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization Education for All Development Index
by achieving near-universal levels of primary education, adult literacy, and gender
parity; the Program for Student Assessment (PISA) test results showed improvements
from 2009 to 2012 in reading, math, and science (though significantly lower than scores
obtained by Russia and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development

[OECD] countries). Public expenditure on education over the period 2004–09 increased
from 2.3 percent to 3.1 percent (see figure 2.4).

At the same time, the country continues to face a number of health-related challenges,
with the health outcomes lagging behind its rapidly increasing income. Mortality and
life expectancy rates are similar to those of other upper-middle-income countries
(average), but the incidence of tuberculosis is still high. Other health-related problems
the country faces are cardiovascular disease and tobacco- and alcohol-related diseases.
Kazakhstan is also still spending less on health and education (as a share of the overall
budget) than neighboring Russia and the Kyrgyz Republic, as well as when compared
to other upper-middle- income countries (see figure 2.5).

Governance
Kazakhstan faces a number of governance challenges, including the centralization of
authority, a lack of accountability and transparency, and corruption. Although the
Heritage Foundation’s 2014 Index of Economic Freedom calls Kazakhstan “moderately
free” and places it ahead of most of its neighbors and a number of European countries
(for example, France, Italy, and Portugal), Transparency International’s 2013 Corruption
Perceptions Index ranks Kazakhstan 140th in the world, alongside Honduras, Lao PDR,
and Uganda (see table 2.3).

Gender
Kazakhstan ranks 31st in the world with regard to gender equality (WEF 2012). The
country has experienced a drastic change in gender dynamics over time. The Soviet era
broke many traditional barriers to women’s participation in economic and social life,
when programs on childcare, education, and medical care were established. After the
fall of the Soviet Union, the government supported several legislative efforts addressing
gender equality in Kazakhstan’s constitution, government policy, and its legal structure.

Despite challenges in legal implementation, Kazakhstan has performed well overall
regarding gender issues, as reflected in some gender-related Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) and measures such as the OECD’s Social Institutions and Gender Index
(SIGI).5 The SIGI ranks Kazakhstan as 14 out of 86 for the year 2012. Kazakhstan’s
performance on gender-related MDGs has been steadily improving since independence.
However, it was mixed compared to other upper-middle-income countries (UMICs),
performing better on some goals (for example, health and employment) and worse on
others (for example, political participation) (see appendix A).


Environment
Kazakhstan inherited significant environmental issues from the Soviet era related to
military nuclear testing programs, industrial and mining activities, and land
degradation, desertification, and water scarcity. The Aral Sea had long been degraded
by unsustainable agricultural practices in the Syr Darya and Amu Darya river
watersheds: between 1960 and 2007, the water surface was reduced by 90 percent as a
result of increasing water withdrawals for irrigation and other needs. Desertification
and the shrinking of the Aral Sea have increased the health risks for the population.

Another area of environmental distress includes the former Soviet nuclear testing site of
Semipalatinsk and other former military and industrial complexes in the northeast of
the country. These are all characterized by a high level of complex air, water, and soil
contamination.

With respect to climate change, Kazakhstan ranks among the top 10 most energy-
intensive economies in the world. Mirroring the high energy intensity, the country is
the fourth most greenhouse gas-intensive economy in the world.

COUNTRY BACKGROUND

Key Government Policies and Strategies
The government of Kazakhstan has been consistently strategic in its vision for the
country’s development and prolific in producing strategic documents, visions, and
plans. The Kazakhstan 20306 strategy for development (presented in 1997) outlined a
long-term approach for development. It included, among other things, the following
priority areas: economic growth based on an open market economy with a high level of
foreign investments and internal savings; better health, education and well-being for
Kazakhstani citizens; development of power resources; improvement of infrastructure
(particularly, transport and communication); and a professional state.

 In 2003, Kazakhstan adopted its National Strategy for Industrial Innovation Development
for 2003–2015 (World Bank 2008), in keeping with the implementation of the long-term
strategy envisioned in Kazakhstan 2030. It aimed to establish the legislative and
institutional foundations for economic diversification. The government also created
new public institutions to play a leading role in the implementation of Kazakhstan 2030:
the Development Bank of Kazakhstan, the Investment Fund of Kazakhstan, and the
National Innovation Fund.

In 2009–10, the government modified implementation of the Strategy of Industrial
Innovation Development for 2003–15 by launching its Accelerated Industrial–Innovative
Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan, 2010–2014.7 This five-year plan highlighted
seven sectors: (i) agriculture; (ii) construction and construction materials; (iii) oil and
gas products and infrastructure; (iv) metallurgy and metal products; (v) chemicals and
pharmaceuticals; (vi) energy; and (vii) transport and telecommunications infrastructure.

Following the financial crisis of 2008, the government shifted the emphasis in its
development strategy in 2010–11 toward growth from non-oil sources through
diversification, innovation, investment in human capital, and international trade
integration for job creation. Increased emphasis was placed on strengthening
governance, the business enabling environment, and private enterprise, as well as on
improving the quality of public services and taking measures to address workforce skill
shortages. The government’s Strategic Plan for Development 20208 outlined a set of
priorities for achieving a competitive, diversified economy with macroeconomic
stability. These key policy initiatives, reinforced by the president after the January 2012
parliamentary elections, focused on five themes:

        Consolidating progress toward economic recovery from the global crisis through
         business environment reforms, and improving legal and financial systems
        Diversifying the economy through industrialization, with an emphasis on
         enterprise modernization, and agro-industrial complex and infrastructure

         Sustaining growth through the building of the human resource base by
          increasing the quality of human resources
         Ensuring that people have access to basic social, housing and utility services,
          with an emphasis on creating employment opportunities for youth, as well as on
          modernization of municipal housing and the water supply network
         Advancing public sector reforms to increase efficiency, transparency and
          accountability by streamlining government agencies, establishing the basis for a
          performance-based public management system, accelerating civil service
          reforms, and increasing the quality of government services.

In December 2012 during his annual state of the nation address, the president
announced the Kazakhstan Strategy 2050, a new policy that calls for widespread
economic, social, and political reforms to position Kazakhstan as one of the world’s top
30 developed states by 2050. The three key aims of the policy are to define new markets
where Kazakhstan can form productive partnerships and create new sources of
economic growth; create a favorable investment climate; and develop an effective
private sector and public-private partnerships (PPPs).9

3. World Bank Group Strategies and Program,
2004–13
World Bank Group assistance during the review period was guided by the 2004 and
2012 CPSs (covering 2012–17). These strategy documents outlined the direction of the
Bank Group’s program of lending, grants, analytic and advisory activities (AAA) and
guarantee operations. The World Bank has provided 41 loans to Kazakhstan for a total
of more than $6.8 billion. This evaluation covers the 2004 CPS fully and reflects mainly
on the relevance aspect of the 2012 strategy, covering effectiveness to the extent possible
(from FY12 to FY14).

World Bank Group cooperation with Kazakhstan followed a somewhat unique
trajectory. The Bank Group was an important donor and partner in the 1990s, supplying
Kazakhstan with both financial (loans) and intellectual (analytical work) assistance.
After a relatively fast recovery from the Russian financial crisis in the late 1990s/early
2000s, and spearheaded by growing hydrocarbon prices, Kazakhstan was able to pay
off its loans to the Bank and International Monetary Fund. The top leadership of the
country made a political decision not to borrow from the international financial
institutions (IFIs).Cooperation was then limited to the format of an ongoing dialogue,
being officially open to continue receiving analytical products, but shutting the door for
further lending. Despite a number of ongoing “legacy” projects, the absence of new
lending was making the Bank’s presence in the country and continuing dialogue
increasingly unsustainable.

The situation changed drastically around 2003–04, when the decision not to borrow
from the Bank was reversed, following rounds of consultations with the Bank and the
growing demand for high-level policy advice in various areas of economic
development. As a result, at least two interesting mechanisms for policy dialogue
between the Bank and Kazakh authorities have emerged: (i) regular rounds of high-
level (Prime Minister and Cabinet members) “brainstorming sessions” (see box 3.1) that
included top levels of the political leadership and technical staff from relevant
ministries, that were prepared and led by the Bank; and (ii) the Joint Economic Research
Program (JERP), a demand-driven program of analytical studies and policy notes on
specific sector topics.

The JERP has been very popular both within the government and with the Bank. The
share of JERP financing has been steadily moving so the government finances more. It
started as a 50–50 endeavor, and the current ratio is 80 percent government and 20
percent World Bank; it is expected to be 100 percent government in the near future. This

                                            WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGIES AND PROGRAM, 2004–13
restart of an intensive high-level policy dialogue was followed by the resumption of
borrowing from IBRD (according to the ex-ante implicit understanding to that account),
including two large transport sector loans (for the East-West and South-West Road
Projects, 2009 and 2012 respectively, totaling $3.2 billion). These made Kazakhstan one
of the largest clients of the Bank (in terms of volume) in the Europe and Central Asia
Region.


 Box 3.1. Brainstorming Sessions
 In Kazakhstan, the Bank is in a unique position to deliver AAA through a series of
 brainstorming sessions requested and cochaired by the Prime Minister. These sessions have
 provided the government with a forum for debating important policy issues, thinking
 through problems, and developing strategies, with analytical support from the Bank.
 The first such brainstorming session was held in February 2004 in Geneva during the World
 Trade Organization (WTO) meetings to discuss the new World Bank Group CPS with
 Kazakhstan. Since then, approximately 16 brainstorming sessions have been held to discuss
 key development issues—both topical and long term—such as the financial crisis,
 competitiveness, foreign investment, economic diversification, public administration reforms,
 food prices and agricultural policy, and human development.
 These sessions appear to have been optimized by strong ownership on the part of the Kazakh
 Prime Minister, who has a keen interest in these topics, and ensures that the right officials
 and high-level experts are present. The impact of these brainstorming sessions is evident in
 several areas: resuming preschool education services, providing input for the elaboration of
 the anticrisis package, establishing per capita financing in the health system, and pension
 reform. However, IEG’s 2013 knowledge-based country programs (KBCP) evaluation
 reported that because most of the brainstorming sessions were confidential (the Independent
 Evaluation Group team had a difficult time finding public minutes or notes of the results of a
 number of sessions), the lessons learned were not being disseminated to a wider audience of
 critical stakeholders.

In May 2014, at the initiative of the government, Bank Group senior leadership signed a
broad Partnership Framework Agreement (PFA) with the government in Astana—an
agreement that potentially opens a completely new page in the Bank-Kazakh
government partnership history. The overall program is expected to be co-funded by
the government (1 trillion KZ Tenge = $5 billion from the National Oil Fund) and a
group of donors, including the Bank Group. It includes seven thematic areas: (i)
financial sector development; (ii) an increasing the role for the private sector, including
small and medium-size enterprise (SME) development and improvement of the
business climate; (iii) innovation; (iv) addressing skill gaps; (v) attracting investments
and strengthening PPPs; (vi) sustainable and greener regional development; and (vii)
institutional reform. The Bank and other major donors—including the European Bank

for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and
the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB)—will provide assistance through the provision of
analytical services, project lending, and implementation support. It is expected that the
amount of Bank financing will match that of the government. Specific action-oriented,
nationwide development programs for each of these areas are being developed by the
government in partnership with the Bank.


Country Partnership Strategies
2004–12
The 2004–12 CPS implementation took much longer than a standard CPS (three to four
years). According to Bank management, the 2004 Kazakhstan CPS was “open-ended”
by design, developed in response to the need for flexibility in swiftly addressing
evolving client demands. It was expected to remain in force as long as it remained
relevant to the client, provided added value to the country’s development process, and
addressed the challenges of the policy environment. It would also include regular
progress reports assessing CPS relevance against these criteria.

The 2004 CPS adopted the four pillars of the government strategy at the time: (i)
managing the oil windfall and improving public institutions and policies; (ii)
developing an appropriate role for the government to foster competitiveness and
facilitate business; (iii) investing in human capital and infrastructure; and (iv)
safeguarding the environment. The partnership, anchored on knowledge products
(JERP, see box 3.2), contained a large program of co-financed advisory work, with
selective lending aimed at introducing new ideas and building capacity. A CPS
Progress Report (World Bank 2008) recommended maintaining this approach.


 Box 3.2. Joint Economic Research Program
 The JERP, initiated in 2004, is the main instrument of the World Bank’s CPS in Kazakhstan.
 The JERP works on the basis of a cost-sharing arrangement between the Bank and the
 government and serves to frame the Bank Group’s contributions to the country through
 AAA. Under this framework, the annual AAA program is defined and based primarily on
 Kazakhstan’s demand for services; the Bank team provides its own suggestions on the
 program composition. Since the 2012 CPS, there has been a shift toward a more
 programmatic JERP, allowing for a multi-year focus on specific priority tasks.
 The JERP analytical work and policy dialogue focuses on the areas of: public resource
 management, public administration, education, health, agriculture, PSD, and pension and
 social protection.

                                            WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGIES AND PROGRAM, 2004–13

 The JERP has been growing over time, from $1.3 million in 2004 (of which 40 percent was
 government financed) to $4.3 million in 2012 (of which 85 percent was government financed).
 IEG’s 2011 Performance Assessment Report for Kazakhstan (in the context of the Evaluation
 of World Bank Support for Revenue Policy Reform in Eastern Europe and Central Asia)
 highlighted that the JERP seems to be a model that other upper-middle-income countries
 might consider adopting.
 IEG’s KBCP evaluation (IEG 2013) found that the JERP is anchored in policy analysis, good
 practice options notes, and brainstorming sessions with high-level officials on a variety of
 topics where the government needs to form a view. The evaluation also concluded that JERP-
 induced brainstorming sessions have become a critical platform to share opinions and help
 the authorities systematically think through issues with substantial analytical support from
 the Bank. At the same time, the fully demand-driven nature of the Bank’s program in
 Kazakhstan imposed some limitations on the Bank in defining priorities in its advisory work
 program.

2012–17
In line with key government priorities, the 2012–17 CPS focuses on three elements:
competitiveness and jobs; strengthened governance in public administration and
service delivery; and safeguarding the environment and gender (see table 3.1). The CPS
presents a results framework, including major milestones and outputs, expected
outcomes for each priority area in the government’s strategy supported by the Bank
program and a list of proposed activities in support of each of these outcomes.
Although it retains the tradition of a flexible architecture, the current CPS envisions a
programmatic approach (in contrast to the previous CPS) aimed at strengthening the
strategic focus of the JERP. This would be done through improving task sequencing,
emphasizing interconnected tasks to better address policy linkages, and better tracking
impact. Greater attention is devoted to results, including a stronger focus on monitoring
and evaluation, than in the previous CPS.

The new Partnership Agreement (2014–17) is anchored in the framework of the current
CPS and strengthens cooperation aimed at supporting sustainable development in
Kazakhstan. The government has allocated 1 trillion KZ Tenge (approximately $5
billion) to this partnership for investment lending and other nonlending activities.

IEG EVALUATIONS
The last Country Program Evaluation (CPE) in Kazakhstan (IEG 2001) assessed Bank
assistance to Kazakhstan from 1991 to 2000. IEG found IBRD’s adjustment lending
instrumental in stabilizing the economy, strengthening the financial sector, liberalizing
prices and trade, establishing a legal framework, and privatizing enterprises. The goal
of the IBRD strategy to develop competitive markets was slowed by non-transparent

                                                                                CHAPTER 3

privatization procedures, and the lack of enforcement of laws and regulations.
Moreover, insufficient resources were devoted to economic and sector work (ESW). IEG
proposed that the overall relevance of the strategy would have been far greater if it had
addressed—explicitly and forcefully and earlier in the transition – agricultural
development, issues of transparency, and judicial reform with its development assistance
partners and the civil society. IBRD lacked a comprehensive, long-term approach to
capacity building and was overly optimistic about growth recovery and poverty
reduction. As a result, its early operations neglected environmental sustainability and
targeted assistance to the poor.

IFC was found to be well known and valued as an “honest broker” in the country,
providing (i) high-quality and timely project support to relevant operations in a
particularly difficult enabling environment; (ii) assistance in the financial sector of
critical value after the 1996 banking crisis and the Russian and Asian crises; and (iii)
well-targeted engineering and environmental advice to private companies and their
financing partners. MIGA's involvement in Kazakhstan was found to be modest, and its
potential had not yet been fully realized. The evaluation called for World Bank Group
support to improving the enabling environment for the development of the private
sector, in particular with regard to clarity in the legal and regulatory framework,
judicial reform, transparency in privatization, and a reduction in the arbitrary
enforcement of tax laws.

IEG recommended that the Bank apply a "donor"-coordinated approach in dealing with
the corruption-related constraints. In addition, it recommended that the new CAS spell
out how it would use the full menu of instruments available to the World Bank Group
to promote PSD. The evaluation rated the outcome of the IBRD program as Partially
Satisfactory; its contribution to institutional development was rated as Modest and its
sustainability Uncertain.

In 2011, IEG conducted a review of the 2004 CPS Completion Report (CPSCR Review)
for Kazakhstan. IEG rated the overall outcome of the Bank Group’s strategy as
Moderately Unsatisfactory (see table 3.2). IEG stressed five findings:

      Full country ownership of an advisory agenda does not guarantee its
       effectiveness
      A flexible approach of the JERP calls for effective and regular monitoring of the
       value added and the progress made in the policy framework
      A flexible approach needs to be coupled with a results frameworks that allows
       for valuable and operative monitoring and evaluation of the strategy and its
       implementation

         objectives if revised at the Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report stage
         Careful, constant monitoring of the macroeconomic conditions, including the
         financial sector, and a persuasive policy dialogue with the government about
         them would allow the Bank Group to be a more effective and opportune
         development partner.

Kazakhstan was one of the case studies under the IEG knowledge-based country
programs evaluation (IEG 2013) (see box 3.2). IEG found that the Bank concentrated on
areas covering a coherent critical mass of reforms (for example, public finances and the
public sector). Knowledge activities in the private sector focused on diversification,
deregulation, and competitiveness, which reflect the Bank’s strategy for Kazakhstan’s
private sector. The flexibility of this program allowed it to adapt to changing
government priorities/country context and has contributed to its growth since 2004.

The Bank program in the public sector had mixed results. There were areas where the
program could have benefitted from a stronger strategic focus, notably on governance.
More positive and diverse results were achieved in the financial sector; the quality of
the work delivered by the Bank on financial systems enhancement was good and was
adopted by related agencies.

Program Performance
IBRD LENDING AND ANALYTIC AND ADVISORY ACTIVITY
Over the FY04–13 period, the Bank approved 25 new projects in the amount of $4.9
billion. Although the flow of project approvals was relatively steady (at two to four
projects approved per year), the main variability was related to the size of the
investments. In FY09, the size of the portfolio was almost 15 times larger than the FY08
portfolio (figure 3.1)—thanks to the South-West Road Project alone. The portfolio is
dominated (about 86 percent) by only three loans: two transport investments (the
South-West and East-West Roads) and a Development Policy Loan (DPL). Five percent
of the portfolio is covered by two projects in the health and irrigation sectors (over $100
million each). The rest of the portfolio includes several projects in different sectors,
focusing on institution building in the areas of education, innovation, environment, and
the revenue administration agenda (with an average size of investment of $25 million)
(see figure 3.2).

IEG’s evaluations of completed Bank Group operations in Kazakhstan are generally
favorable. Twelve Bank projects exited the portfolio between FY04 and FY12, out of
which only one received a negative rating1 (of Moderately Unsatisfactory). The riskiness
of the Bank’s portfolio under implementation did not show significant variation
between 2004 and 2013.

Overall, the World Bank’s Kazakhstan portfolio appears to be highly efficient, with few
exceptions. There are several projects where the economic rate of return (ERR) estimate
or calculation was either absent at the appraisal stage or at the closing; only one project
did not provide an ERR—at either the appraisal or the closing stage. Otherwise actual
ERRs exceed the appraised rate or the rate of economic viability.

AAA products constituted an important part of the World Bank Group program in
Kazakhstan, anchored in the JERP. During the review period, 46 ESW and 164
nonlending technical assistance projects were initiated. Support to the development of
the financial and private sectors, governance, economic policies and social protection
account for more than half of the ESW and technical assistance (55–58 percent by project
count). A significant share of the Bank’s analytical work was reviewed by the
knowledge-based country programs evaluation, with generally positive conclusions
related to the overall relevance of the work and the high degree of government
ownership, albeit with certain reservations about the actual impact.

THE IFC AND MIGA PORTFOLIO

During the CPS 2005–11 period, Kazakhstan represented IFC’s sixth largest exposure in
the Europe and Central Asia Region, with an outstanding portfolio of $382 million as of
the end of 2011. This constitutes a threefold increase in the size of portfolio during the
CPS period. Total investments in Kazakhstan during the period amounted to more than
$1 billion in 27 projects, of which $950 million was for IFC’s own account, and $110
million was raised through syndication.

                                         WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGIES AND PROGRAM, 2004–13
Prior to the crisis, IFC focused on SME development, investments in sectors of
comparative advantage for Kazakhstan (such as agribusiness, oil-gas, general
manufacturing, infrastructure, and services) and developing leasing and mortgage
finance. During the 2008–09 global financial crisis, IFC rapidly expanded its
engagement, mainly to support stabilization in the financial sector and increased access
to finance in the priority sectors in the economy. Over the four-year period (FY10–13),
IFC focused its investment operations on supporting the banking sector ($617 million of
net commitment) through equity, quasi-equity, senior debt, and trade finance
guarantees to several private sector banks in Kazakhstan. At the end of the 2005–11 CPS
period, IFC’s loan investment portfolio in Kazakhstan was performing well (with no
loan arrears at the end of FY11). In addition, IFC has been providing advisory assistance
in the areas of corporate governance and business transparency to address the key
constraints to the expansion of private sector investments in Kazakhstan.

In the 2012–17 CPS, IFC plans to promote the development of the private sector through
investment and advisory services in support of economic diversification. The focus is on
the non-extractive industries (for example, access to infrastructure, strengthening the
financial sector, and supporting diversification and competitiveness). In the short term,
IFC plans to focus on strengthening the financial sector, with medium-term efforts
targeting infrastructure. Other objectives include promoting SME development in
agribusiness, manufacturing, and services. IFC is also supporting the energy efficiency
agenda as a cross-cutting theme in its activities.

MIGA supported financial and manufacturing sectors; its portfolio in Kazakhstan
consists of five projects. The combined gross exposure from these investments (as of the
end of October 2014) is $512.7 million.

PARTNERSHIPS

The World Bank Group works in close collaboration with other multilateral institutions
and development partners. In the absence of a joint assistance strategy, there is a loose
division of labor among development partners.

According to the latest 2012–17 CPS, in the area of improving competitiveness and
fostering job creation, partners provide support on expanding the role of the private
sector and trade integration (European Community [EC], United States Agency for
International Development [USAID]), financial sector reforms (IMF), building skills
(EC, German Agency for International Cooperation [GIZ]), agriculture (GIZ), SME
development (ADB), electricity markets and investments (EBRD, USAID), and roads
(ADB, EBRD). Regarding the broad governance agenda, partners provide advice on
local public administration reform, public sector implementation capacity (EC), civil

service reform (EC, United Nations Development Programme [UNDP]), customs
reforms (USAID), judicial sector reforms (EC, GIZ, USAID), social protection (EC,
UNICEF), and health (EC, USAID). In the area of environment, partner focus is on
sustainability (EC, GIZ, and UNDP) and energy efficiency (EBRD).

The share of the official development assistance decreased significantly since 2000,
although it was never above 8 percent of central government expenses or gross capital
formation. Its share in imports and as a percent of gross national income (GNI) was
even less—about 1 percent in 2000, and one-fifth of a percentage point by 2012 (see
figure 3.3).

4. Pillars 1–2: Macroeconomic Management and
Governance
This chapter combines an assessment of two standard pillars identified as common to
the resource-rich countries included in this cluster of CPEs: (i) the management of
resources, covering activities related to addressing risks to macroeconomic and fiscal
sustainability; and (ii) improving governance and institutions for the effective use of resources.

In Kazakhstan, the policy developments under these two pillars and respective Bank
Group support were highly interrelated, which justifies a combined review of the pillars
in this chapter. Moreover, in Kazakhstan, the Bank’s role in the first pillar was less
prominent during the review period, as the respective agenda was significantly
advanced in the earlier period. The country had already set up effectively functioning
institutional mechanisms, helped by generally prudent and conservative
macroeconomic policies, including an established oil fund, the National Fund of the
Republic of Kazakhstan (NFRK), and so on. The Bank helped the government further
fine-tune these institutional arrangements through its analytical work and policy
advice, mainly within the framework of the JERP. These will be reviewed in conjunction
with the second pillar assessment.

Therefore, the bulk of the analysis in this chapter covers issues pertaining to Bank
engagement in the second pillar (improving governance and institutions for effective use of
resources), and in particular PFM from the standpoint of the efficient and effective use of
the resources generated both from mineral taxation and other sources. Specific
questions covered in this section include (i) the efficiency of the country’s PFM
institutions and arrangements and (ii) strengthening accountability of the public sector
in the midst of an increased flow of income from natural resources.


Context
By the time of the Board approval of the 2004 CPS, Kazakhstan had an established
record of being among the leading reformers in the Commonwealth of Independent
States. The economy had recovered strongly after the Russian financial crisis of 1998–99.
It was driven by higher oil prices and supported by conservative macroeconomic
policies. The overall budget deficit has been under control since 2000, with the non-oil
budget balance being less than 5 percent of non-oil GDP. In 2000, the authorities
established the NFRK, which accumulated about $4 billion in oil revenue savings in the

first three years of its operations. The fund has been a promising first step towards a
countercyclical fiscal policy. As such, it sent a strong positive signal to the markets.

Nevertheless, Kazakhstan’s economy remained vulnerable to external shocks, primarily
because of its dependence on oil exports and exposure to the global financial markets.
The volatility of government revenue was high and unpredictable, which undermined
budget credibility. The total country’s external debt (including private debts) remained
in excess of 50 percent of GDP in 2003.

Institutional reforms continued, but their progress generally lagged behind
macroeconomic stabilization and core policy reforms. In the budgetary sphere, various
PFM reforms were initiated, facilitated by the 1999 Budget System Law. However, the
pace of reforms was uneven. Some progress was made with respect to budget
formulation and consolidation, as well as with budget reporting. The Treasury was
significantly strengthened, including through the earlier Bank-financed Treasury
Modernization Project (closed in 2002). Starting with the 2000 budget, the government
has based its fiscal plans within the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. However,
the linkage between planning (government programs) and budgeting (resource
allocation) remained insufficiently effective.1 Similarly, budget consolidation was
incomplete, as evidenced by the broad use of the off-budget mechanisms used for
financing the construction of the new capital city of Astana.

Despite general progress and commitment to reforms, several core PFM components
continued to underperform. These included mechanisms for commitment control
(which prevented full elimination of budget arrears), monitoring and evaluation, and
arrangements for independent budget audit and oversight. A basic framework
governing public procurement in Kazakhstan was established and included the law on
state procurement and the State Procurement Agency. However, effective
implementation of the national procurement regime required further strengthening2,
including through the increased transparency of public procurement.

On the revenue side, both tax policy and administration were affected by the
proliferation of special taxation regimes, which brought about large volumes of tax
discounts and exemptions to specific industries. Meanwhile, the government has
introduced steps to reduce the tax burden for nonextractive industries, especially with
respect to labor taxes.3 Progress toward expenditure rationalization remained insufficient,
although the government has admitted that its key spending policies (including in
infrastructure and social sectors) need to be improved.4

With respect to intergovernmental fiscal arrangements, the country’s system for allocating
resources across regional governments was largely based on historical expenditure

                                       PILLARS 1–2: MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
patterns. This has given rise to substantial disparities in per capita public spending
among the oblasts (regions), which were directly related to regional disparities in social
outcomes.

Perceptions of corruption remained high in Kazakhstan. According to the Corruption
Perception Index (CPI) by Transparency International, Kazakhstan did not make any
progress in the anticorruption area between 1999 and 2004, with its CPI rankings
consistently staying in the bottom 15 percent of the index.


World Bank Group Program
The 2004 CPS was effectively aligned with the government’s long-term strategy as
outlined in the speech by President Nazarbayev in March 2004. Within Pillar 1 of the
2004 CPS (“Preventing loss of competitiveness through appropriate macro and fiscal
management”), the Bank intended to focus its support in the following areas: (i)
management of the oil windfalls (including transparency of oil revenues); (ii) the
government’s medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF); (iii) local and central
governments’ capacity to absorb public spending; and (iv) the addressing of corruption.
The CPS did not contain a specific Results Framework, but rather an explicit
commitment (CPS Annex 1) for a direct contribution to the management of oil revenues,
prioritization and rationalization of public spending, intergovernmental finance reforms, and
capacity building of core government institutions, including local governments.

The 2012 CPS followed the same approach of emphasizing Bank Group support for the
government’s own policy priorities. The latest government program, as outlined in the
Strategic Plan for Development 2020, aimed at achieving a competitive, diversified
economy with macroeconomic stability. There has been a lot of continuity in the
government development program over the last decade, which is naturally reflected in
the CPS set of ongoing priorities.

The Bank’s program priorities in the governance area were grouped under two separate
country development goals—achieving competitiveness gains through macro-stability and
international integration; and improving public financial management and fighting
corruption)—and three related CPS outcomes: (i) strengthening fiscal discipline and trade
openness; (ii) improving governance; and (iii) strengthening budget and accounting
institutions). The 2012 CPS also identified the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI) as one of the activities it would support.

As opposed to the previous strategy, the 2012 CPS contained a specific results
framework to monitor development progress over the period of 2012–17, albeit with a
limited set of specific governance indicators related to the use of oil revenue, customs


                                                                                           25
CHAPTER 4
PILLARS 1–2: MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
and procurement reforms, and actions in the area of expenditure rationalization. At the
same time, the 2012 CPS contained a broader list of governance policy priorities (World
Bank 2012) to be advanced over a medium term. These can be grouped along the
following four core policy reform directions:

        Improvements in revenue management, including strengthening the rules
         governing the utilization of oil earnings
        Progress toward a more accountable and transparent government supported by
         the development of a comprehensive anticorruption program, attaining
         compliance with EITI norms, strengthening external audit and parliamentary
         oversight, and advancing the transition to international accounting standards
        More effective budget management systems, including through
         implementation progress with results-based budget management, the upgrading
         of public debt management, and oversight of state-owned enterprise (SOE)
         borrowing
        Improvements in intergovernmental financial management (with an initial
         focus on the system of targeted development transfers).

Given the lack of an explicit Results Framework in the 2004 CPS, as well as a significant
degree of continuity between the 2004 and 2012 CPS documents, IEG uses the above list
of policy priorities as a (substitute) monitoring framework to measure progress
achieved under the Bank program since 2004 in the governance area.

The World Bank Group supported PFM reforms in Kazakhstan through several lending
operations and a large number of nonlending activities (mostly funded by JERP). Many
of the nonlending activities, undertaken before 2013, were reviewed and evaluated
under the earlier IEG assessment (IEG 2013). The following section highlights the main
outcomes in the PFM area and Bank Group’s contribution to their achievement. It also
summarizes relevant evaluation findings on the governance-related activities that were
identified under IEG’s earlier evaluation.

SECTOR OUTCOMES AND BANK GROUP CONTRIBUTION
Overall reform progress within Pillars 1 and 2 has been rather uneven: in several
instances, there is still a considerable gap relative to the targets. Generally, progress on
the legislative and regulatory side has been stronger than actual policy adjustments.
The area of revenue management, including tax and customs administration,
experienced the most significant advancement. However, there was no systematic
follow-up on such core Bank policy diagnostic tools as the Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability (PEFA)5 and sectoral Public Expenditure and Institutional
Reviews (PEIRs). In this context, the government was reluctant to undertake a standard
budget wide Public Expenditure Review.6 The government made a fresh commitment

                                     PILLARS 1–2: MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
to advance broad PFM reforms under its Concept on a new budget policy for
Kazakhstan (2013), approved following the President’s Address to the Nation in
December 2012. The Concept covers the period 2014–20 and envisions PFM reforms
across many functions and objectives, many of which reflect the Bank’s earlier
recommendations. However, the formulation of several objectives under the Concept
serves as an indirect recognition of very limited progress made during the review
period in areas such as result-based budgeting, intergovernmental fiscal transfers, and
budget consolidation.

IMPROVEMENTS IN REVENUE MANAGEMENT
The government’s reform effort resulted in the most tangible progress in the area of
strengthening the rules governing the utilization of oil earnings. Establishing the set of
conservative fiscal rules to govern the annual oil revenue transfer from the NFRK to the
budget was a major achievement. The government now has an established track record
of maintaining a counter-cyclical policy. It ran budget surpluses in all years over the
period of 2002–08, averaging 2.5 percent of GDP. During the 2008–09 crises, the
government used oil savings to finance a stimulus program with the total value
estimated at $17 billion. This helped to smooth the overall effect of the global crisis on
the Kazakh economy and supported rapid recovery in 2010–11. The budget support
was duly downsized as soon as the worst of the economic crisis was over.

The Bank’s contribution to results in governance and PFM reforms was quite
significant. The largest project intervention to support governance and PFM reforms in
Kazakhstan was a DPL ($1 billion; 2010–11) that focused on improving PRM and
addressing financial sector vulnerabilities. Reforms supported by the DPL aimed at
increasing market confidence in Kazakhstan following the global financial crisis. It did
so by signaling that the government was willing and indeed capable of maintaining
macroeconomic stability against domestic and external pressures.

The emphasis of the DPL program was on strengthening the National Fund’s
governance to transform it into a reliable national savings mechanism and an
instrument of countercyclical fiscal policy. The DPL program also supported significant
fiscal adjustment and expenditure rationalization, including cuts in transfers to state
enterprises, while at the same time protecting social expenditures.

One particularly important achievement was related to the strengthening of NFRK
management: the government capped annual transfers from the fund to less than $8
billion. As a result, the NFRK balance rose from $24.4 billion in 2009 to about $43.6
billion at the end of 2011. Overall, the existing oil rules are effective and practical,
although there is still room for fine-tuning, including making NFRK more transparent
and better integrated into the overall macroeconomic framework.7


                                                                                           27
CHAPTER 4
PILLARS 1–2: MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
In addition to the DPL, the Bank provided considerable analytical and advisory support
to the government in the area of macroeconomic management with a special emphasis
on strengthening national arrangements for oil revenue management. The report “Oil
Rules. Kazakhstan’s Policy Options in a Downturn” (World Bank 2013) assessed
Kazakhstan’s current oil rules against possible alternatives (as informed by best
international practices), modeling of various crisis scenarios. It concluded that
Kazakhstan’s fiscal rules performed well under different types of external shocks: they
are simple and practical, and a switch to a more sophisticated alternative would not be
desirable at this stage. The primary recommendation of the report was to develop
stabilizers for the country’s monetary and fiscal policies that would make
countercyclical policy changes as automatic as possible.

Significant progress and improvements were made in revenue management. Boosted by
higher oil revenues, the revenue performance became much stronger with an increase
in total government revenues from 24 percent of GDP on average in 2000–04 to 28.2
percent in 2005–08.8 The new Tax Code (2008) adopted flat tax rates for both personal
and corporate income taxes, and introduced a special tax regime that lowered the tax
burden on SMEs.

Reforms in revenue administration were supported by the Bank’s Tax and Customs
Administration Projects9 and a few important studies that became a blueprint for
subsequent government reforms.10 Bank support was aimed at strengthening revenue
administration to improve the level of voluntary compliance, enhancing effectiveness to
fight tax evasion and smuggling, increasing administrative efficiency, and reducing the
potential for corruption. Both projects were ongoing at the time of review. However,
progress indicators were quite clear, such as: (i) a reduction in the stock of tax arrears;
(ii) introduction of the new e-tax system; (iii) improvement in taxpayers’ perception of
revenue management institutions (reflected in enterprise surveys); and (iv) a reduction
in average time and the number of documents required for customs clearance. The
government cofinancing of the Customs Project (70 percent of the total) indicates strong
ownership of the reform process.

The government added most of the tax policy changes recommended by the Bank in
2007–09. These made a critical contribution to the development of a new Tax Code. The
Tax Policy Committee benefited significantly from the interactions with the Bank, and
the tax policy unit at the Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning was strengthened.
The 2014 Doing Business report rated Kazakhstan 18th out of 189 countries in terms of
the ease of paying taxes, which makes it the top-ranked country in the Europe and
Central Asia Region (figure 4.1), showing significant improvement compared to 2007
(66th position). Overall, the current tax policy and administrative environment in
Kazakhstan—with its combination of low tax rates on labor and capital and improved

tax administration—represent a strong positive contribution to improving the country’s
investment climate (see figures 4.1 and 4.2).

MORE ACCOUNTABLE AND TRANSPARENT GOVERNMENT
Kazakhstan’s exceptional endowment of natural resources (petroleum and mineral) was
and continues to be the main source of fiscal revenue and economic growth. As noted,



                                                                                                     29
CHAPTER 4
PILLARS 1–2: MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
prudent macroeconomic management combined with the institutional and fiscal
framework led to an accumulation of significant resources that could be reinvested or
distributed at the government’s discretion. In this context, accountability and
transparency become exceptionally important to avoid waste and curb the possibilities
for corruption. At the 2004 CPS stakeholder consultations, participants specifically
supported the Bank’s efforts to help the government manage extractive revenues in a
more transparent manner, as well as to use excess revenues for social and
environmental purposes in a sustainable manner. They also encouraged the Bank to
make improving public access to information and legal rights a central part of its
activities.

Following the consultations, the 2004 CPS identified management of oil windfalls,
including transparency in oil revenues, as a focus area. However, it did not propose any
specific extractive sector activity in support of this outcome, or any indicator to monitor
the results. The 2012 CPS cited strengthening governance as one of the main
development challenges and an area of engagement. It identified EITI as one of the
activities it would continue to support. However, there was no reference to any specific
outcome indicators in the Results Framework.

The EITI has been the Bank Group’s main instrument for assisting the government in
improving its governance and institutions in the extractives sector over the past decade.
This follows the completion of two EI-related projects in the early 2000s,11 and is in line
with the strategic priorities of the 2004 CPS.12 Kazakhstan participated in the 2003
conference that launched the EITI but did not immediately follow up on it. The 2005
Country Economic Memorandum noted that Kazakhstan could benefit significantly
from the three main requirements of the EITI: (i) the Treasury’s disclosure of oil
revenues received, (ii) the oil companies’ disclosure of payments to the government,
and (iii) the NFRK disclosure of its financial statements. These measures were expected
to result in significant positive reputational effects (both domestically and abroad) and,
more importantly, enhance the accountability framework for oil revenues.

After a slow start, Kazakhstan joined the EITI in 2005; it was mainly motivated by the
expectation that it would make the country more attractive to foreign private investors.
It achieved candidate status in 2007. Its first EITI Validation Report was submitted in
2010, which led to the country being designated as “Close to Compliant.” Having
completed some remedial actions, Kazakhstan submitted a second Validation Report in
2013, which led the EITI Board to declare it EITI Compliant. This achievement was
underpinned by a 2010 amendment to the Law on Subsoil and Subsoil Use that requires
all companies to submit data confirmed by an audit report in compliance with EITI
requirements. The extent to which the number of reporting sectors and companies has
increased is indicated in table 4.1, as is the extent to which the time lag for the

                                         PILLARS 1–2: MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
publication of the EITI reports has been shortened over the years. With Kazakhstan
having achieved compliance, the EITI National Stakeholder Council is now in the
process of identifying new activities and priorities required to meet the revised and
expanded standards established by the global EITI Board in 2013.

An important result of the EITI was the inclusion of civil society organizations (CSOs)
as equal players in the National Stakeholder Council process to discuss and demand
transparency and accountability from the government and the enterprises in the sector,
a process that has begun to broaden citizen participation in governance issues at both
the national and local levels. According to IEG mission interviews, the EITI process is
also reported to have encouraged the Ministry of Finance to enhance the disclosure and
accessibility of budget information. In this context, the Kazakhstan’s Open Budget
Index has improved from 35 (below average) in 2008 to 48 in 2012 (figure 4.3), which is
higher than the average for all 100 countries surveyed (albeit lower than Georgia,
Mongolia, and Russia) (International Budget Partnership 2013). An independent
implementation review conducted in 2013 with funding by UKAid (IIED 2013) found
that even prior to Kazakhstan’s achievement of EITI compliance; the EITI process itself
had already enabled more concrete and practical debates among CSOs, the government
and industry around hot topics in the extractive sectors. IEG confirmed these findings
during interviews with various stakeholders.

The Bank Group provided essential support to the implementation of the EITI in
Kazakhstan. The initiative originated in 2003 and was mainly driven by CSOs; the EITI
had struggled to get under way until the Bank provided technical assistance for the
capacity building and credibility needed to mobilize the unprecedented
multistakeholder (government, industry, CSOs and parliament) process. The active
involvement of the Bank Group was also helpful in familiarizing participants with the
requirements of the EITI—a study tour to Norway was reported to have been especially
helpful—and in resolving tensions between and within major stakeholder groups.

Since 2006, the Bank Group has supported the EITI-Kazakhstan through technical
assistance for implementing the required multi-stakeholder consultation process and
preparing the necessary validation reports. Following Kazakhstan’s achievement of
EITI compliance in 2013, the Bank Group has supported EITI-Kazakhstan’s
communication, outreach and capacity building efforts at the local levels, with a focus
on the main oil-producing regions.

Overall, the Bank Group’s assistance for EITI implementation was highly relevant and
fully aligned with the government’s commitment to improve transparency and
accountability, as broadly expressed through the Kazakhstan 2030 Strategy’s goal of
achieving a “professional government”—and for which combatting corruption and
abuse of power by civil servants is listed as a priority action. The mining-related JERP
studies are also relevant for economic growth based on an open market with a high
level of foreign investment, absolute supremacy of the law, and a minimum of
administrative interference. At the same time, although JERP studies have been
appreciated as inputs in support for key policy reforms, their actual impact on
respective policy changes ( for example, in the area of mine licensing) remains to be
seen.

In addition to the EITI and the Tax and Customs Administration Projects, the Bank
pursued anticorruption objectives through capacity building in core PFM agencies
(funded from various grant facilities).13 The Bank helped improve the capacity of the
Ministry of Finance to implement accounting and reporting reforms in the public sector



32
                                                                                     CHAPTER 4
                                       PILLARS 1–2: MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
through an international audit of the national regulatory framework, a large retraining
program for public sector accountants, and the establishment of a new system for their
certification. As a result, the entire public sector (including regional level public entities)
completed the transition to the International Public Sector Accounting Standards by
January 2013, which is a significant achievement.

Progress toward meeting international standards on external audit and parliamentary
budget oversight was robust. However, it has been slow and remains incomplete. The
Bank program to build capacity at the National Accounts Committee (the Supreme
Audit institution in Kazakhstan) and upgrade the legal framework for external audit in
line with the standards of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions
proceeded slowly, primarily because the concept of a fully independent supreme audit
institution did not have broad support in Kazakhstan. Several project outputs,
including the initial draft of a new Public Audit Law, could not be delivered on time,
affecting the volume and quality of training. The current draft Law14 represents a policy
compromise: it grants additional powers to the Accounts Committee, but does not
expand the body’s financial independence. The draft Law also envisions a relatively
long transition period during which the Committee will continue to share its audit
responsibilities with the Department for Financial Control under the Ministry of
Finance.

Overall, despite the tangible success of the EITI process and the contribution of two
ongoing successful projects (Tax and Customs Administration) to the anticorruption
agenda, the government’s broader efforts to fight corruption were only partially
successful. The latest CPI score by Transparency International (2013) is low (2.6)—worse
than in Zambia (3.8) and just marginally better than in Nigeria (2.5). The improvements
in CPI scores since 2004 (2.2) have been limited. Moreover, some earlier progress has
eroded since the CPI reached its peak of 2.9 in 2009 (see figure 4.4). The broader
indicators for government accountability remain rather weak, for example, the World
Governance Indicator for Voice and Accountability places Kazakhstan in the bottom
quintile worldwide and has not shown any improvement since 2004 (see figures 4.5 and
4.6).

There is no evidence that a comprehensive governmental anti-corruption program has
ever been introduced during the period under review.15 With time, the accounting and
audit reforms described above are likely to bring tangible anti-corruption benefits.
However, these types of specific project-level interventions are usually not a sufficient
substitute for a more comprehensive anticorruption effort that is based on a longer-term

The 2014 World Bank Group Country Survey for Kazakhstan (see box 4.1) identified
public sector governance/reform as a top development priority, and corruption as the
issue of greatest concern. Moreover, it is one of the key obstacles to economic growth. It
is also noteworthy that although anticorruption was rated as the most important area
for World Bank involvement (8.3 on a 10–point scale), the effectiveness ratings for the
Bank’s work in this area were the lowest (4.6).

 Box 4.1. Summary of the 2014 World Bank Group Country Survey for Kazakhstan
 Methodology
 The survey was designed to address general issues facing Kazakhstan; overall attitudes toward
 the World Bank Group; the World Bank Group’s effectiveness and results; the Bank Group’s
 knowledge work and activities; working with the Bank Group; the World Bank Group’s future
 role in Kazakhstan; and the Bank Group’s communication and information sharing in
 Kazakhstan.
 Participants in the survey were drawn from: the offices of the President and Prime Minister; other
 ministers and parliamentarians; ministerial departments and implementation agencies;
 consultants working on World Bank Group-supported projects and programs; project
 management units; local government officials; bilateral and multilateral agencies; private sector
 organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; nongovernmental
 organizations; community-based organizations; the media; trade unions; faith-based groups;
 academia; and other organizations.
 Main Findings
 Overall, the FY14 Kazakhstan Country Survey findings demonstrate that the World Bank Group
 is well regarded in the country, with positive ratings related to many aspects of its work. The

Bank is viewed as relevant, effective, and a reliable development partner in Kazakhstan. The
survey data suggest room for improvement in areas related to disclosure, level of collaboration
with stakeholders, and overall accountability and citizen engagement. More specifically:
Stakeholders’ views of how the Bank operates on the ground are very positive. The Bank receives
high ratings on being “a long-term partner,” collaborating with the government and donors, and
being accessible and open. Areas of concern (some of the survey’s lower ratings) relate to
flexibility, responsiveness, inclusiveness, and collaboration with groups outside of government.
Stakeholders believe the Bank should focus primarily on rural/territorial development
(specifically related to poverty reduction in the country), public sector governance, and education
and skills.
Capacity development emerges to a degree as an important area for the Bank: a quarter of
respondents, primarily from nongovernment groups, believe that the Bank should be involved in
increasing the level of capacity development in the country (particularly in the area of citizen
engagement).
Corruption emerges as the issue of greatest concern among opinion leaders in Kazakhstan. A
majority of respondents identified it as the top development priority, considering it one of the key
obstacles to economic growth. It assigned the Bank negative ratings in terms of its effectiveness in
this area.
Stakeholders indicate that the Bank lacks sensitivity to political and social realities on the ground,
and maintains insufficient levels of collaboration with non-state actors. In this context, targeted
outreach to selected stakeholder groups might be worth consideration.
Three of ten respondents (a plurality) reported that the Bank’s greatest weakness is in the areas of
communication and openness (specifically in terms of the inadequate public disclosure of its
work).

RAISING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BUDGET MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

Progress with the implementation of results-based budget (RBB) management and the
government’s Medium-Term Fiscal Framework has been insufficient. Despite various
improvements in the legal framework for RBB, the government planning system
remains overly complex, with too many simultaneous plans required at each level. The
proliferation of plans and indicators has overburdened decision makers and the overall
system. This became a constraint on the effective use of data and prioritization. The
latest Bank report (World Bank 2014)16 recommended revisions to the legislative
framework (including the Budget Code), in particular to introduce a process for setting
indicative expenditure ceilings and requirements for the evaluation of the effectiveness
of budget programs. As recognized in IEG’s evaluation on knowledge-based country
programs, effective implementation of RBB in Kazakhstan remains a longer-term
objective, in part because of serious capacity constraints within the line ministries.

The linkages between plans and resource allocation remain weak. Although the
government made a new commitment to advance RBB management reforms under the
Concept on the new budget policy, another round of amendments to the Budget Code is
needed to facilitate making the RBB arrangements more effective. Implementation of

                                     PILLARS 1–2: MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
medium-term budgeting needs further strengthening, as its effectiveness as a
managerial tool is undermined by a number of institutional and capacity constraints.
The credibility of the government’s macro/fiscal projections is explicitly questioned by
the IMF (IMF 2013).

Following implementation of Bank advice, the government’s capacity for public debt
management was visibly upgraded, including the development of the Government
Debt Management Strategy. Bank support included standard diagnostics17 that revealed
significant institutional and regulatory gaps. The most pressing need related to the
development of a medium-term debt management strategy that would provide longer-
term guidance for the government’s borrowing, as well as for market development.
Other major weaknesses included weak overall borrowing planning, an inadequate
regulatory framework for borrowing procedures, and weak reporting of public sector
debt data.

At the same time, progress on strengthening the oversight of state-owned enterprise
debt has been lagging. The availability of information on the consolidated debt profile
of such enterprises is still limited, despite recent improvements in the capacity of the
National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) to monitor and consolidate this information. In
light of the size/importance of the state-owned enterprise sector in Kazakhstan, the IMF
(2013) listed a need for enhanced transparency of financial operations of these
businesses among the key fiscal policy priorities. Whereas the government debt remains
low (less than 13 percent of GDP in 2013), the overall stock of quasifiscal debt owned by
state-owned enterprises is estimated to be close to 20 percent of GDP.

There has been much less government interest in follow-up regarding Bank advice on
expenditure management and rationalization18—in contrast to some other policy advice
( for example, on oil revenue management and tax policy). In particular, the PEFA
report was not used by the government to design a coherent framework to address PFM
weaknesses in areas such as accountability and oversight. In part, this may be
influenced by the shifts in responsibility for the PFM agenda between the Ministry of
Economy and Budget Planning and the Ministry of Finance.

The two sector PEIRs identified distortions in the structure of public spending in the
health and agriculture sectors and recommended a major expenditure restructuring to
be complemented by structural reforms. In the agriculture sector, the efficiency of
government spending was undermined by an excessive emphasis on subsidies at the
cost of financing public services. The share of subsidies in the agricultural budget was
about 40 percent in 2009. The most damaging aspect of these programs was that they
were delaying the structural adjustment of the sector. The Bank report recommended
re-examining the rationale for each of the subsidy programs.


                                                                                           37
CHAPTER 4
PILLARS 1–2: MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
The government’s expenditure policy adjustment in the health sector (including
expansion in the share of primary health funding) has been much more pronounced
than in agriculture. In the health sector, the Bank’s PEIR pointed to major inefficiencies
in the country’s hospital network. It recommended an increase in spending on primary
care, health promotion and disease prevention, as well as a deep restructuring in the
hospital sector. Further suggested reforms included (i) changing the methods of health
planning and budgeting, which would incorporate arrangements for per capita
funding; (ii) deepening provider payment reform; (iii) strengthening the autonomy of
service providers; and (iv) improving the quality and availability of information on
health expenditures

IMPROVEMENTS IN INTERGOVERNMENTAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
The area of intergovernmental finance was another priority for the Bank’s advisory
support. A Bank report (World Bank 2012) reviewed the system used to distribute
government investment grants across regional administrations and developed a
comprehensive proposal for its reform. The report stated that despite several earlier
efforts to reform the system of intergovernmental fiscal relations, the system appeared
complex and opaque. The core report’s recommendation was to switch to the formula-
based principles of allocation of government investment transfers to regions, especially
in the sectors such as education, housing, and road construction. This was justified
based on both transparency and equity considerations.

Overall, improvements in intergovernmental financial arrangements have been limited
so far, despite a consistent effort to advance these reforms under the JERP. The
government introduced a system of per capita-based financing in primary health as part
of the existing system of intergovernmental finance. However, little progress was made
on a system wide basis. The system of government budget transfers to regional
administrations remains based largely on historical spending patterns—leading to
significant cross-regional inequality in social service delivery and high variation in core
social indicators. It should be noted, however, that the government is planning to
introduce formula-based financing in several public sectors as part of the Concept on
the new budget policy.

CONCLUSIONS
The areas of macroeconomic and public financial management were among the top
priorities of the World Bank Group assistance strategy in Kazakhstan, and the Bank’s
assistance package has served as a primary driver of reforms in the public sector and
resource management. The Bank has established itself as a trusted adviser to the
government, with a proven track record of timely delivery of high-quality technical and
policy advice covering a critical mass of reforms.

                                    PILLARS 1–2: MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
The Bank’s PFM program has been highly relevant, with its priorities fully aligned with
the government’s development program. The Bank provided support for upgrading a
number of important elements in the national system of macroeconomic and fiscal
management. It made a strong and consistent effort to emphasize support for policies
and institutions promoting macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability, which has
been at the center of Kazakhstan’s development challenges. The program relevance was
somewhat undermined by a few gaps related to insufficient attention to the
anticorruption agenda and public expenditure rationalization. These weaknesses
mainly reflect the lack of government interest.

Although the overall reform progress with respect to the objectives outlined in the 2004
CPS was uneven, the critical areas of macroeconomic and oil revenue management, tax
policy, and tax and customs administration achieved impressive results. The Bank was
effective in using the window of opportunity during the crisis of 2008–009 to accelerate
reforms promoting fiscal sustainability. Bank products (the DPL and follow-up
advisory work) were instrumental in fundamentally strengthening the framework for
oil revenue management and in securing its robustness against external shocks, which
have been a critical macroeconomic challenge for Kazakhstan. The DPL helped
rationalize the use of National Fund savings and then withdrew the fiscal stimulus as
the economy recovered. It also promoted an increase in public spending on social
sectors from 52 percent in 2008 to almost 60 percent in 2010. The more recent Bank work
provided an in-depth diagnostic of the existing oil rules and developed additional
suggestions to make them more flexible.

The Tax and Customs Administration Projects made a critical contribution to the
modernization of these government functions, the improvement of the investment
climate, and a reduction in corruption risks. In the tax area, the combination of Bank
project support and high-quality advice proved particularly effective. The Bank also
helped the government secure several grants, the implementation of which allowed for
significant capacity strengthening in recipient agencies, primarily in the Ministry of
Finance and the Accounts Committee. The Bank’s advice was a major input to
improving budget and debt management capacity, as reflected in the revised Budget
and Tax Codes, the development of a Public Debt Management Strategy, and the new
government Concept on budget policy.

The quality of the Bank’s AAA has been consistently high, but the follow-up on the
Bank’s policy advice was sporadic and poorly monitored. The Bank program did not
succeed in accelerating reforms or in securing sufficient progress in a number of PFM
areas, including the introduction of the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and
RBB, external audit, SOE oversight, and reforms in intragovernmental budget transfers.
As a result, the Bank program was only partially effective in its support for

strengthening the core national institutions responsible for accountability arrangements
and the national system of check and balances.

The fully demand-driven nature of the Bank’s program in Kazakhstan imposed some
limitations on the Bank in defining priorities in its advisory work program. Thus, the
program coverage remained insufficiently coherent, reflecting the lack of governmental
interest in the analysis of several “sensitive” policy issues. The most important gaps in
the PFM program relate to: (i) poverty analysis (including non-income aspects of
poverty) – a full-scale Poverty Assessment would have been instrumental to
establishing a baseline and identifying priority areas; (ii) a PER – no comprehensive
PER was done over the last 10 years; (iii) support for an anticorruption strategy; and (iv)
analysis of the role of the SOE sector in the economy (for example, the Samruk-Kazyna
National Wealth Fund).

The government used the Bank’s policy advice regarding PFM and other issues quite
selectively, and often requested the Bank’s analytical inputs “for information only”—
without a clear intention to follow up with a policy change. The government’s interest
in acting on the Bank’s advice was sometimes difficult to assess ex ante, and the
ownership for reforms varied considerably across counterpart agencies. One of the
areas in which the Bank’s advice did not get much traction was expenditure
rationalization. There is no evidence of systematic implementation of the
recommendations outlined in the two PEIRs.

Some trends in the overall PFM results area indicate a shift in the Bank-supported
interventions from policy reforms to regulatory changes and capacity building. As a
result, in some cases, considerable improvements in government capacity did not result
in adequate policy changes. These include (i) strengthening debt management systems
without improving oversight over SOE debt; (ii) strengthening capacity in the
Accounting Committee, which was not matched by the extension in its powers and
independence; and (iii) improvements in public accounting without much progress in
budget consolidation.

The effectiveness of the Bank’s program in PFM was reduced by the critical lack of
attention (with the exception of the EITI program) to its public demand side of
governance reforms – that is, nongovernmental stakeholders. The policy dialogue was
exclusively focused on the government, at the cost of communicating with other local
stakeholders. The depth and coverage of the Bank’s analysis was not used to inform the
public or generate more support for necessary reforms, especially in the areas of
expenditure efficiency and budget transparency and accountability.

                                        PILLARS 1–2: MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
Local capacity building was another dimension that did not live up to its potential. The
JERP rarely (if at all) engaged local partners in program delivery. It contributed
surprisingly little to the build-up of local analytical capacity. For instance, the
macromodeling work done by the Bank for the Ministry of Economy and Budget
Planning did not bring much improvement to its capacity to prepare its own
macroforecasts and policy simulations. In addition, the ministry’s own research arm
was never included in the process.

In several cases, PFM program effectiveness may have been increased if analytical
support under the JERP had been backed up by more traditional
implementation/project support that would have given the government access to
specialized consulting services on a more continuous basis. For instance, an additional
technical assistance project could have improved government efforts to introduce RBB
and modernize intergovernmental fiscal relations. Overall, taking into account the
recent successful experience with the Tax and Customs Administration Projects, the
Bank program in Kazakhstan may benefit from a separate self-standing PFM reform
project to address remaining capacity bottlenecks.

The sustainability of results achieved in Kazakhstan regarding PFM reform continues to
face several risks, the more tangible ones including the incompleteness of a number of
core reforms and weakness of the civil society—and hence limited public demand for
strengthening budget accountability. The sustainability of the EITI process appears to
be reasonably assured, as the EITI is mandated by law and the government is already
funding 80 percent of its cost through the JERP. Even so, new technical challenges have
arisen associated with the compliance of the 2013 EITI’s expansion of standards. In
addition, further effort is needed to improve accountability and transparency at the
regional level by building the capacity of the regional EITI multistakeholder councils
and enhancing their participation in resource governance with local governments and
industry.

toward a softer budgetary policy.
8The Bank’s tax policy advice did not cover the issues of oil and gas taxation. Kazakhstan
introduced significant changes to its tax regime in the hydrocarbon sector first in 2004–05, and
then again in 2008, which did result in additional revenue gains for the government. However,
this change was done with the input from other development partners and the consultants
working under direct government contracts. The effective tax rate in the oil sector almost
doubled from 16–17 percent in 2003–2004 to over 30 percent in 2010.

5. Pillar 3: Economic Diversification
This chapter assesses the role of the World Bank Group and the results of its program in
promoting economic diversification and the entry of the private sector into
nonextractive sectors. Diversification of the economy and broad-based economic
development are critical for long-term sustainable development, in particular for
generating employment and reducing the vulnerability of the country to fluctuations in
the prices of natural resources.

The natural resource sectors are capital-intensive and, as a rule, deploy a small fraction
of the labor force in resource-rich countries. Investments in extractive industries can
represent a sizable fraction of a developing country’s GDP and lead to spectacular
increases in export revenues. However, they do not create many jobs (World Bank
2013). It has been well known and observed that a high concentration of GDP in the
exportable natural resource sectors with low spillovers and limited job prospects
(typical for hydrocarbon and mining sectors) can also keep the currency exchange rate
high, thereby hurting the competitiveness of other sectors of the economy.

In the case of Kazakhstan, generating employment and growth in non-oil sectors is a
major focus area of government policy, as the large reserves accumulated through the
NFRK provide a cushion against price fluctuations. Nevertheless, even in the presence
of large reserves, volatility in commodity prices and resource exhaustibility may
threaten the long-term fiscal and external sustainability. Therefore, the long-term
development prospects of a country such as Kazakhstan depend on the effective use of
resource revenues for diversifying the economy away from the extractives.

In this context, it would be important to (i) identify critical bottlenecks and invest in
infrastructure (energy, transport), addressing also issues of a modern regulatory
framework and PPPs; (ii) promote growth and job creation in non-extractive, labor-
intensive sectors, such as agriculture; (iii) develop an efficient and competitive financial
sector, capable of mobilizing local savings and turning them into private investments;
and (iv) promote PSD (nonextractives) by reducing the cost of doing business, improving
the business environment and promoting the deregulation agenda to help the private
sector to respond to growth in local demand. This chapter will assess the diversification
aspect of the World Bank Group program in Kazakhstan through a combined review of
these areas.

PILLAR 3: ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION

Context
The impressive growth of Kazakhstan’s economy by the start of the review period (11
percent GDP growth on average in 2001–04) was driven mainly by rising oil production
and prices. During this period, Kazakhstan was one of the 10 fastest growing economies
in the world and attracted more FDI than all other Central Asian countries combined. In
2004, the oil and gas sector accounted for 16 percent of GDP, 55 percent of investment,
and 50 percent of exports. After plummeting in the 1990s, manufacturing resumed a
modest growth but was still only at 82.8 percent of its 1980 level, and about 60 percent
of the 1990 level (ADB 2013b). The export diversification index was constantly
deteriorating and the export concentration rising (see figure 5.1).

 a. The Herfindahl-Hirschmann Concentration Index shows whether exports are concentrated on some products or
 distributed in a more homogeneous manner among a series of products. The modified Finger-Kreinin Diversification
 Index denotes whether the structure of exports by product or a given country differs from the structure of product exports
 of the world.


The diversification of the economy has been a key economic goal of the government.
Specific measures for diversification were introduced in the early 2000s, with the
adoption of the 2003–2005 Agriculture and Food Program and the Innovative Industrial
Development Strategy for the Years 2003–2015. These planned a proactive approach to
using subsidies to promote agriculture and government investment to promote
industrialization. A number of new institutions were created to support the
industrialization strategy, including the Development Bank of Kazakhstan, the
Investment Fund of Kazakhstan, and the National Innovation Fund. The government

also proposed major investments in infrastructure and education to support
diversification.

Despite a strong push, the government’s diversification efforts have not achieved much
success. Economic growth during the review period was still largely propelled by
growth in the extractive and service sectors. As a result, the share of agriculture and
manufacturing declined during this period and the share of construction and services
increased slightly. Growth in employment was concentrated largely in construction and
real estate, with a decline in agriculture and minimal growth in manufacturing (see
figure 5.2).

The diversification of exports during the review period was minimal, with a continued
concentration in mineral products. By 2012, the oil industry remained the main
contributor to exports and GDP, accounting for 20 percent of GDP (compared to 15
percent in 2007) and almost 70 percent of total exports (compared to 50 percent in 2004).
The narrow production base and highly concentrated type of export basket products
stressed the economy during the crisis and demonstrated Kazakhstan’s vulnerability
toward external shocks (see figure 5.3). This narrow-based growth led to a
concentration of wealth and economic activity in the three main urban areas of Astana

increasing from 12 percent in 1995 to almost 75 percent in 2010. The second largest
increase was in the metals category, with 30 products in 2010, representing 15 percent of

World Bank Group Strategy and Sector Programs
Supporting the government’s efforts for economic diversification and job creation were
the key objectives of World Bank Group support for both the 2004 and 2012 CPSs.
However, there was no explicit support provided for the government’s active industrial
policy agenda, given the doubts about its effectiveness. Instead, Bank Group support
centered on improving the competitiveness of the non-oil industry by “strengthening
the government’s capacity to identify and reduce barriers to business and private
investors” (Pillar 2 of CPS 2004, p. 5), and by “building the foundation for future
competitiveness by investing in basic infrastructure and human capital” (Pillar 3 of CPS
2004, p. 5). Both strategies envisaged support for these objectives in “four broad areas:
infrastructure, agriculture, education and skills, and private sector development.”
Although the objectives under each of these were stated somewhat differently in the
two strategy documents, their main thrust was essentially the same (table 5.1).

PILLAR 3: ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION
INFRASTRUCTURE
Transport

The geography, population, economy and trade flows of Central Asia have an
important bearing on transportation challenges in Kazakhstan. Within the region,
distances are substantial (2,000 kilometers from the Kyrgyz Republic to Russia), and
access to major markets involves very long travel distances. There are also significant
nonphysical barriers to trade, including inefficiencies at border crossings, unofficial
payments, and the lack of harmonization of basic transit documents and regulations—
all of which have been subjects of discussion at the Central Asia Regional Economic
Cooperation (CAREC).

CAREC countries have designated six major transport corridors, four of which are
through Kazakhstan (see appendix F). Although current trade movements are relatively
low, there is significant potential for trade with Europe, China, and South Asia—in
addition to current trade with Russia. Whereas rail transport accounts for more than 75
percent of the combined ton-kilometer of freight carried in Kazakhstan, road freight
traffic has been growing more rapidly in the last 10 years.

The road network of some 84,000 kilometers, of which about 21,000 kilometers are
national roads, plays an important role in the provision of basic access to rural areas
and provides essential transit corridors for trade. The key issues in the sector include (i)
an outdated and weak organizational capacity to plan and manage the network; (ii)
inefficient allocation of funds among competing needs; (iii) the poor condition of the
network, with more than 50 percent of roads requiring major maintenance or full
rehabilitation; (iv) the high costs of construction; (v) poor road safety; and (vi)
inefficiencies of various kind along the transit corridors (World Bank 2009).

The government’s strategy includes significant investments in roads and the provision
of select additional infrastructure, particularly along the CAREC corridors, totaling
8,290 kilometers. The strategy also includes strengthening the key agencies responsible
for construction, maintenance, and operations of roads, as well as improvements in the
functioning of the transit corridors (World Bank 2009). Government plans in the early
2000s envisaged support in the road sector coming from IFIs. However, in that period,
there was not much Bank activity, primarily because of a lack of government interest in
borrowing from the Bank at the time.

The pace and scale of Bank support for the roads sector picked up dramatically with the
approval of two large road projects in 2009–11.1 So far, the implementation of these
large multi-donor-financed projects has been very effective. The government values
Bank contributions in introducing modern contracting and contract management

                                                           PILLAR 3: ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION
practices. KazAutoZhol (the road agency) also indicated that it welcomed Bank
requirements for safeguards and fiduciary aspects. The government views Bank
involvement in this sector as important for ensuring smooth implementation of its very
large investment program in the sector. In addition to the actual roads, both projects
aim to introduce stronger governance and fiduciary standards, upgrade the capacity of
contractors, and establish new and innovative maintenance practices for outside
contracting. To complement these investment projects, the Bank also provided
significant support for policy and institutional development in the road sector2 that
provides a basis for some key sector policies and institutional design.

Overall, there is good progress toward achieving the CPS objective of building
transport connectivity throughout the country, and there are good prospects for
meeting the objective of upgrading the core network by 2020. The Southwest China-
Western Europe corridor financed by the Bank is expected to be completed and
operational by 2016.

Power

Kazakhstan has one of the most advanced institutional structures in the power sector
among the former Soviet countries. Sector reforms initiated in 1996 aimed to introduce
private participation in the power sector and establish a competitive power market. By
1997, the sector had been unbundled as follows: all 70 electricity generation plants were
separated from the former state-owned integrated power utility and privatized; some 21
regional distribution companies (REKs) were established, of which three were
privatized; and the state-owned Kazakhstan Electricity Grid Operating Company
(KEGOC) was established to operate the high-voltage transmission line.

The main challenge in the power sector in 2004 was the inability to supply growing
demand to the south (around Almaty) from the excess generation capacity in the north
because of a lack of adequate interconnection capacity among the three regional power
grids. This resulted in power shortages and a lack of reliability in the rapidly growing
region around Almaty. Thus, a key priority of the government was to strengthen the
transmission system connecting the northern and southern grids—and to create a
unified national system that would also have the potential for greater intraregional
power trade with Russia and its southern neighbors.

Bank engagement in the energy sector was limited to supporting KEGOC through four
investment projects that aimed at strengthening the north-south transmission line, and
connecting the additional available capacity in and around Almaty with the southern
grid.3 Three of the four projects have been successfully completed and the fourth is
proceeding satisfactorily. They have had a significant impact on key expected outcomes,



                                                                                          51
CHAPTER 5
PILLAR 3: ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION
specifically in upgrading the transmission capacity and reliability of the transmission
system in the north-south line and in reducing transmission losses.

KEGOC regards the Bank as having been a valuable partner in its modernization
efforts. However, KEGOC now is a mature company with access to many other donors
and even private capital, so there is little justification for continued Bank support. In
addition, as a private company, KEGOC prefers to get future Bank support from IFC to
avoid the need for a government guarantee.

Overall, Bank involvement in the sector—despite over a decade of support—has been
rather narrow. The 2004 CPS did not articulate any outcomes for the sector, and the
2012 CPS set out only physical indicators for KEGOC. The power sector faces many
more important issues in which the Bank has not been engaged. Most of the generation
plants are coal fired and use outdated technology. Their refurbishing and
modernization are constrained by the unwillingness of investors to invest without an
adequately functioning power market. The previous surplus capacity has now been
fully utilized with the rapid economic growth since 2001. However, new investment
that is needed in power generation is similarly constrained. Thus, only power plants
owned by the state-owned Samruk Energo have been adding new capacity. The
distribution companies face challenges in mobilizing resources because of inadequate
tariffs for district heating for which they are also responsible.

The Bank is not well positioned to provide support in these priority energy areas. Bank
knowledge of the sector is limited, as it did not carry out any sector work or JERP-
funded studies. Thus, it has not had any significant engagement with the Ministry of
Energy and Industry on sector policies. The Bank would need to fill this gap rapidly if it
were to have a meaningful engagement in the sector in the future.

Agriculture

Kazakhstan has significant agricultural potential, and development of the agriculture
sector is an important part of the government’s strategy for growth and economic
diversification. More than 80 percent of its land area is classified as agricultural,
including almost 70 percent occupied by pasturelands. Arable land, however,
constitutes less than 10 percent of the country’s area. However, its availability per
inhabitant (1.5 hectares) is the second highest in the world after Australia (2.1 hectares).
Kazakhstan today ranks among the top 10 wheat exporters in the world. With the
growth of the oil and minerals sectors, the share of agriculture in GDP has declined
steadily, from a high of 34 percent in 1990 to about 5 percent today. At the same time,
the sector still accounts for almost one-fourth of employment.

                                                            PILLAR 3: ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION
Agriculture has gone through a major transformation since the country’s independence.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the farm sector, like the economy as a
whole, was affected by the disruption of supply chains and went into a profound debt
crisis. Reforms and land privatization in the 1990s resulted in the replacement of the
collective farms by agricultural enterprises and individual farms. The agricultural
enterprises were predominantly in the northern part of the country, focusing largely on
wheat production, whereas the individual farms were predominantly in the south and
focused on growing cotton, sugar beet, sunflowers, and other higher-value crops.

Since 2003, the government has pursued an active policy agenda for the promotion of
agriculture and agro-industry. In the 1990s, the principal agriculture policy instruments
were state purchases and a limited number of input subsidies coupled with nontariff
trade regulations (for example, export restrictions, and export and import licensing).
Starting in 2003, the scope of these instruments broadened to include crop subsidies of
various kinds, input subsidies, concessional credit and other forms of financing, tax
concessions, expanded agriculture support services, and various trade policy
instruments. The budgetary outlays for these programs have increased each year since
then, and averaged 200 billion Tenge ($1.36 billion) in 2009–11.

Bank support for the sector included several unrelated investment projects4 and
studies.5 The overall achievements of Bank-funded projects were uneven, with
sustainability a major issue overall. Bank assistance to restore abandoned cereal lands
using environmentally sustainable technologies was an important and relevant
undertaking that achieved impressive results. However, there has been no follow-up,
and there is no clarity on institutional responsibility and ownership within the
government.

Bank engagement in rural finance and increasing agricultural competitiveness was not
successful because of poor design of Bank projects and lack of uptake. The projects were
conceived without an adequate understanding of constraints and challenges in rural
finance, and they lacked a logical link between project components and desired
outcomes. In one case, a Bank project overlapped with and was dwarfed by a major
government initiative in the same area (rural credit). Another project on agricultural
competitiveness had a very successful component of matching grants to promote
linkages between researchers and farmers and agroprocessors, but the program was
never internalized in the Ministry of Agriculture and ended with project completion.
Implementation of all projects was structured around ad hoc project management units
that are dissolved at the end of the project.

Bank sector studies were of high quality, but it was virtually impossible to trace their
impact on the government’s approach to the sector.6 Most studies were done at the


                                                                                           53
CHAPTER 5
PILLAR 3: ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION
Bank’s initiative rather than in response to a specifically identified need, including for
the JERP-funded studies that were supposed to be fully demand driven. The study on
agricultural subsidies (World Bank 2014) provided a rigorous analysis of the
effectiveness of the government’s large subsidy program, but its recommendations have
not found much traction, as the government seems committed to maintaining the
subsidy programs.

Overall, although the Bank has pursued an active program of lending and nonlending
in the agricultural sector, its contribution to and influence on the sector and policy has
been limited. The lending program suffered from a number of weaknesses, such as poor
technical designs, insufficient attention to institutional sustainability, a lack of linkage
between projects and the government’s own programs, and inadequate consideration of
project sequencing. The nonlending services—although ostensibly demand driven
under the JERP—have lacked ownership by the Ministry of Agriculture. There is also
significant duplication of studies on similar subjects by the OECD and the Food and
Agriculture Organization.

Financial Sector

The financial sector in Kazakhstan is currently under great pressure, with the banks
facing the worst ratio of nonperforming loans in the world (31.7 percent of total loans7)
and a large foreign debt. Since 2004, the sector has grown rapidly, supported by strong
macroeconomic performance and a substantial inflow of foreign wholesale funding.
Banks borrowed heavily from the international markets and accumulated $50 billion of
debt by 2007. The global financial crisis of 2008 and the associated decline in commodity
prices in 2009 triggered a crisis in the domestic financial sector. Real estate prices
dropped sharply, causing the construction bubble to burst and leaving the banks with a
massive amount of delinquent loans.

The government took drastic measures to quell the crisis, including the recapitalization
of three major problem banks and a reduction by more than $10 billion in their external
debt. Several banks had to be restructured (those with NPLs of around 70 percent), and
were either taken over by the National Welfare Fund, Samruk-Kazyna, or have been put
under monitoring. More recent measures, including the introduction of Basel-III capital
ratios, are expected to lead to more stability and consolidation. The total official fiscal
and banking support amounted to $17 billion, largely drawing on savings in the NFRK.
Despite these measures, the crisis continues to have a lasting impact on the structure
and solvency of the banking system and has not been fully resolved until now.

The Bank Group did not consider financial sector development a priority prior to the
2008 crisis. The 2012 CPS, reflecting on the government’s Development Strategy 2020—

which listed financial market development (insolvency reform, resolution of corporate
financial sector distress) as one of its priority areas—included the objective of
reinvigorating the financial sector.

The main World Bank Group interlocutor in dealing with the financial sector was IFC.
Until 2008, IFC had engaged in very few small value projects (one per year on average)
in commercial banking. During the crisis, IFC expanded its activities in the banking
sector, passing longer-term credit to institutions that would offer lending to SMEs, and
offering guarantees to facilitate international trade—with varying degrees of success.

IFC’s strategy in Kazakhstan, in line with its regional approach, focused primarily on
strengthening the financial sector through investments that addressed liquidity issues,
especially in view of the 2008 crisis. Other areas of focus included infrastructure
development through the creation of PPPs and promoting SMEs in agribusiness,
manufacturing, and services. In the longer term, IFC focused on the establishment of
best practices in international banking, corporate governance, and the regulatory
environment.

The IBRD mainly concentrated on updating its Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP)8 reports and monitoring the relevant processes. A series of these (in 2004, 2008,
and 2009) and policy notes9 alerted the government to the risks in the banking sector
early on. However, the government addressed these warnings only much later, in the
wake of the crisis. The Bank organized two “brainstorming sessions” dedicated to the
financial crisis (2008 and 2009). Following these sessions, the government set up a
special commission to tackle the banking crisis and used inputs from these discussions
to prepare an anticrisis program. After 2009 the Bank was not involved in providing
support to address the main issues in the financial sector (NPLs and foreign debt)
because of a lack of demand from the government. IFC supported the banks during the
crisis through recapitalizations with equity and subordinated debt, as well as long-term
loans to banks that would offer lending to SMEs; it also offered short-term guarantees
for trade facilitation.

Despite these efforts, there is still little progress toward achieving the objective of
helping to reinvigorate the financial sector. The banks are still burdened with a large
share of NPLs and foreign debt (see figure 5.5). Moody's outlook on Kazakhstan’s
banking system remains negative, given its weak asset quality. Capital adequacy will
remain a key credit challenge for the next few years, despite NBK’s target to decrease
NPLs to less than 10 percent—or the need to comply with Basel-III capital requirements,
which are to be implemented by 2019. The government did not directly request the
Bank’s assistance on issues pertinent to the financial crisis post-2009. In turn, efforts by

Looking ahead, a more comprehensive approach in dealing with NPLs might achieve
better success. Recent measures represent a step in the right direction. However, more
can be done, including changes to the legal and fiscal frameworks, such as
improvements in the insolvency regime, the removal of obstacles to transfers of
collateralized debt to the Problem Loan Fund, bank-owned Special Purpose Vehicles,
and so on.

Private Sector Development

Kazakhstan’s economy is dominated by state-owned interests that control more than 60
percent of the economy (about 2,000 enterprises). By 2001, Kazakhstan had privatized
thousands of enterprises, but most of the large important enterprises remained in
majority state ownership. Samruk-Kazyna, the National Welfare Fund, owns, in either
whole or in part, many important companies in the country (see box 5.1). SMEs account
for no more than 20 percent of GDP and exist active mainly in retail and services.

The government paid close attention to improving the overall business climate, in
particular to the country’s standing on various rankings, such as the Doing Business
indicators. A number of reforms, including legislative changes on investor protection,
insolvency procedures, concessions, competition, and licensing and inspection
requirements led to improvement of Kazakhstan’s Doing Business ranking (see figure
5.6).10

 Box 5.1. National Welfare Fund
 Established in 2008 through the merger of two separate funds, the National Welfare Fund (or
 Samruk-Kazyna) was mandated to enhance the nation’s economic competitiveness and
 support growth. It holds shares in national development institutions, national companies,
 and other legal entities. Its aim is to maximize their long-term value and competitiveness in
 world markets. The company controlled $78 billion in assets in 2011, or nearly 56 percent of
 GDP, and is expected to hold $100 billion by 2015.
 The following is a partial list of organizations partly or wholly owned by Samruk–Kazyna:
    Air Astana (51 percent)
    Kazakhstan Development Bank (100 percent)
    Kazakhstan Electricity Grid Operating Company (100 percent)
    Kazakhstan Mortgage Company (91 percent)
    KazakhTelecom (45.9 percent)
    KazMunayGas (100 percent)
    Kazpost (100 percent)
    National Innovation Fund (100 percent)
    SK-Pharmaceuticals (100 percent).
 Samruk–Kazyna’s functions also include: (i) financing SME projects; (ii) acquiring authorized
 voting shares in second-tier banks to allocate socioeconomic development funds
 (construction, SMEs, agribusiness); and (iii) supporting the development of the mortgage
 credit market and the housing construction savings system; localization of manufacturing,
 assembly, and repair; and maintenance of imported equipment. Diversification and
 modernization of the national economy is one of Samruk-Kazyna’s stated priorities.

IFC had very little presence in the real sector and limited success in promoting
diversification. Its advisory services intended to open doors for further investments and
private sector participation. However, because most of the private sector initiatives in
Kazakhstan were related directly or indirectly to state-owned interests, IFC had
difficulty identifying clients and investments unconstrained by its Integrity Due
Diligence14 issues; it therefore concentrated mainly on the banking sector. In 2008, IFC
increased its efforts to engage in more advisory activities to match investments, albeit
with quite a low success rate: of 34 formal documented efforts to engage, only 10
materialized, of which 6 are currently active (see figure 5.7). Among all the sectors in
which IFC attempted to engage (transport, manufacturing, finance, health, renewable
energy), it managed to conclude participation in only a few: solid waste management,
the Almaty ring-road, wind power, coal generated electricity, and financial sector
transactions. IFC’s investment side was dormant until 2008 (averaging only one new
project per year, with a maximum size of $15 million). In 2008–13, there was a strong
increase in activity, with five new projects per year valued at $70–300 million (see
figures 5.8, 5.9, and 5.10).

The Bank Group was more successful in helping improve conditions for doing business.
The most successful contribution was the Bank’s continuous work (2009 onward)
regarding the improvement of the Doing Business rankings indicators (for example,
access to financing, construction permits, and cross-border procedures). Kazakhstan is
currently considered the least regulated economy in the region (Central Asia and
Russia), with steady improving Doing Business rankings (see figure 5.6). At the same
time, other rankings (for example, the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development Transition Indicators) show rather static performance (see table 5.2).

The Bank’s work on the reduction of trade barriers focused on trade facilitation and
WTO accession. The Bank organized seminars (with World Bank Institute support) and
training sessions and prepared policy notes or provided comments on governmental
programs. More recent work includes an analysis of the impact of the Customs Union15
with a focus on the non-energy sector (firm level and a roadmap developed to transit
from compulsory to WTO compatible voluntary certification). Although the Bank’s
advice in this area was targeted and well received by the government, WTO accession
has been delayed several times and the prospects for membership remain unclear.

MIGA has no specific country strategy and no local presence in Kazakhstan. The
Agency had one scoping mission during the period and developed a portfolio of five
projects. They were sponsored by Austrian and Dutch investors in support of the
country‘s financial and manufacturing sectors. The combined gross exposure from these
investments is $512.7 million (as of October 2014). MIGA provided two separate $190

million guarantees to UniCredit Bank Austria AG, which accounts for 70 percent of
MIGA business. MIGA offered guarantees against the political risk of transfer
restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance for shareholder loan that
UniCredit bank provided to ATF Bank. Overall, leveraging existing relationship with a
European parent bank, MIGA played a positive role during the financial crisis by
facilitating financial support from the parent bank to its subsidiary in Kazakhstan with
its political risk guarantees.


Conclusions
Despite the continuous prominence given to economic diversification away from the
extractive sectors in all of the government and World Bank Group strategies, the
economy of Kazakhstan today is more concentrated than it was at the start of the review
period. Indeed, it continues to be dominated by state-owned interests that control more
than 60 percent of the economy, either directly or indirectly through the National
Welfare Fund. The government continues to pursue active industrial policy initiatives,
but the results are not yet evident, and the Bank Group is generally not involved in
them. Bank Group strategies and analytical products acknowledged the importance of
economic diversification away from the extractive industries, but struggled to define
diversification as a specific objective. Diversification was usually described in rather
general terms, and neither CPS strategy specified any outcome measures/indicators for
it in their results frameworks.

The Bank Group strategy of focusing on specific sector interventions (infrastructure,
non-oil sector growth and private sector development) through a mixture of projects,
analytical work, and policy dialogue was and remains relevant in the country context.
The selected areas of Bank intervention are all pertinent for diversification. However,
the effectiveness of separate elements of the Bank Group program in these areas was
highly uneven. In addition, the impact of these interventions in terms of achieving
diversification was not evident. The CPS did not set out any indicators for
diversification, and there were no mechanisms to monitor diversification outcomes.
This meant that the impact of the various elements of World Bank Group support
remained unknown. Moreover, there was no effort to identify midcourse alterations in
strategy and/or changes in emphasis, if these were to be warranted.

In the future, the Bank Group needs to be much more selective and strategic in its
interventions. These interventions should be designed around specific goals and targets
for diversification that are underpinned by relevant analytical work and jointly
monitored with the government. An alternative approach would be what was
advocated by a recent Bank study on diversified development (Gill, Izvorski, and van

Eeghen 2014). It argues that diversification is a complex subject that is often hard to
plan for and achieve results; it suggests that diversification should be treated as a
process rather than as an explicit objective. Countries like Kazakhstan should therefore
instead focus on effectively converting their natural capital (oil and minerals) into
physical (infrastructure, agriculture, and private sector), human (education and skills),
and institutional (governance) capital.

Agriculture is an important sector in Kazakhstan in terms of its potential contribution to
growth and job creation. However, the Bank Group contribution to agriculture in
Kazakhstan has been marginal to the country’s own program in the sector, and there
does not seem to be much scope for meaningful engagement by the Bank Group. The
Bank’s program has been dispersed among a number of different areas, lacking a
sustained involvement in any of them. Institutional sustainability has been an issue
even when a projects or parts of a project were successful. There does not seem to have
been agreement between the government and the Bank on the sector strategy. Bank
efforts have been marginal to the Ministry of Agriculture’s overall program, and there is
little justification for continued ad hoc projects. Unless there is a strategic convergence
between the government and the Bank strategy, the Bank might consider exiting this
sector completely—with the possible exception of the irrigation sub-sector (in case there
is an agreement on longer-term Bank support around the newly formulated irrigation
strategy).

The Bank’s continued presence in the transport sector (highways) will help to ensure
that it plays a role in the efficient implementation of an ambitious public investment
program. The large roads projects could be an effective instrument to help with further
institutional development of the agencies involved in planning, construction,
maintenance and operations of highways, as well as in strengthening the logistics
around the movement of goods in the CAREC corridors. There could also potentially be
a role for IFC in case the government proceeds with its planned PPP initiative.

Future Bank engagement in the power sector is less evident. Traditionally the Bank has
been involved in upgrading transmission lines, but the challenge now is to upgrade the
distribution and generation systems that are largely in private hands—a factor that
limits Bank involvement. At the same time, there may be room for Bank involvement in
a number of policy and regulatory issues, especially the tariff policy. There is also room
for possible IFC-Bank collaboration. This would require the Bank to deepen its sector
knowledge through analytical work to define its sector strategy.

The Bank Group’s efforts to reinvigorate the financial sector were not successful. The
financial sector is still burdened with NPLs and large foreign debt. IFC offered a wide
range of its financial products to help recapitalize its client banks as well as to support

lending to SMEs. Ultimately, the government was not keen on requesting the Bank
Group’s assistance, and efforts by the Bank to support relevant institutions along with
IFC‘s counter-cyclical support were not adequate to resolve financial sector issues. The
outlook for the Kazakhstan banking system remains negative, given weak asset quality
and capital adequacy. This will remain a key challenge for the next couple of years,
despite NBK’s target to decrease NPLs to less than 10 percent, or for ensuring that
Basel-III capital requirements will be implemented by 2019.

The Bank Group’s program had little effect on the overall business climate, other than
helping improve selected Doing Business indicators. Kazakhstan managed to reach 47th
place in 2012—a tangible improvement compared to 86th place in 2006. After 2012, the
ranking slightly deteriorated. Other rankings, such as the EBRD transition indicators,
do not show progress on governance, enterprise restructuring, competition policy, or
the trade and the foreign exchange system—and even show a slight deterioration on
price liberalization. IFC has generally struggled to find its niche for investments in
Kazakhstan. IFC concentrated mainly in the banking sector and its engagement in the
real sector was minimal, as it proved to be challenging to identify suitable clients in an
economy dominated by state interests.

6. Pillar 4: Investing in Human Capital and a
Clean Environment
Translating natural resource wealth into tangible and visible benefits for the population
at large is a common challenge for many resource-rich countries—whether through
building human capital as reflected by improved health and education outcomes,
establishing effective social safety nets, or improving the living conditions through
addressing the environmental challenges. Although governments may have the
resources to increase spending, the quality and effectiveness of these investments are
often questionable.

There is much evidence demonstrating the importance of investment in human capital
and the environment for sustainable development. Investments in human capital
(education and skills development) improve labor productivity, increase a country’s
competitiveness and may lead to economic diversification. A cleaner environment and
improvement in living conditions have an immediate positive impact on the quality of
life, health outcomes and other human development indicators.

As described in previous chapters, Kazakhstan was able to “monetize” its hydrocarbon
wealth and accumulate large resources. Thanks to the oil-fueled economic growth, the
country has made steady progress over the last decade on poverty reduction and social
development. During the period 2004–13, progress was made in some key areas,
including the achievement of three of the global Millennium Development Goals: a
reduction in poverty by half, universal primary education, and gender equality in
education. The UNDP’s human development index shows Kazakhstan’s improvement
from 80th place in 2005 to 70th place in 2013. Life expectancy also increased from 66
years in 2004 to 70 years in 2012, and maternal and infant mortality rates have been cut
nearly in half (WDI 2014).

Poverty officially declined from 33.9 percent in 2004 to 2.9 percent in 2013—although
inequality and gaps between urban and rural living standards still persist. The last two
strategies of the Bank Group in Kazakhstan (see table 6.1) do not mention poverty
reduction as an explicit objective, and do not track poverty indicators. Instead, the
strategy documents list the areas of environmental protection, education, health, and
social protection as part of the World Bank Group strategy in Kazakhstan.

 This chapter looks at the Bank Group role in and contribution to helping Kazakhstan
 use its revenues from natural resources to build human capital and address
 environmental challenges. This includes issues identified in the common analytical
 framework for this CPE, such as improving human development indicators; matching
 education to the demands of the private sector; helping establish effective social safety
 nets; and addressing environmental and climate change priorities and challenges.


 Addressing Environmental Challenges
 Over the past decades, Kazakhstan’s transition and growth have been associated with
 major environmental issues, including a legacy of historical pollution concentrated in
 urban areas; air, soil and water pollution as a result of ongoing mining and
 processing/manufacturing; inherited issues related to nuclear testing; land degradation
 as a result of the damaging agricultural practices in the mid-20th century;
 desertification; and water scarcity.

 Two areas stand out for both the range and severity of their environmental distress: the
 desiccation of the Aral Sea and a cluster of seriously polluted and partially abandoned
 industrial complexes, such as nonferrous and ferrous metallurgy, power, chemical
 industries, and mining, and a former Soviet nuclear testing site. All these sites are
 characterized by a high level of complex air, water, and soil contamination.

 Protecting the country’s forests is another important and challenging task. Kazakhstan’s
 forest area accounts for a mere 1.2 percent of its territory, but the 33,000 km2 of forest
 cover still make it the third largest forested country in the Europe and Central Asia
 Region, after Russia and Turkey. Public funding of forest management and
 environmental protection declined dramatically in the 1990s, and most of the
 afforestation and forest maintenance and protection work had come to a virtual

standstill. In addition, Kazakhstan’s forests suffered dramatic losses from fire in 1998,
which affected as much as 10 percent of the forest area (Kushlin, van Veen, and Sutton
2004).

With respect to climate change, Kazakhstan ranks among the top 10 energy-intensive
economies in the world. Mirroring the high energy intensity, the country is the fourth
most greenhouse gas-intensive country in the world. With 1.4 kilograms of carbon
dioxide (CO2) per dollar of GDP emitted in 2008, Kazakhstan is more than twice as
greenhouse gas-intensive as the Europe and Central Asia regional average, and more
than three times as intensive compared to the OECD average (World Bank 2013).

Kazakhstan’s water and sanitation companies emerged from the post-Soviet transition
with a decaying infrastructure that, in many cases, relied on outdated and inefficient
technologies. They were expensive to operate and struggled to maintain even a minimal
service level. Tariffs were too low to allow the utilities to make the investments required
to rehabilitate, update and expand their services. Furthermore, the policy and
regulatory environment inhibited both domestic and foreign investment in the sector.
These difficulties were particularly serious in the rural areas. The dispersion of the rural
population into small, scattered communities made provision of network services
particularly challenging.

The government’s Kazakhstan 2030 Strategy envisions the creation of “a clean and green
country with clear air and pure waters” (Government of Kazakhstan 1997). The 2030
Strategy also notes that only one-third of the population has access to substandard
water, mostly in rural areas. The situation calls for a quick solution through the
modernization of the water supply network.

THE WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM
The 2004 CPS recognized that Kazakhstan inherited significant environmental
liabilities, related to past military, industrial and mining activities including land
degradation, desertification, and water scarcity. The National Environmental Action Plan
for Sustainable Development (1999) set out some remedial investments, and the
environmental agenda was reassessed and updated to prevent additional
environmental damage from the economic exploitation of the country's vast natural
resources. It sought to continue to mitigate past environmental damage and put into
place systems to monitor the environmental impact of future investment and growth.
This included introducing international practices in establishing cost-effective and
sustainable environmental remediation strategies, addressing the technical as well as
the institutional aspects. On this basis, the 2004 CPS commits the Bank Group to
support of the government’s efforts to “ensure that future growth will not harm the
environment and [that] past liabilities are mitigated” (World Bank 2004, p. 5)

By the time of the 2012 CPS, energy efficiency concerns had risen higher on the
government agenda, pointing to the need to address global warming through the
promotion of low-carbon techniques and greater energy savings. Thus, the 2012 CPS
commits the Bank Group to support the government’s efforts to “fight climate change
with [a] cleaner environment.”

Overall, the 2004 CPS expected outcomes were consistent with its broader objectives
and well supported by the ongoing and planned activities. At the same time, it did not
include any specific outcome indicators, other than a reference to the Millennium
Development Goals, such as the proportion of land area covered by forests and carbon
dioxide emissions per capita. However, these are far too broad and detached from the
Bank-supported activities to provide any indication of the actual impact of Bank-
supported activities.

With respect to water services, the 2004 CPS notes that the quality of the water supply
infrastructure was well below the country’s own aspirations, especially in rural areas.
Thus, the CPS supported a direct Bank contribution to “the creation of mechanisms that
can be used for a steady improvement of drinking water.” However, the only water
sector indicator referenced in the CPS is “access to an improved water source” which is
widely used to measure progress towards the Millennium Development Goal on access
to safe drinking water.1

PILLAR 4: INVESTING IN HUMAN CAPITAL AND A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT
The 2012 CPS had no specific objectives for the water sector. However, it noted that
despite recent reforms toward a greater role for the private sector, tariff differentiation,
and the greater use of commercial principles in company operations, the water sector
still suffered from large backlogs in maintenance and investment, poor metering and
inefficient management.

Overall, the Bank’s portfolio covered three major environmental and natural resource
management themes: (i) remediation of environmental legacies and promotion of
cleaner and greener production; (ii) addressing climate change; and (iii) strengthening
municipal water services.

OUTCOMES
Over the past decade, Kazakhstan has substantially modernized its institutional and
regulatory framework for environmental management. The restoration of the Northern
Aral Sea was associated with the institutional reform and strengthening of the
Committee for Water Resources. The responsibility for the management of the forest
estate was consolidated under the Committee for Forests and Hunting of the Ministry
of Environment and Water Resources, which gave priority to forest conservation and
the protection of its ecological functions. The 2007 Environmental Code introduced a
number of important amendments and additions, specifically with respect to the
management of hazardous waste, greenhouse gas emissions limits, and genetically
modified organisms.

However, substantial progress with environmental policies and institutions has not yet
been reflected as improved results in terms of the key Millennium Development Goal
indicators referenced in the CPS, and as shown in tables 6.2 and 6.3. Thus, the
strengthening of the Committee for Water Resources was not accompanied by an
improvement in water supply services in rural areas. Indeed, supplies declined slightly
from 88 percent in 2004 to 86 percent in 2012. Similarly, the consolidation of forest
management in the Committee for Forests and Hunting has not yet resulted in an
expansion of forest cover, which declined slightly from 33,400 to 33,000 km2 over the
same period.

Finally, in relation to climate change, CO2 emissions from the heating and power sector
have nearly doubled since 2000—from 70 to 124 million metric tons per year. The main
driver has been the growing share of coal used for heat and power generation, from 75
percent in 2000 to 81 percent in 2011; it accounted for the entire increase in generation
during that period. In this context, CO2 emissions have increased from 11.5 tons per
person in 2004 to 15.2 tons per person in 2010.

Two significant measures were taken to reduce gas flaring: a ban on the flaring of
associated petroleum gas during oil production operations and a requirement for oil
producers to develop and implement associated gas recovery programs. Since 2013, the
government has also been piloting the implementation of a carbon emissions trading
system; 178 enterprises are participating, and there is a total emissions cap of 147.2
million tons of CO2, the same as the base period (for the average of 2011–12). For Phase
II (2014–15), the reduction target has been set at 1.5 percent.

Pollution levels (both air and water) remain high, especially in the industrial regions. As
estimated in a 2012 JERP report, the total economic cost associated with the health
impacts of air pollution alone exceeds $2.5 billion per year (or 1.7 percent of GDP) (JERP
2012). Based on IEG’s interviews with key officials, the pollution control laws and
regulations are being harmonized with European standards, but the corresponding
monitoring and enforcement capacity are lagging behind.

Little progress appears to have been made with respect to the strengthening and reform
of municipal water services. As of 2013, 70 percent of water supply networks were still
reported to be “worn out,” with unsatisfactory levels of service and water quality.2

THE WORLD BANK GROUP CONTRIBUTION
Over the past decade, the World Bank Group helped strengthen Kazakhstan’s
environmental management through a wide variety of interventions—from project
safeguards to technical assistance and policy studies—with mixed results. The Bank
Group has been most effective in supporting the remediation of legacy environmental
issues; its contribution to other areas (climate change, and municipal water services) has
been less evident.

Remediation of Environmental Legacies

The Bank and IFC’s early petroleum projects successfully updated environmental and
social policies and procedures for enterprises, introduced sophisticated pollution


                                                                                                             73
CHAPTER 6
PILLAR 4: INVESTING IN HUMAN CAPITAL AND A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT
abatement technologies, and cleaned up past environmental damage. The subsequent
environmental projects3 effectively remediated two of the areas of greatest
environmental distress: the degradation of the Aral Sea (see box 6.1) and one of the
major legacy industrial pollution sites remaining from Soviet times. The project-
oriented technology transfer and capacity building associated with these projects also
contributed to the strengthening of the country’s environmental management capacity.

The Bank provided assistance for the modernization and strengthening of forest
management4 in response to the crisis in forest management institutions after their
funding declined dramatically in the 1990s. Most forest maintenance, protection, and
afforestation works had come to a virtual standstill, even while forests fires had affected
more than 10 percent of the forest area. A Bank project helped improve fire detection
and upgraded response equipment and procedures. As a result, the average forest area
damaged by each fire outbreak in the pilot zone covered by the project was reduced by
96 percent—from 53 hectares in 2002–06 to 2 hectares in 2007–12. This compares to an
average 46 percent reduction for the entire pine forest area.


 Box 6.1. Success Born from the Lessons of Failure: The Restoration of the Northern Aral Sea
 By the early 1990s, the drying up of the Aral Sea had become a globally famous
 environmental disaster. Decades of excessive irrigation had reduced its water level by 20
 meters and its surface area by 70 percent. As a result, salinity and pollution levels rose
 dramatically, fish production disappeared, tens of thousands of jobs were lost, and dust and
 salt storms were causing serious health problems for the more than 5 million people in the
 region.
 The environmental distress also heightened water allocation conflicts between the
 downstream countries—Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan—that need the water
 most in the summer months, and the upstream countries—the Kyrgyz Republic and
 Tajikistan—which use water for power generation in the winter and need to store it during
 the summer. An internationally supported regional program to restore the Aral Sea had been
 under way since 1994. However, the results were unsatisfactory. A decade after program
 inception, the water level had dropped by 26 meters and its surface area had shrunk by 90
 percent. An evaluation identified several important lessons (IEG 2006):
    Overambitious scope: The regional effort should have been more modest and simple in
     view of the riparian countries’ different interests, implementation commitments, and
     capacities.
    Failure to address root causes: The regional programs focused only on the problems of
     the Aral Sea, without addressing the root causes of poor water management in upstream
     zones.
    Failure to address local interests: The program had been designed by technical experts
     and governmental officials with little participation from affected communities, as well as
     inadequate consideration of the costs and benefits of interventions to the national
     economies.

                                      PILLAR 4: INVESTING IN HUMAN CAPITAL AND A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT
    Poorly defined role for regional institutions: The role of the regional institutions had
     been poorly defined, and the institutions were weakly linked to national agencies.
 Drawing on the lessons from the earlier regional efforts, the project focused on an approach
 that could be fully implemented within Kazakhstan’s control. It funded the rehabilitation of
 the Chardara Reservoir on the Syr Darya river, which allowed the water inflows into the
 northern Aral Sea to be increased and managed. The project also funded the construction of a
 dyke over the Berg Canal, which enabled Kazakhstan to control the outflow from the
 northern remnant of the Aral Sea, and increase its volume by 70 percent.
 As a result, the salinity of the Northern Aral Sea declined by more than half, the flora and
 fauna were much improved, and the health impacts were greatly reduced. This restored the
 living conditions to the surrounding region and encouraged the return of a large share of the
 population that had previously abandoned it. However, the southern section of the Aral Sea,
 between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, is withering away. There are no efforts under way to
 save it, although it can be expected that tangible success with the northern section will
 encourage an expansion of the approach to the regional level in the future.

Two Bank projects5 addressed the legacy industrial pollution, helping clean up a large
concentration of serious mercury and heavy metals contamination in central and
northeast Kazakhstan. This pollution had threatened the well-being of the local
population, with evident but unquantified health and welfare benefits. The combined
effects of the pollution clean-up and reservoir restoration have provided a safe and
secure alternative water supply for local water users.

In parallel with these remediation projects, the Bank also supported a series of
environment-related studies under the JERP umbrella. The client appreciated the three
major environment-related JERP studies (World Bank 2006, 2012 and 2013).6 A study
tour to Poland, which had successfully undertaken a similar post-Soviet transition, was
particularly helpful to the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources in
understanding the implications and potential impacts of many of the reports’
recommendations. As a result, in part, various amendments to water pollution control
regulations have been made, and the design and implementation of an up-to-date air
quality monitoring and reporting system is moving forward. In contrast, the Ministry’s
monitoring and enforcement capacity are lagging, and pollution levels remain high,
especially in industrial areas.

Addressing Climate Change

The Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFRP)7 supported several activities to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the flaring of associated petroleum gas. These
activities include the partnership’s assistance in improving the country's legislation on



                                                                                                 75
CHAPTER 6
PILLAR 4: INVESTING IN HUMAN CAPITAL AND A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT
gas flaring reduction, enhancing flared gas measurement procedures, and identifying
associated gas utilization projects. The GGFRP’s technical assistance for direct
measurement of gas flaring volumes and economic assessment of gas utilization options
and their implementation was greatly appreciated. However, the government has not
accepted its methodology for estimating gas flaring emissions from satellite monitoring
data. As a result, although government officials indicate a significant reduction in gas
flaring, the GGFRP’s estimates indicate a smaller reduction from a higher base, as
shown in table 6.4. In addition, the government has not participated in recent regional
conferences where this issue could have been discussed. It has also stopped paying its
membership contribution to the GGFRP.

Strengthening Municipal Water Services

In the absence of a municipal water services project, the Bank remained engaged in the
sector through the JERP studies. This enabled the Bank to maintain a policy dialogue on
key issues, such as tariff regulation and PPP approaches. Based on IEG’s field
discussions, the studies were well received, but political sensitivities made it difficult
for the government to accept many of the recommendations. The government agency
on regulation of natural monopolies is gradually modernizing its approach to tariff
regulation. However, the water tariff was still below the level needed to enable
potential PPP investors to achieve a realistic rate of return.

CONCLUSIONS
The Bank’s interventions in the environmental arena were highly relevant and fully
aligned with the government’s Kazakhstan 2030 Strategy, which envisions the creation
of “a clean and green country with clear air and pure waters.”

The Bank’s program was particularly effective in the remediation of past environmental
legacies. The partial restoration of the Northern Aral Sea transformed a region that had
become uninhabitable into one in which people are returning and restoring their
livelihoods. The clean-up of the Nura River and the reduction in forest fires are also

                                   PILLAR 4: INVESTING IN HUMAN CAPITAL AND A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT
major achievements. The impact of these projects has also extended to the strengthening
and modernization of key environmental agencies, such as the Water Resources
Committee and the Forest and Hunting Committee.

The long-term sustainability of these activities appears to be on a solid footing. The
responsible agencies are competent, committed, and adequately funded to continue
supporting the projects’ contributions. What cannot be taken for granted is the
replication and expansion of this achievement to the remainder of the issue areas, that
is, to achieving the full impact of the know-how and technologies whose feasibility was
piloted and demonstrated through the projects. This would require an expanded level
of support from the government, which remains to be seen.

Various JERP-related studies were well received and used. In combination with the
remediation projects, the studies were helpful in transferring pollution monitoring and
mitigation know-how to the environmental control agency and to key enterprises.
Although both the regulators and the enterprises are still struggling to meet the
applicable standards, they are committed to reaching full compliance by 2020.

The Bank’s assistance in addressing climate change and the strengthening of municipal
water services was less successful. Although the GGFRP’s technical assistance
contributed to the implementation of some reduction in flaring, the ongoing
disagreement about emissions data and the government’s absence from recent regional
conferences represent significant shortcomings with respect to the program’s objectives.
These trends also suggest that the sustainability of these achievements will be low. The
JERP studies on water helped identify and discuss key issues. However, in the absence
of a project, the Bank did not have enough influence to overcome the political
sensitivities that made it difficult for the government to accept many of the
recommendations.

Overall, Bank activities related to the promotion of a cleaner environment were much
more effective in the areas where the Bank studies were associated with concrete
projects with realistic results frameworks. The influence and results of the JERP studies
on cleaner and greener production were enhanced by their association with remediation
projects. These projects directly strengthened the capacity and procedures of the
relevant agencies and allowed for frequent contacts and follow-up. Where the Bank did
not have any projects, such as municipal water services and gas-flaring reduction, it had
fewer opportunities to engage and follow up with the client, and the studies had much
less impact.

The most successful Bank intervention (the restoration of the Aral Sea) fully achieved its
objectives after revising the original objectives and scaling down the magnitude of its

activities. The initial project was originally launched with considerable international
and expert support. It was intended as a regional program involving five countries.
However, with each country having different interests and capabilities, the results were
unsatisfactory and the Aral Sea continued to shrink. Having tested the limits and
highlighted the challenges facing a multicountry solution, the subsequent project
focused on a partial solution that could be fully implemented within Kazakhstan’s
control. The project’s tangible success can be expected to encourage an expansion of the
approach to the regional level in the future.


Education and Skills
Overall levels of education in Kazakhstan are relatively high. Literacy rates are almost
100 percent for both men and women. Almost all youth complete secondary or
vocational and technical education, and higher education attracts more than 50 percent
of secondary school graduates. The average number of years of schooling of the
population rose from 8.8 in 1995 to 10.4 in 2010, matching a level similar to that in
developed countries (OECD 2013).

Despite these positive accomplishments, Kazakhstan faces a number of challenges.
Enterprise surveys point to an inadequately educated labor force as a significant
drawback for doing business; challenges include a lack of mastery of language,
mathematics, and science, as well as a lack of “higher-order” skills. In the PISA tests
conducted in 2012, Kazakh students showed improvement over the 2009 test levels in
math and science, equivalent to almost one year of schooling. However, the score was
some 100 points below the OECD average and below what would be expected, given
the country’s income level. Each year more than 300,000 new workers enter the Kazakh
labor force, but many lack the skills needed by industry. There is generally an excess
demand for workers with higher and vocational education, and an excess supply of
workers with a general secondary education. There are higher shortages of workers
with vocational skills than workers with a higher education (World Bank 2013).

Thus, the challenges facing the education sector in Kazakhstan are to upgrade the
quality of basic education and to increase the supply of workers with vocational and
higher education. The government has made these issues a priority. In this context,
education has received a growing allocation of funds that reached around 5 percent of
GDP in 2012.

                                  PILLAR 4: INVESTING IN HUMAN CAPITAL AND A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT
education has been the major area of Bank focus with five JERP-funded tasks, starting
with a study “Higher Education and Innovative Development” (World Bank 2007) that
had a specific focus on tertiary education. The study was followed by a broader review
of higher education conducted jointly with the OECD (World Bank and OECD 2007).
The study made comprehensive and far-reaching recommendations on reforms in
policies relating to quality, governance and management, financing, and access, among
other things. However, the recommendations did not result in many actions, in part
because so many were probably well beyond the institutional capacity of the
government to absorb and implement—but also because the government was much
more committed to the president’s initiative to create a world class university
(Nazarbayev University), an idea not entirely embraced by the Bank-OECD studies.

The Bank subsequently conducted two additional JERP-funded tasks on higher
education. It provided advice on the governance and management of Nazarbayev
University (FY10) and on improving advanced post-graduate education (FY11). These
tasks were peripheral to the broader dialogue on higher education policy in which the
Bank has not, to date, been able to find traction.

Regarding primary education, the Bank has provided continued support to Ministry of
Education and Science to build capacity to analyze the PISA test results. Under its
Systems Approach for Better Education Results program, the Bank also helped the
Ministry benchmark key educational policies related to teacher policies and student
assessments, as well as the autonomy and accountability frameworks for schools. There
were also several JERP-funded tasks to build the capacity of the Ministry of Education
and Science with respect to school inspections and the enhancement of a Unified
National Test. More recently, the Bank conducted a review of e-learning system (World
Bank 2013).

The only lending operation in the sector8 that responded to the recognized needs was to
improve the quality of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET)
institutions and to make TVET more relevant and responsive to the needs of industry.
The main achievements include the establishment of occupational standards based on
an intensive dialogue involving all stakeholders, including employer groups. The
project also supported the upgrading of curriculum and pedagogy for vocational and
technical institutions through competitive grants. However, the sustainability of these
efforts is potentially at risk because of uncertain institutional responsibilities and
capacity arrangements since project completion.

CONCLUSIONS
The government accords high priority to improving the quality of and access to all
levels education as a necessary basis for its objective of developing a knowledge-based


                                                                                           79

PILLAR 4: INVESTING IN HUMAN CAPITAL AND A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT
economy. Higher education and (more recently) TVET have received particular
attention in various government plans. However, the Bank’s strategic advice on higher
education was not in sync with the government’s strategic vision. The Bank advocated
broad-based reforms in the governance of higher education institutions, whereas the
government prioritized the key role of the newly established Nazarbayev University as
a model center of academic excellence—experience that could be replicated to other
public and private universities. The government made a strategic transition from
supporting tertiary education through subsidizing Kazakh nationals’ study abroad (the
Bolashak stipend program) toward creating a local powerhouse, that is, a “world class”
university that could attract and retain local, regional, and worldwide talent.

At the same time, the Bank made a tangible impact in basic education, where it focused
on supporting the government’s efforts to improve quality. Discussions with the
Ministry indicated that Bank support has been very timely and that it has exposed the
country to best practices. One task for which the Bank is widely credited by
interlocutors is the introduction of universal preschool education. This was an idea that
emerged from discussions of education policy in one of the high-level “brainstorming
meetings.” It appears that the government expects a continued relationship with the
Bank on these issues. The JERP-funded studies are likely to be the most appropriate
form of Bank support for basic education.

The JERP-funded tasks on basic education addressed very practical issues that the
Ministry faces in its day-to-day functioning. However, it did not deal with
comprehensive “policy studies.” The work has been focused much more on how to do
something rather than on what to do. This is consistent with the government’s
expectation from the JERP more generally. The experience with JERP-funded basic
education tasks could provide useful lessons for other sectors.

Regarding vocational training, the current Bank project has provided a sound basis, but
much more is needed. The Bank should work with the government to develop a series
of follow-up projects to sustain and further develop the initiatives started under the
project.

Overall, if assessed against the outcome indicator of the 2004 CPS (“assist the
government in laying strategic directions and improvements to the education system”),
the Bank was much more successful in providing help for basic education and
vocational training than with higher education. The performance indicators of the 2012
CPS are more specifically related to improving the TVET system. However, it is too
early to assess the outcomes, as the Bank’s project is still not complete. Nevertheless, so
far, the actions taken to introduce vocational standards with the participation of
industry, make quality curriculum improvements at several vocational and technical

considered as necessary building blocks to meeting this objective.


Health
The origin of health care reform in Kazakhstan stemmed from the need to solve
problems in health care financing and service delivery that are similar to all countries of
the former Soviet Union. The system of health care in Kazakhstan has faced two main
challenges: the specialized care in hospitals and polyclinics was fragmented and
inefficient; and primary health care needed expansion to improve the use of
standardized protocols and to increase its focus on healthy lifestyle issues.

Over the last decade, the Ministry of Health has implemented two important health
care reform programs—both attempts to shift away from the old Soviet style system. In
2004, Kazakhstan initiated a comprehensive National Program of Health Care Reform
and Development for the period 2005–2010 to address key challenges. These included
dealing with inequities in health financing per capita between the country’s regions and
between urban and rural areas, and out-of-pocket payments for health services and
pharmaceuticals. The State Health Care Development Program "Salamatty Kazakhstan"
for 2011–15 aimed to capitalize on these reforms by adopting new provider payment
mechanisms, developing evidence-based medicine, introducing pay-for-performance
for the health professions, and pooling resources at the national levels for hospital
services. Health expenditures in Kazakhstan are in line with upper-middle income
countries, but much lower than in countries in Central Europe and the Baltics. Health
spending as a percentage of GDP is comparable to one of the lowest shares in the World
Health Organization (WHO) European Region.

Despite recent improvements in resource use, some basic health indicators are worse
than in comparable countries. Adult mortality rates are high,9 particularly for men
(more than double the rate of women); life expectancy rates are lower than in
comparable countries, and some health problems (such as tuberculosis or mortality due
to cervical cancer) are also higher, showing failures of access and quality aspects of the
health system.

WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM
The 2004 CPS places health sector strategy within Pillar 3—building a foundation for
competitiveness through strengthening human resources and infrastructure. The 2012
CPS includes a focus on strengthening the strategic approach to health reforms under
Area of Engagement 2 and specifies, “Strengthening governance and improving
efficiency in public services and delivery, through alignment with the WTO on food

safety regulations and norms, and piloting of interventions with proven success to
positively affect male life expectancy” (World Bank 2012, p. 55).

Despite the absence of Bank lending in the health sector in the earlier years, the Bank
retained an ad hoc relationship with the government on health issues until 2003, when
the health sector was included in the JERP. Analytical work produced under the JERP
evolved into a lending project.10 This project aimed to raise the efficiency of public
resources directed to the health sector and help implement the key aspects of the
government’s reform program in the health sector. In 2009, the Bank undertook a PEIR
that identified major distortions in the structure of public spending in the health sector.
It recommended a major expenditure restructuring to be complemented by structural
reforms at the sector level.11

CONCLUSIONS
Kazakhstan has seen improvements in the health sector over the last decade, although
some health outcomes still lag behind the rapidly increasing level of income. Life
expectancy increased from 66 years in 2004 to 70 years in 2012, and maternal and infant
mortality rates have been cut nearly in half (WDI 2014). Since 2004, budgetary
allocations to the health sector have drastically increased, and the government has
introduced a system of per capita-based financing in primary health care. It is to be a
part of the existing system of intergovernmental finance, which is more equalizing.

The World Bank has supported government efforts to make changes to Kazakhstan’s
health sector through analytical work and lending. The Health Sector Technology
Transfer and Institutional Reform Project reports a number of achievements, including
16 regional hospital master plans developed to rationalize the hospital networks; the
development of evidence-based disease management programs for three prevalent
noncommunicable diseases; 211 public health facilities accredited by a national
accreditation body in 2014; harmonization of food safety legislation with EU standards,
which will allow Kazakhstan to access world markets; and the setting of cost ceilings for
pharmaceutical drugs. The initial introduction of basic per capita financing in primary
health care in 2010 and recent (January 2014) equalization of per capita rate across the
oblasts and its significant increase was in line with the Bank’s advice in various
analytical studies.

Key aspects of Kazakhstan’s health care system performance still need improvement,
and there is scope for Bank engagement on these issues, especially regarding
institutional reform aspects. Continued reforms are required for better health outcomes,
including expansion of preventive population services (with focus on “lifestyle” health
services); implementation of the 16 regional master plans to improve quality and
efficiency of secondary and tertiary care; strengthening of primary care (preventive and

efficient technologies for diagnosis and treatment (increasing ambulatory procedures);
expansion of evidence-based care pathways and consolidation of quality control
mechanisms; improving the financial protection of the population; and overall health
financing system reforms to enable all of the above reforms.


Pension Reform
CONTEXT AND THE WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM

Kazakhstan’s pension system was transformed from a pay-as-you-go scheme to a
contribution-based, fully funded accounts scheme in 1998. In the first decade of
transition, Kazakhstan was a leader in the area of pension reform among the
Commonwealth of Independent States countries. However, real returns on pension
savings remained depressed, given the risk aversion of the pension funds, and the
average pension size was rather low. The government was slow to address low
retirement ages, especially for women.

The pension reform objectives did not figure prominently in the Bank strategy
documents. The 2004 CPS has just a passing reference to the Pension Policy Analysis, to
be delivered under the JERP, within its Pillar 3 –Investing in Human Capital and
Infrastructure. There is no specific program outcome related to the pension. The 2012
CPS followed the same format: it made a commitment regarding continuation of the
advisory assistance on pension reforms under its Outcome 10 ‘Reforming social
protection system’. The only relevant output listed in the 2012 CPS Results Framework
provided for adoption of new regulations governing pension contributions to improve
the sustainability of the system.

The advisory work on pension reform has become an important part of the Bank’s
policy dialogue in Kazakhstan, driven by particularly strong demand from the
government. There were at least seven self-standing pieces of analytical work and
nonlending technical assistance in this area delivered by the Bank between FY05 and
FY12. The Bank flagship product was a 2011 report entitled “Pension Reform in
Kazakhstan: Options for Policy Reform.” It provided a detailed analysis of the pension
system performance for the period since 1998. It concluded that the poor performance
of the pension system had more of a structural than a tactical cause, which justified a
need for broader reform. It provided a comprehensive list of recommendations aimed at
tackling the issue of income adequacy for future pensioners in a sustainable way.
Specifically, the Bank emphasized the objectives of broadening participation in the
social insurance system and reducing inequalities among pension beneficiaries. The

CHAPTER 6
PILLAR 4: INVESTING IN HUMAN CAPITAL AND A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT
report’s recommendations were used as a core input to the high-level brainstorming
session in 2012 dedicated to the topic of pension reform.

OUTCOMES AND THE WORLD BANK GROUP CONTRIBUTION

Progress in comprehensive pension reform advocated by the Bank in its advisory
products has been partial. Overall, the pension system remains fiscally sustainable and,
at the moment, provides a respectable replacement rate of 43 percent (according to the
Ministry of Labor and Social Protection). However, the objective of increased coverage
was not achieved: coverage remains at only 64 percent because of the high incidence of
informal employment. This indicates a high level of inequality among old-age citizens.
Moreover, the pension fund fees are high, investment returns to date have been
negative, and the projected replacement rates are lower than the current rates. Further,
there is not enough international diversification of risks. There is also no rules-based
indexation of the pension benefit, representing a risk of future erosion in its value.

The government introduced several corrective measures recently and plans to follow
this corrective course in the medium term. It made a politically sensitive decision on a
gradual increase in the retirement age for women. There was also a decision to adjust
the base pension rate to bring it closer to the subsistence income level. To reduce
administrative costs and improve returns, in 2014 the government centralized all
administrative functions for the previously independent pension funds, with total
assets of $22.5 billion (10 percent of GDP). This decision, however, may have adverse
implications for the local capital markets, according to the IMF.

The Bank has been the primary source of policy advice regarding pension reforms in
Kazakhstan over the entire review period. The Bank built a strong relationship with the
main client, the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection. All recent policy changes
implemented by the government in this area reflect the recommendations outlined in
the earlier Bank reports. This includes, among other things, the decision on instituting a
higher retirement age for women, adjustment of the base pension, and centralization of
pension funds.

The government explicitly acknowledges the central contribution made by the Bank in
advancing the pension reform agenda. However, there seems to be an explicit
disagreement with some other Bank recommendations, such as switching the pension
investment strategy toward more diversification. The Bank also contributed to the
strengthening of technical capacity of the Ministry, for example, with respect to
modeling and analyzing future pension system developments.

                                         PILLAR 4: INVESTING IN HUMAN CAPITAL AND A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT
CONCLUSIONS

The set of AAA products on pension reforms in Kazakhstan was highly demand driven
and aligned with country priorities. There has been strong country ownership for these
activities. The Bank achieved a high level of trust by the government and used it
effectively to advocate policy priorities related to the sustainability of the pension
system and reduction in poverty among the old-age population. The policy advice and
nonlending support were of high technical quality and delivered in a timely manner.

However, actual reform progress among the objectives recommended by the Bank was
mixed, primarily because of the government’s reluctance to accelerate the pace of
change. So far, the returns on pension savings have been low, representing a longer-
term policy risk. Without further adjustment, the current trend would result either in
lower future replacement rates or in significant additional pressure on the budget to
support the pension system. The government fully understands the risk and seems to be
committed to making the necessary changes as part of its medium-term strategy.

7. Conclusions and Recommendations
Kazakhstan’s impressive economic performance during the review period was
accompanied by steady progress on poverty reduction and social development. Thanks
to the oil-fueled economic growth and prudent macroeconomic management,
Kazakhstan was able to “monetize” its hydrocarbon wealth and accumulate large
resources in its oil fund (NFRK). At the same time, the country continues to grapple
with a number of systemic challenges, including a lack of progress on economic
diversification; governance problems characterized by centralization of authority,
insufficient levels of accountability and transparency, and high perceptions of
corruption; an outsized state presence in the economy and weak private sector; high
income inequality and poor socioeconomic conditions in underdeveloped regions; a
lack of requisite skills in the labor force; and a legacy of environmental problems
inherited from the Soviet era.


Conclusions
The World Bank Group’s cooperation with Kazakhstan followed a somewhat unique
trajectory. After a relatively fast recovery from the Russian financial crisis in the late
1990s-early 2000s, Kazakhstan decided not to borrow from IFIs. Despite a number of
ongoing “legacy” projects, the absence of new lending made the Bank’s presence in the
country and continuing dialogue increasingly unsustainable. The situation changed
drastically around 2004, when the decision not to borrow was reversed. It followed the
growing demand for high-level policy advice in various areas of economic
development. As a result, two unique mechanisms for policy dialogue between the
Bank and the Kazakh authorities have emerged: (i) regular rounds of Cabinet-level
“brainstorming sessions”; and (ii) the JERP, a demand-driven program of analytical
studies and policy notes on specific sector topics, which is cofinanced by the
government. This restart of intensive high-level policy dialogue was followed by a
resumption of large-scale borrowing from the IBRD, as exemplified by two flagship
transport sector loans totaling $3.2 billion; that made Kazakhstan one of the largest
clients of the Bank (in volume) in the region.

Bank Group strategies in Kazakhstan were fully aligned with the government’s
strategies at the time and reflected their main priorities. The quality of the Bank-
government dialogue has been exceptionally high, and can be considered best practice.
The Bank has established itself as a trusted adviser to the government with
unprecedented access to the highest levels of policy making and a proven track record

                                                           CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
of timely delivery of high-quality technical and policy advice covering a critical mass of
reforms.

At the same time, the fully demand-driven nature of the Bank’s program in Kazakhstan
imposed some limitations on the Bank in defining the priorities of its advisory work
program. As such, the program coverage remained insufficiently coherent, reflecting
the lack of governmental interest in the analysis of several “sensitive” policy issues. The
most important gaps in the program relate to poverty analysis, governance and
anticorruption, and the role of the SOE sector in the economy. The government used the
Bank’s policy advice quite selectively, and often requested the Bank’s analytical inputs
“for information only”—but without a clear intention to follow up with policy changes.
The government’s interest in acting on the Bank’s advice was sometimes difficult to
assess ex ante, and the ownership for reforms varied considerably across counterpart
agencies.

Implementation of the JERP in Kazakhstan suggests that a large AAA program that is
fully owned by the client government and effectively delivered by the Bank could
become a powerful instrument for strengthening country-level partnership, advancing
the policy reform agenda, and the gradual build-up of the lending program—especially
in the context of Bank Group engagement with upper-middle-income countries.
However, the effectiveness of a JERP-type program could be further enhanced if proper
attention is paid to specific elements of program design, including (i) an adequate
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework with a special focus on monitoring the
degree of governmental follow-up on the Bank’s policy advice; (ii) routine disclosure of
the main policy recommendations as a tool to broaden public understanding of the
policies promoted by the Bank and to strengthen reform ownership; and (iii)
engagement of local partners, such as think tanks and consulting firms, in joint
preparation of the agreed analytical products.

The Bank’s program on macroeconomic management and governance has been highly
relevant; its priorities have been fully aligned with the government-owned
development program. Bank assistance placed a special emphasis on turning the NFRK
into a reliable national savings mechanism and an effective instrument of
countercyclical fiscal policy. The government now has an established track record in
this area, as seen by its effective and smooth handling of the impact of global crises on
the Kazakh economy that in turn supported a rapid recovery in 2010–11.

Experience with the EITI in Kazakhstan confirms its usefulness as an effective
instrument for promoting transparency and accountability beyond the extractives
sector. The government’s commitment to implement a multistakeholder process created
a platform for CSOs to discuss and demand transparency and accountability from

CHAPTER 7
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
government and industry officials in an unprecedented manner. The process is reported
to have encouraged the Ministry of Finance to enhance the disclosure of budget
information.

Overall, despite the tangible success of the EITI process and the tax and customs
administration reform, broader efforts to fight corruption were only partially successful.
Kazakhstan continues to score very low (compared to its income levels) on the
corruption perception indices, and improvements since 2004 have been limited. Despite
stated objectives, there is no evidence that a comprehensive government anticorruption
program was ever introduced during the review period. Some trends in the overall
results in the PFM area indicate a shift in the Bank-supported interventions from policy
reforms to regulatory changes and capacity building. As a result, in some cases
considerable improvements in government capacity did not result in adequate policy
changes.

Despite the continuing prominence given to economic diversification in all the
government and Bank Group strategies, the economy of Kazakhstan today is more
concentrated than it was at the start of the review period. Indeed, it continues to be
dominated by state-owned interests that control more than 60 percent of the economy,
either directly or indirectly through the National Welfare Fund (Samruk-Kazyna). Bank
Group strategies and analytical products acknowledged the importance of economic
diversification away from the extractive industries, but struggled to define
diversification as a specific objective and to specify any outcome measures/indicators
for it in the results frameworks.

The Bank Group strategy to promote economic diversification through specific sector
interventions (infrastructure, non-oil sector growth, and PSD) remains relevant in the
country context. However, the effectiveness of separate elements of the Bank Group
program in these areas is highly uneven, and the impact of these interventions in terms
of achieving diversification is not evident. The Bank Group program in the agriculture
sector has been dispersed among a number of different areas and lacked sustained
involvement in any of them. Its contribution has been marginal to the country’s own
program and there is little justification for continued ad hoc projects.

The Bank can play an important, continued role in the transport sector in the efficient
implementation of an ambitious public investment program. The large Bank-supported
roads projects could be an effective instrument to help with further institutional
development of the agencies involved in planning, construction, maintenance, and
operations of highways. In addition, they could also aid in strengthening the logistics
around the movement of goods in the CAREC corridors. There could potentially be a

role for IFC if the government proceeds with its planned PPP initiative. However, the
feasibility of the PPP for highways remains to be established.

Future engagement by the Bank in the power sector is less evident. The Bank has been
traditionally involved in upgrading the transmission lines, but the challenge now is to
upgrade the distribution and generation systems that are largely in private hands—a
factor that limits Bank involvement. At the same time, there may be room for Bank
involvement in a number of policy and regulatory issues, especially the tariff policy.
There may also be possible room for IFC-Bank collaboration. This would require the
Bank to deepen its sector knowledge through analytical work to define its sector
strategy.

Bank Group cooperation in PSD aimed to provide assistance to the government in
improving the business climate, enhancing innovation, reinvigorating the financial
sector, providing better access to finance, and advancing WTO accession. The most
successful contribution was the Bank’s continuous work (from 2009 onward) on the
improvement of the Doing Business rankings indicators. Kazakhstan is currently
considered the least regulated economy in the region (Central Asia and Russia), with a
steadily improving Doing Business ranking. Other areas of Bank Group PSD work were
less successful: the banks are still burdened with a large share of NPLs and foreign debt;
the technology commercialization project did not generate any business deals; WTO
accession has been delayed and the prospects for membership remain unclear. IFC has
generally struggled to find its niche for investments in Kazakhstan. IFC concentrated
mainly in the banking sector and its engagement in the real sector was not significant,
as it proved to be challenging to identify suitable clients in an economy dominated by
state interests.

Kazakhstan inherited significant environmental liabilities related to past military,
industrial, and mining activities, including land degradation and desertification and
water scarcity. The Bank Group has been most effective in supporting the remediation
of legacy environmental issues, whereas its contribution in other areas (for instance,
climate change and municipal water services) has been less evident. The most
successful Bank intervention—the partial restoration of the Northern Aral Sea—
transformed a region that had become uninhabitable into one where people are
returning and restoring their livelihoods.

The main challenges facing the education sector in Kazakhstan today are to upgrade the
quality of basic education and to increase the supply of workers with vocational and
higher education. Enterprise surveys point to an inadequately educated labor force as a
significant drawback for doing business, noting a lack of “higher-order” skills. Bank
strategic advice on higher education through the JERP was not in sync with the


                                                                                          91
CHAPTER 7
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
government’s strategic vision. The Bank advocated broad-based reforms in the
governance of higher education institutions, whereas the government prioritized the
key role of the newly established Nazarbayev University as a model center of academic
excellence. At the same time, the Bank made a tangible impact in basic education, where
it focused on supporting the government’s efforts to improve quality.

The Bank has supported the government’s efforts to reform the health sector through its
analytical work and lending. Achievements so far include introducing a health
information system; harmonizing legislation of food safety with EU standards; and
setting cost ceilings for pharmaceutical drugs. Nevertheless, key aspects of
Kazakhstan’s health care system performance still need of improvement. There is scope
for further Bank engagement, especially in sector institutional reform.

The Bank has been the primary source of policy advice on pension reforms in
Kazakhstan. Analytical products on pension reforms in Kazakhstan were demand
driven and aligned with country priorities. However, actual reform progress among the
objectives recommended by the Bank was mixed, primarily because of the
government’s reluctance to accelerate the pace of change. The returns on pension
savings thus far have been low. Without further adjustment, the current trend would
result in either lower future replacement rates or a significant additional pressure on the
budget to support the pension system from general government revenues.


Recommendations
The Bank needs to strengthen the enabling environment for implementation of its
policy advice by linking the key JERP outputs with concrete large-scale sector
investments envisaged under the Partnership Framework Agreement. The Bank
Group program in Kazakhstan had been mainly driven by advisory (JERP) activities,
and Bank lending was rather sporadic and not always preceded or complemented by
JERP studies. This is not unusual in the context of a demand-driven partnership with an
upper-middle-income client such as Kazakhstan. Most of the high-performing and most
efficacious segments of the Bank’s program were combinations of JERP analytics and
lending, such as the tax and customs administration, environmental protection,
macroeconomic management, and roads. The emerging modality of partnership, based
on a multi-billion-dollar commitment by the government for nationwide investments
jointly with the international development partners opens new opportunities in this
regard.

The Bank needs to advance its M&E tools to track the effectiveness of its program,
the JERP in particular. It should also cover the degree of governmental follow-up on

                                                           CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
the Bank’s policy advice and better integrate it into the core country monitoring
systems. The JERP was a powerful instrument for strengthening the country-level
partnership and advancing the policy reform agenda and the gradual build-up of the
lending program. At the same time, a country program dominated by nonlending
services still needs to have an M&E framework capable of reflecting the effectiveness of
delivered advisory services.

The Bank should use the disclosure of the main policy recommendations as a tool to
broaden public understanding of the policies promoted by the Bank and strengthen
reform ownership within the government and broader civil society. The Bank’s
program in Kazakhstan generally lacked attention to its demand-side component (with
the exception of the EITI program). The depth and coverage of the Bank’s analysis was
not used to inform the public or generate more support for necessary reforms. A wider
disclosure of JERP products could have had a positive impact on the program’s overall
effectiveness, reform ownership, and sustainability, as well as on better utilization of
the Bank’s analytical insights.

The Bank should be more proactive in engaging local partners (think tanks and
consulting firms) and make their participation an integral part and a good-practice
feature of joint preparation of agreed analytical products. Almost a decade of JERP
implementation had seen surprisingly little participation of local institutional partners
in program delivery. Hence, the JERP contribution to the build-up of local analytical
capacity was minimal.

The Bank needs to apply the experience of engaging with civil society partners
within the framework of EITI to other areas as well, to advance transparency and
accountability. EITI implementation in Kazakhstan confirmed its usefulness as an
effective instrument for promoting transparency and accountability beyond the
extractive industries sector. The commitment to implement a multistakeholder process
created a platform for civil society to discuss and demand transparency and
accountability from government and industry officials in an unprecedented manner.
These are important achievements in a country in which strengthening governance
remains a major challenge.

The Bank should consider (re-)introducing standard regular pieces of country
diagnostics, such as Public Expenditure Reviews and poverty assessments. The
demand-driven nature of the Bank’s program in Kazakhstan imposed limitations on the
Bank in defining priorities in its advisory work program; this reflects the lack of
governmental interest in the analysis of several “sensitive” policy issues. The most
important gaps in the program relate to poverty analysis, governance and anti-
corruption, and the role of the SOE sector in the economy. In an environment where the

CHAPTER 7
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
country partnership is defined by the client-driven AAA program, the Bank needs to
maintain the space and capacity for its own selection and preparation of specific
analytical products in line with its global development mandate.

The Bank Group needs to be more selective and strategic in its efforts to promote
economic diversification. Bank Group interventions should be designed around
specific goals and targets for diversification. They should be underpinned by relevant
analytical work and jointly monitored with the government. Bank Group strategies and
analytical products acknowledged the importance of economic diversification away
from the extractive industries but struggled to define diversification as a specific
objective and to specify any outcome indicators for it in the results frameworks.

The Bank should consider becoming more selective in sector engagement based on
its comparative advantages relative to other stakeholders and the private sector, as
well as the depth of dialogue and strategic convergence with government plans. The
Bank Group’s selection of specific sector interventions was generally relevant in the
country context. However, the effectiveness of separate elements of the Bank Group
program in these areas was uneven. Agriculture is a potentially high-impact sector for
diversification in Kazakhstan. However, the Bank program was a combination of
unrelated ad hoc projects that were not expanded even when they had positive impact.
In the energy sector, the Bank needs to reinvent its role after a decade of fruitful
cooperation. At the same time, there is strong potential for successful expansion in the
transport and environment sectors—with the possibility of positive spillover effects on
relevant sector institutions.

Program in Kazakhstan
This note analyzes Bank Group engagement through a gender lens in Kazakhstan,
reviewing country strategies, operations, and analytical work during the evaluation
period (FY04–13), with an emphasis on human development, energy and mining,
agriculture, employment, and pension reform.


Gender Issues in Kazakhstan
Kazakhstan experienced a change in gender dynamics over time. In the pre-Soviet era,
women were primarily confined to the roles of mothers and wives. However, the Soviet
era brought more autonomy as the payment of bride wealth (kalym) at marriage were
formally prohibited.1 In addition, programs on childcare, education, and medical care
were established so that women were relieved of some aspects of domestic work. After
the fall of the Soviet Union, the government supported several legislative efforts
addressing gender equality in Kazakhstan’s Constitution, government policy, and its
legal structure. The Council for Family and Women Affairs and Demographic Policy
was established in 1995, and became instrumental in supporting equal rights and
opportunities for men and women.2 For example, between 1998 and 2009, several laws
were passed relating to issues such as raising the minimum age of marriage for men
and women (1998), equal inheritance for men and women, and laws on domestic
violence (2009).3 However, gaps remain in legislation and practice, as all gender
equality laws are not accepted equally across the country. For example, southern
Kazakhstan tends to have more gender disparities than in other parts of the country.4
Despite challenges relating to legal implementation, overall, Kazakhstan has performed
well on gender issues, as reflected in some gender-related MDGs (elaborated below)
and measures such as the Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI).5 The OECD’s
SIGI ranks Kazakhstan as 14 out of 86 in the 2012 Index.


Gender-Related MDGs
When compared to other upper middle-income countries, Kazakhstan’s performance on
gender-related MDGs has been mixed—performing better than other UMCs on some
goals and worse on others.

Gender and Employment: While labor force participation of women in Kazakhstan
continues to remain higher than in other UMCs, within Kazakhstan, labor force
participation remains higher among males than among females. See table A.2. Low
female labor force participation rates are attributed to few incentives for women to seek
work in higher positions due to the lack of social services that can provide time away
from domestic responsibilities.7

Gender and Political Participation: The proportion of seats held by women in the
national Parliament in Kazakhstan was lower than in other UMCs until 2010. However,
there was an increase in women’s representation surpassing the UMC average in 2012
(see table A.3). This increase may be due to the Gender Equality Strategy of the
Republic of Kazakhstan 2006–2016, which came into effect in December 2005 and targets
women’s representation, aiming to increase it to 30 percent.8

Gender in Country Strategies
The two country strategies in Kazakhstan covering the evaluation period (2004 CPS and
the 2012 CPS) varied greatly in their emphasis on gender issues. The 2004 CPS has little
emphasis on gender, making reference to gender issues only in the context of maternal
and child health indicator targets not being met for the MDGs by 2015.

In contrast to the 2004 CPS, the 2012 CPS mentions that key gender issues in
Kazakhstan include the political empowerment of women, making the business climate
friendlier to women, and addressing unmet demand for child-care facilities.9 The 2012
CPS (for the FY12–FY17 period) also points to gender gaps in three areas that require
particular attention: low male life expectancy, lagging male tertiary enrollment, and the
gender wage gap.10 Further, the CPS 2012 emphasizes several gender issues, such as
increased labor force participation for women both in business ownership and in top
management.11 However, it recognizes gaps in unemployment rates that remain higher
for women12 at 6.5 percent as compared to 4.1 percent for men (2012).13 The lack of
availability of childcare facilities is identified as a major impediment to female labor
force participation, both for high and low skilled women.14 The 2012 CPS states that



                                                                                                                 97
APPENDIX A

evidence shows that women entrepreneurs are at an additional disadvantage when
interacting with inspectors, trying to secure credit, or obtain licenses and permits. To
address these disadvantages and barriers, the CPS also plans to focus on legislative
changes for easing business entry and exit conditions, improving the business climate,
and addressing barriers around access to financing, cross-border procedures, and
licensing and permits.15 The CPS also describes the low levels of political participation
for women. Kazakhstan is ranked 74 among over 140 countries in its level of women’s
participation in national parliaments.16

Overall, while the recent 2012 CAS focuses more on gender issues than the 2004 CAS,
the focus continues to be narrow, being more descriptive of gender issues rather than
forward looking on how the Bank could engage in potential gender interventions and
programs. The Bank could have focused more on narrowing the labor force
participation rate and unemployment rates between men and women, but this is
missing. There is little focus on addressing gender in the Bank’s project portfolio or
analytical work. This lack of gender emphasis is elaborated in the sections below.


Gender in World Bank Operations
EDUCATION
World Bank lending in the education sector in Kazakhstan was primarily through two
projects: the Technical and Vocational Education Modernization or the TVEM (FY11),
and the Youth Corps Project (FY13). There was no gender dimension in the TVEM
project as it focused primarily on improving the policy framework, and institutional
capacity to raise the relevance, quality, and efficiency of technical and vocational
education. The Youth Corps Project promotes community engagement and life skills for
youth through a community-based service-learning program, particularly for
vulnerable youth.17 Even though the project is very new, and no numbers on achieved
targets have been reported as yet, it recognizes that two groups of youth require
additional support: women and youth with disabilities. The project recognizes
disparities along the lines of gender and youth with disabilities, but there is no targeted
effort to address these disparities in the project documents at this point (Project
Appraisal Document), even though female beneficiaries will be tracked in the project (as
per the Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR), 2014). Also, tracking women
beneficiaries only may not be enough if there is no targeted approach to addressing
gender disparities through the project.

ENERGY AND MINING
The Bank had funded seven projects in the energy and mining sector in Kazakhstan
during the evaluation period. A majority of these projects (six of the seven projects)

                                                                                  APPENDIX A
                                       GENDER IN THE WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM IN KAZAKHSTAN
focused on electricity supply and transmission, or on oil field rehabilitation—but with
no relevant gender dimensions. However, the recently approved Energy Efficiency
Project (2013) focuses on improving energy efficiency in public and social facilities, and
on the enabling environment for sustainable energy financing (Project Development
Objective). Since public facilities include schools, hospitals, and street lighting, the
project expects to benefit the economically disadvantaged through the provision of
public services, especially to women, children, and the sick and elderly in the
beneficiary target group. 18 However, the project is still in its early phases and no
beneficiary data are available yet.19

HEALTH
The Bank engaged in lending to the health sector through the Health Sector Technology
Transfer and Institutional Reform project. The World Bank assisted government efforts
(through the Health project and the JERP) in shifting health service provisions to
primary health care from a greater emphasis on the hospital sector, including for the
distribution of public expenditure funding. Initially the project was designed to support
the government’s State Health Reform and Development Program for 2005–2010. Now,
with the development of the "Salamatty Kazakhstan” State Program on health, the goals
have not changed (World Bank 201120). Even though there is no obvious gender
dimension in the project, project achievements include the introduction of an electronic-
health system (storing information on patient histories, medication records, and
evaluations of clinics in computerized databases), and contributions to the
government’s recent (January 2013) introduction of per capita financing in primary
health care (ISR 2014). Gender-disaggregated data relating to per capita financing in
primary health care would be helpful to address the low life expectancy rates for men.
In the health sector, the Bank has not focused on pro-poor health care programs, which
seems to be long overdue. Preventive health programs for Tuberculosis would be
especially helpful. This is particularly relevant since incidence of Tuberculosis in
Kazakhstan is very high (137 per 100,000 people as compared to 86 per 100,000 in other
upper-middle income countries).

AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
During the evaluation period, the Bank funded six projects in the agriculture sector.
Overall, Bank efforts in the agriculture sector were fragmented (as per IEG’s mission-
based findings). Of the six projects, there were at least three projects that included a
component on farmers that could have also included women farmers as target
beneficiaries. For example, in projects such as the Agricultural Post-Privatization
Assistance 2 Project or the APL Phase 2 (FY05), the Agricultural Competitiveness
Project (FY05), and the Second Irrigation and Drainage Improvement Project (FY13),
there was potential to include a gender dimension by working with female farmers but


                                                                                         99
APPENDIX A
GENDER IN THE WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM IN KAZAKHSTAN
this was not done. It could also have been a consequence of men and women working
in equal proportion in the farm labor force (at about 32 percent each).21 However, other
challenges faced by women in the agricultural workforce (especially female-headed
households) were not addressed. Overall, there is a lack of involving communities or
adoption of community-driven development (CDD) approaches in the agriculture and
rural development projects in Kazakhstan—mainly because the sector is primarily
focused on commercial agriculture rather than on subsistence agriculture.


Gender in World Bank’s Analytical and Advisory Assistance
EDUCATION ESW AND NONLENDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE (NLTA)
The Bank funded two education related economic and sector work (ESW) initiatives in
Kazakhstan during the evaluation period. The Education Policy Dialogue (FY04)
focused on initiating a dialogue on basic education strategy to support the poverty
assessment. However, little documentation on this work can be found among the Bank
documents. Therefore, it is hard to assess whether a gender dimension would have been
relevant.

The Education and Innovation Development (under the JERP; FY07) work proposed
data collection on key characteristics of students, including socio-economic origin,
gender, rural/urban origins, and so on. This was to be done through a reliable
management information system to ensure equitable distribution of public resources at
the tertiary education level.22 This information would in turn be used to analyze
benefits incidence of public spending by looking at the distribution of public subsidies
across various population groups.23 One of the main findings of this work was that
public spending for education overall remains low in Kazakhstan—in spite of rapidly
growing oil and gas revenues.24 However, no follow-up of this work was done in the
TVEM project of 2011 or in the Youth Corps project (FY13). These would have been
relevant avenues for follow-up. Also, this work did not analyze any gender dimensions
in the tertiary education arena to assess whether gender mainstreaming or gender-
targeted programs would be more relevant.

Through the JERP, the Bank provided nonlending technical assistance via three
undertakings in FY07, FY09, and FY10. All three focused on institutional building, for
example: providing support to the Ministry of Education and Science in the
implementation and monitoring of the new Education Strategy (FY07); designing and
implementing plans relating to the New University (FY09); and conducting workshops
on learning from world-class universities (FY10). There was no gender dimension to the
NLTA provided in the education sector.

                                     GENDER IN THE WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM IN KAZAKHSTAN
HEALTH ESW AND NLTA
Only one ESW was funded in the Health, Nutrition, and Population sector, which
focused on Health Management Information Systems and did not have a gender aspect.
In providing NLTA, the Bank mostly focused on working with government health
agencies on information systems/ capacity building and did not address any gender
dimensions.

POVERTY ASSESSMENTS
The Bank conducted one full-scale poverty assessment25 during the evaluation period
(FY04). The Assessment highlighted that wages varied significantly across sector,
oblasts, occupational categories, and gender.26 Wages in rural areas were lower than in
urban areas, and farm wages were the lowest among the occupational categories (at 18
percent of public sector wages). On average, gender differences in wages showed that
male wages were 31 percent higher than female wages in 2002.27 The study shows
segmentation of the labor market in Kazakhstan, putting women and the rural
population at a disadvantage in accessing jobs, earning an income, thereby contributing
to ‘sustaining’ poverty.28 The study suggests that there were no considerable rural-
urban or gender-linked disparities found at the lower levels of education. However, the
disparities among the poor and the rich are greater at higher levels of education.29

The study also emphasizes the importance of pension benefits in Kazakhstan, and notes
that a significant reduction of pension benefits could lead to a greater prevalence of
poverty among the elderly, especially women. Women’s vulnerability to poverty would
increase with the loss of the minimum pension guarantee that provides these elderly
women with significant income support.30 No targeted efforts were seen at the project
level to address the gender disparities raised through the poverty assessment.


Social Protection ESW and NLTA
The Bank funded three pieces of ESW in the pension reform area during the evaluation
period. The Pension Policy Note (FY05) focused on the transformation of Kazakhstan's
pension system of the 1998 pay-as-you-go basis into one exclusively based on fully
funded, defined-contribution individual accounts. The policy note did not have any
relevant gender dimension since it focused on reviewing reform implementation based
on current conditions and projected outcomes, as well as providing recommendations
for a long-term equitable pension system.31

The JERP Pension Study (FY07) recognized that the pay-as-you-go system, which
awarded higher pensions per unit of contribution for the longer retirement periods of
women, was being replaced with one in which women’s lower retirement age and


                                                                                      101
APPENDIX A
GENDER IN THE WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM IN KAZAKHSTAN
shorter contributory periods are reflected in lower benefits.32 The study also proposed
that, unlike its original design, the Kazakhstan pension system would continue to rely
on publicly financed pensions, with the importance to the length of the beneficiary
period managed through retirement age increases.33 The study suggests that, as a first
step, the retirement age of women should increase to 63, the same as for men34—even
though it may be politically difficult to do so. The study explains that actuarially fair
annuities are lower both per unit of retirement balance and in absolute terms for
women (by analyzing mortality tables applied to annuity calculations). In this context,
women’s average earnings are usually lower than those of men; they spend more time
away from the labor force caring for children; they have traditionally had a lower
retirement age; and they live significantly longer.35

Regarding pension reform, women’s lower retirement age as compared to men has been
a politically contested issue. In 2013, the government agreed to increase the retirement
age of women from 58 to 63 years of age, thus striving towards equality with the
working male population.36 There has been public debate on this reform relating to
whether the retirement age should be raised gradually by six months to a year over the
next few years or in one instance.37 The government has decided that starting January 1,
2014, the retirement age of women will be increased in increments of 6 months from 58
to 63 years,38 thereby taking ten years for this reform to be fully implemented (that is,
from 2014 to 2024) . In 2014, the Minister of Labor and Social Security elaborated that
while women accounted for 70 percent of retirees in Kazakhstan, they held only 45
percent of individual retirement accounts.39 Also, the average pension savings for
women in Kazakhstan is 25 percent lower than that of men—mainly due to a shorter
period of pension contributions and gender pay differences.40 The influence of the Bank
in the formulation of this policy is unclear.

With the JERP-supported Improvements in Social Safety Net Phase 1 (FY11), a
comprehensive review of the existing social protection system of the low-income
population was undertaken. The focus of this study was on identification of
dependency causes from social protection systems in low-income populations. It
covered several types of social protection including active forms of employment
promotion, targeted social assistance, housing assistance, and so on. However, it is not
clear whether there was an emphasis on women-headed households, especially those
headed by elderly women and identified as a vulnerable group in the previous Poverty
Assessment, since no documents related to this study were found on the World Bank
website or the Internet.41

The Bank provided TA to ten projects in the social protection area—more than in many
other areas—indicating that social protection was an important focus of the Bank’s
work in Kazakhstan. Three social protection-related TA projects had the potential to

include a gender dimension, but eventually did not. For example, in the JERP-
supported Comparative Analysis SSN (FY11), the government approached the World
Bank to help design a modern safety net. Joint work progressed to learn about the
barriers to working among the low-income populations of Kazakhstan, and analyzing
international experience with successful social protection programs. The JERP-
supported Conditional Cash Transfer TA (FY12) helped to develop elements of a
conditional cash transfer program that would contribute to the improvement of living
standards of low-income group beneficiaries of the Last Resort program. It also
developed a set of recommendations on strengthening the social safety net to better
serve target population groups. The JERP-supported Modernization of the Social
Sphere (FY13) proposed a key set of outcomes for the social modernization framework
for Kazakhstan. However, the only focus on gender came through one of the ten
proposed outcomes: “All pregnant women having professional support during
pregnancy and delivery, which will reduce infant mortality and avoidable early
childhood illnesses.”42 Despite a heavy focus on the social protection sector in analytical
work and the 2012 CAS, there were no Bank projects in the evaluation period that
focused on conditional cash transfers, or other pension-related social protection
programs.


Conclusion
The World Bank Group engagement on gender issues in Kazakhstan has been limited
through the evaluation period. The two country strategies (CPS 2004 and CPS 2012)
briefly described some of the gender-based challenges in the health, unemployment,
and political participation areas, but did not commit to addressing these issues through
its lending projects. The World Bank Group was not involved in any lending or
analytical work relating to gender issues in the extractives sector. The Bank did address
gender issues through its analytical work, but only as a subset of a broader issue, for
example, in poverty assessments or in the JERP-supported pension reform study. It is
unclear whether the gender dimensions of the JERP’s pension reform work contributed
to national-level legislation that increased the retirement age of women from 58 to 63
years in 2013. Clearly, there is a trend toward greater emphasis on gender issues in the
latter half of the evaluation period. It remains to be seen how the Bank chooses to
engage more actively on gender issues in Kazakhstan in the future.

Over the FY04–13 period, the Bank approved 25 financing agreements for a total
amount of $4.9 billion, including four trust fund operations, three recipient-
executed activities, and one Global Environment Fund (GEF) grant. The portfolio
size is dominated (about 86 percent) by three major investments: South-West Roads,
East-West Roads International Transit Corridors, and a DPL. Five percent of the
portfolio is covered by two projects in the health and irrigation sectors, and the
remaining nine percent of lending supports education, innovation, environment,
and the revenue administration agenda.

The World Bank implemented (approved and closed) 34 operations between FY04
and FY13. The agriculture sector dominated, with seven projects implemented
between FY04 and FY13, including one GEF-blended project (grant). The next largest
sector by project count was energy and mining with five investments. These were
mainly in energy transmission and included a technical assistance loan for the
extractives sector.

164 Nonlending TA projects were approved for implementation. The majority of this
work focused on governance, administrative reforms, financial sector development,
private sector development, economic diversification and human development. It
accounted for more than half of the ESW and TA portfolio.

In Kazakhstan, the Bank has a unique position in delivering analytic and advisory
activities through the JERP, most notably through brainstorming sessions requested
and co-chaired by the Prime Minister. These sessions have provided the government
with a forum for debating important policy issues, thinking through problems, and
developing strategies with analytical support from the Bank.

The first such brainstorming was held in February 2004 in Geneva during the WTO
meetings to discuss the new World Bank Country Partnership Strategy with
Kazakhstan. Since then, approximately 16 brainstorming sessions have been held to
discuss key development issues both topical and long-term, such as the financial
crisis, competitiveness, foreign investment, economic diversification, public
administration reforms, food prices and agricultural policy, and human
development.

These sessions appear to be optimized by strong ownership on the part of the
Kazakh Prime Minister, who has a keen interest in the topics, and ensures that the
right officials and high-level experts are present. The impact of these brainstorming
sessions is evident in several areas: resuming pre-school education services,
providing input for the elaboration of the anti-crisis package, establishing per capita
financing in health system, and pension reform.


Efficiency of the Portfolio
Overall, the World Bank’s Kazakhstan portfolio is highly efficient, with few
exceptions. Actual economic rate of return (ERR) exceed the appraised rate or the
rate of economic viability. There are several projects in which the ERR estimate or
calculation either was either absent at the appraisal stage (Drylands Management),
or at closure. Only one project did not provide an ERR at the appraisal or at the
closing stage (APP2).

The total completion cost of the Bank portfolio in Kazakhstan varied from $300 to
$10,658 (including Bank-Executed Trust Funds). The share of completion costs of the
Kazakhstan portfolio was in the range of 3–10 percent of the ECA portfolio, and up
to 2 percent of the Bank-wide portfolio. However, in the past two years, trust funds
drove the completion cost of the portfolio to 75 percent of total regional costs, and 10
percent of Bank-wide costs.

higher compared to other countries in ECA. In the early 2000s, Russia’s portfolio
was the most expensive followed by Kazakhstan. After 2005, with few exceptions,
project completion costs in Kazakhstan were higher than in Russia and Turkey, as
well as in other countries in Central Asia with the same portfolio size.

IFC and MIGA Portfolio
During the CPS 2005–11 period, Kazakhstan represented IFC’s sixth largest
exposure in the ECA region, with an outstanding portfolio of $382 million as of the
end of 2011. This constitutes a three-fold increase in the size of portfolio during the
CPS period. Total investments in Kazakhstan during the CPS period amounted to
over $1 billion in 27 projects, of which $950 million was for IFC’s own account, and
another $110 million was raised through syndication. Prior to the crisis, IFC focused
on SME development, investments in sectors of comparative advantage for
Kazakhstan (such as agri-business, oil and gas, general manufacturing,
infrastructure, and services) and developed leasing and mortgage finance. During
the crisis, IFC rapidly expanded its focus to support the stabilization of the financial
sector, and did so by increasing access to finance in the priority sectors of the
economy. Over the past four years, the primary component of IFC assistance ($680
million) focused on equity, quasi equity, senior debt, and trade finance to several
private sector banks in Kazakhstan. At the end of the CPS 2005–11 period, IFC’s
investment portfolio in Kazakhstan was almost fully disbursed (98 percent) and
performing well (with no NPLs at the end of FY2011). In addition, IFC has been
providing advisory assistance in the areas of corporate governance and business
transparency to address the key constraints to expansion of private sector
investment programs in Kazakhstan (CPS 2004 Completion Report).

In the 2012–17 CPS, IFC plans to promote the development of the private sector
through investment and advisory services in support of economic diversification,
with the focus on non-extractive industries (such as access to infrastructure,
strengthening the financial sector, and supporting diversification and
competitiveness). In the short term, the IFC plans to focus on strengthening the
financial sector, with medium-term efforts targeting infrastructure. Other objectives
include promotion of SME development in agribusiness, manufacturing, and
services. IFC also aimed to support the energy efficiency agenda as a crosscutting
theme in its activities.

MIGA supported the financial and manufacturing sectors; its portfolio in
Kazakhstan consists of five projects. The combined gross exposure from these
investments (as of October 2014) is $512.7 million.


Partnerships
The World Bank Group works in close collaboration with other multilateral
institutions and development partners. However, an official joint assistance strategy




                                                                                     115

does not exist. Instead, there is a loose division of labor among all development
partners. According to the latest CPE, in the area of improving competitiveness and
fostering job creation, partners provide support on expanding the role of the private
sector and trade integration (EC, USAID), financial sector reforms (IMF), building
skills (EC, GIZ), agriculture (GIZ), SME development (Asian Development Bank
[ADB]), electricity markets and investments (EBRD, USAID), and roads (ADB,
EBRD). Regarding the broad governance agenda, partners provide advice on local
public administration reform, public sector implementation capacity (EC), civil
service reform (EC, UNDP), customs reforms (USAID), judicial sector reforms (EC,
GIZ, USAID), social protection (EC, UNICEF), and health ((EC, USAID). In the area
of the environment, partners focus on sustainability (EC, GIZ, UNDP), and energy
efficiency (EBRD).

The share of official development assistance has reduced significantly since 2000,
although it was never above 8 percent of central government expenses or gross
capital formation. Its share of imports and as a percentage of GNI was even less—
about one percent in the year 2000, and one-fifth of a percentage point by 2012.

Evaluation Methodology
This methodological note describes the key elements of IEG’s Country Program
evaluation (CPE) methodology.

CPEs Rate the Outcomes of World Bank Group Assistance Programs, Not the
Country’s Overall Development Progress
A World Bank Group assistance program needs to be assessed on how well it met its
particular objectives, which are typically a subset of the country’s development
objectives. If a Bank Group assistance program is large in relation to the country’s
total development effort, the program outcome should be similar to the country’s
overall development progress. However, most Bank Group assistance programs
provide only a fraction of the total resources devoted to a country’s development by
development partners, stakeholders, and the government itself. In CPEs, IEG rates
only the outcome of the Bank Group’s program, not the country’s overall
development outcome, although the latter is clearly relevant for judging the
program’s outcome.

The experience gained in CPEs confirms that Bank Group program outcomes
sometimes diverge significantly from the country’s overall development progress.
CPEs have identified Bank Group assistance programs that had:

          Satisfactory outcomes matched by good country development;
          Unsatisfactory outcomes in countries which achieved good overall
           development results, notwithstanding the weak Bank Group program;
           and,
          Satisfactory outcomes in countries that did not achieve satisfactory overall
           results during the period of program implementation.

ASSESSMENTS OF ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OUTCOME AND BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE ARE NOT THE SAME
By the same token, an unsatisfactory Bank Group assistance program outcome does
not always mean that Bank Group performance was also unsatisfactory, and vice
versa. This becomes clearer in considering that the Bank Group’s contribution to the
outcome of its assistance program is only part of the story. The assistance program’s
outcome is determined by the joint impact of four agents: (a) the country; (b) the
Bank Group; (c) partners and other stakeholders; and (d) exogenous forces (for
example, events of nature, international economic shocks, and so forth). Under the




                                                                                        141

GUIDE TO IEG’S COUNTRY PROGRAM EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
right circumstances, a negative contribution from any one agent might overwhelm
the positive contributions from the other three and lead to an unsatisfactory
outcome.

IEG measures Bank Group performance primarily on the basis of contributory
actions the Bank Group directly controlled. Judgments regarding Bank Group
performance typically consider the relevance and implementation of the strategy,
the design and supervision of the Bank Group’s lending and financial support
interventions, the scope, quality and follow-up of diagnostic work and other AAA,
the consistency of the Bank Group’s lending and financial support with its
nonlending work and with its safeguard policies, and the Bank Group’s partnership
activities.


Rating Assistance Program Outcome
In rating the outcome (expected development impact) of an assistance program, IEG
gauges the extent to which major strategic objectives were relevant and achieved,
without any shortcomings. In other words, did the Bank Group do the right thing,
and did it do it right. Programs typically express their goals in terms of higher-order
objectives, such as poverty reduction. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) may
also establish intermediate goals, such as improved targeting of social services or
promotion of integrated rural development, and specify how they are expected to
contribute toward achieving the higher-order objective. IEG’s task is then to validate
whether the intermediate objectives were the right ones and whether they produced
satisfactory net benefits, as well as whether the results chain specified in the CAS
was valid. Where causal linkages were not fully specified in the CAS, it is the
evaluator’s task to reconstruct this causal chain from the available evidence and
assess relevance, efficacy, and outcome with reference to the intermediate and
higher-order objectives.

For each of the main objectives, the CPE evaluates the relevance of the objective; the
relevance of the Bank Group’s strategy toward meeting the objective, including the
balance between lending and nonlending instruments; the efficacy with which the
strategy was implemented; and the results achieved. This is done in two steps. The
first is a top-down review of whether the Bank Group’s program achieved a
particular Bank Group objective or planned outcome and had a substantive impact
on the country’s development. The second step is a bottom-up review of the Bank
Group’s products and services (lending, analytical and advisory services, and aid
coordination) used to achieve the objective. Together these two steps test the
consistency of findings from the products and services and the development impact

dimensions. Subsequently, an assessment is made of the relative contribution to the
results achieved by the Bank Group, other development partners, the government
and exogenous factors.

Evaluators also assess the degree of country ownership of international
development priorities, such as the Millennium Development Goals, and Bank
Group corporate advocacy priorities, such as safeguards. Ideally, any differences on
dealing with these issues would be identified and resolved by the CAS, enabling the
evaluator to focus on whether the trade-offs adopted were appropriate. However, in
other instances, the strategy may be found to have glossed over certain conflicts, or
avoided addressing key country development constraints. In either case, the
consequences could include a diminution of program relevance, a loss of country
ownership, and unwelcome side effects such as safeguard violations, all of which
must be taken into account in judging program outcome.


Ratings Scale
IEG utilizes six rating categories for outcome, ranging from highly satisfactory to
highly unsatisfactory:

Highly satisfactory:                 The assistance program achieved at least
                                     acceptable progress toward all major relevant
                                     objectives, and had best practice
                                     development impact on one or more of them.
                                     No major shortcomings were identified.

Satisfactory:                        The assistance program achieved acceptable
                                     progress toward all major relevant objectives.
                                     No best practice achievements or major
                                     shortcomings were identified.

Moderately satisfactory:             The assistance program achieved acceptable
                                     progress toward most of its major relevant
                                     objectives. No major shortcomings were
                                     identified.

Moderately unsatisfactory:           The assistance program did not make
                                     acceptable progress toward most of its major
                                     relevant objectives, or made acceptable
                                     progress on all of them, but either (a) did not

                                         development constraint or (b) produced a
                                         major shortcoming, such as a safeguard
                                         violation.

Unsatisfactory:                          The assistance program did not make
                                         acceptable progress toward most of its major
                                         relevant objectives, and either (a) did not take
                                         into adequate account a key development
                                         constraint or (b) produced a major
                                         shortcoming, such as a safeguard violation.

Highly unsatisfactory:                   The assistance program did not make
                                         acceptable progress toward any of its major
                                         relevant objectives and did not take into
                                         adequate account a key development
                                         constraint, while also producing at least one
                                         major shortcoming, such as a safeguard
                                         violation.

The institutional development impact can be rated at the project level as high,
substantial, modest, or negligible. This measures the extent to which the program
bolstered the country’s ability to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use
of its human, financial, and natural resources. Examples of areas included in judging
the institutional development impact of the program are:

         The soundness of economic management
         The structure of the public sector, and, in particular, the civil service
         The institutional soundness of the financial sector
         The soundness of legal, regulatory, and judicial systems
         The extent of monitoring and evaluation systems
         The effectiveness of aid coordination
         The degree of financial accountability;
         The extent of building capacity in nongovernmental organizations
         The level of social and environmental capital.

IEG is, however, increasingly factoring institutional development impact ratings
into program outcome ratings, rather than rating them separately.

Sustainability can be rated at the project level as highly likely, likely, unlikely, highly
unlikely, or, if available information is insufficient, non-evaluable. Sustainability
measures the resilience to risk of the development benefits of the country program
over time, taking into account eight factors:

                                  GUIDE TO IEG’S COUNTRY PROGRAM EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
      Technical resilience
      Financial resilience (including policies on cost recovery)
      Economic resilience
      Social support (including conditions subject to safeguard policies)
      Environmental resilience
      Ownership by governments and other key stakeholders
      Institutional support (including a supportive legal/regulatory framework,
       and organizational and management effectiveness)
      Resilience to exogenous effects, such as international economic shocks or
       changes in the political and security environments.

At the program level, IEG is increasingly factoring sustainability into program
outcome ratings, rather than rating them separately.

Risk to development outcome. According to the 2006 harmonized guidelines,
sustainability has been replaced with a “risk to development outcome,” defined as
the risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) of a project or program will not be maintained (or realized). The risk to
development outcome can be rated at the project level as high, significant, moderate,
negligible to low, and non-evaluable.
