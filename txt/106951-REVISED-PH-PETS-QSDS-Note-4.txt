Building Better Learning
Environments in the Philippines
Introduction
Evidence from around the world has shown that
improving school infrastructure leads to better
learning outcomes.1 For example, a 2011 review of the
economics literature over the last 20 years showed
that the availability of basic school infrastructure (such
as classrooms, desks, and chairs) and facilities (such
as electricity, libraries, and blackboards) is frequently
associated with better student learning achievement.2
These findings have been backed up by a systematic
review of recent impact evaluations, which showed
that infrastructure investments have a positive impact
on school enrollment rates, attendance rates, and
learning achievement.3 Also, research in the Philippines
has shown that reducing the number of students per
classroom is associated with better student learning
outcomes, particularly in rural schools.4

Ensuring that schools have adequate infrastructure of
good quality is a central pillar of government efforts to
improve education outcomes in the Philippines. Over
the last five years, the government has been conducting
a renewed reform effort to increase access to good
quality basic education. It has supported these reform
efforts with significant increases in public spending on
education. In real terms, school infrastructure spending
in 2015 was five times higher than in 2010 and has
been used to reduce classroom congestion and the
proportion of schools operating multiple shifts.

Box 1: The Philippines Public Education Expenditure Tracking and Quantitative Service Delivery Study


     The aim of the Philippines Public Education Expenditure and Quantitative Service Delivery Study has been to answer four
     main questions on the use of the public education budget:
     1.	 Resource flow, management, and control. What factors prevent resources from reaching their intended destination in a
         timely and transparent manner?
     2.	 Existence, use, and financing of inputs at the school level. Do schools have access to essential inputs and how effective are
         the systems that govern their use?
     3.	 Equity. How do the resources available to schools and the systems that manage these resources differ among regions
         and socioeconomic groups?
     4.	 School performance and resources. How and why does the performance of schools differ and what drives those
         differences?
     The study has tracked over 80 percent of the national government education budget (including teacher salaries and
     training, school maintenance and operating expenses, construction, and learning materials) as well as local government
     spending on basic education.
     In order to assess how funds flow and how they are used at the school level, the study team conducted a nationally
     representative survey of government institutions and public schools in the last quarter of 2014. The Autonomous Region
     in Muslim Mindanao was excluded from the study because government funds for this region are managed separately and
     flow to schools through a different mechanism. In addition, integrated schools (which offer both elementary and high
     school education) and schools that did not have final grade elementary and high school students were excluded from the
     sample, primarily because the study aimed to measure outcomes at the end of elementary school and at the end of high
     school.
     The sample for the survey included all regional offices of the Department of Education (DepEd) and the Department
     of Budget and Management (DBM), 51 division and 113 district offices of DepEd, 54 district engineering offices of
     the Department of Public Works and Highways, 74 provincial and city/municipality local governments, 249 public
     elementary schools, and 200 public high schools. At the school level, interviewers administered a questionnaire to each
     parent-teacher association, assessed the competencies of approximately 1,500 teachers, and interviewed 2,200 student
     households.
     The data collected were used to explore the systems that govern the use of public funds and to assess how the
     availability of resources differed among schools. The study team combined information on the flow of funds to schools
     with information on school characteristics and quality to evaluate how financing and governance affected school
     performance.

Box 2: Responsibilities for Joint DPWH-DepEd Projects


     Each year, DepEd identifies the extent of school infrastructure needs using the Basic Education Information System (BEIS)
     and develops a list of school-level projects to be carried out by the DPWH using the infrastructure budget appropriations
     for the year. Once the DepEd central office has selected the projects, it informs the regional and divisional offices who in
     turn notify the selected schools.
     The Schools Division Superintendent (SDS) and the Schools Division Engineer (SDE) within DepEd Division offices are
     responsible for coordinating with their DPWH counterparts on the procurement and implementation of projects. The
     main stages where coordination occurs are:
     •	 The DPWH prepares the program of works, undertakes procurement, and implements the works in accordance with
        DepEd’s standard designs and specifications.
     •	 The SDS approves the program of works prepared by the DPWH.
     •	 The staff of DepEd’s Physical Facilities and Schools Engineering Division (PFSED) and the Division Physical Facilities
        Coordinator (DPFC) supervise the DPWH’s procurement, monitor the implementation of the projects, and conduct joint
        inspections of the completed works.
     •	 The DPWH, DepEd’s Physical Facilities staff, and the school principals are expected to carry out a joint inspection of the
        completed works.
     •	 The DepEd SDS and the DPWH District Engineer both approve the Certificate of Completion for each completed
        project.

Box 3: Mexico’s Better Schools Program


  The Better Schools Program (BSP) in Mexico was a key component of a broader education reform program aimed
  at improving the quality of basic education. Between 2008 and 2012 the program carried out school infrastructure
  improvement projects in 19,400 of the neediest basic education schools in Mexico.
  The involvement and participation of each school community through its parent association was a major thrust of
  the BSP. A central government body was in charge of making payments to contractors and of overseeing the overall
  implementation of the program, but the schools’ parents associations acted as the legal client and was responsible for:
  •	 Commenting on, making decisions, and supervising the school project
  •	 Contributing to the transparency and presentation of financial accounts
  •	 Verifying that the building materials and improvements were of good quality
  •	 Approving all stages of the planning and implementation of the project.
  After the Ministry of Education made an initial selection of schools in need of urgent repair, technical facilitators worked
  with each school to complete a technical assessment of its requirements that formed the basis of the project. Prospective
  contractors aiming to implement BSP projects were required to go through a rigorous pre-screening exercise, after which an
  approved list of contractors was drawn up and these companies were randomly selected to implement packages of projects.
  A recent assessment of the program noted:
  •	 The process of identifying priority schools and working with the schools’ parents associations to undertake the
     necessary work was efficient and flexible enough to adapt to each school’s circumstances
  •	 The procedure of awarding contracts was relatively quick, and the payments process was transparent. It also ensured
     that contractors had incentives to deliver good quality projects
  •	 Overall, the project was cost-effective in that it reached more schools than was initially intended and used resources
     effectively and in line with the relevant regulations and guidelines.
  The necessary components for the effective participation of local communities in school infrastructure improvement were
  summarized in the assessment report:
      “The BSP has demonstrated how partnerships between the community and government can result in substantial
      benefits to the community and foster trust in the government’s capacity to deliver quality education services. A
      clear decision-making framework, clarity of roles and expectations, and well-defined lines of responsibility have
      contributed to the successful engagement of parents and others in the BSP.”
