   to major environmental challenges through its
   partner agencies.

To fulfill its vision, the GEF must achieve impacts on a
greater scale than is being realized within its existing
portfolio. OPS-5 concluded that only 20 percent of
GEF-funded projects showed evidence of achieving
benefits at a system-wide scale beyond the direct
results of an intervention, although the IEO notes that
larger-scale effects may still happen in the future. 35
Similarly, STAP underscored that the GEF would be
able to achieve transformational outcomes only “by
breaking away from single technology and/or single
sector approaches towards a focus on systemic
approaches.”36 STAP noted the importance of the
GEF’s projects seeking broader outcomes, beyond
single programs; better addressing the key drivers of
environmental degradation and not just the pressure
points; and developing a comprehensive approach
toward scaling up the impact of its investments. 37

                                                 Priorities
                                                 To deliver on the 2020 vision, the GEF will pursue
                                                 five strategic priorities: (a) address the drivers of
                                                 environmental degradation; (b) deliver integrated
                                                 solutions; (c) enhance resilience and adaptation; (d)
                                                 ensure complementarity and synergies, especially in
                                                 climate finance; and (e) focus on choosing the right

                                                 Environmental Degradation
                                                 The GEF can enhance environmental benefits by
                                                 addressing the drivers of environmental degradation.
                                                 Environmental drivers arise from the demand for
                                                 and supply of goods and services, which in turn
                                                 generate environmental pressures that directly
                                                 affect the state of the environment (figure 4.1).
                                                 The framework is useful to illustrate that efforts
                                                 to prevent biodiversity loss, for instance, can
                                                 happen at multiple points in the causal chain. For
                                                 example, rising demand for beef may result in added
                                                 pressure to clear land for pastures, leading to further
                                                 deforestation, soil degradation, and biodiversity
                                                 loss. Focusing more on upstream drivers in this
