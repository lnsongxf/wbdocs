Executive Summary

Context
Governments around the world assign top priority to job creation and productivity growth.
Developing the right skills among potential and actual workers not only makes capital and labor
more productive, it also makes the adoption and invention of new technologies possible. Recent
research also indicates that skill acquisition has a long-lasting impact on the trajectory of a person’s
life and that inequality in skills is associated with inequality in income.

Low-productivity employment is a distinctive challenge for the labor market in Armenia. Many
existing jobs do not pay enough to lift people out of poverty. Nearly 40 percent of workers are
employed in agriculture, while the sector accounts for only 17 percent of GDP (Rutkowski, 2012). This
discrepancy between input and output implies that most agricultural jobs are of low productivity.
The share of the non-agricultural sector has increased by less than one percentage point in the last
five years. The modern, high-productivity sector is small and it is barely expanding.

Moreover, the proportion of non-agricultural low-earning jobs is high in Armenia. Low-earning jobs
are defined as those that earn less than two-thirds of the median wage. By this criterion, one in four
jobs in Armenia falls into this category, which represents a significantly higher share than that in
most European countries, where the incidence of low pay is within the 15-20 percent range. The
significant presence of informality in non-agricultural sectors is another factor that contributes to the
low-productivity and low-earnings employment.

Creating modern and high-earning jobs in the formal sectors can only benefit the economy if these
jobs can be filled quickly by capable Armenian workers. It is therefore important for Armenia’s
workforce to be equipped with the right skills to prepare for new and modern jobs as well as with
skills that can foster entrepreneurship and innovation. In terms of educational attainment, Armenia
stands out in the region with a high tertiary education enrollment— 46 percent in 2012. An important
question then is whether this high educational attainment is translating into skills relevant for the
labor market, and not just producing diplomas (Sondergaard and Murthi, 2012). In fact, despite the
high availability of labor and these high educational levels, Armenia’s employers are struggling to
find the right workers, which seems to point to a problem of skills in the labor force.



                                                      7
To better understand skill shortages in Armenia, this report looks into the current demand for skills
from the labor market, together with the landscape of skills formation and utilization in the country,
using the newly available data from the World Bank’s Skills Toward Employment and Productivity
(STEP) household and employer surveys, which were undertaken in the country between 2012 and
2013. These extensive surveys sampled Armenia’s urban population and firms. Based on these
surveys, this report aims to provide a key diagnosis of skills demand and supply issues in Armenia,
highlighting a few initial steps that need to be taken to build a highly productive Armenian labor
force, one that can contribute to as well as benefit from the accelerated economic growth.


Key findings
The findings in this report are organized to follow the five steps that make up the STEP conceptual
framework, which follows a life-cycle approach to skill acquisition. The STEP conceptual framework
builds on five steps: (i) getting children off to the right start; (ii) ensuring that all students learn; (iii)
building job-relevant skills that employers demand; (iv) encouraging entrepreneurship and
innovation; and (v) matching the supply of skills with employers’ demands. Following are the broad,
key findings from the study, arranged under these same five steps. It should also be noted that the
findings are representative only of Armenia’s urban areas.

Getting children off to the right start. Participation in early childhood education (ECE) programs is
positively correlated with the development of cognitive and socio-emotional skills, and these skills
are associated with better labor market outcomes. Quality early childhood education has been found
by numerous studies to help build the cognitive and socio-emotional skills that are later valuable to
employability, worker productivity, and flexibility in the work environment. In this area, participation
in ECE programs in Armenia has expanded over time, although the trend may be reversing as
younger cohorts report slightly lower participation rates compared to older adults. Moreover, the
analysis shows that early childhood programs are positively associated with having higher socio-
emotional skills and using reading and computer work-skills (both related to better labor market
outcomes). Expanding and improving the quality of ECE programs shows a clear benefit in
potentially increasing cognitive and socio-emotional skills. Given that skills formation is cumulative,
the sooner the foundations are laid for children, the easier and less costly it will be to build on them
at later stages in the life cycle.

Ensuring that all students learn. Although education attainment is high, the relevance and quality of
the education system needs to be strengthened. Building strong educational systems with clear
learning standards, effective teachers, adequate resources, and an appropriate regulatory
environment is key to better workforce development. For more than a generation, Armenia has had
a good track record of high educational attainment—more than half the adult urban population
holds a tertiary degree and more than 85 percent have at least an upper-secondary education.
However, average reading proficiency scores in Armenia are below international standards.
Particularly worrisome are the relatively low reading proficiency scores of tertiary education
graduates, which are not substantially different from those of upper-secondary graduates. Tertiary
education graduates, however, do show higher scores than other adults in the socio-emotional skills,
such as grit and decision-making, two skills that are important to success in entrepreneurship and for
earnings as employees. Overall, there is scope to increase the relevance and quality of education in
order to improve the acquisition of foundational and job-relevant skills for the future workforce.
Moreover, there is also a need to assess the curricula and teaching practices to determine the extent
to which these may be improved to promote socio-emotional skills and, by extension, promote the
skills development that makes individuals more employable.

Building job-relevant skills that employers demand. A stronger emphasis needs to be placed on the
quality of learning, since both education and skills are key drivers of labor market outcomes. Given
both the large quantity of secondary-school graduates in Armenia and the poor match-up of their
skills with employers’ needs, it is vital to know what skills formal education is still failing to prepare
graduates with. This study finds that some of the skills individuals acquire are associated with labor
market outcomes in addition to formal schooling. This may be due to the large share of tertiary
educated workers, so that employers and workers are using skills as a way to differentiate among
workers and job candidates. Moreover, there is a gender gap in labor outcomes that will need to be
addressed with specific efforts to improve women’s skills set. Finally, Armenia’s low rates of
participation in on-the-job training and other forms of formal professional accreditation may be
resulting in a loss of skill acquisition and missed opportunities for updating skills.

Encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation. Although entrepreneurial activities are currently
uncommon in Armenia, there is a window of opportunity to promote job creation and productivity
enhancement in an equitable manner. Entrepreneurial activity may be a valuable option in markets
with low demand for workers and high unemployment, like Armenia today. In addition,


                                                     9
entrepreneurship can help bring new products to the market and foster innovation. Measured as a
percentage of self-employed out of total employment, the rate of entrepreneurship in the country
today is low. Currently, entrepreneurs are most likely to be middle-aged men whose socio-emotional
skill levels are similar to those of wage earners, although they have slightly less education and lower
job-related and cognitive skills than wage workers. This strongly suggests that much of the self-
employment may be driven by the inability to find a job. That being said, it is also clear that
entrepreneurship literally pays off, since entrepreneurs, defined as those individuals who are self-
employed or own a business of any size, have higher average incomes than wage earners. Regarding
innovation, one of the most innovative sectors—high technology—displays an unexpected feature:
the overwhelming majority (70 percent) of employees in this sector are women. Overall, it seems
that the economy may benefit from a future increase in the share of entrepreneurs due to the
benefits entrepreneurship brings to innovation, the country’s large unemployed and inactive
population, and the higher earnings of entrepreneurs when compared with wage workers.

Matching the supply of skills with employers’ demands. The school-to-work transition in Armenia is
rather quick, and most workers seem to have adequate qualifications for the jobs they hold.
Nonetheless, inactivity is high, particularly for women. In most countries, longer school-to-work
transitions are associated with poorer labor market outcomes, and Armenia is not an exception.
Armenia’s labor market seems to absorb new workers rapidly, but it may do so in low-skilled jobs.
For instance, among individuals between ages 25 and 40, 92 percent of those who never passed
beyond a lower-secondary education found a job within 6 months of leaving school, whereas for
those whose education ended with upper secondary, only 62 percent found work that quickly.
Moreover, the analysis found that the first out-of-school job that a worker obtains matters for their
future skill development. Another feature of the labor market is the high level of inactivity—that is,
those neither studying nor looking for work nor being employed— which is most common among
women ages 25 to 40. These women also make up a disproportionate number of those who did not
find a job after searching for more than six months. Finally, the analysis found that about 70 percent
of workers seem to have adequate qualifications for the jobs they have. Overall, in addition to
improvements needed in cognitive, job-related and other skills, as implied by the preceding details,
Armenia will need to make specific efforts to improve women’s situation in order to close the gender
gap in labor force participation.

Future policy and research agenda
Policy options can also be explored following the STEP framework. To further strengthen Armenia’s
early childhood education system, priority should be given to three areas: (i) Access to early
education should be improved for socioeconomically disadvantaged households, for whom the
system is currently out of reach. (This equity concern also justifies further increasing public
investment in service provision). (ii) In addition, the apparent declining trend in recent participation
in early education needs to be further looked into, to discern its patterns and likely causes. Policy
interventions may be needed to reverse this trend. (iii) Although the service quality issue is not
covered by the data, global experience shows that expanding public services on a large scale
sometimes risks lowering the bar for service quality. Ensuring service quality is therefore critical for
the effectiveness of expanded early education programs. Expansion without quality will only lead to
a waste of resources.

Moving forward to improve its education and training system, Armenia will need to set three
priorities:

     (i) Improve learning outcomes and skills formation. Worldwide experience shows that this is not
    an easy task, and results may take years to show. Lessons from other countries also show that
    having a high-quality, effective teaching force is the foremost necessary condition for high-
    quality education. Having a strong quality assurance and accountability system for learning
    results is another important prerequisite.

    (ii) Strengthen tertiary education. This will be necessary because over half of Armenia’s labor
    force comes from tertiary graduates. Both systemic and institutional reforms are needed, giving
    emphasis to building a close link with the labor market need for a skilled and innovative labor
    force – not only as employees, but also as entrepreneurs.

    (iii) Narrow the socioeconomic gaps in learning outcomes and skills. Measures need to be put in
    place targeting those who lag behind in the school system. An effective school system should
    serve as an important channel to narrow the gaps associated with the different family
    backgrounds that students come from.

On top of the foundational skills, it will be necessary to build technical and job-specific skills, based
on a re-thinking of the two important stages of skill formation: (i) Vocational education and training


                                                   11
systems need to be assessed and strengthened. The first challenge is how to improve the
effectiveness of the current preliminary and middle-level vocational schools in their provision of skills
needed. In the longer term, as the demand for high-level skills rises, whether to delay tracking after
12 years of foundational learning can be evaluated and considered. (ii) On-the-job training remains
the most effective way to acquire job-specific skills. To increase the opportunities of on-the-job
training, incentives can be designed to encourage firms’ increased provision of on -the job training to
their employees. The current apprentice programs do not seem to work in equipping trainees with
job-relevant skills, so the programs’ designs should be closely examined before considering
extending their future.

To encourage productive entrepreneurship and innovation, future policy assessment and
consideration can aim at: (i) creating an enabling business environment and improving business
supporting services and risk-management policies and instruments to encourage entrepreneurship
that targets innovative sectors; (ii) re-aligning some of the education and training courses,
particularly at the tertiary level, with the objective of fostering entrepreneurship by equipping
trainees with essential knowledge, skills, and attitudes.

To fully understand labor market mobility and job match, two important questions need to be
examined in future research: (i) What is the job turnover rate in Armenia, both in the present and
expected in the future, and how should the system of adult learning and skills re-training or updating
respond to the need? (ii) What is the status and performance of any public employment services that
exist—if indeed they exist—and how could they function more effectively to foster labor market
mobility? How could they provide real-time labor market information and bridge employers with job-
seekers?

1. About the Report

Skills are at the core of improving individuals’ employment outcomes and increasing countries’
productivity and growth. A labor force with adequate skills is quintessential for enhancing labor and
total factor productivity (TFP), as it enables firms and workers to adapt to rapid technological
change and innovation. This is particularly relevant as today’s developing and emerging countries
seek higher sustained growth rates. In recent decades, scientific development has sped up and new
technologies have become increasingly available and accessible worldwide. In the meantime, the
markets for goods, services, capital, and labor have become increasingly global, creating
opportunities as well as challenges for countries and individuals.

These global trends have given rise to structural changes in the labor market. The demand for and
returns to high-level worker skills have been rising. Cross-country data show a strong positive
correlation between the level of economic development and the intensity of cognitive skills in the
economy (Aedo et al., 2013). In the meantime, there are increasing gaps between the skills of the
labor force and the skills needed by firms. Surveys of businesses often indicate that the skill set of
workers is one of the main bottlenecks. More and more employers demand a sophisticated set of
skills, including behavioral and higher-order cognitive skills, but education and training systems have
yet to be adapted in order to impart these skills.

Earlier boom years in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region already exposed significant
bottlenecks to growth with respect to the skills of the labor force. A shortage of worker skills has
emerged as one of the most important constraints to firm expansion. As shown in Mitra, Selowsky,
and Zalduendo (2010), over the latter half of the first decade in the 2000s there was a substantial
increase in the share of firms reporting that finding workers with adequate skills was a major or very
severe constraint to business growth, and this increase occurred in virtually all ECA countries.

Because the countries of the ECA region are recovering from the recent global recession, they are
facing post-crisis conditions that are also very different from those of preceding years. Financial
resources are more limited and more expensive, and export growth is restrained by potentially
slower growth in destination countries. Restoring and sustaining growth in this context requires
deep reforms that can boost competitiveness and increase labor productivity.

Context and objective

In Armenia, skills development is a priority for a number of reasons: first, for governments and
citizens alike, employment has taken center stage as a high priority in the political and economic
discourse. Second, there is considerable interest in enhancing skills for enhanced productivity and
competitiveness. Not unrelated to this is strong interest in skills to unleash entrepreneurship.

The education systems in Armenia have important advantages, including higher average enrollments
than most countries at comparable levels of development, as well as higher attainment levels. The
country embarked on ambitious reform programs which have yielded some positive results;
however, the educational systems have been slow to adjust to the changing needs of the economy:
The earlier vocational education systems, which had been adequate for providing skills that would
lead directly to employment opportunities in the centrally planned economy, collapsed at the time of
the breakup of the Soviet Union; few vocational and technical education programs have been able to
provide the required skills for the modernizing economies or to ensure the levels of employment
needed.

The scenario in Armenia is no exception to what was analyzed in the recent World Bank ECA regional
report, Skills Not Just Diplomas (Sondergaard and Murthi, 2012). That report uses a range of different
data sources to argue that the skills problem in the ECA region is more closely related to the quality
and relevance of the education provided in ECA countries than to problems of access. A central
argument of the report is that policymakers are constrained in a number of ways from effectively
managing their education and training sectors. The lack of systematic data on key skills-related issues
is one of the impediments to improving quality and relevance. While there are international
assessments that provide information on student competencies up to the age of 15 (usually the end
of lower-secondary education), this is not an age when most people in the region are entering the
job market. Beyond these early-stage assessments, no comprehensive, fully reliable information
exists on individual competencies. What is more, the information on competencies that is available
relates only to fundamental cognitive skills, not the behavioral skills—involving such issues as work
ethic and teamwork—that are emphasized by employers. For policymakers to better understand the
causes of the emerging skills bottleneck and how best to address it, this informational gap needs to
be closed.

In another ECA regional report, Back to Work: Growing with Jobs in Europe and Central Asia (Arias and

                                                  14
Sanchez-Paramo, 2014), the authors use the job lens to examine the extent to which workers in the
region are prepared to take on new job opportunities; they look into the skills gaps that constrain
employment in ECA. They argue that skills gaps hinder the labor performance of both youth and
older workers, to varying degrees across countries. As in more modern economies, jobs in the ECA
region are becoming increasingly intensive in higher-order (new economy) skills—especially in
countries more integrated into external markets and with a more skilled workforce—and economic
developments post-transition may have rendered obsolete the skills of many older workers.

The response from education and training systems has been uneven in the region. Tertiary schooling
has expanded fast among youth—delivering diplomas, though with varying quality and relevance.
Meanwhile, the legacy of early tracking into technical and vocational education and training (TVET)
and labor training with loose market links limits the needed skills upgrading among adults and older
workers. As a result, youth and older workers are affected by skills gaps in distinctive ways. Youth do
better in acquiring skills, but many often acquire the wrong set (both generic and technical). Many
older workers educated for centrally planned economies are at risk of skills obsolescence, which
hinders their capacity to tap into new employment opportunities. And in some fast-aging countries,
the emigration of better educated youth compounds skills constraints. In a nutshell, throughout the
ECA region reforms and policies aiming at strengthening the system of building skills for the
workplace should prioritize the development of a strong foundation of generic skills, ensure quality
and relevance in expanding tertiary education systems, and make the training system market
responsive and age sensitive to enable lifelong skills acquisition.

This new report on skills development in Armenia builds on these two recent World Bank regional
reports, adding country-specific analysis enriched by the latest employer and household surveys.
The objective of this report is to build a country-specific knowledge base and provide a solid platform
for Armenia to explore policy reforms in skills development.

With a focus on skills formation, the new information from the survey data sets enables this report
to answer some important questions on how to build relevant skills in today’s Armenia. The report
presents findings on the overall trends on educational attainment, skills use, and labor market
outcomes. While labor force surveys monitor standard indicators of educational attainment,
employment and unemployment, occupation and industry, earnings, and hours worked to track
short- and long-term labor market conditions, the new survey data sets underlining this report fill
some important information gaps. These include: what types of skills are actually required by

                                                   15
current or future jobs; why a particular level of education might be needed for certain kinds of jobs;
how education and skills are relate to the technological content of certain jobs; and even what level
of education and skills are needed for these jobs. The new survey data also measure mismatches
between skill stocks and job skill requirements or the degree to which the skills of workers and jobs
are meeting national goals.

In addition, the information collected covers both cognitive and socio-emotional skills and personal
characteristics. With a growing body of research that has been documenting the importance of these
skills in determining labor market performance (Cawley, Heckman and Vytlacil, 2001; Jacob, 2002;
Behrman et al., 2006; Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua, 2006; Borghans, Meijers, and Ter Weel, 2008;
Hanushek and Woessmann, 2008), introducing the multi-dimensional measurement of skills has
become critical to understanding the complexity of skills formation and utilization.

The information presented in this report is not meant to be exhaustive or definitive. Most of the
findings reflect suggestive correlations, but not causalities. Nonetheless, these exploratory findings
identify areas of high policy relevance and pave the ground for further policy research on skills,
employment, productivity, and earnings.

Conceptual framework and research questions

Skill formation can be considered as a continuum over the life cycle of an individual, with key stages
for the development of both cognitive and socio-emotional skills. Cunha et al., (2006) find evidence
that there are sensitive and critical periods for inputs in the acquisition of cognitive skills and non-
cognitive skills. For example, their findings suggest that parental inputs are particularly critical for
cognitive skill formation during a child’s early years (preschool and early primary grades).1 Non-
cognitive skills appear to be more malleable throughout the life cycle; however, early interventions
appear to have large positive effects. For example the Perry Preschool program in the United States,
which focused on early childhood development, was found to have large positive effects on non-
cognitive skills (Heckman et al., 2010). These findings have important implications for the design of
effective policies and the delivery of time-sensitive programs.

 The evidence from several studies surveyed in Cunha et al., (2006) shows that IQ is relatively stable after age eight,
which implies that early childhood is the key period for the development of cognitive skills.

Figure 1.1. Skills Toward Employment and Productivity (STEP) framework




Source: World Bank, Stepping up Skills for More Jobs and Higher Productivity (2010b).



This report follows the five steps included in the STEP conceptual framework (World Bank, 2010b),
which follows a life cycle approach. The STEP framework brings together research-based evidence
and practical experience from diverse areas—from research on the determinants of early childhood
development and learning outcomes to policy experience in the reforming of vocational and
technical education systems and labor markets. It also provides a set of powerful messages for
policymakers, researchers, and practitioners.

The five steps from the framework may be summarized as follows (Figure 1.1).

Step 1. Getting children off to the right start—by developing the technical, cognitive, and behavioral
skills conducive to high productivity and flexibility in the work environment through early childhood
education (ECE), with an emphasis on nutrition, stimulation, and basic cognitive skills. Research
shows that handicaps developed early in life are difficult if not impossible to remedy later and that
effective ECE programs can have a very high payoff. The key questions to consider in this step
include these:
       What is the status of ECE in terms of access and quality?
       Are the current ECE programs effective in early skills development?
       Are there life-long benefits of ECE?
       What can be done to further improve ECE for effective and equitable skills development?


                                                            17
Step 2. Ensuring that all students learn—by building stronger education systems with clear learning
standards, good teachers, adequate resources, and a proper regulatory environment. Lessons from
research and on-the-ground experience indicate that the key decisions about education systems are
how much autonomy to allow and to whom, how much accountability to expect from whom and for
what, and how to assess performance and results. The key questions to consider in this step include
these:
        Is the current education system delivering high-quality and job-relevant skills?
        How do family socioeconomic factors affect the educational attainment and skills
         development of school-age children?
        How can the current education system be strengthened to deliver better and more equitable
         learning outcomes?

Step 3. Building job-relevant skills that employers’ demand—by developing the right incentive
framework for both pre-employment and on-the-job training programs and institutions (including
higher education). A growing body of experience is showing how public and private efforts can be
combined to achieve more relevant and responsive training systems. The key questions to consider
in this step include these:
        To what extent do skills shortages or mismatches explain unemployment?
        Is the current pre-employment TVET system effective?
        How can pre-employment TVET and on-the-job training be more effective in delivering job-
         relevant skills?

Step 4. Encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation—by creating an environment that encourages
investment in knowledge and creativity. Emerging evidence shows that this requires innovation-
specific skills (which can be developed starting early in life) and investments to connect people with
ideas (such as through collaborations between universities and private companies) as well as risk-
management tools that facilitate innovation. The key questions to consider in this step include these:
        What are the skill sets possessed by the current entrepreneurs?
        How do skill sets differ between entrepreneurs and wage earners?
        What are the skills gaps for innovation and knowledge powered growth?

Step 5. Matching the supply of skills with employers’ demands—by moving toward more flexible,
efficient, and secure labor markets. Avoiding rigid job protection regulations while strengthening


                                                    18
income protection systems, supplemented by efforts to provide information and intermediation
services to workers and firms, make up the final complementary step that enables skills to be
transformed into actual employment and productivity. The key questions to consider in this step
include these:
       Are there clear market signals of demand for skills?
       What are the symptoms of supply-demand mismatch?
       What are the key regulatory barriers for job market entry and mobility?
       How can labor market information and intermediation services function better?

Data, type and definition of skills measured, and methodology

Data

The report draws its evidence mainly from the STEP surveys, which include both a household-based
survey and an employer survey. The household survey has three unique modules that cover the skills
mentioned above: (i) a direct assessment of reading proficiency and related competencies scored on
the same scale as the OECD’s PIAAC (Programme for International                    Assessment of Adult
Competencies) assessment; (ii) a battery of self-reported information on personality, behavior, and
preferences (e.g., Big Five, GRIT, decision-making, and hostility bias); and (iii) a series of questions on
the task-specific skills that the respondent possesses or uses in his or her job. The employer survey
gathers information on job skill requirements using questions parallel to those in the household
survey, a feature that facilitates analysis of skill gaps and mismatches. The employer survey also has
information on practices relating to (i) hiring and compensation, (ii) training, and (iii) enterprise
productivity.

Additionally, the following sources of information were included to situate and contextualize
findings: (i) the World Bank’s Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) country
reports on Workforce Development (WfD) and Early Childhood Development (ECD) systems in
Armenia; (ii) Armenia’s Integrated Living Conditions surveys; (iii) UNESCO’s World Data on Education;
(iv) OECD’s Programme for International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC); and (v) the
Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).

Type and definition of skills measured



                                                    19
1.1     The STEP survey measures three broad categories of skills: cognitive skills, socio-emotional
job-relevant skills (Pierre et al., 2014). Within each of these categories are more specific skills that can
each be measured, either by direct measurement or by self-reporting. All the skills are listed in




                                                    20
Table 1.1 below.

Cognitive skills are defined as the “ability to understand complex ideas, to adapt effectively to the
environment, to learn from experience, to engage in various forms of reasoning, to overcome
obstacles by taking thought.”(Neisser et al. 2006). Literacy, numeracy, and the ability to solve
abstract problems are all cognitive skills. The STEP survey provides a direct measurement of reading
proficiency and an indirect measurement of reading, writing, and mathematics skills.

The direct measurement of cognitive skills entails the assessment of reading proficiency through the
reading literacy assessment designed by the Educational Testing Services (ETS). Cognitive reading
assessment results are scored on the same scale as the test in the OECD’s PIAAC.

The reading literacy assessment has three parts. The first part (Section A) evaluates foundational
reading skills, including word meaning, sentence processing and passage comprehension. The
second part (Section B) consists of a core literacy assessment that is intended as a filter to sort the
least literate adults from those with higher reading skill levels. The core has a total of eight items.
Respondents with three or more correct responses are regarded as having met a minimum reading
literacy threshold. The third part (Exercise booklets) is only administered to respondents having
passed the core assessment. The booklets use a variety of materials, focusing on non-school-based
items that are encountered in daily life and involve different types of tasks, including tasks that
require respondents to access and identify information (in both text-based and non-prose materials
such as tables, graphs and forms), to integrate and interpret information, and to evaluate
information by assessing the relevance, credibility, or appropriateness of the material for a particular
task. Items present varying levels of difficulty, with tasks ranging from locating a single piece of
information in a very short advertisement to summarizing reasons for using generic drugs as
presented in a newspaper article. Overall reading proficiency scores are reported on a scale ranging
from 0 to 500, which is divided into 5 levels, with Level 1 characterized by the least demanding tasks
and Level 5 by the most demanding. For each respondent, 10 plausible values were generated.

The indirect measures of cognitive skills include self-reported information on respondents’ use of
cognitive skills in daily life and at work, namely if they read, write, or use mathematics, as well as the
intensity of use, which in most instances is a proxy for complexity. For each of these cognitive skills,
a score ranging from 0 to 3 is computed. When a respondent reports not using a given skill, the score
is set at 0. For respondents who do use a given skill, intensity or complexity of use is defined (1 for
low, 2 for medium, and 3 for high).

Socio-emotional skills, sometimes referred to in the literature as non-cognitive skills or behavior skills,
relate to traits covering multiple domains (such as social, emotional, personality, behavioral, and
attitudinal). The survey builds on the “Big Five” personality traits: openness, conscientiousness,
extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (or its opposite, emotional stability). Measures of grit,
which has been shown to have an impact on life outcomes, and hostile attribution bias are also
included, as well as questions pertaining to how individuals make important decisions. Response
categories range from 1 (“almost never”) to 4 (“almost always”).




                                                        22
Job-relevant skills are task-related and build on a combination of cognitive and socio-emotional skills.
The STEP survey asks respondents about their use of such skills on the job, including, among others,
computer use, repair and maintenance of electronic equipment, operation of heavy machinery, client
contact, solving and learning, and supervision. For each skill, a score ranging from 0 to 3 is
computed. When a respondent reports not using a given skill, the score is set at 0. For respondents
who do use a given skill, intensity or complexity of use is defined (1 for low, 2 for medium, and 3 for
high). The survey also includes self-reported information about the educational attainment required
to do one’s job and the time required to learn how to do one’s job; these responses contribute to our
understanding of what the education system is currently producing, what the current positions seem
to demand, and how well they match.

This report uses several other concepts which it is important to clarify here. First, it uses the term
ECE to refer to participation in any form of pre-school education; participation does not necessarily
mean actual enrollment rates, nor is anything implied about the quality of such education. Second,
the socioeconomic status at age 15 is a self-reported variable, for which the survey asks each individual
to rank his or her household’s economic well-being when he or she was age 15, using a score from 1
to 10. Third, the current wealth index is estimated using factor analysis on several non-income related
assets and dwelling characteristics. Fourth, entrepreneurs are defined as all those who reported
being self-employed, with or without employees; hence the report uses the terms entrepreneur and
self-employed interchangeably. Lastly, in categorizing commercial sectors this report includes
medium-high-innovation manufacturing and knowledge-intensive services under high innovation
sectors and medium-low-innovation manufacturing and less knowledge-intensive services under low
innovation sectors. The agricultural and construction sectors are classified as low innovation sectors.

Methodology and limitations

This report relies on a combination of three type of analysis: descriptive analyses, simple probability
models, and earnings regressions. All of these are used throughout the report with different levels of
intensity, and all the estimates reported are statistically significant unless noted to the contrary. The
estimation is carried out with sample weighting, and the results are representative for the urban
population in Armenia.

The descriptive analyses present variable distributions and a range of cross-tabulations. For example,
they include distributions of use and intensity of skills, and the scores of reading proficiency, which


                                                   23
are further cross-tabulated by gender, age cohort, and socioeconomic status. This type of analysis
also includes illustrations of an individual’s skill profiles by: (i) socioeconomic status at age 15 and
current household wealth index, and (ii) current education and education required for the job.

The probability models are used to estimate the effects of participation in education and
socioeconomic status on the acquisition of education and skills, and to model the effects of skills and
education on employment participation. They control for different characteristics such as age,
gender, mother’s and father’s education, own education, socioeconomic status at age 15, number of
household shocks experienced by age 12, and in some cases for cognitive, socio-emotional and job
relevant skills.

The earnings regressions follow Bowles, Gintis and Osborne (2001) and Weinberger (2013) in order to
estimate the returns to earnings and analyze how different skill sets contribute in conjunction with
education. The objective of following these authors is to shed light on skills that are rewarded in the
labor market but are not captured by the usual measures of educational attainment and to motivate
the discussion of complementarity between cognitive and social skills. We acknowledge the
limitations that this estimation procedure may have in terms of multi-collinearities, biases, and/or
weak instruments. However, this is a first step towards exploring these issues in greater depth.

2. Labor Market and Demand for Skills in Armenia

Unemployment and low productivity employment

Although economic growth has started to improve in Armenia, a critical issue is that key labor market
indicators still need to catch up. At 63 percent, Armenia has a labor force participation rate
comparable to those of its neighbors—Georgia and Azerbaijan. Nonetheless, it still lags behind on
some key indicators, such as unemployment. The unemployment rate in Armenia today is still quite
high, even though it has come down from the recent peak of nearly 30 percent in 2008 (Table 2.1 and
Table 2.2).

Low-productivity employment is a distinctive challenge for the labor market in Armenia. Many
existing jobs do not pay enough to lift people out of poverty. Nearly 40 percent of workers are
employed in agriculture, while agriculture accounts for only 17 percent of GDP (Rutkowski 2012). This
discrepancy between input and output implies that most agricultural jobs are of low productivity.
The share of the non-agricultural sector in overall GDP has increased by less than one percentage
point in the last five years. In the meantime, the modern, high-productivity sector is small, and it is
only barely expanding.

Informality is another correlate of low-productivity employment. According to official data from
Armstat (the National Statistical Service of the republic of Armenia), informal employment
accounted for nearly 20 percent of total non-agricultural employment (ADB and NSS 2011). However,

                                                          25
the estimates of the size of the informal sector are sensitive to the criteria used to identify informal
employment. The criterion used by Armstat is the lack of a written employment contract. If one
instead uses eligibility for statutory annual and sick leave as the criterion, informal employment
represents as much as 43 percent of total non-agricultural employment in Armenia. On average,
informal jobs pay less than formal jobs. The difference is small in the case of wage earners (4
percent), but it is large in the case of the self-employed: those with registered businesses earn over
90 percent more than those with unregistered ones.

Moreover, non-agricultural low-earning jobs make up a high proportion of all jobs. Low-earning jobs
are defined as those that earn less than two-thirds of the median wage. By this criterion, one in four
jobs in Armenia is low-paid, which is significantly more than in most European countries, where the
incidence of low pay is within the 15-20 percent range. Productivity gains have the biggest impact on
poverty when achieved through the reallocation of labor from less to more productive uses. Such
reallocation, associated closely with industrial restructuring, requires—first and foremost—a
favorable investment climate.

Creating modern and high-earning jobs in formal sectors can only benefit the economy if these jobs
can be filled quickly by capable Armenian workers. It is therefore important for Armenia’s workforce
to be equipped with the right skills to prepare for new and modern jobs as well as with skills that can
foster entrepreneurship and innovation. In terms of educational attainment, Armenia stands out in
the region with a high tertiary education enrollment of 46 percent in 2012. An important question
then is whether this high educational attainment is translating into skills relevant for the labor
market, as opposed to just diplomas (Sondergaard and Murthi, 2012). In fact, despite the high
availability of labor and these high educational levels, Armenia’s employers are struggli ng to find the
right workers, which seems to point to a problem of skills in the labor force.


Skills in demand

The skills gap is indeed significant in Armenia today. The STEP Employer Survey examines a range of
issues in the demand for skills in Armenia’s labor market. The survey looks particularly closely into
the various types of skills—cognitive skills, job-related skills, as well as socio-emotional skills—and
their relevance to the labor market.

Employers among firms in the survey are demanding a wide range of types of workers with varying


                                                  26
levels of skills. Over 40 percent of new hires are highly skilled white collar workers, followed by crafts
and related workers (blue collar), who make up over 30 percent of the distribution. Employers are
also planning to increase their employment mainly in blue collar occupations. Over 12 percent of the
firms answered that they were planning to hire operators and craft workers over the next 12 months,
while only less than 4 percent were planning to hire highly skilled white-collar workers (Figure 2.1).

However, employers are finding difficulty filling job vacancies, and they point to the lack of required
skills as the predominant reason. The evidence suggests that around 90 percent of the firms have
problems when hiring either highly skilled white-collar workers or low-skilled white-collar or craft and
related workers (Figure 2.2). Employers also pointed out that it is not only the lack of technical skills
that is hampering filling their vacancies, but also a lack of socio-emotional skills.

Not surprisingly, Armenian employers are critical of the quality of the skills possessed by the current
workforce. Modern employers (firms that have international business contacts or have introduced
new technology) are more likely than traditional employers to see the education of the labor force as
a major problem. Generally, all employers are critical of the quality of education. More particularly,
firms are even more critical of vocational education than of general education. Roughly two out of
three employers stated that technical and vocational education does not meet their skill needs.
These responses show that there is a disconnect between education and the skills needed at the
workplace (Figure 2.3).

Most firms look for job-related skills, particularly technical skills for both white-collar and blue-collar
workers. Employers were asked what type of skills are the most important ones when deciding to
retain an employee. Among employers, the most important skills cited are cognitive and job-related
skills. Socio-emotional skills are important too, but much less so than job-related skills. The least
important factor, from the employers’ viewpoint, is personal characteristics (such as gender, age,
appearance, etc.), although those factors can influence hiring decisions in some situations (Figure
2.4). This view applied equally among employers regarding both white- and blue-collar workers and
for small, medium, and large firms. Employers also reported that job-specific skills are somewhat
more important for type A workers (highly skilled/white-collar workers) to have than type B workers
(less skilled/blue-collar workers), whereas socio-emotional skills and personal characteristics are
more important for type B workers who interact directly with customers than for type A ones. It
appears from this that white-collar workers might be hired specifically for their technical skills, while
blue-collar workers are expected to use their socio-emotional skills much more. Socio-emotional
skills and personal characteristics cannot be taught in a training session the way job-specific skills
can.

Among job-related skills, cognitive and technical skills are the most valued skills for white- and blue-
collar workers. Employers highly value numeracy, literacy, teamwork skills, and problem-solving skills
among white-collar workers; while for blue-collar positions they are more concerned with skills in
communication, teamwork, ability to work independently, and time management (Figure 2.5). This


                                                                29
seems to suggest that workers in Armenia need both cognitive and socio-emotional skills, but that
highly skilled jobs require workers with adequate cognitive skills.

Among socio-emotional skills, conscientiousness is the skill employers’ value most for both white-
and blue-collar workers. Conscientiousness includes elements of responsibility, self-discipline,
carefulness, and motivation. This skill has come up as a desirable skill among many employers in
countries including Macedonia, Poland, Russia, and the United Kingdom (World Bank, 2013a, p. 63).
This suggests that workers who are hard-working and do a thorough job are more likely to be hired
than workers who do not. For white-collar workers the second most desirable personality trait is
openness to experience, followed by emotional stability, while for blue-collar workers the second
most desirable characteristic after conscientiousness is emotional stability, followed by
agreeableness and extraversion.

Overall, there is clear indication from the feedback of Armenian employers that the demand for
highly-skilled workers is already significant for both white- and blue-collar occupations. However,
the graduates today do not seem to be equipped with adequate skills. The highly desired skills
include cognitive and job-related skills, followed by socio-emotional skills or character and behavioral
skills. Addressing the skills challenge and narrowing the skills gap will require a fundamental
understanding of the existing systems of skills formation and utilization, together with returns to
skills and related market mechanisms and signals for the acquisition of the right type of skills. The

3. Step 1 | Getting Children Off to the Right Start in Armenia

Skills developed in early childhood—from birth to entry into primary school—form the basis of
future learning and labor market successes. This section reviews trends in participation in early
childhood education (ECE) programs across the age cohorts of the adult Armenian population. It
analyzes the relationships between participation in ECE and use of foundational and job-relevant
skills, including computer and solving and learning skills.

This section focuses on the following two questions: (i) Has participation in ECE2 programs gained
ground overtime? and (ii) Is participation in ECE paying off? To answer these questions, this section
uses a combination of descriptive analyses and simple probability models to estimate the effect of
participation in ECE.3 The results presented here are statistically significant, after controlling for
gender, educational attainment, mother’s education, father’s education, number of household
shocks experienced by age 12, household socioeconomic status at age 15, and indicator variables for
age groups. It is important to stress that the survey provides a cross-sectional picture of the
population at a given point in time. As such, it is not possible to observe age cohort trajectories over
time or to move beyond establishing correlations.

Has participation in early childhood education programs gained ground over
time?

More adults have participated in ECE programs over time in Armenia. Almost 60 percent of adults
ages 15 to 64 reported having participated in some form of organized early childhood education
program (e.g., kindergarten, crèche, daycare, nursery school, etc.) before entering first grade.
Although there are no significant differences in participation between men and women, there are
significant differences across age cohorts. Participation peaked at 78 percent for the 25-to-34 age
cohort compared to about 35 percent for the 55-to-65 age cohort. It is of concern, however, that the
upward trend has reversed recently, reaching only 65 percent of the 15 to 24 age cohort (Figure 3.1).

Figure 3.1. Participation in ECE by gender and age cohort

  Participation in ECE is measured broadly (e.g., it includes kindergarten, crèche, daycare, nursery school before entering
first grade); hence it is different from gross or net enrollment in preschool education.

  The questionnaire does not capture the length or intensity of early education services, making it difficult to estimate
quality.

Participation in ECE programs is correlated with household socio- economic status4. About 60
percent of adults who lived in high socioeconomic status households at age 15 participated in early
education compared to 50 percent of adults living in low socioeconomic status households (Figure
3.2).

 For constructing past socioeconomic status of the household, the STEP surveys asked individuals to rank their household’s
socioeconomic status when they were 15 years old from 1 to 10. Similarly to construct a wealth index for the household at
the time of the survey was administered, the survey included information from different types of assets and dwelling
characteristics which was compiled into an index using factor analysis methods. Robustness checks rendered the variables
reliable.

Is participation in early childhood education paying off?

Adults who participated in ECE programs are more likely than other adults to score higher in socio-
emotional skills. Participation in early education programs is associated with a higher probability of
scoring higher on extraversion, conscientiousness and grit. For example, adults who participate in ECE
are more likely to get a higher grit score (3.16) compared to adults who did not participate and
whose grit scores are likely to be lower (3.11) (Figure 3.3). The differences are statistically significant
after controlling for gender, educational attainment, mother’s education, father’s education,
number of household shocks experienced by age 12, household socioeconomic status at age 15, and
indicator variables for age groups.

This finding in Armenia is consistent with the international literature. These traits—in addition to
others—are associated with “character skills” that matter for a range of outcomes in life, including
employability and labor market outcomes (Heckman and Kautz, 2013). The finding is also consistent
with research from Duckworth et al. (2007) which indicates that grit—broadly defined as
perseverance and passion for long-term goals—is a trait capable of predicting long-term success.
According to Duckworth’s research, individuals who score high on grit tend to work tirelessly
through challenges, failures, and adversity to achieve goals, making them more likely to achieve their
goals when compared to individuals who lack similar stamina.

Similarly, conscientiousness is defined as being thorough, careful, efficient and organized.
Conscientious people have a tendency to show self-discipline, act dutifully, and aim for achievement;
and they display planned rather than spontaneous behavior (Costa and McCrae, 1992; Goldberg,
1992). Prevo and ter Weel (2003) applied measures of conscientiousness at age 16 to explain adult
wages and other outcomes, including crime, health and savings behavior. Their estimates suggest a
significant and sizeable correlation between early conscientiousness and adult outcomes. Goodstein
and Lanyon’s (1999) systematic review of the literature indicates that the Big Five factors of
personality can predict job performance and may be used for staffing selection. Barrick and Mount’s
(1991) analyses show conscientiousness as having a consistent relationship with all the job
performance criteria they evaluated (job proficiency, training proficiency, and personnel data) for all
occupational groups studied (professionals, police, managers, sales, and skilled/semi-skilled).

Adults who participated in ECE programs are also more likely to use their reading skills regularly.
Adults who participated in ECE programs tend to use their reading skills more often and with higher
intensity (i.e., read longer documents) compared to those who did not participate in early education
(Figure 3.4).

ECE participants also have a higher probability of using computers at work. Adults who participated
in ECE programs have a higher probability of using their computer skills at work and of using them
with higher intensity (every day). Fifty-four percent of adults who participated in early education
programs reported using computer skills at high intensity, compared to 50 percent of adults who did
not participate (Figure 3.5). Although the differences are small in magnitude, they are statistically
significant.

These findings reaffirm the potential payoffs of expanding ECE programs in Armenia, something that
has already been identified by the Government of Armenia and the World Bank as one of the top
priorities in the education sector. The recent Education Improvement project (EIP) (Box 3.1)—partly
financed by the World Bank—provides increased funding support to the ECE programs in the
country and aims to improve school readiness in young children, including the development of
cognitive and socio-emotional skills.

Box 3.1. Investing in early childhood education and development in Armenia


 The newly approved Education Improvement Project (World Bank, 2014c) supports government efforts to
 promote children’s school readiness. The project finances interventions to increase access, enrollment, and
 quality of preschool education services in Armenia. Approximately 2,400 five- and six-year-old children from
 vulnerable households are expected to benefit from the project every year. Ultimately, the project seeks to
 increase enrollment from the current 75 percent to 90 percent by 2017.

 The project is in line with research by economist James Heckman, a Nobel laureate. Heckman has praised
 early investment in disadvantaged children as “a rare public policy with no equity-efficiency tradeoff”
 because it promotes social justice and fairness by reducing inequality and at the same time raising society’s
 productivity. Both medical and economics literatures agree that gaps in cognitive and non-cognitive skills
 emerge early in life and persist over the life cycle. Policies to mitigate these gaps later in life have proven to
 be less cost-effective.

Highlights of findings


   Early childhood education programs in Armenia have expanded over time, although the trend
    may have begun reversing recently.

   Participation in early childhood education programs in Armenia is positively associated with
    higher socio-emotional scores and with higher reading and computer skills at work—and both
    skill sets are linked to better labor market outcomes.

   Early childhood education programs in Armenia are more readily available to individuals living in
    households with a high socioeconomic status compared to individuals from low-income
    households. Narrowing the gap will be essential to ensuring equitable opportunities for skills
    development.

4. Step 2 ǀ Ensuring that All Students Learn in Armenia

Schools are expected to teach basic competencies that enable students to acquire the skills they will
need to make informed life choices and that will later be valued by employers and useful for self-
employment. These competencies include cognitive skills such as reading, writing, and numeracy;
socio-emotional skills, including the Big Five personality traits—openness, emotional stability,
conscientiousness, agreeableness and neuroticism; and job-relevant skills, such as techniques in
information technology, communications, problem-solving, and teamwork.

This section provides insights on trends in educational attainment, the use of foundational skills
(reading, writing, and numeracy), and the current level of reading proficiency in the Armenian adult
population using a reading assessment module developed to capture reading ability. It also explores
the roles played by past socioeconomic status, current household wealth status, and parental
background in influencing the use of foundational and job-relevant skills.

The section addresses the following questions: (i) Is educational attainment translating into high-
quality and job-relevant skills? (ii) What is the role of past socioeconomic status on education
attainment and skill acquisition? (iii) Do early skills gaps translate into current skills gaps? and (iv)
How do parental education and household resilience to shocks affect skills outcomes?

To answer these questions, this section uses descriptive analyses and estimates simple probability
models to determine the effect of socio-emotional skills on educational attainment, use of job-
relevant skills, and gaps in skills acquisition. These analyses further take into consideration past
household socioeconomic status and current household wealth index. The results presented here
are statistically significant, after controlling for gender, mother’s education, father’s education,
number of household shocks experienced by age 12, and indicator variables for age groups.

Is educational attainment translating into high quality and job-relevant skills?

Armenia has a highly educated population. More than half of all adults hold a tertiary education -
degree. Over 85 percent of adults have completed at least senior upper-secondary education, and
about 60 percent hold a tertiary education degree. The high level of educational attainment had
already been achieved over a generation ago and has remained stable since—as illustrated by the



                                                   38
relatively high percentage of tertiary graduates in several consecutive age cohorts. Few differences
exist between women and men, although women make up a slightly higher proportion of individuals
with tertiary education degrees (Figure 4.1).

Educational attainment is correlated with the use of foundational and job-relevant skills and with the
use of these skills at a higher intensity level. Adults who have completed tertiary education are more
likely to use reading, computer, and problem-solving and learning skills regularly than adults who
have only completed upper secondary education. While the use of numeracy is nearly universal
across educational attainment, it is important to highlight that a sizable proportion of adults—
ranging from 31 to 45 percent—do not use reading, computer, or problem-solving and learning skills
regularly. Tertiary education graduates are more likely to use reading and computer skills at medium
or high intensity, that is, every day (Figure 4.2).

Box 4.1. The education system in Armenia


 The formal education system in Armenia follows a 4-8-4 structure. Basic education comprises four years of
 primary schooling. Eight years of secondary education follows, consisting of five years of lower secondary
 and three years of either upper secondary education (high school) or primary vocational (craftsmanship)
 education. Post-secondary education for a bachelor’s degree is normally four years. (See figure below.)
 Education is free and compulsory until the age of 16. After the country’s independence from the Soviet
 Union, the main language of instruction became Armenian, and the curriculum changed as well. Literacy
 rates in Armenia have remained high since independence —nearly 99 percent.

 Enrollment rates at primary and secondary levels of education have generally increased but are far from
 universal. The adjusted net enrollment rate, which includes all students who are enrolled in primary and
 secondary school, was 92.9 percent in 2007, which is an increase from 81.6 percent in 2004. The net
 secondary enrollment rate was 83 percent in 2012, which is a drop from its peak during 2000 –12 at 90
 percent in 2007 (UIS, 2014). The gross enrollment ratio for tertiary increased from 35 percent in 2000 to 51
 percent in 2011, although the ratio dropped drastically to 46 percent in 2012 (World Bank EdStats, 2014).

 The transition period may have harmed the education system, partly due to a reduction of public spending
 in education. National government investments in education are low. In 2012, public expenditure on
 education was 3.3 percent of GDP, lower than the OECD-recommended 5 percent of GDP, and it made up 14
 percent of total government expenditure (UIS, 2014).




                                                      41
Young adults are the persons most likely to use reading and computer skills, and they tend to use
them more intensively. The use of these two skills is positively associated with decreasing age—
young adults (in the 15 to 24 age cohort) report the highest use of skills. For other job-related skills
such as problem solving and learning at work, adults between age 25 and 34 report the highest use.
This finding is likely related to the fact that older adults are more likely to be employed and tap into
their accumulated experience to solve problems. Over half of adults between age 15 and 24 use
reading skills at the high-intensity level, compared to one-third of adults age 25 or above. The pattern
is the same when it comes to computer skills, with the youngest cohorts using computer skills twice
as intensively as the oldest cohort (Figure 4.3).

The STEP household survey administered a reading assessment instrument to evaluate adults ’
reading proficiency in depth. The assessment instrument uses a variety of materials, focusing on non-
school- based items encountered in daily life. Reading proficiency is grouped into five levels: levels
0/1 to level 5. This five-level reading competency scale is consistent with international benchmarks of
reading proficiency (OECD, 2013).

An advantage of the five-level scale is that it also provides an assessment of what an individual at
each level is capable of in terms of reading proficiency (see Technical Annex 2). For example, adults
scoring below level 1 perform at a very basic level and are not required to understand the structure
of sentences or paragraphs or make use of other text features. In contrast, adults scoring at level 5
are able to search and integrate information across multiple, dense texts, construct syntheses of

similar and contrasting ideas, or evaluate evidence-based arguments.

Adults in urban areas in Armenia score lower on average than adults in OECD countries as a whole.
Looking at the distribution of reading proficiency, almost 65 percent of adults in urban Armenia are
clustered in levels 2 or below, compared to 38 percent in high-performing countries such as Finland
(Figure 4.5).

The widest gap between urban Armenia and the national OECD average is by educational
attainment, especially at the upper secondary level (a −14 point difference in test scores) and tertiary
level (a −31 point difference). The only exception is for adults with primary or less than primary
education in Armenia, whose score is 29 percentage points higher than the OECD national average
for adults with the same level of education (Figure 4.5).

Note: PIAAC scores for OECD countries are representative of national populations of adults aged 15-65.


Adults with more education and from younger cohorts score higher in reading proficiency. In
Armenia, about 12 percent of adults score at level 1 or below, 53 percent score at level 2 and 33
percent score at level 3. Only 2 percent of adults score beyond level 3. While tertiary graduates
outperform all other groups, their average scores are still clustered in levels 2 and 3. Only 3 percent
score at levels 4 and above compared to 24 percent for the OECD national averages.

It should be noted the STEP data provides a snapshot in a particular point in time. As such,
differences in reading proficiency across age cohorts may be linked to a range of factors, including
decline in skills, less schooling or differences in content of schooling across older groups. This issue
may be explored in greater depth by looking at cohort analyses.

Socio-emotional skills such as conscientiousness are positively associated with reading proficiency.
Adults who score high in conscientiousness have a higher probability than other adults of scoring at
the highest levels of reading proficiency—levels 3 to 5 (Figure 4.7). The results are statistically
significant when controlled for education, gender, current household wealth, mother education,
number of household shocks experienced by age 12, socioeconomic status at age 15, other socio-
emotional skills, type of school, and school proximity.

Educational attainment is associated with higher scores in socio-emotional skills such as grit and
decision-making. The probability of scoring higher in grit and decision-making increases with
educational attainment, the contrast being starkest between adults with primary education or less


                                                                    45
and those with completed tertiary education. For example, the predicted grit score for adults with
primary education or less is 2.8, as compared with 3.2 for adults with tertiary education (Figure 4.8).
The predicting model controls for education, gender, current household wealth, mother’s education,
number of household shocks experienced by age 12, household socioeconomic status at age 15, type
of school, and school proximity.

Openness is positively associated with the use of solving and learning skills at work. The higher the
openness score—ranging from 1 to 4—the greater the likelihood of using problem solving and
learning skills at work and of using them with high intensity (that is, every day). The results are
statistically significant and they control for education, gender, current household wealth, mother’s
education, number of household shocks experienced by age 12, socioeconomic status at age 15,
other       socio-emotional            skills,      type       of        school,    and   school   proximity.

Box 4.2. Results from the 2012 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, Armenia



The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is an international exam that assesses,
every four years, how well students are performing in math and science. Armenia fares much better in math
than in science TIMSS scores, but some recent trends are worrisome.

Overall, Armenian students’ results in math (mean score of 467) were better than in science (mean score of
437) for 8th grade in the 2011 exam. However, Armenia has a higher share of students scoring at the “below
low” proficiency level in math and science than OECD and EU averages. What is even more worrisome is that
the percentage of students in Armenia in the “below low” category in math increased from 18 to 24 percent
between 2003 and 2011, while the proportion of students in the “advanced” category increased only by 1
percentage point (see Figure B.1).

Analysis suggests that students from less well-off families may have been the most affected by the drop in test
scores. Disaggregating trends in achievement suggest that test scores dropped for a number of groups. Test
scores dropped for students in different household wealth quintiles, using the number of books at home as a
proxy variable. However, the highest drop in test scores (44 points) between 2003 and 2011 can be seen for
students whose parents have less than lower-secondary completed; this is in stark contrast to students whose
parents have higher levels of education, where the drop was only 3 points. The drop in test scores affected
students in medium-size cities (50k - 100k people) the most, although it seems to have been gender neutral.




                                                                        47
What is the role of past socioeconomic status in skill acquisition?

In determining patterns in skills acquisition and reading proficiency outcomes by household
socioeconomic status, this section uses a variable scaling the socioeconomic status of the household
when the respondent was 15 years old (individuals were asked to rank their household’s
socioeconomic status from 1 to 10), as well as a household wealth index constructed using
information on current household dwelling characteristics and assets. Robustness checks were
carried out to ensure the viability and precision of the indicators. Using these variables, we explore
the extent to which the education and skills profiles of respondents who were living in low-
socioeconomic-status households at age 15 but are living in high-wealth-index households at present
are significantly different from the profiles of respondents who were living in low-socioeconomic-
status households at age 15 and remain in low-wealth-index households at present.

Past household socioeconomic status is associated with the use of reading and computer skills and
with using problem-solving and learning skills at work. Adults who lived in high-socioeconomic-
status households at age 15 are more likely to use computer and solving at learning skills at work and
to use those skills more intensively compared to adults who lived in low-socioeconomic-status
households at the age of 15 (Figure 4.9). All results are statistically significant controlled for
education, gender, current household wealth, mother’s education, number of household shocks
experienced by age 12, socioeconomic status at age 15, socio-emotional skills, type of school, and
school proximity.

Adults who once lived in high-socioeconomic-status households at the age of 15 score higher on
socio-emotional skills such as conscientiousness and openness. Scores for these socio-emotional
skills are higher for adults who grew up in high-socioeconomic-status households. For example,
scores in openness averaged 3.27 for adults from high-socioeconomic-households, compared to 3.15
for adults in low-socioeconomic-status households (Figure 4.10).

Do early skills gaps translate into current skills gaps?

As noted above, skills acquisition and reading proficiency outcomes are positively correlated with the
household’s socioeconomic status in the past. The question that remains to be explored here is
whether adults who did not transition from low socioeconomic status have a different skill profile
than those adults who managed to transition into middle or high socioeconomic status.

Figure 4.11 shows the distribution of respondents by socioeconomic status at age 15 and by
household wealth index at present. The graph shows an increase in the proportion of respondents
falling into the low-socioeconomic-status category. The trend may be explained by a range of
factors, including the economic shifts that followed the political, social, and economic transitions in
the region in the 1990s, as well as the most recent global financial crisis. Recent estimates show that
the poverty rate increased from 28 percent in 2008 to 35 percent in 2011. Although it increased most
acutely in rural areas, it also affected urban centers, and inequality (as measured by the Gini
coefficient) has also increased—from 0.24 to 0.27—over the same period (World Bank, 2014).

Adults who remained in low-socioeconomic-status households have generally low educational
attainment and use problem solving and learning skills less than others do. About 42 percent of
adults who transitioned out of a low-socioeconomic-status household have tertiary education,
compared to 31 percent for those who remained behind. Adults who transitioned into high-wealth-
index households used solving and learning skills more often and more intensively compared to
adults who did not transition out of low socioeconomic status (Figure 4.12 and Figure 4.13).

However, there are few differences in reading proficiency outcomes between adults who remained
in low socioeconomic status and those whose households have made an upward transition. The
distribution of reading proficiency scores is similar across these groups of households of varied social
mobility, with most respondents clustering in levels 1/0 or 2 (Figure 4.14).

How do parental education and household resilience to shocks affect skills
outcomes?

Parental educational attainment is associated with reading proficiency. Adults whose mothers
attained only lower-secondary or less education score lower on reading proficiency (at levels 0
through 2) compared to adults whose mothers attained tertiary education (Figure 4.15). The results
are statistically significant, controlling for education, gender, current household wealth, mother
education, the number of shocks at age 12, socioeconomic status at age 15, other socio-emotional
skills, type of school, and school proximity.

Higher parental education attainment is also associated with a higher probability of using problem-
solving and learning skills at work. Adults whose mothers completed secondary or tertiary education
have a higher probability of using solving and learning skills at work compared to adults whose
mothers completed less than primary education (Figure 4.16). The model controls for education,
gender, current household wealth, mother’s education, number of household shocks experienced by
age 12, socioeconomic status at age 15, other socio-emotional skills, type of school, and school
proximity.

Finally, household vulnerability at age 15 is associated with a lower probability of using reading skills.
Adults who grew up in households that experienced severe shocks (such as death of a member,
family break up, employment loss, natural disaster, violence or displacement) had a lower probability
of using reading skills and of using them with higher intensity compared to adults from households
that experienced one or no shocks (Figure 4.17). The results for more than one shock are statistically
significant, controlling for education, gender, current household wealth, mother’s education,
number of household shocks experienced by age 12, socioeconomic status at age 15, other socio-
emotional skills, type of school, and school proximity.

Highlights of findings


      Overall, educational attainment is high among Armenia’s urban population. Nonetheless, the
       average reading proficiency remains relatively low by international standards. Most adults in
       Armenia score at level 2 or below, as compared to levels 2 to 3, which is the average for OECD
       countries in the PIAAC assessment.

      The score gap between urban Armenia and OECD averages is widest when comparing the
       difference among adults between those with upper-secondary and those with tertiary
       education.

      There is a positive association between educational attainment and

           o   use of foundational and job-relevant skills;
           o   scores in socio-emotional skills such as grit and decision-making;
           o   scores in reading proficiency.

      The socioeconomic status of the parental household is associated with adults’ use of reading
       and job-relevant skills, and some of the early skills gaps remain over time.

      Parental education and household protection from shocks are positively associated with
       foundational, socio-emotional, and job-relevant skills. The higher the educational attainment
       of the parents and the fewer the shocks experienced in the parental household, the more
       use there is (as an adult) of foundational and job-relevant skills and the higher the scores in
       socio-emotional skills.

5. Step 3 | Building Job-Relevant Skills in Armenia

The education system and the household play a pivotal role in improving the labor market
performance of individuals, as shown in the previous section. Both the educational system and the
household provide solid foundational skills as well as job-relevant skills that enhance the individual’s
employability and productivity. Notwithstanding the fundamental role that education plays in
equipping people with appropriate skills, the process of skills acquisition can continue over a
lifetime. As such, continuing education and training programs as part of the workforce development
system are important to ensure that workers maintain or upgrade their skills to keep up with
changing business and production processes and, more broadly, with technological changes altering
the workplace environment.

This section discusses how skills matter and shows that they matter at least as much as education for
the labor market. It lays out evidence regarding how (and which) skills pay off in Armenia in terms of
labor force participation, employment and earnings. It also examines to what extent training or
other forms of accreditation, such as certification or apprenticeships, can help in skills acquisition. In
more detail, this answers the following three questions: (i) To what extent can skills help explain the
labor force participation and employment? (ii) How are different skills sets, in conjunction with
education, contributing to workers’ earnings? and (iii) Is training providing value-added to workers in
terms of skills?

The analysis carried out in this section involves descriptive statistics and two econometric models.
The first one is a probability model for two outcome variables: labor force participation and
employment. The model controls for cognitive skills (mainly, literacy proficiency scores), socio-
emotional skills, computer use, household related variables, dropout, age, mother education,
father’s education, socioeconomic status at age 15, and the number of household shocks at age 12.
The second model follows Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne (2001) and Weinberger (2013) in order to
estimate the returns to earnings and to analyze how different skills sets contribute in conjunction
with education. The model controls for experience, gender, years of education, literacy score, socio-
emotional skills, computer use, contact with clients, solving and learning new things, autonomy,
economic sector, occupation, and (using an indicator variable) whether one is a wage worker. All the
results presented here are statistically significant unless noted otherwise. We acknowledge the
possible limitations of the estimation procedure, in terms of multi-collinearities and measurement


                                                   55
and/or omitted variable biases. However, we expect this to be a first step towards exploring these
issues in greater depth.


To what extent can skills help explain the labor force participation and
employment?

In the absence of a direct measurement of skills, there is vast evidence on the relationship between
educational attainment and labor force participation and employment in Armenia. For instance, the
probability of actively participating in the labor force increases with educational attainment, rising
from 39 percent for those with primary or less education to 65 percent for those with tertiary
education. Education also increases the probability of being employed—which rises from around 55
percent for those with upper-secondary education to 70 percent for those with tertiary education
(Figure 5.1).

Additionally, direct measures of skills such as reading proficiency suggest that they have a stronger
association with labor force participation and employment than educational attainment alone. The
chances of actively participating in the labor force are higher across the reading proficiency levels
when compared to educational attainment, except for tertiary education. Probability of active
participation is around 53 percent for reading level 1 or below, 58 percent for levels 4 and 5. Similarly,
the probabilities of being employed also increase with reading proficiency and are consistently
higher than those based on educational attainment alone, rising from 63 percent for reading level 1



                                                                   56

Labor force participation and employment share vary across age groups and proficiency levels. There
are no large differences in labor force participation between reading proficient levels 0 and 3 across
the age range of 25 to 65 years, although the employment share of those participating dips for those
between ages 35 and 44. However, for the high performers (level 4/5), both labor force participation
and employment share increase with age. (Figure 5.3)

More precisely, skill sets can explain up to half of the effect attributed to education on the
probability of being active in the labor market. An additional year of education alone seems to


                                                                           57
increase the chances of being active in the labor market by around 2 percentage points. But
accounting for skill sets can reduce this probability by as much as half a percentage point. For
instance, when accounting for cognitive skills, socio-emotional skills, and computer skills, an
additional year of education increases the probability of being in the labor force by 1.5 percentage
points. This suggests that investing in education still matters, since additional years of education still
increase the probability of being in the labor force. However, investing in promoting better skills may
yield better results for labor force participation.

Socio-emotional skills are associated with labor force participation and employment even after
controlling for years of education. Some socio-emotional skills also improve the probability of
participation, such as conscientiousness (by 10 percent) and decision making (by 5 percent). Other
personality traits, such as risk aversion, which are not necessarily skills but can be learned through
training, reduce the probability by 4 percent. Those who reported that they use their overall
computer skills are 9 to 10 percent more likely to be participating in the labor force than those who
reported that they do not use these skills at all. All the results are statistically significant (Figure 5.4).

It is worth noting that women still have low employment chances, even after accounting for
different characteristics and skills. Among Armenia’s urban population, women’s participation in the
workforce is consistently lower than men’s. Household-related variables (marital status, number of
children, labor dependents, parents’ education, and household vulnerability) alone could only
explain around half of this lower participation. Figure 5.5 compares the employment probability of


                                                                        58
Armenian men and women by skill group and household characteristics. The evidence suggests that
women’s participation rate is between 14 and 17 percentage points lower than men’s.

Furthermore, the explanatory power of skills surpasses that of education concerning the probability
of employment conditional on being active in the labor market. The results of this analysis are
presented in the last column in Annex Table 17. An additional year of education does not seem to
increase the probability of being employed—at least not statistically significantly—whereas grit and
conscientiousness add between 5 and 12 percentage points, respectively, to that probability. Also,
the gender differences seem to narrow even further and they are not statistically significant.

How are different skills sets, in conjunction with education, contributing to
higher earnings?

Skills seem to matter at least as much as education in terms of earnings. There is evidence
supporting a payoff for workers who invest in acquiring education and skills, albeit with caveats
present in both theory and estimation (for instance, Griliches, 1977; Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua,
2006; Hanushek and Woessmann, 2008). Following Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne (2001) and
Weinberger (2013), a standard statistical analysis suggests that for full-time workers in Armenia, an
additional year of education would increase hourly earnings by around 2.4 percentage points. This
rate remains rather constant when one accounts for different skill groups, even after taking into
account type of occupation and economic sector (it only reduces about half of a percentage point).

                                                              59
This result suggests that investing in education still matters, but individuals can benefit greatly from
complementary skills. This is the case because the labor market rewards skills, such as socio-
emotional skills and job-related skills that are an indicator of technical skill and not only of credentials
(Figure 5.6).

Skills affect earnings in different ways depending on the industry. This may reflect correlations
between certain skills and the average job compensation for different industries, as well as the
complementarities among types of skills. For instance, grit, risk aversion, and hostility bias seem to
positively correlate with higher hourly earnings. So do certain job-related activities, such as high
computer use at work and high solving and learnings activity (the latter is defined as frequently
undertaking tasks requiring 30 minutes or more of thinking and often requiring learning new things).
On the other hand, agreeableness, more careful decision making and more contact with clients are
associated with lower hourly earnings. This last part aligns with the idea that service-related jobs
(those where workers are more prone to have more contact with clients and use this second group
of skills) tend to pay less on average in the labor market. One potential risk with this estimation
appears when one tries to disentangle the individual effect of each socio-emotional skill or job-
related task, as they rarely occur in isolation. However, joint significance tests suggest that the
impact of both the socio-emotional skill set and job-related tasks are statistically significantly
different from zero. This would reinforce the point that these skills complement education as they
also correlate with earnings (Figure 5.7).

Returns to education and skills are also differentiated by age cohorts. For instance, there are positive
and significant returns to an additional year of education for those between ages 25 and 44.
However, this is not the case for the oldest age cohort (45 to 65 years old). In terms of skills, the
results are more diverse across age groups. For example, no single socio-emotional skill seems to
matter across all the age groups. In the case of job-related skills, it is worth noting that when they do
matter, their effects are larger in magnitude than those of education and socio-emotional skills. The
data also shows that that using problem solving and learning skills for at least 30 minutes at the work
place is highly rewarded for the 25 – 34 age group, whereas autonomy in decision making is more
rewarded among the older cohort, ages 35 to 44. This may reflect the progression on the complexity
and responsibility in a job, and associated different skill requirements.

Box 5.1. Findings of the SABER-Workforce Development Study, Armenia

 A recent World Bank study assessed the current status of workforce development policy and institutions in
 Armenia. That study, known as SABER-WfD, was based on an analytical framework that identifies and ranks
 a country in three dimensions: (i) Strategic framework, which represents the advocacy, championship, and
 coordination of the objective of workforce development with national priorities; (ii) System oversight,
 which refers to provisions for funding, quality, and learning pathways that affect individuals, employers,
 and training providers; and (iii) Service delivery, which encompasses the diversity, organization, and
 management of training provision. The SABER diagnostic’s findings on the state of Armenia’s workforce
 development system and what is needed to improve it may be summarized as follows.

 The state of Armenia’s workforce development system
  There is currently a process for connecting employers, workers, and the educational system, which was
     started years ago; it includes the National Center for VET Development and the National Council for VET
     Development, which coordinate the workforce development strategies.
     The workforce development system relies heavily on government resources, and there are no
      incentives to use them efficiently or to base them on performance. The quality assurance system is not
      enforced uniformly across the workforce development policies. Even though the system is being
      updated and policies are being implemented to diversify the pathway for skill acquisition, the VET
      system is still seen as one limited to vertical movement toward tertiary education.
     The training providers are regulated, but they have limited accountability in meeting quality standards,
      since there is almost no monitoring and evaluation. This results in a lack of evidence for and poor
      information on labor market training needs. As a result, training is still developed without industry’s
      input; where some linkages do exist, they are sporadic and non-institutionalized.

 Policy recommendations
  Improve the strategic framework of the workforce development system by increasing cooperation
      among stakeholders through the identification of an apex-level body to oversee key priorities with the
      private sector and coordinate policy implementation. The involvement of the private sector will be
      necessary to overcome the mismatch of training with needs, to introduce incentives, and to identify
      best practices for replication in training.
     Improve system oversight by introducing performance-based funding mechanisms to provide incentives
      and accountability for increased efficiency and effectiveness, build institutional capacity to respond
      more flexibly to local market needs, and foster innovation through competition and best practices in
      training delivery. This can be achieved by allocating resources (financial and legal, among others) to the
      quality assurance system.
     Improve the service delivery by enhancing the monitoring and evaluation system linked to accreditation
      and certification, introducing and enforcing measures for training providers through performance
      indicators, and building a strong labor market information system.

Is training providing value-added to workers in terms of skills?

Workers need to keep their skills relevant and updated to meet the job market need. They can
achieve this by participating in vocational education or through various forms of training. Either way,
it is important that such service provision be adequate and relevant and that it generate enough
incentives for participation. A workforce development system in Armenia has been established, but
it lacks adequate institutional structure to link it to the productive sector, to oversee training quality,
and to generate incentives to participation (Box 5.1). This section provides a quick overview of the
participation rates in different types of training and the cost in terms of skill gaps.

Skills matter as long as they are relevant and updated, but participation in on-the-job training,
professional certification, and apprenticeships is not widespread in Armenia. The overall percentage
of 15-to-64-year-olds participating in training is about 6 percent, while for certification it is 7 percent
and for apprenticeships it is 10.2 percent. Of those who have participated in any form of skill
updating, the younger age groups underwent training, certification or apprenticeship programs
more frequently than others. The peak percentages for all three age groups are among 25-to-34-year-
olds, and they diminish for the older cohorts (Figure 5.8).

Training and certification seem to help in acquiring job relevant skills, whereas apprenticeships do
not. Individuals who attended training were more likely than others to report using cognitive skills
and more likely to use them intensively. Similarly, those who had attended a certification program
were more likely to report using a computer at work and more likely to use it intensively. However,

                                                              63
those who attended apprenticeship programs were not as likely as others to report using their skills
of autonomy (freedom to decide on how to do your work) and repetitiveness (frequency of
performing short and repetitive tasks), although they were more likely to use those skills intensively
when they do (Figure 5.9).

Highlights of findings


      Skills, especially socio-emotional ones, are positively associated with labor force participation
       and employment opportunities in Armenia. Skills are paying off in the labor market in terms
       of hourly earnings, and this payoff is large and statistically significant.

      Disparities in labor market outcomes across age groups and gender exist today. The returns
       to education are larger for the younger cohorts than for the older groups, but skills affect the
       hourly earnings across age cohorts differently. In terms of the gender disparity, it is
       consistently large for men and women with comparable skill profiles.

      Skills that are attributable to the learning process contribute the most to increased earnings.
       This puts an emphasis on the quality of the skills that workers need to acquire.

      Armenia’s low rates of participation in on-the-job training, professional certification, and
       apprenticeship programs may represent missed opportunities for workforce development,
       as these programs do seem to help in acquiring job relevant skills.

6. Step 4 | Encouraging Entrepreneurship and Innovation in
Armenia

Skills are not only essential for employable and productive workers, they are also prerequisites for
successful entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurial activity is a valuable option in markets with low demand
for workers and high unemployment, like Armenia, and it can help bring to the market new products
and foster innovation. When their number is sizable, entrepreneurs contribute to economic
development through large enterprises that create jobs and through enterprises that serve in case of
necessity for vulnerable populations. These factors are key to boosting shared prosperity. Research
also shows that improving regulations, reducing business environment constraints to doing business,
and increasing access to finance and credit all encourage entrepreneurship and innovation (Valerio,
Parton, and Robb, 2014).

Some clarification of terminology may be helpful. An entrepreneur is often defined as someone who
is willing to take the risk of starting a business in order to make a profit (Chell and Ozkan, 2010). In
this section, the definition of entrepreneur includes self-employed individuals and all those who own
a business of any size. Due to data limitations, the definition does not distinguish between formal
and informal arrangements or sectors of businesses. The term innovation is used in this section to
signify the use of knowledge to create new marketable products. Innovation is also considered an
important component in a country’s economic success. To look at innovation, this report analyzes
the skills in high-innovation manufacturing and knowledge-intensive services in comparison to those
sectors that use technology and knowledge less intensively, including agriculture and construction.

This section uses descriptive statistics to answer the following questions: (i) Who are the
entrepreneurs in Armenia? (ii) How do entrepreneurs and wage workers differ in their use of skills?
(iii) Who is working in the high innovation sectors in Armenia? and (iv) What skills are used in the
sectors most related to innovation?


Who are the entrepreneurs?

There are relatively few entrepreneurs in Armenia, and they tend to be middle-aged men with slightly
less education than wage workers. The share of entrepreneurs in Armenia is small compared to


                                                  66
those who have a wage-earning job, and entrepreneurs also tend to differ in gender and age
characteristics. Approximately 89 percent of employed individuals have a wage-earning job; only 11
percent identify as entrepreneurs as defined. Being an entrepreneur does not seem to be associated
with current household wealth. Men are more likely to be entrepreneurs than women; with over 92
percent of working women having a wage-earning job. There are differences across age cohorts, too.
Entrepreneurship is highest, at 31 percent, for the 45 to 54 age cohort, compared to about 13 percent
reported by the 15 to 24 age cohort (Figure 6.1).

The education profile of entrepreneurs is different from that of wage-earning workers. Like most of
Armenia’s adults, the majority of entrepreneurs and wage-earners have completed a tertiary degree
(51 percent of entrepreneurs and 69 percent of wage workers). However, the share of the
population that is engaged as wage-earning workers increases with higher levels of educational
attainment, whereas the share of entrepreneurs increases with lower levels of education. This
suggests that self-employment may be driven by the inability to find a job, particularly among
individuals with lower education (Figure 6.2).

The profile of entrepreneurs varies by economic sector and also by occupation. Most entrepreneurs
and wage-earning workers are in the services sector. Except for trade, where 52 percent of all
workers are self-employed, there are far more wage-earning workers than entrepreneurs across all
economic sectors. The majority of workers across the various occupations are wage-earners too,
except for those employed in skilled agricultural work; in this last field, 43 percent of workers
reported that they were self-employed. Finally, a majority of wage-earners are employed in high-
skilled white-collar jobs, while among the self-employed the majority are in low-skilled white collar
jobs (Figure 6.3).

How do entrepreneurs and wage-earning workers differ in their use of skills?

Overall, entrepreneurs reported less use of cognitive skills than wage-earning workers.
Entrepreneurship is associated with less use of reading skills than the work of wage earners. For
instance, 43 percent of wage earners reported high use of reading skills, compared with 28 percent
of the self-employed. Entrepreneurs are also less likely to use computers at work. For instance,
almost 40 percent of wage earners reported high use of computer skills at work, compared with 28
percent of entrepreneurs. This adds to the evidence presented before that self-employment in
Armenia is related to occupations that generally use lower levels of skills, since individuals with
higher levels of education are more likely to find employment (Figure 6.4).

Entrepreneurs have scores similar to wage earners’ in most socio-emotional skills. For instance, the
mean score in extraversion for entrepreneurs is 3.0, while the average is 2.9 for wage earners.
Results are similar for entrepreneurs and wage earners for skills such as conscientiousness, grit,
agreeableness, and openness. In fact, the only skills where there is a difference between the two
groups are emotional stability and risk taking, entrepreneurs reporting less stability and more risk
taking than wage earners.

Being an entrepreneur pays off, as entrepreneurs are likely to have higher incomes than wage
earners. An analysis of the determinants of earnings shows that entrepreneurs or self-employed
individuals in Armenia are much more likely (up to 30 percent more likely) to earn higher income than
wage earners. However, it is possible that this premium comes from business profit. This can be


                                                            69
particularly the case for those with relatively formal businesses and those that have employees. The
premium may also reflect returns to risk-taking. In the meantime, there are differences between
wage earners’ and entrepreneurs’ job-related skills that may account for this difference as well. This
is aligned with recent evidence research on entrepreneurship (Levine and Rubinstein, 2013). While
risk-taking may not be considered a skill, but rather an attitude or a behavior, it still can be acquired
through training.

The most used job-relevant skills vary between entrepreneurs and wage workers. Wage earners are
more likely to use reading, writing, and computer skills at work, while entrepreneurs are more likely
to have contact with people outside of work. For instance, 20 percent of wage workers use reading
skills at work with high frequency, compared with only 6 percent of entrepreneurs. Additionally, 38
percent of wage workers use computers with high frequency, compared with 28 percent of
entrepreneurs. This suggests that entrepreneurship is much more related to activities that have to
do with direct people-to-people contact and that wage workers use cognitive and job-related skills
more frequently (Figure 6.5).

Overall, entrepreneurs are greater risk takers and are in more contact with people than wage-
earning workers. Young people who wish to become entrepreneurs may need to be more open than
other people to risk-taking activities and to a certain amount of lack of security on the job front, as
well as more open to using their people skills than their cognitive or job-specific skills.
Entrepreneurship may also be an important option in times of high unemployment, particularly for
youth.

Who is working in the high-innovation sectors?

A division usually made by researchers to explore the innovation topic is that between high-
innovation and low-innovation manufacturing. This section expands on that approach, following the
World Bank’s recent report on jobs in Europe and Central Asia, by dividing workers between those in
high tech, that is, in high-innovation industries, and those in medium and low tech, that is, in low-
innovation sectors (including construction). For instance, we include medium-high manufacturing
and knowledge-intensive services in the high innovation category and medium-low manufacturing
and less knowledge-intensive services in the low innovation category. The agriculture and
construction sectors are classified in low innovation.

Highly educated women with some experience are the most likely to work in high-innovation sectors
in Armenia. There are slightly more workers in high-innovation sectors than in low-innovation ones
(56 percent and 44 percent, respectively). The proportions of individuals working in low- and high-
innovation sectors are very similar. Around 25 percent of individuals in both sectors are between 45
and 54 years old. Overwhelmingly, the majority of individuals working in high-innovation sectors are
women (70 percent), compared with 30 percent of men. Not surprisingly, over 80 percent of
individuals working in these sectors have completed their tertiary education (Figure 6.6).

What skills are used in sectors most related to innovation?

Cognitive skill use is much higher among individuals working in high-innovation sectors. The
frequency and intensity of use of reading and writing skills are much higher among individuals
working in high-innovation sectors than among those in low-innovation sectors. For instance, about
50 percent of workers in high-innovation use reading skills with high frequency, compared with 30
percent of those in low-innovation. Surprisingly, the use of numeracy skills is quite similar in both
groups of individuals, although slightly higher in those individuals who work in high-innovation
technology occupations (Figure 6.7).

While the job-relevant characteristics of individuals working in high- versus low-innovation
occupations are different, their socio-emotional characteristics are fairly similar. Individuals working
in high-innovation sectors not only use reading, writing and computer skills on the job much more
often than their counterparts in low-innovation occupations, they also report having more contact
with people outside work and use thinking and learning skills more frequently. For instance, 47
percent of individuals working in high tech reported a high use of computer skills, compared with 23
percent of low-innovation workers. Overall, individuals in high tech sectors demonstrate greater use
of higher-order skills on the job than workers in low tech sectors (Figure 6.8).

Highlights of findings


         Entrepreneurship, measured as a percentage of self-employed among total urban
          employment, is low in Armenia.

         Overall, entrepreneurs have different characteristics and skills when compared with wage-
          earning workers. They tend to be male, between 35 and 44 years of age, and to have lower
          levels of education than wage workers, yet on average they earn higher incomes.

         Concerning their skills, overall entrepreneurs have lower scores in job-relevant, socio-
          emotional, and cognitive skills than wage earners. Entrepreneurs report less use of their
          cognitive and job-related skills than wage earners—except for risk taking, a skill they report
          using more. The use of socio-emotional skills is fairly similar between entrepreneurs and
          wage earners.

         Among wage earners, the profiles differ between those working in high-innovation and
          those working in low-innovation sectors. A substantial share of all wage earners in Armenia
          work in high-innovation sectors (56 percent), and women are more likely to be employed in
          these sectors than men. Individuals working in the high-innovation sectors use their cognitive
          skills more often than individuals in low-innovation sectors.

inactive population, and the higher earnings of entrepreneurs when compared with wage
earners.

7. Step 5 ǀ Facilitating Labor market Mobility and Job
Matching in Armenia

The previous sections have shown that the educational system and households in Armenia can
promote learning for all and can help build the right skills for jobs, and that such skills matter for
employability. Another key factor for employability is the quality of labor mobility. While multiple
measures of labor mobility exist, the STEP survey first focuses on individuals’ school-to-work
transitions. The STEP survey results suggest that the longer an individual takes to find a first job after
completing his or her highest level of education, the less promising his or her employment prospects
are, and the lower the rewards to his or her skills. Further, labor mobility facilitates job matching,
which increases economic efficiency, and enables individuals to be productive and to use their skills
efficiently.

This section starts by exploring the school-to-work transition in Armenia and its implications for the
further use of skills. It then explores the occupational mismatches between the qualifications of the
workers and the qualifications required by the job. In more detail, this section focuses on answering
the following three questions: (i) How does the school-to-work transition affect current labor market
outcomes and skills? (ii) How does first out-of-school job affect skill development? and (iii) What are
the skill profiles of those who are neither studying nor actively looking for employment (NEETs)?

The analysis is mainly carried out using descriptive statistics on adults between 25 and 40 years old in
urban Armenia. By using this age group of population, we aim to capture the transitions of those
individuals who are most likely to have just completed their highest education level and with some
labor market experience.


How does the school-to-work transition affect current labor market outcomes
and skills?

There is a rather quick school-to-work transition in Armenia, but it seems to vary widely by
educational attainment. For instance, a large proportion of individuals between ages 25 and 40
found a job within the first six months after completing their highest level of education. However,
this proportion ranges as low as 62 percent for upper-secondary graduates to as high as 92 percent
for lower-secondary graduates. It is possible that individuals with lower levels of education may be

                                                   75
more willing to take lower-level occupations, since they cannot afford to be unemployed. The
proportion of tertiary education graduates that found a job in less than six months is 72 percent. It is
worth noting that half of the tertiary education graduates found a job within one month of leaving
school, suggesting a rapid transition to employment (Figure 7.1).

The quick transition is positive news, because longer school-to-work transitions are associated with
poorer labor market outcomes. The percentage of employed individuals between ages 25 and 40
declines as the duration of their first job search lengthens. However, individuals within this age
group seem to continue actively looking for jobs even after long school-to-work transitions. This is
evidenced by the percentage of people in the “inactive” category remaining fairly constant across
school-to-work transitions (25.8 percent).

The effects of longer school-to-work transitions are also visible in the status of people’s current skills.
For instance, the longer school-to-work transitions last, the less likely people are to report using
cognitive (reading, writing, and numeracy) skills. Individuals with longer transitions also report using
all three skills less intensively (Figure 7.2).

development?

How does first out-of-school job affect skills development?

The field of work for a person’s first out-of-school job affects his or her current employability.
Overall, among employed workers, first out-of-school jobs were concentrated in white-collar
occupations, with marked differences in gender. The white-collar occupations represent about 80
percent of all first-job positions; consisting of 48 percent in high-skilled white collar (HSWC) and 32
percent in low-skilled white collar (LSWC). The gender composition is highly skewed toward women,
who make up 79 percent and 76 percent of these first-job positions in HSWC and LSWC, respectively.
The gender composition is reversed in crafts and related occupations, where men account for 65
percent of these positions, while in the elementary occupations the proportion is almost even (51
percent men and 49 percent women) (Figure 7.3).

The occupation of the first out-of-school job also influences whether an individual will further
develop socio-emotional skills. For instance, some occupations seem to help the acquisition of socio-
emotional skills such as openness. In Armenia, HSWC and crafts-related occupations are associated
with increases in openness, quite apart from workers’ educational attainment, whereas openness
remains rather constant among workers in LSWC and elementary occupations (Figure 7.4).

Job-related skills are also associated with differences in occupation of first out-of-school job and
educational attainment. For instance, individuals in crafts and related occupations and elementary
occupations were less likely to report using solving and learning skills than were those in HSWC and

LSWC occupations. Individuals in HSWC occupations reported using these skills more intensively
(Figure 7.5).

What about the skills of those inactive between ages 25 to 40?

Among individuals ages 25 to 40 in urban Armenia, around 41 percent reported that they were
inactive, that is, neither studying nor actively looking for employment. These individuals require
special attention both because they signify a loss in human capital and because they are at risk of
becoming vulnerable, either through loss of current income or through poverty at old age.

The lower skill levels of these inactive individuals limit their possibilities of finding quality
employment. For instance, inactive individuals (abbreviated as NEET in the accompanying figures)
were consistently less likely than other individuals to report that they use cognitive skills (reading,
writing, and numeracy) as well as job-related skills like computer skills. Inactives are also less likely to
use the skills intensively. The lesser use (and lower intensity of use) of these skills, in combination
with a difficult school-to-work transition, may pose limits to their employment possibilities (Figure
7.6).

Inactivity is more common among women and those who did not have a smooth school-to-work
transition. Inactive individuals are predominantly women in the 25-to-40 age group. These women
also make up a disproportionate number of those whose job search lasted more than six months, in
spite of the fact that these women are highly educated (Figure 7.7).

The rest of this section explores aspects of job matching. Workers have to both learn and use their
skills in the workplace in order to be productive. However, mismatches can occur between job
requirements and a worker’s qualifications and skills due to imperfectly competitive labor markets,

                                                                                 80
incomplete information about an applicant’s qualifications, or limited geographic mobility. Mismatch
is defined as a poor fit between the individual’s qualifications and job-required qualifications
(Quintini, 2011). Over-qualification is defined as a situation where a worker’s qualification is higher
than what is required for the job, while under-qualification is the reverse. In this section, we use
realized occupational matches following Clog and Shockey (1984) and Verdugo and Verdugo (1989).
This method roughly assumes that the years of schooling reflect the abilities or skills of the
individual. The section then explores how the skills of those who experience mismatch compare with
the skills of those who do not experience mismatch.


To what extent are there occupational mismatches in the labor market?

Most of Armenia’s workers have adequate qualifications for the jobs they hold. Overall, 71 percent of
Armenia’s workers have an adequate number of years of education, while 15 percent of them are
overqualified and 14 percent are underqualified. This difference in occupational mismatch is gender-
neutral, and it is highest for those in the 60 – 64 age cohort (Figure 7.8).

As expected, cognitive skills vary for those individuals who are overqualified compared with those
who are underqualified or adequate for the job. For instance, overqualified workers use reading and
writing skills much more than workers who are adequate or underqualified. Individuals who are
overqualified also have much better numeracy skills than those who are adequate or underqualified.

In contrast, socio-emotional skills tend to be similar among the three types of workers (by



                                                                        81
qualification match) while some job-relevant skills are more likely to be used by overqualified
workers. The difference in socio-emotional skills is not large between the three types of workers. In
contrast, overqualified individuals are much more likely to report a higher use of computer skills and
to be in contact with people outside work than adequate or underqualified individuals (Figure 7.9
and Figure 7.10).

    transition continue actively looking for a job instead of becoming discouraged

   Quick school-to-work transition often leads to better employment prospects, together with
    better and more job-relevant skills and social-emotional skills.

   The inactive population in Armenia is comprised primarily of women and individuals who did
    not have a first out-of-school job after their highest educational attainment (among
    individuals between 25 and 40 years old), which takes a significant toll on their human capital
    prospective.

   About 70 percent of workers seem to have adequate qualifications for the jobs they have.
    Underqualified, adequately qualified, and overqualified individuals have different cognitive
    and job-relevant skills, while socio-emotional skills tend to be similar among these three
    categories.

8. Conclusions and Way Forward

Given the challenges faced by Armenia in employment and growth, it is essential for Armenia’s
current and future workforce to be equipped with the right skills for the newest and most modern
jobs as well as with skills that can foster entrepreneurship and innovation. Under the STEP
framework and enriched with the newly available survey data sets, the findings presented in this
report point to several key areas that need to be given due attention as Armenia moves way forward
in building a highly skilled workforce.

Step 1 ǀ Getting children off to the right start in Armenia. Compared with neighboring countries,
Armenia has better coverage of early childhood education programs in terms of enrollment rate.
The expansion of the early childhood education programs over time has a demonstrated pay-off in
the rising cognitive and socio-emotional skills of the individuals who participated in the programs.
Those individuals are also more likely to use certain job-related skills frequently associated with
better earnings. To further strengthen Armenia’s early childhood education system, priorities should
be given to three areas: (i) Expanding access to the socioeconomically disadvantaged households
that are out of the current reach of the system. Concern for equity also justifies further increasing
public investment in this service provision. (ii) In addition, the seeming recent trend of declining early
education participation needs to be further looked into – its patterns and likely causes need to be
identified. Policy interventions may be needed to reverse this trend. (iii) Although the service quality
issue is not covered by the data, global experience shows that expanding public services on a large
scale sometimes risks lowering the bar for service quality. Ensuring service quality is therefore critical
for the effectiveness of expanded early education programs. Expansion without quality will only
lead to the waste of resources.

Step 2 ǀ Ensuring that all students learn in Armenia. Armenia has a well-educated population overall,
with high average educational attainment as measured by years of schooling. The report shows that
in Armenia, higher levels of educational attainment are associated with higher reading proficiency;
higher scores in socio-emotional skills; and more frequent use of foundational and job-relevant skills.
However, compared with OECD countries, Armenian adults’ average reading proficiency is low. Most
importantly, the gains in skills achieved by completing higher education levels appear to be much
smaller than the gains achieved in OECD countries. In other words, Armenia’s education system does


                                                   84
not add as much value as is added elsewhere. In addition, the education and skills gap is prominent
across the socioeconomic strata of the households. Moving forward, Armenia will need to prioritize
by doing the following: (i) Armenia needs to improve the learning outcomes and skills formation in
its education system. Worldwide experience shows that this is not an easy task, and results may take
years to show. Lessons from other countries also show that having a high quality and effective
teaching force is the foremost necessary condition for high quality education. Having a strong quality
assurance and accountability system for learning results is another important pre-requisite. (ii)
Strengthening tertiary education will be necessary, as over half of Armenia’s labor force comes from
tertiary graduates. The systemic as well as institutional reforms should give emphasis to building a
close link with the labor market need for a skilled and innovative labor force – not only as employees,
but also as entrepreneurs. (ii) To narrow the learning outcomes and skills gaps, Armenia needs to put
in place measures targeting those who lag behind in the school system. An effective school system
should serve as an important channel to narrow the gaps associated with the different family
backgrounds from which the students come.

Step 3 ǀ Building job-relevant skills in Armenia. In Armenia, higher levels of educational attainment as
well as reading proficiency are distinctively associated with higher labor force participation and
employment rates. In addition, socio-emotional and job related skills seem to matter at least as
much as education in terms of labor force participation, employment and earnings. This is a finding
that is consistent with the ranking of importance of skills by employers in the employers ’ survey. On
top of the foundations skills, building technical and job-specific skills will particularly require re-
thinking the two important stages of the formation of these skills: (i) Vocational education and
training systems need to be assessed and strengthened. How to improve the effectiveness of the
current preliminary and middle-level vocational schools in providing the skills needed is the first
challenge. In the longer term, as the demand for high-level skills rises, whether to delay tracking
after 12 years of foundation learning can be evaluated and considered. (ii) On-the-job training
remains the most effective way to acquire job-specific skills. To increase the opportunities for on-the-
job training, incentives can be designed to encourage firms to increase their provision of such
training to their employees. The current apprenticeship programs do not seem to work in equipping
trainees with job-relevant skills, so the program designs should be closely examined before
considering the future of such programs.

Step 4 ǀ Encouraging Entrepreneurship and Innovation in Armenia. The prevalence of


                                                  85
entrepreneurship in Armenia, defined as self-employment in this report, is low as measured by the
percentage of total employment. The findings indicate that Armenian entrepreneurs tend to have
lower levels of education attainment and lower scores in job-relevant, socio-emotional, and cognitive
skills than wage earners, but on average they earn higher incomes. This is likely to be linked to the
payoffs of the risks they take, which is consistent with their reported higher frequencies of using
“risk-taking” skills. While it is unclear to what extent the entrepreneurship as defined is linked to
innovation and higher productivity activities, there are signs of high potential as a substantial share
of all wage workers in Armenia work in high-innovation sectors (56 percent), particularly for women.
Future policy assessment and consideration can aim at: (i) creating an enabling business
environment and improving business supporting services and risk management policies and
instrument to encourage entrepreneurship targeting innovative sectors; and (ii) aligning some of the
education and training courses, particularly at the tertiary level, with the objective of fostering
entrepreneurship by equipping trainees with essential knowledge, skills, and attitudes.

Step 5 ǀ Matching the supply of skills to what employers demand in Armenia. In Armenia, the
transition period between finishing school and starting the first job is generally short. This report has
found that smooth school-to-work transition often leads to better and more job-relevant skills in the
future and further increases employability and earnings prospects. In addition, a majority of workers
seem to have adequate qualifications for the jobs they have, even though “qualifications” may not
be fully aligned with “skills”. To fully understand labor market mobility and job match, two
important questions need further research: (i) What are the job turnover rates in Armenia, both in
the present and expected in the future, and how should the system of adult learning and skills re-
training or updating respond to the need? (ii) What public employment services exist, what is their
performance record, and how could they function most effectively to foster labor market mobility by
providing real-time labor market information and bridging need and demand between employers
and job-seekers?

Technical Annexes
Annex 1: The STEP Skills Measurement Program: The Household Survey
1. Geographic coverage
The STEP Skills Measurement household survey program covers a large sample of low and middle-
income countries, including Armenia, Bolivia, Colombia, Georgia, Ghana, Kenya, Lao PDR, Macedonia,
Sri Lanka, Ukraine, Vietnam, and the Yunnan Province in China. Surveys were carried out between
2011 and 2013. In Armenia, the household survey was implemented in 2013. The field work was carried
out from April to June 2013.

2. Target population
The STEP target population is the urban population ages 15 to 64. The sampling strategy was
designed to ensure that the target population represents at least 95 percent of the urban working-
age population (aged 15 to 64) in each country. The specifics for the Armenia data are included
below:

Annex Table 1. Main characteristics
   Target population            Non-institutionalized persons 15 to 64 years of age (inclusive) living in
                                private dwellings in urban areas of Armenia at the time of data collection
   Initial sample size          6,814 activated households, of them 5,052 eligible households
   Response rate                50.3%
   Final sample size            2,992 participating selected persons with a final person weight
   Field work                   April –June 2013
   Coverage                     36 urban cities representing ten provinces (marzes), and the country's
                                capital Yerevan

It should be noted the STEP samples in Armenia, both unweighted and weighted, are significantly
more biased to the female population. The unweighted STEP sample is also biased to older age
groups but this bias has been almost corrected in the weighted sample.

3. Background questionnaire
The STEP survey collects comprehensive information not typically captured by traditional household
surveys. It includes two distinct instruments: a background questionnaire and a reading literacy
assessment. The background questionnaire is organized in three household background modules
and seven thematic modules. Module 1 starts with a standard household roster and a section on
dwelling characteristics. It concludes with the random selection of a household member aged 15 to
64 to whom the remainder of the survey is administered. The random selection is based on strict
guidelines set by the STEP technical standards. Modules 2 to 11 are applied to the randomly selected
respondent. Module 2 collects in-depth information on education, training, and the person’s first job.
Module 3 asks health-related questions. Module 4 gathers extensive information on the
respondent’s current occupation(s). Modules 5 and 6 include some of STEP’s most innovative
features. Module 5 asks detailed questions on the respondent’s use of reading, writing, and
numeracy skills in daily life and at work, as well as job-relevant skills used at work. Module 6 provides
information on personality traits, behavior, and preferences. It is important to note the survey
gathers skills information from the entire sampled population, regardless of their labor force status
(employed, unemployed or inactive) and type of employment. Job-relevant skills, however, are
captured only for respondents who are currently working or have worked at some time in the 12
months prior to the survey. Finally, Module 7 focuses on family background.

4. Reading literacy assessment
The second part of the STEP survey consists of a reading literacy assessment, which was specifically
developed for the STEP survey by Educational Testing Services (ETS). This assessment provides a
direct measure of respondents’ reading proficiency. It is organized in three parts. The first part
focuses on foundational reading skills, including word meaning, sentence processing and passage
comprehension. The second part consists of a core literacy assessment, which is used as a screener
intended to sort the least literate from those with higher reading skill levels. The third part is only
administered to respondents having passed the core literacy assessment. It provides a finer
evaluation of reading skills for the most literate individuals in the sample. The STEP Survey in the

                                                           94
Yunnan province of China, Lao PDR, and Sri Lanka included only parts one and two of the reading
literacy assessment. In Sri Lanka the test was administered in Tamil and Sinhala.

5. Technical standards
The STEP Skills Measurement household survey was specifically designed to ensure data
comparability. Coordination and supervision were centralized so survey instruments were
administered in a standardized way across all participating countries, including Armenia. All survey
firms benefited from the STEP team’s technical assistance throughout the implementation process
and complied with the STEP technical standards. Each survey firm’s implementation plan was
summarized in a National Survey Design Planning Report. The sampling strategy and data weighting
were carried out by a single survey methodologist to ensure consistency across methodologies (see
STEP Skills Measurement Survey Methodology Note, 2014).

Cognitive skills are defined as the “ability to understand complex ideas, to adapt effectively to the
environment, to learn from experience, to engage in various forms of reasoning, to overcome
obstacles by taking thought.” Literacy, numeracy, and the ability to solve abstract problems are all
cognitive skills. The STEP survey provides a direct measurement of reading proficiency and an
indirect measurement of reading, writing, and mathematics skills.

1. Direct measurement
The survey includes a direct measure of reading proficiency through the reading literacy assessment
designed by the Educational Testing Services (ETS), as outlined in Figure A2.

This assessment has three parts:

    (i) The first part of the assessment (Section A) evaluates foundational reading skills, including
        word meaning, sentence processing and passage comprehension. Word meaning exercises
        ask respondents to match written words to pictures of everyday objects. Sentence
        processing exercises ask individuals to identify whether or not a given sentence makes sense.
        Finally, passage comprehension exercises require respondents to complete sentences
        embedded in a paragraph, by selecting one of two words that best fit the overall meaning of
        the section. As these exercises were timed, the analysis may also include a time dimension.
        The data provided by part one of the assessment can translate into multiple variables (e.g.,
        score, pace).
    (ii) The second part (Section B) consists of a core literacy assessment, which sorts the least
        literate from those with higher reading skill levels. This section includes eight items.

                                                       97
   Respondents with three or more correct responses are regarded as having met a minimum
   reading literacy threshold. The present document uses an indicator variable to identify
   respondents having passed the core reading assessment.
(iii) The third part (Exercise booklets) is only administered to respondents having passed the
   core assessment. It evaluates reading proficiency in more depth. The assessment uses a
   variety of materials, focusing on non-school-based items encountered in daily life. It also
   involves different types of tasks, including tasks that require respondents to access and
   identify information (in both text-based and non-prose materials such as tables, graphs and
   forms), to integrate and interpret information, and to evaluate information by assessing the
   relevance, credibility, or appropriateness of the material for a particular task. Items present
   varying levels of difficulty, with tasks ranging from locating a single piece of information in a
   very short advertisement to summarizing reasons for using generic drugs as presented in a
   newspaper article. Overall reading proficiency scores are reported on a scale ranging from 0
   to 500, which is divided into 5 levels, with Level 1 characterized by the least demanding tasks
   and Level 5 the most demanding. (Table A5 below explains the levels and scoring in detail.)
   For each respondent, 10 plausible values were generated. Findings presented in this report
   are based on using all 10 plausible values.

                                                  Reading Proficiency Levels and Score
   Literacy Below Level 1         The tasks at this level require the respondent to read brief texts on
   0 to 175                       familiar topics to locate a single piece of specific information. Only basic
                                  vocabulary knowledge is required, and the reader is not required to
                                  understand the structure of sentences or paragraphs or make use of other
                                  text features. There is seldom any competing information in the text and
                                  the requested information is identical in form to information in the
                                  question or directive. While the texts can be continuous, the information
                                  can be located as if the text were noncontinuous. Tasks below Level 1 do
                                  not make use of any features specific to digital texts.




                                                     99
Literacy Level 1   Most of the tasks at this level require the respondent to read relatively
176 to 225         short digital or print continuous, non-continuous or mixed texts to locate
                   a single piece of information which is identical to or synonymous with the
                   information given in the question or directive. Some tasks may require the
                   respondent to enter personal information into a document, in the case of
                   some noncontinuous texts. Little, if any, competing information is
                   present. Some tasks may require simple cycling through more than one
                   piece of information. Knowledge and skill in recognizing basic vocabulary,
                   evaluating the meaning of sentences, and reading of paragraph text is
                   expected.
Literacy Level 2   At this level, the complexity of text increases. The medium of texts may be
226 to 275         digital or printed, and texts may comprise continuous, noncontinuous or
                   mixed types. Tasks in this level require respondents to make matches
                   between the text and information, and may require paraphrase or low-
                   level inferences. Some competing pieces of information may be present.
                   Some tasks require the respondent to cycle through or integrate two or
                   more pieces of information based on criteria, compare and contrast or
                   reason about information requested in the question, or navigate within
                   digital texts to access and identify information from various parts of a
                   document.

Literacy Level 3   Texts at this level are often dense or lengthy, including continuous,
276 to 325         noncontinuous, mixed or multiple pages. Understanding text and
                   rhetorical structures become more central to successfully completing
                   tasks, especially in navigation of complex digital texts. Tasks require the
                   respondent to identify, interpret or evaluate one or more pieces of
                   information and often require varying levels of inference. Many tasks
                   require the respondent to construct meaning across larger chunks of text
                   or perform multistep operations in order to identify and formulate
                   responses. Often tasks also demand that the respondent disregard
                   irrelevant or inappropriate text content to answer accurately. Competing
                   information is often present, but it is not more prominent than the correct
                   information.
Literacy Level 4   Tasks at this level often require respondents to perform multiple-step
326 to 375         operations to integrate, interpret, or synthesize information from
                   complex or lengthy continuous, noncontinuous, mixed, or multiple type
                   texts. Complex inferences and application of background knowledge may
                   be needed to perform successfully. Many tasks require identifying and
                   understanding one or more specific, non-central ideas in the text in order
                   to interpret or evaluate subtle evidence claims or persuasive discourse
                   relationships. Conditional information is frequently present in tasks at this
                   level and must be taken into consideration by the respondent. Competing
                   information is present and sometimes seemingly as prominent as correct
                   information.




                                      100
  Literacy Level 5                  At this level, tasks may require the respondent to search for and integrate
  376 to 500                        information across multiple, dense texts; construct syntheses of similar
                                    and contrasting ideas or points of view; or evaluate evidence-based
                                    arguments. Application and evaluation of logical and conceptual models
                                    of ideas may be required to accomplish tasks. Evaluating reliability of
                                    evidentiary sources and selecting key information is frequently a key
                                    requirement. Tasks often require respondents to be aware of subtle,
                                    rhetorical cues and to make high-level inferences or use specialized
                                    background knowledge.


2. Indirect measurement
The STEP survey also asks respondents to report on their use of cognitive skills in daily life and at
work, namely if they read, write, or use mathematics. For each skill, a score ranging from 0 to 3 was
computed. When a respondent reports not using a given skill, the score is set at 0. For respondents
who do use a given skill, intensity or complexity of use was defined (1 for low, 2 for medium, and 3
for high). The aggregation process and reliability testing are described in the STEP Skills
Measurement Survey Methodology Note (2014). Table below lists the key indicators for cognitive
skills.

Socio-emotional skills, sometimes referred to in the literature as non-cognitive skills or soft skills,
relate to traits covering multiple domains (social, emotional, personality, behaviors, attitudes, etc.).
The survey builds on the “Big Five” personality traits: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion,
agreeableness, and neuroticism (or its opposite, emotional stability). Measures of grit, which has
been shown to have an impact in life outcomes and hostile attribution bias, were also included, as
well as questions pertaining to how individuals make important decisions. Response categories
range from 1, “almost never”, to 4, “almost always”. The aggregation process and reliability testing
are described in the STEP Skills Measurement Survey Methodology Note (2014). Table A7 presents
the questionnaire items used for each socio-emotional skill.

Job-relevant skills are task-related and build on a combination of cognitive and socio-emotional
skills. The STEP survey asks respondents about their use of such skills on the job, including among
others computer use, repair and maintenance of electronic equipment, operation of heavy
machinery, client contact, solving and learning, supervision, etc. For each skill, a score ranging from 0
to 3 was computed. When a respondent reports not using a given skill, the score is set at 0. For
respondents who do use a given skill, intensity or complexity of use was defined (1 for low, 2 for
medium, and 3 for high). The STEP Skills Measurement Survey Methodology Note (2014) provides
more information on the selection of this particular set of skills and on the way these skills are
assessed in the STEP survey. See Tables A8 and A9, below, for lists of skills and associated scales.
