DECARBONIZING DEVELOPMENT
Decarbonizing Development: Planning Ahead for a
Future with Zero Emissions
Stabilizing climate change entails bringing net emissions of carbon dioxide (CO) to zero. CO, stays in the atmosphere for hundreds,
if not thousands, of years. As long as we emit more than we capture or offset through carbon sinks (such as forests), concentrations of
CO2 in the atmosphere will keep rising, and the climate will keep warming. Countries can follow three principles in their efforts to create
a zero-carbon future: (a) planning ahead for a future with zero emissions, (b) getting carbon prices and policies right, and (c) smoothing
the transition and protecting the poor.
This policy note is drawn from Decarbonizing Development: Three Steps to a Zero-Carbon Future (2015) by Marianne Fay, Stephane
Hallegatte, Adrien Vogt-Schilb, Julie Rozenberg, Ulf Narloch, and Tom Kerr. Washington, DC: World Bank.
