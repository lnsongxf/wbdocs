FOREWORD

The Mediation Series is a celebration of the long-term work of the International Finance Corporation (IFC),
member of the World Bank Group, in helping client countries adopt and integrate mediation to increase
the effectiveness of their conflict resolution systems. Since 2004, IFC has extended technical assistance to
both governments and the private sector, globally, to ensure that mediation is established effectively. IFC’s
projects cover the Balkans, East and South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East and North Africa
and have led to a considerable increase in the use of commercial mediation.

The success and the expansion of our mediation projects globally and the scarcity of material in Arabic
have led and inspired the Mediation Series. The series offers a unique and comprehensive set of Alternative
Dispute Resolution (ADR) learning resources for users, policy makers, lawyers, judges, and ADR
professionals. The resources promise to support the growth and sustainability of mediation and ADR in the
region and beyond.

The Mediation Series consists of a three-book-package (Mediation Essentials, Making Mediation Law,
and Integrated Conflict Management Design Workbook) that provides both breadth and depth on various
important topics. The Mediation Essentials deskbook serves as an orientation guide to ADR generally and to
mediation specifically for users, advisers, and mediators. Making Mediation Law offers a robust perspective
on how to design successful mediation policy and legislation. Integrated Conflict Management Design
Workbook offers a hands-on focus for designing efficient and effective dispute management systems with
companies and organizations. The publications appear in both English and Arabic, except for Integrated
Conflict Management Design Workbook (Arabic only).


ABOUT MAKING MEDIATION LAW
Making Mediation Law focuses on regulatory aspects of mediation and provides a step-by-step guide to
making mediation policy and law. Mediation law affects all parties and can take a variety of different forms,
from private contracts and codes of conduct to legislation.

For mediation law to be successful, it requires a set of principles and techniques. The authors of this book
provide an exposition of those principles and techniques, encapsulating the regulatory aspects of mediation
in a step-by-step guide. This easy-to-read, practical book draws on international research, policy, and
practice, and it offers valuable advice to a wide audience involved in the lawmaking process. Given the
universality of the topic, the book serves a broad audience, is written in practical terms, and is offered in
English and Arabic. Each chapter enriches the theoretical discussion with practical case studies. The first
part of the book focuses on common issues, definitions, and models of mediation. It is important for readers
to have a good grasp of those key concepts before they move to the hands-on sections. For individuals more
familiar with mediation, the later chapters may be of more interest as they delve into the practical details of

PREFACE

At the start of the 21st century, mediation continues to enjoy a fresh and vibrant image. It symbolizes a
transformation in the way people approach resolving disputes, the way lawyers advise clients, and the way
judges dispense justice.

As a dispute resolution process, mediation offers flexible solutions for a fast-changing world. While the
substantive laws of nation-states grapple with (a) the fuzzy borders of online transacting, (b) the increasing
difficulty of separating national from international, (c) the challenges of a global mobile workforce and
global families, and (d) the way environmental disasters ignore national borders, mediation aims to offer
dispute resolution procedures tailored to the needs of disputants. Those disputants might be corporate
business entities, start-ups, online consumers, or indigenous leaders in charge of vast resources subject to
foreign investment.

Needless to say, regulatory activity in this area has been, and continues to be, significant throughout the
world, with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) playing a leading
role in the international commercial arena. Yet, making law on mediation presents a unique challenge that
can be framed as follows: how do we best regulate a dispute resolution mechanism, the most attractive
characteristic of which is its procedural and substantive flexibility?

Making Mediation Law offers a step-by-step guide to making mediation law. It sets out best practice
principles, one of which is the involvement of a wide range of interested individuals and groups in the law
making process. Drawing from international research, policy, and practice, the book shows that mediation
law belongs to everyone and can take a variety of different forms, from private contracts and codes of
conduct to legislation.

Making Mediation Law is written in accessible language and is suitable reading for everyone interested in
the future of mediation practice.

Mediation is a procedure in which an intermediary without decision-making powers (the
mediator) systematically facilitates communication between the parties of a conflict with
the aim of enabling the parties themselves to take responsibility for resolving their dispute.
Mediation is a highly flexible and adaptable process—a factor that can create challenges
for regulators. In fact, some people suggest that mediation should not be regulated at all.
Yet, mediation does not and cannot exist in a regulatory vacuum.

   Box 1.1: Laws regulate

   In examining the laws of mediation, it is useful to think of law in terms of regulation. We make laws
   to regulate our behavior to one another, and those laws can derive from the state, self-management
   through contract or industry norms, and the marketplace. For example, dispositive (or default) law
   permits private parties to tailor rules to regulate their business relationship. Typically, this tailoring
   occurs through contractual arrangements such as agreements to mediate or mediation clauses.

  Box 1.2: Case illustration—Working Group
  on Mediation

  The Department of Justice of Hong Kong SAR, China, set up the Working Group on Mediation
  in 2008. Wong Yan Lung, senior council and a former secretary for justice, chaired the group. A
  cross-sector body, the working group comprised representatives from the Judiciary; the Legal Aid
  Department; legal professional bodies; universities; and alternative dispute resolution organizations.
  Its purpose was to review the development of mediation services in Hong Kong SAR, China,
  following the October 2007 policy address of Donald Tsang, the then–chief executive of Hong Kong
  SAR, China, “to map out plans to employ mediation more extensively and effectively in Hong Kong
  in handling higher-end commercial disputes and relatively small scale local disputes.”a

  The working group published its report in February 2010 with 48 recommendations that cover three
  policy areas:
  ■■ Training and accreditation
  ■■ Public education and publicity
  ■■ Regulatory framework for mediation

  In relation to the area of legal framework, Recommendation 33 suggests the introduction of a
  Mediation Ordinance and 15 recommendations deal with various aspects of the proposed Mediation
  Ordinance.

  After the report was published, a mediation task force was established to implement the policy.
  Once the work of the task force was complete, the Department of Justice under the subsequent
  secretary for justice, Rimsky Yuen, set up the Steering Committee on Mediation to continue ongoing
  mediation policy work in Hong Kong.

Mediation is often thought of as a process that is connected to the courts, and this connection
certainly can be the case. However, mediation is also the product of private business–based
initiatives, as figure 2.1 and comments demonstrate.



THE REGULATORY LANDSCAPE FOR
MEDIATION DRAWS ON THE PUBLIC AND
PRIVATE SECTORS
A number of key points need to be made in relation to figure 2.1:

   central argument for private sector involvement in mediation                  potential for maximum
   reforms is that it maximizes the scope and application of interventions           benefit in a given
   and hence its likely effectiveness. Private sector participation also                   context.
   involves mediation users or potential users in the reform process, thus
   increasing awareness and use of mediation.
■■ The overlap area of the public and private sectors is also critical and may
   generate particular effects. The area offers opportunities for each sector to
   enhance implementation of mediation in the other. For example, a court (public body)
   may have a mediation referral program that refers cases to private sector mediators.
   Here, the public and private sectors work together. This practice is called the court-
   related mediation market model, and it is discussed with examples subsequently in this
   chapter. At the same time, note that mediation regulatory projects can still be effective
   whether they focus exclusively in the private or public sector.

   Box 2.1: Case illustration—Singapore

   In Singapore, the justice model was introduced as a pilot with district court judges as mediators.
   In 1995, the Primary Dispute Resolution Centre was established at the state courts. Now called the
   Centre for Dispute Resolution, it provides alternative services for all court cases. Mediating judges,
   or settlement judges, are trained in interest-based mediation and do not hear trials; instead, they
   specialize in mediation. Surveys indicate a settlement rate of more than 85 percent and high levels
   of satisfaction with judicial mediation. This court-based mediation model was free for litigants until
   May 2015, when fees were introduced at S$250 per party for district court mediation. With the civil
   jurisdiction of the district court ranging from S$60,000 to S$250,000, S$250 is a small amount
   compared to the value of the disputes. The amount is affordable—but it is a sufficiently serious
   amount for parties to settle their dispute out of court. Overall, the model can still be characterized as
   the justice model because mediation is seen as an integral part of the justice system and therefore a
   function of the court. Note that mediation services are still free for all other nondistrict court disputes
   (magistrate’s court claims under S$60,000, claims for harassment, and others). When mediation
   results in settlement, such settlements may be directly enforceable as court orders.

     Box 2.2: Case illustrations—Marketplace models

     In Bosnia and Herzegovina, a court-related mediation marketplace model was introduced. Mediations
     are conducted by mediators in a center outside of the courts. However, initial training and education
     in mediation is free to judges as well as to lawyers and others outside the courts to encourage
     understanding and awareness. Such training and education also encourage referrals by court.

     In Hong Kong SAR, China, a court-related mediation marketplace model operates with Practice
     Direction 31 requiring prelitigation mediation in most civil cases. Parties can obtain mediators
     privately or through a range of mediation institutions. In addition, the courts house the Joint
     Mediation Helpline Office (JMHO). The JMHO has been set up by eight mediation centers with
     the support. The JMHO manages a list of mediators and offers information about mediation and
     mediators to the general public.

   In Bangladesh, a community mediation program uses a multitier structure of village mediation
   committees to deliver informal nonbinding mediation services. The program is built on an existing
   traditional dispute resolution system and on a system of educated and trained women mediators
   to increase access to the services for female members of the community. Community mediation
   services can help resolve (a) commercial disputes in which businesses operate at the village level or
   (b) construction disputes that involve members of a village and land rights issues.

     In Hong Kong SAR, China, mediation to resolve investment disputes enjoyed high-profile media
     coverage in the Lehman Brothers–related minibond disputes.a After the collapse of Lehman Brothers,
     about 48,000 investor who had bought HK$20 billion in investment products issued or linked to
     Lehman Brothers complained to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) about the banks that
     sold them the products. In 2008, the HKMA appointed the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre
     (HKIAC) as the service provider for the Lehman Brothers–related Investment Products Dispute
     Mediation and Arbitration Scheme. The HKMA referred more than 1,000 cases involving 16 banks
     to the HKIAC. Most disputes were settled within a week of appointment of the mediators, and the
     mediations did not exceed five hours.

     Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau proposed establishing the Financial Dispute Resolution
     Centre (FDRC) in Hong Kong SAR, China, to specifically handle financial disputes.b The FDRC
     came into operation in 2012 as an independent and impartial organization administering the Financial
     Dispute Resolution Scheme (FDRS). Financial institutions authorized by the HKMA and licensed by
     the Securities and Futures Commission are members of the FDRS administered by the FDRC.c

     In 2007, the Hong Kong Mediation Council introduced a pilot scheme for mediation of low-value
     construction disputes. The pilot ran for a year until August 31, 2008, and was then extended to August
     31, 2009.d Under this pilot, mediation was provided by an accredited mediator pro bono—or no fee—
     for up to eight hours for disputes up to HK$3 million. A mediator fee of HK$1,500 per hour was borne
     by both parties equally (unless otherwise agreed) for mediation time beyond the eight hours. More
     recently, the pilot scheme has been replaced by the Construction Mediation Scheme, which deals
     with construction disputes of differing values. The scheme aims to encourage and facilitate wider and
     further uses of mediation, and it is administered by the HKIAC.e

   Box 2.6: Case illustration—Australia

   Australia offers an example of a jurisdiction that features access to mediation in all four quadrants.
   Mediation commenced in the early 1980s through a variety of community justice initiatives
   (community mediation model) focusing on neighborhood and family disputes. In the early 1990s,
   formalized state court mediation schemes were introduced around the country using the court-related
   mediation marketplace model. The federal court of Australia offered—in addition to the marketplace
   model—mediation conducted by senior court registrars (court-related mediation justice model).
   In this model, mediators are not judges but full-time court employees who are trained in interest-
   based mediation and specialize in mediating in the court. Many specialized quasi-judicial tribunals
   in Australia (for example, the Australian Administrative Tribunal) also offer a version of the justice
   model. The final model to develop in Australia has been private sector mediation (for example,
   private prelitigation commercial mediation). Whereas private mediation has long been offered, the
   demand for it has varied. The introduction of the court-related mediation marketplace model helped
   boost private mediation. In 2015, a high level of public awareness and a proliferation of industry-
   based schemes helped develop the private mediation sector.

WHY DO WE NEED A DISPUTE
RESOLUTION POLICY?
As indicated previously, policy refers to a strategy or a plan—and it may include a set of
principles—proposed by a government, an institution, or an organization.

What is a good dispute resolution policy, and what does it aim for? A dispute resolution
policy refers to a plan and a guiding set of principles to introduce and then to roll out
different forms of dispute resolution. Such a policy aims for the resolution
of conflicts such that the legitimate interests of the parties involved are
satisfied. Why are informal negotiations and formal court proceedings not
sufficient to achieve this goal? Different parties have different interests                What is a good

a mechanism that solves their dispute for the lowest cost and creates the
most favorable benefits. Policies that permit and facilitate dispute resolution

essential building block for a prosperous and just society.

     Box 3.1: Example—Why we need mediation

     A 2007 study by the United Kingdom’s National Audit Office collected statistical data for family
     disputes in the years 2004 to 2006.a According to the study, the average costs of mediation were
     £752, whereas court proceedings accounted for more than twice as much—£1,682. Assuming that
     the state provides financial assistance for mediation as well as for court proceedings, this finding
     meant that aggregate costs amounted to almost £74 for the taxpayer because mediation was not used
     in appropriate cases. Also, the mediations covered by the study were resolved more quickly than
     court proceedings were. The mediations needed an average of 110 days, while the court proceedings
     lasted an average of 435 days.

     A mediation pledge is a statement in which the signatories promise a principled approach to conflict
     resolution with a stronger focus on mediation. A mediation pledge can be part of a more general
     pledge for a systematic approach to dispute resolution with a focus on alternative dispute resolution;
     the general pledge is then called an ADR (alternative dispute resolution) pledge. Most often, such a
     pledge takes the form of a public statement. For example, a company may pledge to always consider
     and try mediation, if suitable, before going to court.

     Mediation pledges are being used in many countries, including France, Germany, Poland, Singapore,
     the United Kingdom, and the United States.

     Box 4.2: Illustrations of regulatory form

     Legislation: The German Mediation Act 2012 establishes duties of mediators and rights of parties
     in mediation.
     Ordinance: The Hong Kong Mediation Ordinance regulates confidentiality and nonadmissibility.

     Framework regulation: The European Directive on Civil and Commercial Mediation is designed to
     achieve homogeny and predictability in mediations of commercial disputes.

     Court Practice Directions: Practice Direction 31 in Hong Kong SAR, China, requires parties to
     mediate before litigating when it is reasonable to do so.

     Court precedent (common law): Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States
     have much case law on confidentiality, enforcement of mediated settlement agreements, mediation
     clauses, and other issues.

     Nonlegislative standards: The Australian National Mediator Approval and Practice Standards provide
     one example; also, the International Chamber of Commerce mediation rules are another example of
     a set of international institutional rules that can be incorporated into parties’ mediation arrangements
     by private contract. Over time, they have a standardizing, harmonizing, and normalizing effect.

     Private contract: Agreements to regulate many aspects of mediation, particularly in the absence of
     legislation on the topic, for example, rights and duties of participants and mediator, confidentiality,
     requirements for mediated outcome (for example in writing), and so on.




     Box 4.3: Case illustration—Austria

     The Austrian experience provides a useful example of what happens when triggering mechanisms
     are not considered in the regulatory plan. Initially, mediation initiatives focused on the training and
     regulation of mediators and on the aspects of the mediation process, with little effort to incentivize
     demand. Consequently, despite extensive quality legislation relating to mediators, very few mediations
     took place. Subsequent efforts have focused on triggering mediation through nonlegislative means—
     or soft triggering—such as awareness programs at courts.

   Box 4.4: Case illustrations—Rules governing
   mediation

   In Hong Kong SAR, China, process primarily follows institutional rules, such as the Mediation Rules
   of the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre and the Hong Kong Mediation Accreditation
   Association Limited Mediator’s Code of Conduct. When these rules are incorporated into mediation
   clauses and agreements to mediate, they become binding on the parties involved. The Hong Kong
   Mediation Ordinance (see box 1.2) does not deal with process, apart from a detailed definition
   of mediation that describes an interest-based process and a section expressly permitting foreign
   lawyers and nonlawyers to support parties in mediation.

   In France, internal mediation processes are regulated by the numerous codes of conduct and ethics
   drafted by different regional or national mediation centers in the country. Legislation on mediation
   deals with other aspects of mediation such as rights and obligations (see below).

   In the United Kingdom, there is little general legislation about cross-border mediation and no
   legislation on domestic mediation. Detailed rules on the internal process of mediation are contained
   in institutional mediation rules and agreements to mediate.




   Box 4.5: Case illustration—Mediation accreditation

   Mediator accreditation (certification) in Hong Kong SAR, China, is voluntary. Nothing legally
   prevents anyone who does not have accreditation from offering mediation services. This statement
   remains true even with the enforcement of the Mediation Ordinance 2013. (box 1.2) So why do
   people bother getting accredited? The answer lies in the power of industry and professional self-
   regulation.

   After its establishment in 2013, the Hong Kong Mediation Accreditation Association Limited
   (HKMAAL) quickly became the premier mediation accreditation body in Hong Kong SAR, China.
   At the time of this writing, more than 2,000 general accredited mediators are on HKMAAL’s panels.
   In Hong Kong SAR, China, the value of professional accreditation is recognized by the majority of
   stakeholders: mediators; users of mediation services (for example, litigants); and referring bodies,
   such as courts, professional associations, and dispute resolution organizations. Further, by adopting
   accreditation-friendly mediation rules and codes such as the Hong Kong Mediation Code, referral
   bodies and mediation users continue to encourage accreditation as a foundation for professional
   practice.

    Box 4.7: Case illustration—Training

    In most common law jurisdictions, including Australia; Canada; Hong Kong SAR, China; New
    Zealand; and the United States, mediation training often consists of 40 hours of specialized,
    interactive skills training followed by role-play assessment and, in some cases, a written assessment.
    Other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, require fewer hours.

    In most civil law jurisdictions, training ranges from 90 to 400 hours conducted in three-day blocks
    over one to two years (for example, Austria, approximately 370 hours; Germany, approximately
    150 hours; France, approximately 100 to 200 hours; Belgium, approximately 90 hours). Assessment
    includes theoretical and practical components and usually a number of live cases and reports on
    those cases.

    In civil and common law countries, once training and assessment have been completed, mediator
    candidates can apply for mediator certification (also called accreditation or credentialing). Some
    countries such as Australia and Austria require mediators to obtain professional indemnity insurance
    to secure a place on the panel.




   Box 4.8: Case illustration—Professional development

   Most civil and common law countries have continual professional development (CPD) requirements
   for mediators to retain their certification. Some jurisdictions also have practice requirements.
   ■■ Australia: CPD 25 hours over two years, plus mediation practice hours
   ■■ Austria: CPD 50 hours over five years
   ■■ Belgium: CPD 18 hours over two years
   ■■ France: No national standard; however, can be up to CPD 20 hours each year depending on
      certifying organization
   ■■ Hong Kong SAR, China: CPD 15 hours over three years

   Box 4.10: Did you know? Three kinds of
   confidentiality

   The following tripartite classification of confidentiality covers the various situations of confidentiality
   in mediation: insider–outsider confidentiality, insider–insider confidentiality, and insider–court
   confidentiality.

   Insider–outsider confidentiality refers to a general duty of confidentiality in the face of outside
   parties. This classification means that those parties involved in a mediation (insiders) cannot make
   prohibited disclosures to people outside the mediation (outsiders). The duty can apply to the various
   participants in mediation, such as the parties, mediators, advisers, experts, interpreters, witnesses, and
   relevant support staff. The duty prohibits those participants from disclosing mediation information
   to outsiders or nonparticipants. An example can be found in the United Nations Commission on
   International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on International Commercial Conciliation,
   article 9.a

   Insider–insider confidentiality regulates the flow of information in mediation, especially in
   relation to private sessions—also known as caucuses—between the mediator and a party. As
   a matter of practice, mediators manage insider–insider confidentiality in one of two ways: the
   open communication approach or the in-confidence approach. In the former, information passed
   to mediators in private sessions is not treated as confidential unless specifically requested by the
   relevant party. The other approach, the in-confidence model, operates by treating all information
   disclosed privately as confidential unless otherwise indicated by the disclosing party. An example
   of the open communication approach can be found in UNCITRAL Model Law on International
   Commercial Conciliation, article 8.

   Insider–court confidentiality involves the rights and obligations associated with protecting these
   mediation communications from being legally discovered or admitted in evidence in court and
   arbitral proceedings. It is categorized as a specific form of insider–outsider confidentiality in which
   the court is the outsider. Technically, however, this area is not about confidentiality but rather about
   admissibility of evidence. Specifically, it is about the admissibility of mediation communications in
   evidence in court or tribunal proceedings. An example can be found in UNCITRAL Model Law on
   International Commercial Conciliation, article 10.

     Box 4.12: Case illustration—United Kingdom

     As indicated earlier in the chapter in the discussion on mediation triggering mechanisms, parties in
     the United Kingdom may face cost sanctions for failing to reasonably engage in mediation. While
     this provision applies to premediation behavior, the British case of Earl of Malmesbury v. Strutt and
     Parkera suggests that the duty might extend to the mediation itself. In this case, the court considered
     the application of cost sanctions in relation to a party’s unreasonable behavior in mediation, arguably
     falling short of good faith participation in the process. The case dealt with a dispute in which the Earl
     ultimately prevailed in court, but the financial quantum awarded was significantly less than both his
     claim and his final offer at mediation.

     The judge, Justice Jack, made the following comments:
        [T]he claimant’s position at the mediation was plainly unrealistic and unreasonable. Had they
        made an offer which better reflected their true position, the mediation might have succeeded.
     The judge equated the behavior of a party who had agreed to mediate and then acted unreasonably
     with that of a party who unreasonably refused to mediate. Under the British Civil Procedure Rules
     of 1999, the latter behavior could be taken into account in cost determinations. Therefore, the court
     considered it appropriate to take the former category of behavior into account.
     In this case, both parties waived privilege so that evidence from the mediation could be considered
     in relation to the award of costs.

   Box 4.13: Did you know? Two models for dealing
   with costs and mediation

   There are two models for regulatory approaches to costs. They can be distinguished according to the
   type of incentives provided for the conflict parties.  

   In the first regulatory model, a mediation costs rule that applies to the parties may never create costs
   for the state. This principle can be observed in the costs laws of the United Kingdom mentioned in
   box 4.12.

   There, a party that rejects an attempted alternative dispute resolution can be held liable for the costs
   of litigation even when it succeeds with the claim in court. On closer examination, this cost incentive
   is created only through a threatened redistribution between the parties rather than through monetary
   incentives provided for by the state.

   The second regulatory model aims at avoiding net costs for funding the court system (in particular,
   by avoiding unnecessary court cases). To reduce net costs for the treasury, however, countries that
   use this model provide cost incentives for mediation that lead directly to additional expenses for the
   state. For example, the costs laws of Sacramento County, California, provide for an initial financial
   grant for the first three hours of mediation. A rate of US$200 an hour is set for those first three hours
   of work by court-recognized mediators, and it is met by the court budget. The expectation is that
   this mediation incentive will avoid court cases that would create even greater costs for the treasury.

   In addition, a cost incentive in favor of mediation is the fact that the usual costs of mediation
   are lower than the usual costs of litigation and arbitration, without the state intervening to exert
   regulatory control.

                                 Where mediation use is low, consider using triggers with strong incentives or

                               implements the European Mediation Directive (EU-Mediations-Gesetz).
                               In Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, extensive mediation laws were enacted
                               by the state and civil procedure codes amended to support the development of
                               mediation and regulate its operation.
                               Japan is a further example of this regulation model. In the field of conciliation and
                               mediation, Japan has two general procedural law sources in statutory form, and
                               subordinate legislative provisions supplement them.
                               Arguments raised in favor of a high regulatory density are consumer protection, the
                               need for state promotion of mediation, legal certainty, and the necessity to draw a

  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s OECD Guiding Principles for
  Regulatory Quality and Performancea provides a useful policy illustration. Adopted by the OECD
  Council in 2005, it endorses a regulation mix that promotes “innovation though market incentives
  and goal-based approaches” and is compatible with “competition, trade investment-facilitating
  principles at domestic and international levels.” These principles echo those of legal reform projects
  that promote mediation as a dispute management mechanism that provides benefits for trade and
  investment and economic growth and stability. They are also reflective of the principles of interest-
  based mediation itself.

SUCCESS FACTORS
Mediation offers attractive characteristics, namely (a) cost and time advantages, (b) high
success and satisfaction rates, and (c) flexibility to maximize the fulfillment of the interests
of the parties. Still, mediation policy and the regulatory context play an important role
in providing an attractive environment for the parties to choose the dispute resolution
mechanism that best suits their interests. Important success factors for the regulation of
mediation are as follows:
■■ Institutional integration of mediation. The challenge is to design dispute resolution
   institutions that guide conflicts to mediation if the mechanism is best
   suited to satisfy the interests of the parties (box 5.1).
■■ Enabling mediation law. Mediation policy should provide a reliable
                                                                                          Mediation

                                                                                       offers attractive
   putting mediation on an equal footing with other dispute resolution
   mechanisms. This policy applies to both private and judicial                    characteristics, namely
   mediation.                                                                  (a) cost and time advantages,

■■ Incentives to counter predictable human error. Regulatory incentives
   and other impulses can influence human behavior in dispute resolution
   and can be an effective strategy to counter parties from making choices
   that potentially are not in their interests. Such incentives, even if they generate costs, are
   often a less expensive solution for public finances compared with funding a court system
   that does not always fit the conflict needs of the parties (box 5.2).

     Box 5.1: Institutional integration

     An example of institutional integration of mediation can be illustrated by judges screening incoming
     cases on the basis of a questionnaire. The questionnaire asks the parties to reveal mediation indicators.
     Such indicators are characteristics of the dispute that show whether it is suited for mediation. If the
     court considers the case suited for mediation, the court will issue a recommendation to the parties
     to try mediation.




     Box 5.2: Incentives


     Examples of incentives to manage decision deficits of parties affected by disputes include the
     following:
     ■■ A duty for lawyers to discuss (and document) the suitability of dispute resolution with their
        clients
     ■■ A requirement on parties to engage in mediation before court when it is reasonable to do so
     ■■ A subsidy for the first hour of a mediation

   This appendix outlines particular issues of cross-border and online mediations. They are
   independent developments, cross-border and online mediations are also interrelated in
   practice. For example, it is not uncommon for some parts of cross-border mediations such
   as preliminary meetings to be conducted online or through telecommunications.

   Consider a dispute resolution clause signed in the Arab Republic of Egypt as part of a
   commercial banking contract by parties from Lebanon and France. The clause stipulates
   that the United Arab Emirates’ substantive law is to apply to the resolution of any dispute
   arising out of the contract and that mediation is to be the initial dispute resolution process.
   The mediator is from Switzerland, and she is subject to the applicable professional code
   of mediator conduct in Switzerland. The place of mediation is to be in London,
   and the British law on mediation (procedural law) prima facie applies to the
   mediation process. However, initial discussions between the mediator and
   the parties with their lawyers take place on videoconference using Internet             The clause stipulates

   CROSS-BORDER MEDIATION:
   REGULATORY INSTRUMENTS
   Mediation regulation first developed domestically. On a cross-border level, mediation
   regulation has become increasingly relevant. With the opening of more geopolitical borders
   and the rise in online transactions, the regulation of cross-border mediation is a highly
   topical matter.
