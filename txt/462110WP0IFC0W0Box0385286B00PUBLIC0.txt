          Report Abstract

          This report analyzes the current status of Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) technology deployment in developing countries and
          investigates the success factors in countries where WHR has become widely spread. The report then focuses on the in-depth
          analysis of WHR potential and enabling factors in eleven country markets in Africa (Nigeria, South Africa), South Asia (India,
          Pakistan), Middle East (Egypt, Turkey), Latin America (Brazil, Mexico) and East Asia (Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam). The report
          maps out major WHR equipment suppliers. In addition, the report includes a brief analysis of business and project models used
          internationally to support WHR deployment.

Executive Summary

Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) is a proven technology,                                         shows average installation costs for Chinese-manufactured
but until now WHR uptake has been limited except in                                       WHR installations in China, Asia and Europe/Middle East and
China. As early as the 1980s, Japanese companies spear-                                   North Africa.1

cement industry. Currently, there are a range of commercially-
proven and mature WHR power systems ranging from classic                                                Chinese-manufactured WHR Equipment

       fused into new mineralogical phases when heated to around                       consumption in the kiln and the de-carbonation of limestone

          stucco, and most non-specialty grout. It consists of ground Portland
          cement clinker (more than 90 percent), a limited amount of calcium
                                                                                       however today in most countries the primary fuel in use is
          sulfate (which controls the set time) and up to five percent minor           coal because it is relatively low cost and the coal ash can add
          constituents as allowed by various standards such as the European
                                                                                       necessary minerals to the cement product. Indirect emissions

Cement industry CO2 reduction strategies are focused on
reducing the emissions intensity of cement production
(emissions per ton of cement product). Approaches include
installing more fuel-efficient kilns, using less carbon-intensive
fuels in the kiln, partial substitution of noncarbonated sources
of CaO in the kiln raw materials, and partial substitution of
supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) such as blast
furnace slag, fly ash and limestone for OPC in finished cement
products. Because SCMs do not require the energy-intensive
clinker production (kiln) phase of cement production, their
use, or the use of inert additive or extenders, reduces CO2
intensity of the final product. The use of SCM and other
materials for blended cement is growing worldwide (Crow
2008). For example, in the United States, the ASTM C-595
standard for blended cement was amended in 2012 to allow
the addition of up to 15 percent limestone in certain blends.
Research continues on developing cements that require less
energy to manufacture than OPC and/or to use more benign
raw materials.

Mexico had 59.3 GW of installed electricity generation capac-
ity in 2009. Preliminary Mexican government statistics indicate
that electricity generation increased by at least 3.0 percent
per year in 2010 and 2011. Conventional thermal plants pro-
vide most of Mexico’s electricity capacity and generation, and
industry accounts for 60 percent of power sales.

The state-owned Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) is the
dominant player in the generation sector, controlling over
three-fourths of installed generating capacity. CFE has a mo-
nopoly on electricity transmission and distribution. In 2009,
CFE absorbed the operations of Luz y Fuerza del Centro, a
state-owned company that managed electricity distribution in
Mexico City. The Comisión Reguladora de Energía (CRE) has
principal regulatory oversight of the electricity sector.

The Public Electricity Service Act of 1975 established exclusive
Federal responsibility over the electricity industry through CFE,
but amendments to Mexican law in 1992 partially opened
electricity generation to the private sector. Private participation
in electricity generation is now permitted in certain catego-
ries, including for construction, and self-supply, cogeneration,
Independent Power Producer (IPP), small production (under
30 MW), and import/export. Companies seeking to establish
private electricity generating capacity or begin importing and/or
exporting electric power must obtain a permit from CRE.

        in 2011, according to EIA’s latest estimates (DOE 2013a).

        The chronic electricity shortages are attributed to lack of invest-
        ment in new power infrastructure and gas supply infrastructure
        to capture the natural gas that is being flared. According to
        a World Bank report, Nigeria experienced power outages on
        average for 46 days per year from 2007-2008, and outages
        lasted almost six hours on average. Population growth and un-
        derinvestment in the electricity sector has increased power de-
        mand without any significant increases in capacity. Inadequate
        maintenance, insufficient fuel, and an inadequate transmission
        network also contribute to electricity sector problems.

           500 to 900 MW in India. Estimated WHR potential is an             project, and local construction and labor rates, however,
           obvious parameter in gauging relative market priorities for       high-priced grid power is a strong driver for WHR:
