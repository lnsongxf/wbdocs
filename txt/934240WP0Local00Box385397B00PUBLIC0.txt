                                       of Indonesia’s rural districts and more than 60,000
                                       villages. Through PNPM, communities have shown
                                       that with support, funding and opportunities
                                       they are capable of planning for quite complex
                                       projects (see, among others, Voss 2008; Syukri et
                                       al. 2010; Barron et al. 2011).

                                       Such CDD programs emphasize participation,
                                       transparency, and accountability in their
                                       operations. The intent is that these practices will
                                       be more broadly adopted and integrated into
                                       village governance. Assessments have shown,
                                       however, that the extent to which such principles
                                       proliferate beyond project activities depends
                                       largely on the skills of the program facilitators.
                                       As CDD projects have proliferated to cover all
                                       villages, ensuring high quality facilitation has
                                       been an accompanying challenge (AKATIGA
                                       2010; Sari, Rahman, & Manaf 2011). The extent to
                                       which CDD programs really embody the expected
                                       principles is thus variable, as are the possibilities
                                       for transfer of principles and structures beyond
                                       the programs (Barron, Diprose, & Woolcock 2011).
                                       The overall patterns remain unclear. Given the
                                       weak accountability mechanism and limited
                                       funds for villages to manage, CDD projects,
                                       such as PNPM, appear to serve as a stopgap, to
                                       facilitate villagers to participate actively in their
                                       village development through projects, rather
                                       than institutionalized mechanisms for providing
                                       input to village government leaders in the use of
                                       community resources.

                                       In summary, the shifts in democratization,
                                       decentralization and CDD projects have signaled
                                       some positive changes at the village level.
                                       However, these shifts have not yet resulted in
                                       institutionalized practices that consistently
                                       empower villages to have more control over their
                                       village leaders and voice in the direction of their
                                       development.

 THE LOCAL LEVEL INSTITUTION STUDY 3
BOX 1:
Summary of major findings from first round LLI research (LLI1)
I. Positive link between social capital and household welfare
Households with high social capital stocks have higher expenditure per capita, more assets, higher savings,
and better access to credit. The main reasons given for joining groups are benefits for household livelihood
and protection against future risk. Social capital plays a role in household welfare through (i) sharing
of information among association members, (ii) reduction of opportunistic behavior, and (iii) improved
collective decision making. The effect of social capital stocks on household welfare is roughly similar to that
of human capital endowments. Returns to investments in social capital are higher for the poor than for the
general population.

II. Strong local capacity for collective action
More than 80% of households surveyed in the first round participated at least once in community activities
to meet collective needs during the past year. Communities plan and implement almost as many projects
as the government does, and community projects are better able to reach intended beneficiaries and
considerably better at maintaining completed projects. Even communities with relatively weak organizing
capacity have effective groups and projects, but they are fewer, smaller scale, and tend to be undertaken at
the neighborhood, rather than the village, level.

III. Government does not work well with the existing capacity
In general, the Indonesian government has not been successful in working with existing capacity to improve
planning and implementation of projects and services. Collaborations tend to take place within communities,
with similar groups rather than with government. Eighty percent of linkages outside the community are
with groups not initiated by government. However, communities with high organizing capacity tend to have
better performing village governments, pointing to improved accountability and participation in government
decisions in communities that are better able to organize.

IV. Disconnect between communities and government
Village level government tends to represent higher levels of government, rather than village constituents.
The government has undermined local capacity through restrictions on organizing projects and services, as
well as low levels of support for community-initiated projects (12% of funds come from the government with
the remainder largely raised by community donations). The government’s bottom-up planning process is
not responsive to locally identified needs and does not reward better organizing capacity. Mismanagement
of project funds and failure of government-initiated projects has led to disillusionment with government
provision of services.

Exceptions occur in cases where pro-active village heads (found in less than one third of communities) are
able to facilitate linkages between government and community leaders and mediate in conflicts. In cases
where village heads are not seen as cooperative, the only option is to break off relations (more than half of
active community groups report no active involvement with village head). Communities with the lowest
organizing capacities also have the worst performing village governments.

V. Government barriers have resulted in institutional gaps
Largely due to restrictions on private service provision, institutions that could have important consequences
for poverty alleviation and political development are missing at the community level. Most notably, groups
for collective production and marketing, environmental management, and political organizations aside from
village government are absent.

of the data gathered, the purposive selection

     BOX 2:
     Summary of LLI2 findings
     The second round of the LLI study in 2000/2001 took stock of social capital, local capacity, and state-society
     relations since LLI1 in 1996.

     I. Shifting organizational landscape:	
                                          There was a decline in memberships in government-initiated groups,
     which many households had replaced with participation in

     II. Problem-solving capacity remains:	  Sixty-five percent of problems identified by villagers were completely
     or partially solved. Unsolved problems were often those of overwhelming scope. Capable village officials could
     augment village capacity to solve non-local problems, but if such official willingness or ability was absent,
     high capacity communities found external agents to help them address non-local problems. Higher levels
     of organizational membership were associated with higher local capacity but more frequent participation
     in mandatory organizations was associated with lower capacity. There was also a tendency for low capacity
     communities to enter a vicious cycle; past inability to solve problems undermined cooperation and sometimes
     increased competition such that new challenges were even more unlikely to be overcome.

     III. Some opening of village government, but little effect on outcomes:	      In spite of political changes
     underway after 1998, villagers reported little participation in planning, with women and poor households
     particularly unlikely to participate. Government projects show some increased opportunities for villagers to
     contribute to decision-making, but most projects still produce unsatisfactory outcomes. Villagers had initiated
     protests against many village leaders, but these rarely brought lasting change. Even for newly elected village
     heads who were more open to community input, good intentions were difficult to sustain as there had been
     little change in surrounding institutions, such as accountability mechanisms, and means of rewarding better
     performance. The BPD were operating in some villages but faced the same limitations as other officials (no clear
     expectations of improvement, passive, inadequate compensation).

     IV.Recommendations:	    Further decentralization should ensure that local government enhances local problem-
     solving capacity and needs for accountability mechanisms. An important element of reform is to introduce
     a reward structure that encourages village officials to identify local needs and support community problem-
     solving efforts.

     External projects should identify how resources are best channeled into the community to integrate with local
     problem-solving efforts and with local government channels. Designs need to include mechanisms to merge
     community and government leadership roles in project implementation to allow for selection of individuals
     with the most appropriate skills, connections, and resources in a given project.

What effect have changes in government at the
village and district levels had on local capacity?17

  programs benefit villagers. Districts have few
  mechanisms to identify local needs, but for
  the most part are responsive to village officials

  local priorities or problems. Many supra-village

  IV. Organization of report

  The report is organized to allow the reader to
  focus on particular aspects of the study. Those
  who wish to further familiarize themselves
  with the conceptual framework underlying the
  study and the methods used should continue
  to Chapter 2. Readers interested in specific
  elements of the research can skip ahead to
  subsequent chapters, which loosely correspond
  to the research questions. Chapter 3 outlines
  the problems villages face and assesses overall
  capacity, while chapter 4 identifies existing
  capacity and factors underlying changes in
  problem-solving ability. Chapter 5 focuses on
  changes in the organizational landscape, and
  household participation in the groups and
  activities of which it is composed. The role of the

  LLI3 is an empirical investigation of the patterns
  of state-society relations in the research sites and
  what their implications are for villagers’ efforts
  to address problems. We look at “historically
  specific constellations of power and interest”
  (Hadiz 2010, 7) and their consequences for
  and interactions with local capacity over the
  three rounds of the LLI study.20 Even slight or
  partial shifts in power relations between the
  village head and villagers, as well as between
  the village and supra-village governments may
  have an effect on what problems are addressed,
  the extent to which they are resolved, or whose
  problems are viewed as collective issues worthy
  of attention. For instance, the reduced control of
  the military over timber and mining concessions
  during the past decade has enabled villagers to
  negotiate directly with companies over access
  and distribution of benefits (Wollenberg 2009,
  251). Although communities may not be equal

incidence occurred for “scarcity of land and/or
natural resources” , “irrigation”, and all social  	
problems. However, problems with “drinking
water,” “infrastructure”, and devastation of
productive resources (crop failure, forest fire,
livestock epidemic) have increased substantially
since LLI2. All told, for these nine types of pre-
listed problems, their incidence across the entire
LLI study area declined from approximately 2,500
problems reported in LLI2 to approximately 2,100
problems reported.

For each problem type, the household survey
respondents can also indicate whether the
problems listed are collective and communally-
experienced or whether they affect less than
a majority of households in any locality.
For example, Chart 1 below demonstrates
that “drinking water” – and perhaps also
“infrastructure” – became less of a personal
problem and more of a collective problem

BOX 3:
Water management system in Pelem

Pelem is a hamlet of 54 households in Beral, Central Java. Like other parts of the village,
the hamlet has problems with accessing water. Water scarcity, especially in the dry season,
regularly sparks disputes among villagers. Residents have tried different distribution systems to
deal with the problems.

In the rainy season when water is relatively easy to get, there are three sources of water:
       The water spring nearby (available all year round).
       	
       The public water tank: a large tank (more than 3 cubic meters) to catch rain water that
       was built by the villagers and is located in a villager’s front yard. Villagers can get water
       for free here.

      Two rain-fed wells, also built by villagers.

In the dry season they get their water from:
       Another water spring further away.
       	
       A villager who has a private water tank. This man buys water from a vendor at IDR
       100,000 for 5,000 liters (or IDR 20 per liter), which he resells at IDR 50 per liter. Most
       villagers buy the water in 10 or 20 liter cans. One villager said she usually spent IDR 5,000
       a day on water.
      	 he public water tank, which villagers take turn to buy water to fill. However, this does
      T
      not always work fairly as people living close to the public tank use a disproportionate
      amount of water.

Quarrels over water often happened when people were queuing at the water springs, for
example if a villager brought multiple cans to fill, making others wait longer for their turn. The
neighborhood head came up with the idea to draw up a schedule for collection of water from
the spring. There are 54 households in the hamlet, so each day eight households are allowed
to get water from the spring. Each household has three hours to fill their tanks (120-150 liters).
This schedule works well.

BOX 4:
Continuous problems with water in Mataloko, NTT
Water is an on-going problem for villagers in Mataloko. The ward has two water springs, both
of which have plenty of water. But the first serves only the area immediately around the spring;
villagers outside that area have to walk for one kilometer to get the water. The second spring
does not really provide water to the ward, as it has been diverted to other users. Some decades
ago (1960s), the villagers had an agreement with the local parish: the church provided pipes
and got a share of the water (the parish is located between the spring and the community
settlement). Later, the head of the clan that controls the land on which the spring is located
made another agreement to divert water to a neighboring village. As Mataloko’s population
grew, villages needed more water.

In 2006 the village, funded by KDP/PNPM (IDR 350 million), got three electronic pumps to get
water from the spring but the project did not work. No water could be pumped up. KDP teams
and consultants from Kupang could not solve the problem, either, and the water tanks and
pipes were left unused.

In 2008, the neighboring village, funded by PNPM, was able to pipe the water from the spring
within Mataloko’s boundaries. Since then clan leaders and the ward head have initiated
negotiations with the parish and the neighboring village to regain access, but these discussions
have not been successful.

With funds from central government and assistance from experts from as far away as Bandung,
in 2010 the ward got an artesian well. But there was no electricity to run the pump and villagers
could not afford the diesel for a generator, so the machinery was left idle and there was no
water for villagers.

In spite of the numerous efforts to address Mataloko’s water problems, villagers still have to
walk (or ride a motorcycle) one kilometer to get water. Wealthier households can buy water
from vendors or get piped water from the city water company, but these options are beyond
reach for many villagers.

BOX 5:
Reclaiming land in Kelok Sungai Besar, Jambi

In 1992, a palm oil plantation company started to clear land in Kelok Sungai Besar. There was no
discussion with the villagers beforehand and when they tried to stop the company, they were told that
they would receive compensation of IDR 200,000 for every hectare of their land and that they would
be given a large area of land to develop palm oil gardens in the plantation. However, the company
reneged on its promises.

In 1995, the villagers filed a suit against the company. This action was led by T, the present village head,
who hired a lawyer from a provincial legal aid organization. However, the suit was deemed unclear and
rejected in court.

In 2002, the village head mobilized villagers to rally to district parliament. They managed to get the
district parliament to form a team consisting of the local government, district parliament, and the
company to conduct fact finding in the field. The work resulted in an agreement to give 165 plots to
165 households. As of the end of 2002, the agreement remained on paper.

In 2003, the village head, his staff and other community leaders met and discussed a plan to occupy
the company’s plantation. They notified the local police, district head and other relevant institutions
about their plan. Villagers from 480 households, led by their neighborhood heads, divided the 1,680
hectares of land among them and tended to the plants. The district head gave a nod to this move as he
was about to run for re-election.

In 2008, the village head found out that the company had filed an application for land tax exemption
in the previous year. He then prepared all the documents to have the local land tax office issue the
land tax form and paid the tax to 2009. In 2009, villagers started to harvest the palm oil. Seeing this,
the company reported the villagers to the police for theft of the palm oil. Three villagers, including the
brother of the village head, were arrested, charged and put on trial. This case triggered rallies to free
the three, facilitated by a regional environmental group. The local media also helped bring the case
into the public eye; and when violence erupted, the National Commission for Human Rights and other
NGOs arrived on the scene and made the case national news. The court then discharged the three
villagers and an appeal by the attorney to the Supreme Court was denied.

Another major rally was conducted in 2010 to resolve the case, with the support of regional NGOs. An
agreement with the company was reached that villagers would get 168 lots in the plantation (2-2.5
hectares per lot) and the district head issued a decree to this effect. Other arrangements were made,
including a crop-sharing agreement (villagers and company to get 70% and 30%, respectively) and
an agreement that the villagers would pay for the land certificates and take out loans to develop the
plantation.

In the end, however, the agreement did not work out as expected. The villagers got just 83 lots, as the
remainder of the 168 lots had still not been planted. Turmoil continues, as another company had claims
on some parts of the disputed land, underscoring the precariousness of villagers’ gains.

  I. Introduction

  It is expected that during the 16-year period
  between the LLI1and LLI3 surveys and analytical
  activities, the organizational landscape that
  communities confront and in which they
  participate will have changed significantly.
  Likewise it is expected that the patterns
  of individual, household, and community
  participation in and contributions to that
  landscape, as well as the nature and extent of that
  landscape’s products for the same individuals,
  households, and communities, may have also
  changed significantly. The organizational

 fielded. Likewise, the average number of events                 evolution of per capita participation rates for all
 attended per activity has also fallen markedly:                 household members and for dependent members
 by approximately one-third from LLI1 to LLI2                    only (defined as any present household member
 (from six attended events per activity to four) and             who is under 13 or over 65 years old). These

 decline is composed of moderately-accelerating                  from LLI1 to LLI3, with the bulk of that change
 declines in Jambi, constant declines in Java, and               occurring after LLI2 was fielded: for example,
 a significant increase followed by an even larger               while an LLI household member accounted for
 decrease in NTT, between the LLI1 and LLI2 and                  approximately seven events in LLI1 and LLI2,

 Since LLI households in all study areas have                    suggest that even though households have
 become smaller and contain a higher ratio                       gotten smaller and older, participation rates
 of older to younger dependents (data not                        are falling across all sizes and profiles of

 participation rates could be due to changing                    do not explain the decrease in participation.

This observed fall in participation is confirmed                      As NTT accounts for three of four greater than ten

community groups at about 34 percent of its LLI1
level. Meanwhile, in NTT a steady decline across
all LLI rounds leaves government participation
in the establishment of community groups at
approximately 27 percent of its LLI1 level.

When governments stop establishing community
groups, neighbors, and to a slightly lesser extent,
NGOs/CSOs or churches/mosques, become more
involved in establishing these groups. Conversely,
when governments participate more in founding
community groups, neighbors and NGOs/CSOs
or churches/mosques scale back activities.
Overall, the large decrease, followed by a sizeable
increase, in government activity in founding
community groups in Central Java is largely due
to government dynamics. The changes in the
two other LLI regions – the new founding of
community groups by neighbors in Jambi and
NTT and by NGOs/CSOs/churches in NTT – tend to
wash out when aggregated across the entire LLI
study area.

These patterns partially confirm but also add
nuance to our hypothesis that government
founded groups would decline in importance. In
2002, relatively soon after the demise of the New
Order (and its drive to monopolize communal
life), governments everywhere let wither their
proclivity for establishing and/or regulating
formal organizations. However, after more
than a decade of persistent and unpredictable
innovations and revisions to the scale, scope,
and flexibility of decentralization and political
competition, governments in different regions
are taking divergent paths: in Jambi, they
have regained some ground, though they
remain far less involved than they were in and
around the LLI1 study period; in Java, they
have come back in force; and in NTT, their
participation in the organization of popular
community activities continues to decline. The
re-emergence (in some areas) of the state is also
reflected in the strengthened role of the village
head in problem-solving (see Chapter 3) and in
village government generally (Chapter 5).

data provide a general confirmation of the shift
in the average profile from LLI2 to LLI3. Table 10
summarizes the information available on participants’
attributes and demonstrates, for example, that in LLI1
“all household members” once had a much higher
share in total participation, with the highest share in
NTT followed by Jambi and then Java. That regional
ranking is similar to the ranking in LLI2 and LLI3 of
the “most household members” share, where that
category has the highest share of total participation
in NTT, followed by Jambi and Java. Table 10
also demonstrates that it is primarily household
members over 25 years of age who are participating,
regardless of activity type; so it is not implausible,
then, that household heads and spouses account
for the bulk of participation in LLI1 too. Finally, LLI1
data demonstrate that the ratio of female-to-male
participation was close to 70 in Jambi and NTT and
close to 115 in Java. This indicates that in Jambi,
the rate of women’s participation did not change
drastically between LLI1 and LLI2; that it may have
dropped significantly in Java from LLI1 to LLI2; and
that it may have already started improving in NTT
between LLI1 and LLI2.74

74 Generally, this divergent trajectories of change are not dissimilar
to the longitudinal trajectories in other facets of the LLI data discussed
earlier (e.g. overall rates of participation; level of government activity
in founding organizations; levels of formality): approximately constant
levels in Jambi between LLI1 and LLI2 and then noticeable change
between LLI2 and LLI3; noticeable fluctuations in Java between LLI1
and LLI2 that are then reversed between LLI2 and LLI3; and steadier
increases or decreases in NTT from LLI1 to LLI2 to LLI3.

  THE LOCAL LEVEL INSTITUTION STUDY 3
BOX 6:
Village Head of Walet, Central Java
“Finally, our village head comes from a different hamlet after people from KS hamlet led the village for
four consecutive terms” - RT (neighborhood) Head, Walet.

2007 was a special year for the residents of villagers of S hamlet, Walet, Central Java. Their hamlet
head won the election to become village head. One villager said, “Now our hamlet has a paved
road, upgraded in 2010. It used to be a dirt road that our motorbikes could hardly negotiate in
the rainy season.” Another villager from a different hamlet admitted that he was initially
pessimistic about the new village head, “But he kept his promises. He stays late into the night in
the village office. He helps clear the canals when villagers have problems with irrigation. He really
fights for our proposals to be funded by the district.” One former rival in the election said, “He is
smart. He beat me. He was able to divert my supporters although I already paid them IDR 50,000
each. He is very good.” One BPD member compared him with the previous village head, who “…
just followed up his own ideas. Suggestions and advice from the BPD and others were ignored.
The current village head is different. He listens to other people’s ideas. He lives in the village office,
so it’s easy for villagers to find him whenever they need him.”

The village head, a junior high school graduate, has held different positions in the village,
including neighborhood security, village government staff and hamlet head. He was also active
in a youth organization for disaster response, which was supported by the social affairs agency,
as Walet and other villages in the district are prone to floods. The hamlet he headed was one of
the smaller ones in the village and often excluded from decisions and benefits because of the
residents’ belief in a more syncretic version of Islam than other villagers.

One of the conflicts he had to handle was over tanah bengkok (land given to village staff in lieu of
wages, which is common practice in Central Java). In 2000-2001, the BPD re-assigned ownership of
several idle plots of tanah bengkok (as a few village staff and hamlet head positions were vacant)
and reduced the tanah bengkok of other village staff by 12.5% to enable the village to give land to
the neighborhood heads, who are unpaid. In 2012, the hamlet heads demanded the return of the
tanah bengkok in full. The village head consulted the BPD and then invited all neighborhood heads
and two community leaders from each neighborhood to a meeting. It was agreed that the hamlet
heads could get their tanah bengkok back in full if their performance was satisfactory. The villagers
would evaluate their performance at the end of the year. Only then would the village head issue a
village decree on the tanah bengkok.

Villagers acknowledged the village head has been able to bring in resources and development
projects to the village, in most cases with the help of a couple of district parliament members
representing the area. “The annual development planning process (musrenbang)? Useless. It is just
pro forma. Without the help from DPRD members, we wouldn’t get anything from development
planning process,” said the village head.

BOX 7:
Managing customary forest in Sipahit Lidah, Jambi

“Taking care of the forest means taking care of future generations”

That may sound like a cliché, but whenever asked about the forest, most villagers gave similar responses
– that taking care of the forests means taking care of their future generations. The village of Sipahit
Lidah assigns the task of caring for their 200-hectare hutan adat (customary forest) to a customary forest
management team (Kelompok Pengelola Hutan Adat, KPHA), the leader of which is elected every three
years. The team was first set up in 2003.

Brief history
In 1997 a company started clearing and pegging the forests surrounding Sipahit Lidah, claiming the
area was part of its concession. Some villagers found pegs in their gardens. The adat leader of Sipahit
Lidah (a former district parliament member who was active in a national adat organization) went to see
the forestry agency, as well as a regional conservation NGO that later facilitated the discussions with
the company, district head and parliament. Both the village and the company produced their own map
to support their arguments. In 2000, the company yielded and paid a customary sanction. In 2003, the
district head issued a decree that designated the forest adat status, and this is when the KPHA was set up.

Activities of the team
The team has members from the village, male and female, working in different sections to manage the
forests. The public relations section, for example, assisted by the NGO, regularly promotes the importance
of maintaining the forests in their presentations to the village government and representatives from each
hamlet. The NGO also invited the team to various seminars on sustainable forest management. The team
also developed their own homepage to promote ecotourism in the village. Regreening is also part of the
team’s program, and they have planted rubber and agarwood in some parts of the forests, with help from
the forestry agency, which has often provided them with seedlings and funds.

Rules
In 2004, the village issued a by-law on management of the forest. Under this by-law, villagers can collect
wood from the forests for personal or community use, but not for sale. The KPHA identified which kind of
trees villagers are allowed to cut under this by-law. To get permission to collect wood, a villager must first
get a recommendation from his or her clan leader for approval by the village head and KPHA team leader.
The villager then pays fees to the village treasury, the KPHA, the adat institution, the youth organization,
and the religion-based education group. Breach of the rules is punishable by the adat institution, which
remains active in the village.

The rules limit villagers’ access to the forests but they benefit from their management of the forest being
designated a model of customary forest management in the district. Villagers regularly get seedlings
from the forestry agency that they can plant in the buffer zone of the forests. Researchers and tourists
have also started coming to the forest, which contributes to the village economy. Villagers are proud that
their forest is home to some of the district’s oldest and best trees.

                                       IV. Holding village government
                                       accountable

                                       There are fewer open protests about
                                       unsatisfactory performance, compared to
                                       LLI2. In LLI2 amidst the cry for “reformasi” (mass
                                       political and governance reform), almost 40%
                                       of the villages with changes in leadership had a
                                       history of efforts to hold government accountable
                                       – either open demonstrations against some part
                                       of village government or explicitly electing a
                                       candidate other than the incumbent as a protest
                                       vote. In LLI3, the proportion of villages with
                                       changes in leadership that related to efforts to
                                       hold government accountable has decreased to
                                       23%. In 15% of the villages, village heads failed
                                       to be elected for a second term because of weak
                                       leadership and in 8% of the villages they were
                                       terminated because of corruption.

                                       The household data also show lower levels of
                                       dissatisfaction. The proportion of households
                                       indicating that residents had expressed
                                       “discontent” about their village government (over
                                       the past four years) fell from about one-third to
                                       about one-quarter between LLI2 and LLI3 (Table
                                       3). Although, relatively, village government is
                                       doing better, 26% of the respondents still admit
                                       that residents express discontent; which is not
                                       much lower than the proportion in LLI2 when the
                                       question was asked at the peak of open political
                                       discontent. For respondents who indicate that no
                                       discontent is expressed, satisfaction with village
                                       government does appear to have increased. The
                                       number responding that “There are no problems
                                       with the leadership” in their village rose 20
                                       percentage points to about 90 percent. Compared
                                       to LLI2, villagers are also less likely to refrain from
                                       taking part in protests because they perceive
                                       them to be ineffective, difficult to organize, or the
                                       reprisals too severe.

VI. Chapter summary

National policy changes have strengthened
the position of village head. They are able to
access resources directly from districts. The
position is also more open to a broader range
of candidates than in the past. However, in the
absence of any robust control mechanism, this
new power is prone to abuse. Reformist, pro-
village village heads are able to help villagers
solve their collective problems and improve
village development, especially when they are
externally well connected. Bad village heads, on
the other hand, thrive at least during their term
of office, as there is no effective mechanism of
control in the village. They use their position to
(disproportionally) benefit themselves, including
supporting their political career. Noticeably
better LLI3 village governments tend to have
functioning control mechanisms of adat rules or
a BPD operating according to the body’s original
conception. Without these, villages mainly rely
on electoral accountability, although there are
some encouraging signs that they have learned to
use protests more effectively than in LLI2. In sum,
it is positive to have a strong village head, but
strengthening the village head does not translate
directly to strengthening the village community.
The implication is that villages need to have
additional accountability mechanisms which
are largely missing now, to engender synergy
between strengthened village heads and their
constituents.

     BOX 8:
     A different kind of BPD, Deling, Central Java

     Deling is one of the villages that has maintained high local capacity between LLI2 and LLI3. Various
     local initiatives have been introduced to govern the village in ways that are more responsive to different
     groups’ inputs and needs, such as activating the village youth organization beyond sports and cultural
     activities to creating employment, and maintaining the function of the BPD to create checks and
     balances, despite the changes made by national regulation. The latter is elaborated below.

     Selection of BPD representatives
     The present BPD (2008-2013) is a vestige of the previous design under Law 22/1999. In 2003, before
     Law 22/1999 was replaced by Law 32/2004, the village nominated 15 candidates – mostly informal
     community leaders ¬– from each neighborhood . They included a school principal, the head of a private
     Moslem education foundation, and a section head at the district education office. Villagers then went
     to the ballot box. The nine candidates winning the most votes became BPD members, and each was
     assigned a particular area of work. The village decided the BPD would serve for two periods, 2003-2008
     and 2008-2013. Whenever there is a change of representatives (due to various causes, for example death
     or resignation for personal reasons), the replacement is taken from the next candidate in line (numbers
     10-15).

     Implementation of development projects
     Each year, the village government develops its annual plan. Once the BPD approves it, the LPMD
     (Lembaga Pemberdayaan Masyarakat Desa, Village Community Empowerment Board) prepares detailed
     plans and a budget. If they need more funds, the village government discusses this with BPD to agree
     on the contribution to be collected from villagers. The LPMD consults the neighborhood heads and the
     villagers (the target beneficiaries in the project location). Then the LPMD sets up a task force (usually the
     youth organization of the village) to do the work, under the supervision of the LPMD and the BPD.

     Accountability reporting
     Each year, the village head prepares an annual accountability report, which given to the BPD for
     comments a week before being presented at a village meeting (attended by the BPD and village
     government, neighborhood heads, and informal community leaders). The BPD presents their comments
     and the village head responds. The village head revises the report as agreed at the meeting. After
     receiving BPD approval, the report is sent to everybody who attended the meeting, and to the district.
     Each neighborhood head conveys the content of the report at neighborhood gatherings or the weekly
     Quran recitals, which are often attended by BPD members.

     Bridging the community and village government
     Attending neighborhood and other community gatherings enables BPD members to understand the
     community’s problems, needs and grievances. This information helps the BPD work with the village
     government to address the identified issues. BPD members also actively help resolve neighborhood
     problems (for example, conflicts between neighbors), and the BPD actively communicates and discusses
     village government policies (for example, on splitting large neighborhoods into smaller ones).

      Water user group in RT 01, RW 04, Deling	

      Before 1992 villagers in RT 01, RW 04 did not have piped water. They had to walk about a kilometer to
      reach the nearest river. This problem was raised at a neighborhood meeting, and villagers agreed to
      install pipes to bring water from the spring in a neighboring village to their houses. The neighborhood
      contributed IDR 400,000 towards this, and each of the 30 households contributed IDR 70,000. The
      village government contributed IDR,000 and one of the villagers who had a co-worker who was a
      member of Rotary Club managed to get a contribution of 35 bags of cement.

      The neighborhood head, who later became the head of this water users group, always discusses
      plans and mechanisms or rules, including sanctions, user charges and maintenance, with the group
      members. The group’s management team periodically reports to members on the use of group funds.
      The books are clear and very well prepared, and placed on the coffee table in the house of the head,
      accessible to all members. The team also regularly check the system to make sure that each member
      gets his share of water. The system works well and there have been no major problems or complaints.

      Building up networks to get resources

      The village head of Deling, Central Java, a former inter-city bus driver, did not have any contacts
      or networks in the district. He realized, once he became village head, that he needed to network.
      He started visiting the district offices as his village is only 12 kilometers away from the district
      capital. These district government agencies included community empowerment, agriculture,
      irrigation, and forestry, which had a lot of projects.

      In early 2012, the deputy district head attended an event just outside Deling. In the evening he
      prayed in one of the mosques in Deling, where he complained about the condition of the roads.
      The village head replied quickly that the village did not have funds to repair the road. A month
      later he was told by district public works to submit a proposal for road on the recommendation
      of the deputy district head, and in April, the village took delivery of 25 tanks of asphalt.

      BOX 11:
      Village proliferation (pemekaran)

      LLI3 did not set out to look at village proliferation, focusing instead on the village with the largest
      population where villages had split since LLI2. In the field, however, the rate of proliferation in LLI
      villages in Jambi and NTT turned out to be large, and the research team checked with the seceding
      village for the reasons of the split. No other information was consistently collected in these villages.
      In three out of eight villages (38%) in Jambi, and in one ward of the four villages and wards (25%)
      in NTT, a hamlet had seceded to become a village in its own right. One hamlet in another NTT village
      united with a new neighboring village, while three more villages in Jambi are attempting
      to break away.

      Secession is driven by dissatisfaction over sharing of resources and/or the personal ambition
      of a few local leaders, rather than by the readiness of the hamlet to be a village in its own
      right. In all cases of the proliferated villages, the break-away hamlet is far from the center (thus more
      isolated from services) or the residents felt they were neglected by the village government. They did
      not get as much information or as many projects as the other hamlets or they were not involved in
      the planning discussions of the village development. Most of these distant hamlets, at least in Jambi,
      are known as “hamlets of migrants” (mainly from Java) even though the residents have been living
      there for more than a generation. In the one case in NTT, however, the hamlet has actually received
      projects – mainly as a result of its own efforts, rather than the efforts of the ward administration.
      This prompted local leaders, led by an influential businessman, to insist on a separation.92 When
      it did separate, the son of the businessman became the interim village head. In one case in Jambi,
      according to a teacher who moonlighted as patchouli trader in the new village, the secession was
      driven by the fact that the hamlet used to be a village in its own right even though it only has a
      population of 80 households, but was forced to merge with the present village under a now defunct
      law (Law 5/1979). On-going attempts to secede are driven by similar dissatisfaction, although one
      is actually driven by local conflicts during the most recent village head elections. In another (high
      capacity) village, the hamlet has actually backed down after the recently elected village head showed
      willingness to be more accommodating to the needs of the protesting hamlet.

      Services are better but they seem to benefit the elite most. Now these new villages get their own
      village grants (ADD) which becomes larger per capita, and get projects for their own area that benefit
      them, such as roads, clean water, schools, health services and agricultural inputs. For example, one
      village in Jambi had a marked improvement in basic needs. Prior to the split, this hamlet’s PPK/
      PNPM proposals for wells were never prioritized, even though residents were relying on (increasingly
      polluted) water from the Batanghari river for drinking, washing, and toilet needs. Since seceding, the
      village has gained twenty wells through PNPM and other programs. In this way, secession has clearly
      enhanced the village’s capacity to address local problems.



      92 Some of the leaders in the hamlet have good networks with district officials that enable them to get projects. In addition villagers in this
      hamlet were more willing to donate their land for the projects (e.g., village clinic), while the land in the “old” ward was rife with conflicts that
      has resulted in the cancellation of a few projects.

  THE LOCAL LEVEL INSTITUTION STUDY 3
The seceding villages also suffer from some of the same problems as other villages, including elite
domination of benefits and unresponsive leaders. There may be improvements in some areas
(increased funds, more projects to manage), but the elite retains control. Or they may have problems
with the village head they elected; for example, in one new village the village head was not open
about the use of various funds, including ADD funds and fees paid for electricity generated by the
village micro hydro system, but the villagers did not protest as the village head appeared to have
local police back up. An informant said that villagers chose to remain silent and not to participate in
the village activities, and will not re-elect the village head.

“Old” higher capacity villages deal with the impact of the secession better, while lower
capacity villages find it hard to recover. Secession leads to a split of resources or assets (for
example, health clinics and student dormitories) which is a loss to the “old” villages. For example, in
a medium-capacity village in Jambi, management of the micro-hydro power system is split between
the now two villages. Each village has a different management system. So, when the system was
used above its capacity and the generator broke down, collecting sufficient money for repairs from
the two villages proved difficult. Some villagers solved the problem themselves by forming small
groups (of 15-17 households) in their hamlets and setting up their own power system, which is now
being replicated in the new village. In the village in NTT, the health clinic lost to the new village has
yet to be replaced because of land conflicts.

       Coffee Cooperative (Unit Pengelola Hasil), Mataloko, NTT

       The coffee cooperative was initiated by the district plantation agency, which provided loans
       to active coffee farmer groups. The cooperative in Mataloko started up in 2005. Before that,
       farmers used to sell their coffee to middlemen at low prices. The district plantation agency
       provided the cooperative a short training course to learn about coffee planting and post-
       harvest processing, as well as team building to strengthen the group. It also provided some
       equipment, such as a generator, tarpaulin and sacks. In 2006, just before the first harvest, the
       district agency gave the cooperative a low-interest loan of IDR 130 million for post-harvest
       processing of the coffee, including renting a piece of land. The coffee the cooperative produced
       was sold to a company in Surabaya. The profit was used to pay the first installment of land they
       bought for post-harvest production and for to buy new coffee plants. In 2007, the provincial
       government provided a new loan to pay off the land and expand production. Membership
       of the group had also doubled. In 2010, the group was able to produce 17.5 tons of coffee, its
       largest production to date, and is encouraging members to maintain organic farming practices
       so that US buyers will continue to purchase their beans. This collective is one of the few groups
       currently active in this village.

  BOX 13:
  Villages Bill
  Deliberations are underway of a Bill on Villages, which, if passed will be the first law to focus
  exclusively on village government since Law 5/1979, which imposed uniform state structures on all
  villages in Indonesia. While shifts towards more autonomy have taken place with decentralization
  (Law 5/1979 was superseded by Law 22/1999), the bill now being debated will have a broad and deep
  impact on how villages are governed and what resources they have to address local problems (Antlöv
  & Eko, 2012).

  At a minimum, the bill should safeguard achievements to date in making village government
  more democratic and accountable. Since LLI2, there have been clear gains in enforcement of basic
  requirements for village heads, resulting in better qualified village heads who do not exceed the
  specified terms of office. There has been a marked broadening of the field of candidates running for
  village head, reflecting a change in behavior from district officials who used to approve candidates for
  village office. Perhaps most importantly, the new law must avoid weakening electoral mechanisms
  for accountability. As we saw in the LLI villages, the ballot box is often the only means available in
  low capacity villages to remove corrupt village heads.

  In parallel, the new law should also avoid concentrating more power in the office of village head.
  The profile and authority of the village head have been raised substantially as a result of developments
  over the past decade, including the weakening of the BPD, the relative decline of the role of other
  community leaders in problem-solving, direct access to the district with the removal of the sub-district
  as a formal level of government, and the direct election of members of higher-level executive and
  legislative bodies who vie for the support of village heads. These gains in power have not, however,
  been accompanied by greater scrutiny of the actions of village heads, resulting in an institutional
  environment where the village head has little incentive to place the villagers’ interests above his/her
  own. The new law should assign responsibilities and authorities across village offices to create a
  more balanced distribution of power in the village.

  With the strengthening of the office of village head during the past decade, additional village-level
  accountability mechanisms and sources of countervailing power are needed. Specifically, the
  BPD should regain its former status as an elected body, as well as its functions to inform and
  approve village plans and budgets, and to receive financial and activity reports from the village
  head. An elected BPD would also provide an opportunity to engage in formal village government
  for non-state leaders and institutions that are losing ground to state counterparts. Legislation to
  reinvigorate the BPD should also be sensitive to existing customary accountability mechanisms,
  to avoid weakening them where they are functioning effectively.

  Strengthening accountability by shifting the distribution of power is inherently conflictive, so disputes
  should be anticipated in policy. Learning from prior experience with village head-BPD relations, the
  new legislation should explicitly incorporate conflict resolution mechanisms, to mitigate disputes
  that will certainly emerge as BPDs regain authority. Such mediation efforts should be kept local, to
  ensure that villagers have the opportunity to follow developments. In addition, they should engage




122
109
  THE LOCAL LEVEL INSTITUTION STUDY 3
an external arbiter (possibly the sub-district head) as villages with high levels of internal (elite)
conflict may be particularly likely to see disputes arise between village heads and BPDs. An external
party is thus needed to ensure that these conflicts do not deadlock government decision-making and
undermine problem-solving potential.

Over the past decade, increases in ADD funds have been welcomed by villagers, as they are sufficient
to address some local priorities, rather than just cover officials’ salaries. The new legislation Desa
should continue to provide for substantial funds that are under direct village control. More funding
under autonomous control could support problem-solving if village government’s interests can be
made to align with villagers’ needs through institutional means. However, ADD funds should not be
increased without evidence that past allocations have been used to benefit a broad swath of
villagers. Monitoring could be provided by both the re-empowered BPD and district-level agencies,
and must be more active and frequent than simple end-of-term reporting. Across the LLI districts,
existing passive reporting mechanisms have failed to avert misuse of ADD grants.

Finally, women’s sharply increased participation in LLI village organizational life has not been
mirrored in political institutions, from which they remain largely absent. While there is evidence
of a broader swath of candidates standing for office and being elected (from religious minorities,
remote hamlets, and minority clans), women have not benefited from this shift. To overcome barriers
to women’s participation in village government, the new legislation should stipulate affirmative
action for women’s leadership and participation in decision-making. For instance, a percentage
of elected BPD seats could be reserved for women. Similar quotas in Indonesia’s national and local
parliaments have had mixed results (Bessell, 2010; Davies & Idrus, 2011), but extrapolations from
these experiences to the village level should be made with caution. First, parliamentary outcomes
are a reflection of intense political party competition and complex election procedures (such as
closed vs. open lists), neither of which are factors at the village level. Second, parliamentary quotas
have been for each party’s candidates, resulting in many women assigned by their parties to run in
jurisdictions where they have little chance of winning (Davies & Idrus, 2011). In contrast, the new
legislation on village government should reserve positions in elected bodies for women. Third,
parliamentary quotas have not been enforced and parties have faced few sanctions for failing to
meet them, underscoring the necessity of real consequences for villages that do not fill women’s
seats. Finally, quotas are not an instantaneous remedy to long-standing gender stereotyping and
patterns of discrimination, which can take decades to change. Experience in other countries has
shown that while quotas are no magic bullet, they can help ensure an equitable representation
of views in village government decisions and, over time, are likely to result in female leaders with
political experience who can be elected outside the reserved seats (Ban & Rao, 2008; Clots-Figueras,
2011; Tadros, 2010). Further, institutional mechanisms to encourage women’s participation in direct
democratic decision-making has been shown to result in more equitable development outcomes
(Gibson, 2012). In addition to quotas, this is another means of encouraging women’s participation
worthy of exploration.

  Responsiveness

  To support villagers’ efforts to address and solve
  problems, government actors (particularly at
  higher levels, and including both executive
  and legislative agencies) must find effective
  mechanisms to identify needs and for villagers
  to bring their problems to the state for help.
  As detailed in prior chapters, villagers draw
  on government programs in problem-solving
  (witness the high levels of overlap between
  problems in Jambi and the use of state programs
  to address them). However, such dovetailing is
  often the result of villagers’ use of sophisticated
  networks and lobbying rather than active
  outreach by districts.

  The RPJM process of identifying village medium-
  term needs could hold some promise, but is in
  limited use. Of the LLI districts, only Batanghari
  is using the village medium term development
  plans in planning. Most districts are not relying on
  these village development plans for allocations
  and, even in Batanghari, they need to match only
  the general category of plans (rather than the
  specific needs originally identified). Other existing
  planning processes (Musrenbang) are also slow,
  sometimes taking years to respond, by which time
  the needs may have been addressed locally, or
  changed in scope from the initial identification.
  The efficiency of these processes needs to be
  monitored in terms of alignment with villagers’
  needs, scope, and timeframes.

  In addition, district agencies must become
  more proactive in their outreach to villagers.
  From a village-level perspective, many districts
  are currently “chasing targets,” pushing
  programs to villagers regardless of need or past
  performance. By spending more time in villages
  (attending planning meetings, for example),
  district representatives could improve their grasp
  of current local issues, better targeting existing
  programs and technical assistance, and gathering
  timely input for the design of new ones. However,

      BOX 14:
      PNPM Roadmap
      The implications of the new legislation on village governments (outlined in Box 13) are also
      relevant for the consolidation of policies and programs in the PNPM roadmap, which is scheduled
      for implementation after completion of the current cycle of PNPM programs. Because the village
      government plays a role in the program’s planning mechanisms, improving the responsiveness
      and accountability of the village head will reduce the potential for him/her to dominate the
      development and selection of proposals.

      Specifically for PNPM, the LLI3 findings imply that low capacity villages need more support
      and special consideration, as the data show that participatory programs more often garnered
      broad input to decisions in high capacity villages. For participatory programs to function
      better in low capacity villages, more attention is needed to ensure that principles are followed,
      decisions are made in the interests of a broad swath of villagers, and benefits are broadly shared.
      Remedies could include a set of specific strategies employed by district facilitators to support
      the participatory development of viable proposals in such villages. Paradoxically, these strategies
      may initially involve less intensive participation, to introduce more residents to the idea of joint
      decision-making where collective action is not customary. For example, while a series of open
      meetings could be used to generate proposals, subsequent village-wide balloting might instead
      be used to select among the stated priorities.103 While the latter lacks the benefits of debate over
      village needs, it may open up the choice of priorities to a wider range of villagers (and potentially
      invest them in the outcome) than would otherwise have been the case in low capacity villages.

      In general, program designers should avoid the creation of program-specific groups. Funds
      allocations should favor groups that demonstrate that they have been in existence for some
      time to avoid the impulse to create groups solely to receive program benefits104 but that lack
      the rules, social structures, mutual knowledge, and trust that are needed for successful collective
      action. While more investigation of the LLI data is needed to verify it, there is a possibility that
      the proliferation of programs that encourage group formation may have contributed to the
      relative rise in state- over community-sponsored organizations observed between LLI2 and LLI3.
      Even if that possibility is not borne out by the data, creating more of the former type runs the
      risk of further crowding out the latter, as villagers are spending decreasing amounts of time in
      organizational activities.

      Similarly, design programs around existing governance institutions rather than creating
      project management structures that may link to, but essentially circumvent, village government
      or customary governing bodies. The latter have the benefit of avoiding corrupt and incompetent
      formal village leaders and have provided a training ground for deliberative decision-making, but
      are a missed opportunity to encourage accountability and transparency of existing institutions.

      103 Other studies have found support for this modification of PNPM procedures, including a study of marginalized groups (AKATIGA,
      2010) and field experiments compar ing different selection processes (Olken, 2010).
      104 In the LLI villages, SPP groups formed specifically to receive PNPM loans often failed to repay them, with repercussions for other vil-
      lagers and for local capacity, due to subsequent sanctions on all villagers and the need to raise funds to repay the defaulted loans (drawing
      resources from other problem-solving efforts).




126
113
  THE LOCAL LEVEL INSTITUTION STUDY 3
Further, at least in some LLI villages, the same elites that dominate village government monopolize
the parallel structures set up by PNPM, negating the potential benefit of this model. To thwart elite
capture of decision-making, permanent institutions of countervailing power are needed (see
Box 13), not program-specific parallel systems.

In general, higher levels of government need to provide better oversight over resource use
and village government. As PNPM-like programs proliferate, districts must correspondingly
improve oversight of funds spent, instead of assuming that incorporating PNPM principles
avoids the risks of elite domination and diversion of resources. Here, as well, low capacity villages
may need special consideration, as they likely lack existing accountability, transparency, and
participatory mechanisms. In such settings, fledgling efforts to introduce these principles through
PNPM could particularly benefit from complementary monitoring by higher levels of government.

  Accountability

  As the village head has become a more central
  actor in accessing resources and responding
  to problems, the opportunities for prioritizing
  private gains over collective interests have risen
  commensurately. The village head office has
  become an avenue to gaining higher political
  office, and the resources available at the district
  level are ample for those village heads able to
  access them. While the greater prospects of the
  village head office can benefit villagers if more
  dynamic and creative candidates are inspired to
  run for office, they also create the circumstances
  for a new type of ineffective leader; one whose
  interests are oriented almost entirely outside

      BOX 15:
      Land and resource rights
      LLI3 identifies encouraging examples of villages prevailing over corporate actors in disputes
      over land and resources. These successes are notable indicators of a shift in the broader political
      environment; in prior LLI rounds, similar conflicts were evident, but villagers’ claims were generally
      steamrolled by powerful companies backed by the military and the central state. Settling such
      conflict has implications for local capacity. Assets that are clearly under villagers’ control can be
      used as problem-solving resources. Energies previously focused on resolving the asset dispute can
      be redirected towards addressing other issues. Collaborators in resolving the resource/land conflict
      (within the village, with village and higher levels of government, and NGOs) may help address other
      problems, contributing to capacity improvements.

      The recent victories are fragile, however, due to a lack of clarity in land and natural resource
      regulations. District designations of hutan adat/desa may be superseded by prior licenses assigned
      to companies by the Forestry Ministry. Legal victories over one plantation owner may open villagers
      up to new charges due to a conflicting claim by another company.

      Encouragingly, recent legislative shifts have further tipped the political balance in favor of
      communities. In May 2013, the Constitutional Court invalidated the 1999 Forestry Law’s classification
      of customary forests as “state forest areas”. As a result, the Forestry Ministry no longer has jurisdiction
      over customary forests and cannot issue licenses for their use by corporations. President Yudhoyono
      followed this ruling with a two-year extension of a moratorium on forest-clearing concessions
      (Witoelar 2013).

      In combination, these recent legislative decisions provide a window of opportunity to safeguard
      communities’ claims to land and resources by clarifying boundaries and ensuring all levels of
      government enforce them. National NGOs and international donors need to advocate for swift but
      rigorous implementation of the Constitutional Court’s decision. District-level NGOs should work with
      local communities to make sure that they are aware of their rights, and to map their claims. National
      government must also collaborate with district governments to ensure that customary forests
      are protected by local legislation (Natahadibrata 2013). All actors should contribute to on-going
      efforts, such as those of the Indigenous Peoples Alliance of the Archipelago (Aliansi Masyarakat Adat
      Nusantara, AMAN)108 and the Participative Mapping Working Network (Jaringan Kerja Pemetaan
      Partisipatif, JKPP)109, to focus energies and encourage a unified effort.

      Efforts to clarify and reconcile overlapping claims between state and customary land governance
      systems need to take into account the perspectives and concerns of different community
      members. As Siscawati and Mahaningtyas (2012) show, actors that aim to integrate customary land
      rights and state-sponsored land use regimes usually work and communicate only with male elites in
      structuring such arrangements, frequently resulting in women’s loss of land and livelihood access.
      Clarification of land and forest claims is particularly time sensitive in the face of ambitious,
      108 AMAN’s request for review prompted the Constitutional Court’s decision (Witoelar, 2013).
      109 JKPP has worked with indigenous peoples to identify customary forest boundaries, but the mapping has yet to be completed (Natahadi-
      brata, 2013).

MP3EI (Masterplan Percepatan dan Perluasan Pembangunan Ekonomi Indonesia, Master Plan for
Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesian Economic Development; see Box 16) will require land
appropriations that are likely to displace rural villages and infringe on customary forest lands.
It is therefore particularly important that property rights are clarified in advance of MP3EI
implementation. Without rapid resolution there is a “…high risk that the deliberate institutional
ambiguity becomes an instrument in the violation of villagers’ interests” (Ho 2011, 421 cited in

  THE LOCAL LEVEL INSTITUTION STUDY 3
BOX 16:
MP3EI & MP3KI
The MP3EI (Masterplan Percepatan dan Perluasan Pembangunan Ekonomi Indonesia, Master Plan
for Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesian Economic Development) was instituted in May 2011
to elevate Indonesia to one of the world’s top 12 economies by 2025. To date MP3EI efforts have
focused on “debottlenecking” (removing regulations unfriendly to investment) and infrastructure
investment, with 84 projects valued at IDR 536 trillion targeted for groundbreaking in 2012 (Caruko
2012).

The massive infrastructure investments along six growth corridors that are planned under MP3EI
underscore the urgency to clarify customary land claims (Box 15). Further, MP3EI projects must
feature improved attention to informing villagers of plans, as well as equitable resettlement
and effective dispute resolution, to ensure that villagers’ rights are respected and that projects
benefit local communities. In the LLI villages, these types of large-scale infrastructure projects were
often plagued by delays (or complete derailment), in part due to lack of information and benefit
for villagers. For example, in one NTT village, an irrigation scheme started in 2008 had to be shifted
from its original location as there were no funds to compensate landowners. Residents at the new
location were not provided any information by higher levels of government but worked with the
village government to protest plans once they were underway. By 2012, negotiations between the
district and village governments had arrived at ten points of discussion but no further resolution
was in sight. The project was halted after three-quarters of the total funds had been spent, and the
remainder re-allocated to other government priorities. Also in NTT, three of four villages reported
delays in PNPM infrastructure projects due to difficulties in gaining title to needed land.

National government’s increased need to acquire land for MP3EI infrastructure projects has the
potential to undermine capacity in at least two ways. First, appropriation of villagers’ lands will
directly reduce assets available to respond to local problems. Second, intra-village conflict may
emerge over distribution over any compensation. To preserve capacity, it is therefore important
that resettlement and compensation schemes not only ensure benefits to the community
broadly defined, but that efforts are made to ensure that benefits are distributed within the
village in ways that residents agree is equitable (Arandel & Wetterberg 2013). Unless the latter
dimension is addressed, internal conflict is likely to increase, undermining abilities to collaborate
effectively to solve local problems.

The MP3KI (Masterplan Percepatan dan Perluasan Pengurangan Kemiskinan di Indonesia, Master Plan
for Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesian Poverty Alleviation) was instituted after MP3EI and
aims to reduce poverty to 4% by 2025. Some of the key elements of the plan include:

Participatory planning: Based on the LLI findings, broader implementation of participatory
principles and novel mechanisms are needed, as levels of participation appear to be declining in
the current portfolio of programs reported by LLI villagers.




                                                                                                            133
                                                                                                            120
                                                                          THE LOCAL LEVEL INSTITUTION STUDY 3
      Improving access to job and market opportunities: To the extent that these efforts involve training
      programs, examples from LLI villages underscore the need to tie skills/outputs directly to
      market channels. A number of training programs identified by LLI villagers lacked clear
      opportunities to apply new skills and were perceived as a source of frustration, rather than a
      means of addressing problems with underdeveloped local job markets.

      One common problem identified by villagers is fluctuation in output prices, but it is one that no
      LLI village was successfully able to address. Small farmers face multiple sources of risk, among
      them uncertainty over global commodity prices, which drive their livelihood choices but are
      beyond their control (Rachman 2013). As part of MP3KI, national government could experiment
      with policies to dampen impact of inevitable price fluctuations to protect smallholders and
      help villages address the overwhelming scope of this problem. Further, local governments could
      develop alternative marketing channels that break up regional buyer monopolies as a
      means of helping smallholders capture a larger portion of the sales price for their output, which
      could be saved to safeguard against future price shocks.

      Shifting implementation to local governments: As is detailed in Chapter 7, local governments have,
      as a rule, not yet shifted away from an input-oriented model of program delivery. Awareness
      of local needs, receptivity to villager input, and monitoring of outcomes are generally very low
      among district officials. The designers of MP3KI must work with, and provide incentives for,
      local officials to ensure that progress towards poverty alleviation goals is made and to shift
      course if it is not.
