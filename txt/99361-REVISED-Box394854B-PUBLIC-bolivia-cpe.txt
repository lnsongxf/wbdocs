Overview
 Highlights
 As the result of past investments in gas and mining sectors and high world commodity
 prices, the Bolivian economy grew considerably during the last seven years. Prudent
 macroeconomic policies and high taxes on hydrocarbon revenues led to a significant
 accumulation of fiscal surplus and external reserves. Under a state-led development
 model, the government led by President Morales pursued redistributive policies and
 invested heavily in road construction. However, it has retained far more of the
 conservative fiscal and macroeconomic policies than would have been predicted.
 Sustained growth has translated into significant poverty reduction and improved equity
 as unskilled labor, including from indigenous groups, benefited from booming
 nontradable sector activities. The availability of hydrocarbon revenues, however, created
 little incentive for the government to address the structural issues in the economy. The
 Plurinational State of Bolivia is more resource dependent, institutions are weak, decision
 making is increasingly discretionary, productivity remains low both inside and outside
 the agriculture sector, and environmental degradation is worsening.
 Findings: The period under review (FY05–13) starts amid considerable sociopolitical
 unrest and covers the entire period under President Morales. During this time, three out
 of four World Bank Group strategies were short-term (from 18 months to three years) and
 gave high priority to rebuilding a relationship with a government that came to power on
 a strong anti-Washington platform. This effort has been fruitful as the government has
 reduced its anti-Bank discourse and sought the Bank’s views more frequently, albeit
 informally. However, the improving relationship has yet to produce the expected results
 in most areas during the evaluation period.
 Notable achievements were made in small-scale agriculture development, urban
 infrastructure, and road maintenance, where the government’s interests and the Bank’s
 objectives were aligned. The Bank’s involvement in the environment was limited but
 useful. Gender issues were incorporated into many Bank projects. However, the Bank has
 stayed out of the macroeconomic and resource management areas and addressed a few
 narrowly defined topics related to governance and public institutions. The efforts of the
 Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) at promoting private businesses have
 produced few tangible results. In human development, a high priority area for the
 government, the Bank has lost traction as the ministries became politicized.
 Recommendations: Going forward, the Bank Group should develop a long-term
 partnership with the government as well as groups outside of the government. The Bank
 should scale up the good practice programs in agriculture and help the government
 develop a strategy for improving agricultural productivity and rural development more
 broadly. In transport, the Bank should continue to focus on road maintenance to
 complement the construction programs of the government and other partners. In areas
 where the government has shown little commitment in addressing systemwide issues, the
 Bank should adjust the scale and breadth of its programs according to the expected

    results. Finally, IFC should take a long-term view for its engagement and further adapt its
    products and processes to meet the market demand of countries like Bolivia.

1. Country Context and Purpose of the
Evaluation
The Plurinational State of Bolivia is endowed with rich natural resources, the
exploitation of which has been a dominant feature of its economy as well as its
national politics. In addition to silver and tin, Bolivia has gold, zinc, and estimated
lithium reserves of 5.5 million tons, which are more than half of the world’s reserves.
Although its oil reserves are not significant, it has an estimated 11 trillion cubic feet
of natural gas reserves, which is the second largest in South America after
Venezuela. Large investments in the gas and mining sectors in the late 1990s and
early 2000s, combined with high international commodity prices, have led to an
annual average growth of 5 percent during 2005–2013 compared to 3.6 percent for
Latin America as well as substantial improvement in Bolivia’s terms of trade, which
was 63 percent higher in 2012 than in 2000.

The growth and the large gains in terms of trade have translated into significant
poverty reduction, although Bolivia remains the poorest country in South America.
Income per capita doubled between 2005 and 2011 and extreme poverty declined
from 37 percent in 2002 to 21 percent in 2012. Income inequality has also trended
downward, while improvements in some human development indicators indicate
significant social gains. Nevertheless, the growth was uneven, with extractive
industries, construction, and financial services showing rapid expansion, while
agriculture and manufacturing fell behind. Bolivia’s gap between urban and rural
living standards persists, and inequality remains one of the highest in the Region.
Further, its human development levels continue to be below the Regional averages
by all such indicators.

The election of President Morales in December 2005 signaled a drastic change in
Bolivia’s policy directions. It ended three years of political turmoil, during which
three governments left office early because of social unrest. In taking office,
President Morales reduced his salary by more than 50 percent and formed a cabinet
with little experience in government. With an anti-neoliberalism rhetoric, the
Morales government pursued a state-led development model anchored in the
renationalization of foreign interests in the hydrocarbon, mining, infrastructure,
communications, and other key sectors. At the same time, in its National
Development Plan for 2006–2010, the government adhered mostly to Bolivia’s
previous liberal economic policies. Fiscal and monetary policies were prudent, and
social spending was kept at a level comparable to previous regimes. However,



                                                                                       1
CHAPTER 1
COUNTRY CONTEXT AND PURPOSE OF THE EVALUATION
public investment in hydrocarbons increased sharply, and there was a major push
for road construction to integrate the country physically and to facilitate exports.

Going forward, Bolivia faces many development challenges. While President
Morales’s drive to promote the traditionally excluded indigenous peoples has
succeeded in bringing about profound, positive social changes, his interventionist
policies and the methods employed to implement them have fueled new social
tensions. Concerns have arisen over the long-term sustainability of Bolivia’s
macroeconomic and growth outcomes. There is an urgent need to invest in
hydrocarbon, mining and other productive sectors; increase productivity; further
reduce poverty and inequality; protect the environment; and build the institutional
capacities for managing all of these areas.


World Bank Group Support Prior to 2005
The Bank Group strongly supported the market-oriented reforms that the Bolivian
government implemented between the late 1980s and early 2000. The restoration of
civilian rule to Bolivia in 1982 ended decades of military dictatorships but did not
bring about economic stability. Prompted by the collapse of international tin prices
and the onset of the Latin American debt crisis, a hyperinflationary spiral reached
25,000 percent in 1985. The government started to implement profound, market-
oriented reforms that restructured the bulk of the hitherto statist economy. They
achieved important results at the macro level. In response, the Bank started
supporting the government with debt rescheduling, donor aid mobilization, and
export promotion.

From 1986 to 2004, the Bank approved 69 projects for a total of $1.8 billion, reaching
a commitment peak of $616 million in the second half of the 1990s. Half of the
commitments supported financial and private sector development, transport, and
public sector governance. Another 22 structural adjustment credits were approved
to support the government’s export promotion efforts and capitalization program as
well as its financial sector, decentralization, and pension reforms. Reduction in the
size of the Bolivian program in the early 2000s reflected the expected gradual
phasing out of financing from the International Development Association (IDA),
changes in the portfolio because of fluidity in the social and political sphere, and
tighter management of problem projects in the portfolio.

The Bolivia Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) covering FY86–98 that was
conducted by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED, the precursor of the
Independent Evaluation Group) in 2000 found that the Bank was instrumental in

mobilizing support from the donor community and in helping to stabilize the
economy after the crisis (OED 2000). In view of the modest growth and limited
poverty reduction results, however, it recommended that the Bank further link its
support to progress in structural reforms by (i) giving higher priority to promoting
private sector development (focusing on developing the financial sector and
accelerating judicial and civil service reforms); (ii) assuming a greater role in helping
the government combat corruption; (iii) developing a strategy for sustainable
natural resource management; and (iv) targeting growth and poverty reduction in
the Altiplano and other rural areas.

OED’s 2005 Bolivia CAE, reviewing the Bank’s assistance during FY99–04,
concluded that the performance of the Bank’s projects was in line with Bank-wide
averages, and progress was made toward a number of specific support objectives
(OED 2005). However, the Bank’s overall development impact was moderately
unsatisfactory because of the effects of adverse factors that materialized during
program implementation. Given the high degree of uncertainty in Bolivia at the time
and concerns over persistence of the situation, the 2005 CAE recommended that the
Bank’s next strategy (i) have a short (12–24 month) time horizon; (ii) aim at
achieving sustainable fiscal balances and rapid improvements in Bolivia’s public
sector financial management; (iii) continue to provide support for analytic and
advisory activities on critical social and political issues as appropriate; (iv) fully fund
its lending program through IDA resources until Bolivia’s creditworthiness for
lending from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is firmly
established; and (v) refrain from encouraging Bolivia to complete another Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper before key legislation had been passed.


Evaluation Objectives and Report Structure
This Country Program Evaluation (CPE) assesses the outcomes of the World Bank
Group’s operations in Bolivia during the period from FY05 to FY13. It is part of the
Clustered CPE for Resource Rich Developing Countries, which includes four stand-
alone CPEs for Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Zambia and draws lessons
across countries in an over-arching report. The Bolivia CPE examines the relevance
and realism of Bank Group objectives in the context of the development constraints
facing the country, the extent to which these objectives were achieved effectively
and efficiently, and the institutional development impact and sustainability of the
Bank Group’s interventions.

CHAPTER 1
COUNTRY CONTEXT AND PURPOSE OF THE EVALUATION
This report follows the common organizing framework for the four CPEs in the
cluster, which is based on a set of common challenges that arise from high
dependency on natural resources. These challenges include:

       Macroeconomic and fiscal stability;
       Improving governance and institutions for the effective use of resources;
       Economic diversification and growth; and
       Inclusive growth through human capital development and poverty reduction.

In addition, the Bolivia CPE reviews Bank Group operations along two cross-cutting
themes: environment and gender.

This report has eight chapters. Chapter 2 outlines the Bank Group strategies in
Bolivia and examines trends in its operations. Chapters 3 to 7 assess the relevance
and effectiveness of the Bank Group program in achieving its strategic objectives.
The concluding chapter draws lessons and recommendations for the Bank Group’s
future engagement in Bolivia.

2. World Bank Group Assistance to Bolivia,
FY05–13
 Highlights
     During the evaluation period, the country’s macroeconomic situation changed
      from desperate debtor to secure holder of large international reserves thanks to
      high international mineral prices and prudent macroeconomic management.
     The World Bank Group assistance was guided by four strategies, three of which
      were short-term documents prepared at a highly uncertain time. Although these
      strategies had pillars that were aligned with the government’s development plans,
      their overarching objective was to build a relationship with the Morales
      government.
     Financial support declined and became more concentrated, while technical
      assistance became more common.
     As the Plurinational State of Bolivia became less dependent on external resources,
      some of traditional partners phased out their programs and new actors came in.


The World Bank Group assistance during the review period can be divided into two
phases: FY05–06 and FY07–13. The earlier period covers the second year of the 2004
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY04–05 and the 12 months around the
inauguration of President Morales. Prepared at a very uncertain time to support the
near-term objectives of President Carlos Mesa’s transitional government, the CAS
had an unusually short time horizon of 18 months. On the political front, the
government sought to resolve key issues concerning the Plurinational State of
Bolivia’s hydrocarbon resources and its future constitutional structure. The
economic objectives included restoring macroeconomic stability, implementing
public programs in poor areas, and relaunching institutional reforms. The CAS
envisaged a new strategy for FY06 and beyond (World Bank 2004), but amid
renewed social unrests and the resignation of President Mesa in June 2005, this
never took place.

During the latter period, the Bank Group issued three strategies: the 2006 Interim
Strategy Note (ISN) for FY07–09, the 2009 ISN for FY10–11, and the 2011 Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY12–15 (World Bank 2006, 2009, 2011). All were
undertaken during the administration of President Morales. The overall objective of
the 2006 ISN was “to build a medium-term partnership to support Bolivia as it
redefines itself.” It had three pillars that corresponded to the three broad objectives
of the new government’s National Development Plan (NDP), including (i)

enhancing good governance and transparency; (ii) fostering jobs through growth;
and (iii) providing better services to the poor. Aiming to “consolidate the progress
accomplished during the implementation of the previous strategy” in order to
support the country’s effort to significantly reduce extreme poverty, the 2009 ISN
retained these three pillars and added an additional pillar on sustainable
development to mitigate the effects of natural disasters and environmental
degradation.

Increased institutional and economic stability allowed the Bank Group to prepare
the 2011 CPS to support the government program for 2010–2015, which updated the
NDP for President Morales’s second administration. It has four pillars: (i)
sustainable productive development; (ii) climate change and disaster risk
management; (iii) human development and access to basic services; and (iv) public
sector effectiveness. In addition, gender, governance, and anti-corruption are
identified as cross-cutting themes.

Despite the short-term nature of most strategy documents, the Bank Group’s broad
priorities in Bolivia have remained consistent. Table 2.1 summarizes the objectives of
the Bank Group program across four strategy documents. When describing the areas
of engagement, the various strategies use different terms: “strategic areas” in the
2006 Interim Strategy Note (ISN), “pillars” in the 2009 ISN, and “results areas” in the
2011 Country Partnership Strategy. They are all referred to as “pillars” in this
evaluation.

World Bank Group Instruments and Performance
WORLD BANK SUPPORT PROGRAM
The Bank’s lending portfolio changed significantly during the evaluation period. At
the outset, Bank portfolio consisted of 18 projects. Between FY05 and FY13, the Bank
proposed 25 International Development Association (IDA) credits for $505 million,
of which 15 were approved,1 three slipped to a later strategy period, and seven were
dropped or delayed beyond the review period. Five unplanned projects were
approved for $171.4 million, including the 2011 National Roads and Airport
Infrastructure Project for $109.5 million. Compared to FY96–04, the evaluation
period saw new project approvals declining by 44 percent. After bottoming out at
the end of FY07, when only five projects were active in the portfolio, Bank
engagement recovered. Most of the resources committed from FY07 onward were
realized.

There has been a shift in Bank instruments toward investment lending. In the
decade prior to 2005, one-third of the projects approved were development policy
loans; during the evaluation period, support was provided almost exclusively
through investment loans.2 The government’s increasing fiscal surpluses made
budget support financing unnecessary. IDA lending became more focused,
concentrating in agriculture and rural and urban development, and exited five
sectors (i.e., economic policy, environment, financial and private sector
development, social development, and water).

The Bolivia portfolio performed poorly during FY05–13. Of the 17 projects reviewed
by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG), only 59 percent had outcomes rated
moderately satisfactory or above. This success rate compares unfavorably with the
previous period (68 percent in FY96–04) as well as the Latin America and the
Caribbean Region average (80 percent). Moreover, half of these projects faced
significant or high risk to development outcome, which is higher than the Regional
average of 44 percent.

The Bank program has become more knowledge intensive, with the number of
analytic and advisory activities (AAA) rising from 16 in FY96–04 to 38 in FY05–13. In
particular, nonlending technical assistance (NLTA) has gained prominence,
increasing from one-third to one-half of total AAA delivered. In addition to
economic policy, Bank engagement in both public and private sector development
has shifted from lending to knowledge services (and trust funds to some extent).

The number of trust fund operations increased from four in FY95–04 to nine in
FY05–13. However, their total value remains small ($18 million or about 3 percent of
total Bank commitments). Trust fund support for activities in environment, public
sector governance, and social development has remained steady over the past 20
years. During the evaluation period, additional support was provided for education,
energy and mining, health, nutrition, and population. Performance of these trust
fund projects was mixed, with the latest project development outcome ratings
ranging from moderately satisfactory to highly unsatisfactory. Two projects were
cancelled due to a shift in the government’s position toward project design or a lack
of interest because of small project size.

IFC SUPPORT PROGRAM
During FY05–13, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) had very limited
investments in Bolivia. Total commitments, all of which were in in loans, were less
than $200 million for nine projects, of which two ($10 million each) were
subsequently cancelled. Whereas the biggest investment ($50 million) was to
refinance a gas pipeline, which has since been fully repaid, nearly half of all

commitments were for four trade finance guarantees. There was no new approval
for IFC investment since FY11.3

By contrast, IFC had a substantial portfolio of advisory services that included 25
projects for a total expenditure of $8.5 million—although most of these were
approved before FY07. The decline in donor funding after the financial crisis, the
lack of investment client payment, and reductions in IFC’s Funding Mechanism for
Technical Assistance and Advisory Services4 contribution were partially responsible
for this decline. Over 60 percent of the advisory services (15 projects at $6 million)
were in the Sustainable Business Advisory (SBA) business line. These projects
targeted small and indigenous businesses in traditional sectors such as crafts,
textiles, and wood. They sought to enhance benefits to local communities from IFC
investments. IFC also worked on the simplification of business regulations at the
municipal level (four projects at $1.5 million) as well as access to finance.

IEG reviewed five investment projects (three in infrastructure and two in financial
markets) and two advisory projects (both in SBA), and rated all of them positively
for their development outcomes or development effectiveness.

MIGA SUPPORT PROGRAM
The portfolio of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in Bolivia
during the evaluation period consisted of two projects in the financial sector. One
was issued in 2006 and cancelled subsequently. The other, issued in 2012 as part of a
MIGA master contract for capital optimization purposes to the ProCredit Group,
remains active.


Coordination with Development Partners
 Bolivia has substantially reduced its aid dependency. In 2003, external assistance
reached 10 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and financed two- thirds of
public investment. Since then, steady growth and increasing fiscal surpluses have
changed the picture dramatically. By 2012, external financing comprised about 3
percent of GDP and 27 percent of public investment. Three multilateral development
institutions—the Andean Development Corporation, the Inter-American
Development Bank, and the World Bank—make up 60 percent of total external
financing. Among the bilateral partners, as several traditional donors (Denmark,
Netherlands, and United Kingdom) terminated or phased out their assistance,
nontraditional partners (Brazil, China, Colombia, South Korea, and Venezuela) came
in with new funding and technical assistance.

CHAPTER 2
WORLD BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE TO BOLIVIA, FY05–13
New donor coordination mechanisms were created in 2006. In the 1990s and early
2000s, the main donor coordination mechanism was the annual Consultative Group
meetings. This was interrupted during the tumultuous period of 2003–2005. After
President Morales came to power, the formal coordination mechanism was the
Mesas de Coordinación, which was organized by the Ministry of Development
Planning to discuss their sector plans and the alignment of external assistance
around the main objectives of the NDP. In addition, a Bolivia partner group—El
Grupo de Socios para el Desarrollo de Bolivia (GruS)—was created in late 2006 as an
institutionalized coordination mechanism among donor agencies to support NDP
implementation. All multilateral and most traditional bilateral agencies participate
in the GruS.

The 2010 National Evaluation of the Paris Declaration for Bolivia assessed the
progress in donor coordination in Bolivia.5 It found moderate progress in the
application of ownership, alignment, and harmonization principles, but little
progress in promoting management for results and mutual accountability. Despite
operational limitations, the NDP served as an aid-planning instrument that did not
exist in the past because of fiscal fragility and political instability. Greater fiscal
capacity also allowed Bolivia to exercise more sovereignty. Consequently, donor-
driven practices and the number of requirements that must be met to receive foreign
assistance declined. Similarly, there was a greater use of national procurement and
financial systems, mostly through bilateral cooperation. The formation of GruS
represented a key step toward greater aid harmonization, although there was no
government-led mapping of comparative advantages of donors. For their part,
donors tended to concentrate their efforts in sectors where management skills
existed to ensure satisfactory implementation of programs, at the expense of sectors
with weaker capacity. There was no culture of evaluation for results in government
agencies, whereas donors continued to have different evaluation standards and
results frameworks. Efforts to encourage accountability were scattered and had little
impact.

3. Macroeconomic and Fiscal Stability
 Highlights
  Since 2006, the government has followed policies of fiscal restraint and
   unhurried extraction of mineral wealth. Macroeconomic performance has been
   strong. Although the government did not explicitly address the potential
   threat of Dutch disease, the de facto policy of saving a large proportion of
   natural gas revenues have thus far averted its effects.
  At first, the World Bank offered policy advice in these areas, but such
   assistance was largely rejected. Since the 2007 Interim Strategy Note, the Bank
   has stayed out of these areas.

The Plurinational State of Bolivia was in the midst of a political crisis in 2005,
struggling with problems of debt, deficits, and low foreign exchange reserves. The
election of the Morales government with its strong populist rhetoric did not seem
likely to solve the problems. The same government has remained in power, and
their macroeconomic and natural resource management policies have been
unconventional. However, they have not been traditionally populist either, and by
many standards, they have been economically successful.

Since 2006, two main macro phenomena in Bolivia stand out: fiscal restraint and the
unhurried extraction of mineral wealth. Bolivia’s main resource export has been
natural gas from reserves discovered before 2005. The conjunction of historically
high world hydrocarbon prices and the new tax regime (see box 3.1) greatly
increased the profit accrued to the government. Unlike most populist governments,
Bolivia has not spent all of its available revenue. Although it did not institute a fiscal
rule or a stabilization fund, as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) urged, the
public sector has run fiscal surpluses in every year since 2006, paid off most of its
debt, and built up foreign exchange reserves at the central bank amounting to $29.8
billion at the end of 2013, an equivalent of 48 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP). Despite only modest increases in gas export volumes, GDP more than tripled
between 2005 and 2013, and annual revenues to the government rose from 24 to 39
percent of GDP during this time.

At the same time, Bolivia seems to have resisted the temptation of solely relying on
mineral royalties. Unlike many mineral-rich countries which often grow more lax
about imposing and collecting nonmineral taxes, Bolivia’s nonhydrocarbon direct
and indirect taxes have risen from 17.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in
2005 to 22.3 percent of GDP in 2013 (IMF 2009, 2014). This trend provided an

important counter against the potential to succumb to the Dutch-disease resource
curse.

 Box 3.1. Regime for Hydrocarbon Extraction and Taxation

 Under Bolivia’s 1996 Hydrocarbons Law, the hydrocarbon tax system
 distinguished between existing and new fields. While existing hydrocarbons—
 mainly capitalized fields that had been operated by the national company,
 Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB)—paid 50 percent royalties,
 new fields paid 18 percent royalties plus taxes. The 2005 Hydrocarbons Law
 eliminated this distinction, maintained the 18 percent royalties for all fields, and
 introduced a Direct Hydrocarbons Tax at 32 percent of production value. The law
 also required that all contracts signed by foreign companies be renegotiated within
 180 days and migrate from the concession system to a system of payments for
 services. In addition, it stipulated that all production be shipped to YPFB for
 commercialization, first in the domestic market at regulated prices and then for
 export at realized prices.
 In 2006, a presidential decree nationalized Bolivia’s oil and gas reserves. However,
 the nationalization did not take the form of expropriations or confiscations.
 Instead, buy-backs and negotiations took place so that the state would recover its
 majority interest in the companies that had been capitalized or privatized during
 the 1990s. The decree reinforced the renegotiation of existing contracts within a
 six-month time frame and imposed an additional 32 percent “participation for
 YPFB” on Bolivia’s two most productive fields.
 These changes have left the operations of the foreign companies largely
 unhindered, but created no incentives for them to conduct further exploration.
 Current rates of extraction are predicted to deplete the known reserves by the
 early 2020s. Even if exploration begins immediately, the sector’s long maturity
 cycles may lead to production gaps in the medium term and difficulties in
 satisfying increasing domestic and external demands after 2016.

However, the good aspects of macro policy in Bolivia depend on the discretion of
the particular persons in power, especially the president and the minister of finance.
Several aspects of the hydrocarbon and macro-fiscal policy mix are not sustainable,
including (i) insufficient investment to sustain or expand hydrocarbon and mineral
exports; (ii) continued build-up of reserves with no guide as to the desired level of
fiscal surpluses or international reserves to accumulate; (iii) overall public sector
surpluses that derive largely from the inability of subnational governments to spend
all of the hydrocarbon revenues transferred to them by law; and (iv) the requirement
that local governments use all hydrocarbon transfers for investment without


                                                                                           13
CHAPTER 3
MICROECONOMICS AND FISCAL STABILITY
providing corresponding funding for operations and maintenance. At some point,
local governments will start to spend, and the build-up of reserves and government
financial assets will stop. It remains to be seen whether Bolivia can institutionalize
good practices before those in power move on or the favorable hydrocarbon market
conditions end.


World Bank Group Strategy and Support Program
Of the four Bank Group strategy documents, only the 2004 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) addressed issues related to macroeconomic and natural resource
revenue policy (World Bank 2004). However, as noted in the Country Assistance
Strategy Completion Report attached to the 2011 Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS), “The CAS did not include specific CAS outcomes for Bank assistance; it only
included the government’s goals and corresponding Bank instruments to support
them” (World Bank 2011). The government objectives included revising the
Hydrocarbon Law, organizing a referendum on gas exports, and restoring
macroeconomic stability. The CAS set forth a set of “desired results” in each of the
government’s strategic areas.

The First Programmatic Bank and Corporate Sector Restructuring Project was
presented to the Board along with the 2004 CAS as part of two sequential operations
to strengthen the financial and corporate sectors through legal, regulatory, and
institutional reforms and by encouraging the restructuring of banks and enterprises.
The project was highly relevant and at closing in 2006, it achieved all financial sector
(first tranche) objectives, especially with regard to legal clarity of the banking
supervision authority and prudential regulation and procedures for corrective
actions. However, with the Morales government coming to power and the shift of
priorities from financial sector stability and corporate restructuring to issues of
access to credit by small and medium enterprises and rural producers, the Bank
cancelled the second tranche. The anticipated second programmatic operation
likewise did not materialize, nor did the planned Institutional Reform II Project,
which also would have had substantial macroeconomic conditionality.

The 2005 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) noted that “Macroeconomic
mismanagement is currently not a binding constraint” (World Bank 2005, iii). Thus,
it concentrated on investment climate issues, making only perfunctory cautions
about restraining public spending and improving tax collection, without providing
detailed analysis of these issues.

Assessment and Lessons
 Regarding the framework for macroeconomic policy and managing foreign
exchange reserves, neither the Central Bank nor the Ministry of Finance has asked
for or received advice from the World Bank. Largely refraining from echoing the
IMF’s standard policy critique and prescriptions to avoid antagonizing the
government, the Bank has provided technical assistance only on the peripheral
issues where Bolivia requested help. These have included building capacity for staff,
organizing conferences, and providing technical advice on the details of asset and
debt management (for example, how to issue bonds and manage the portfolio of
international investments), but not on broader topics. The Bank’s 2006 public policy
note, developed during the transition to the new government, discussed taxes, but
these were not important in Bolivia’s tax policy decisions (Fretes-Cibils, Giugale,
and Luff 2006).1

Bolivia’s policy in the hydrocarbon sector, including the 2005 Hydrocarbon Law and
the nationalization in 2006, proceeded independently of Bank advice. The Bank’s
public policy note did not take a clear position about hydrocarbon sector policy, but
it stated that the 2005 law needed revision “so that the tax burden and lack of
flexibility [in regulations] do not continue to compromise the sector's development”
(Fretes-Cibils, Giugale, and Luff 2006, 65). Thus, the Bank argued against the
direction in which Bolivia’s natural gas policy had gone and was about to go in a
more extreme way. Since 2006, the government has not sought any help from the
Bank Group on hydrocarbon sector issues.

The Bank Group’s contribution to the outcomes in pillar 1 is not rated. In the early years of
the evaluation period, the sociopolitical events in Bolivia took on a life of their own,
making it impossible for any external development agencies to influence domestic
policies. The Morales government has largely shunned the Bank’s advice on
macroeconomic policy and resource extraction. In this context, the Bank chose to
focus on other areas of engagement and largely stopped giving advice in
macroeconomic and resource management areas.

4. Governance and Institutions for Effective
Use of Resources
 Highlights
  Since 2006, the Bolivian government has engaged in little public sector reform,
   preferring not to bind itself to rules and to retain discretion in its decisions.
  Bank strategy reflected a declining expectation of involvement in these areas as
   the government rejected the Bank’s ideas on transparency and accountability.
  Bank assistance on public sector management supported work on a few
   narrowly defined topics. Although some of these activities achieved their
   immediate objectives, the absence of agreement on an overall reform framework
   meant that the projects contributed little to improved public sector efficiency.

The arrival of the government of President Morales in 2006 started the present era
with deep skepticism toward ideas associated with the Washington consensus on
matters of governance and public sector institutions. Its governance instincts have
favored a much stronger role for the central government, discretionary decision-
making, and selective release of information. This approach contradicts the standard
World Bank governance standards of rule-based decision making, greater
transparency for the public sector, and decentralization when feasible. The most
recent governance agenda of the Plurinational State of Bolivia has emphasized
empowering indigenous groups, disempowering those who had implemented and
benefited from the policies of the previous governments, and minimizing the rules
and accountability institutions that might constrain the government’s policy
discretion.

As part of the effort to create a plurinational and multicultural society, many citizens
of indigenous origin were brought into the civil service despite a lack of relevant
training and experience because of less opportunity for education and government
employment. Partisan connections, although with a new orientation, continued to
play a role in recruitment and promotion. The wage reduction for senior public
sector employees, triggered by the voluntary salary reduction of President Morales,
substantially reduced the attractiveness of civil service jobs and led to the departure
of some of the best technocrats as well as high staff turnover.

Decentralization was an important part of Bolivia’s public sector reform agenda in
the 1990s and early 2000s but has since stalled. The earlier reforms involved electing
local officials and devolving authority and fiscal resources to them. The Framework

CHAPTER 4
GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF RESOURCES
Law for Autonomy and Decentralization, passed in 2010 to actualize the objectives
in the 2009 constitution, endorsed the idea of decentralization. However, it was not
implemented in a way to devolve power uniformly. Although it called for a fiscal
pact to clarify the allocation of responsibilities and to reduce geographic inequities,
the government has not taken action on this. In some areas, the government
appointed the local executives and used them to mobilize political support.
Meanwhile, some staunch opposition places, such as Santa Cruz, received
substantial local autonomy on the implicit condition that they no longer threaten
secession or other disruptions.

Much change does not seem to have occurred in the wide extent of corruption
despite the establishment of the Ministry of Anti-Corruption in 2009 and the passage
of a new Anti-Corruption Law in 2010. The ministry does not have any programs
aimed at preventing corruption. Rather, it only initiates investigations after an
allegation is made. The law allows retroactive application but without safeguards to
prevent its use for attacking political opponents of the distant or recent past.
International experts have observed, “Despite the government’s recent efforts to
fight corruption, it exists at all levels of society. Facilitation payments are so widely
used that experts describe corruption as an institutionalized and socially accepted
norm” (Wickberg 2012; Business Anti-Corruption Portal 2011). The World Justice
Project and Transparency International assign similarly critical ratings.


World Bank Group Strategy
Supporting governance and public institutions was a key component of Bank Group
strategies throughout the evaluation period, but the priorities and degree of
involvement varied. The 2004 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) envisioned strong
support for a traditional and ongoing public sector reform program to achieve an
efficient public sector (World Bank 2004). The 2006 Interim Strategy Note (ISN)
prioritized support for the government’s fight against corruption by placing
Enhancing Good Governance and Transparency as the first pillar (World Bank
2006). Specifically, it sought to help (i) strengthen the government’s capacity to
monitor and evaluate public expenditures; and (ii) improve the transparency and
performance of service delivery agencies.

The 2009 ISN moved Governance and Support to Public Sector to the fourth pillar
and aimed to (i) improve the design, monitoring, and evaluation of public programs
for effective implementation of the National Development Plan (NDP); (ii)
strengthen public sector management for better services delivery and increased
inclusion; and (iii) strengthen the public financial management (PFM) and

procurement framework to improve transparency and accountability (World Bank
2009).

The 2011 CPS continued the trend of diminished expectations for Bank involvement
on governance in Bolivia (World Bank 2011). Under its pillar 4, Public Sector
Effectiveness, the Bank sought to (i) support municipal governments and indigenous
and peasant autonomies; and (ii) strengthen the government’s capacity and
information base of managing public policies. It also proposed to support
governance as a cross-cutting theme by including transparency mechanisms and
institutional strengthening measures in all new Bank projects. Support for Stolen
Asset Recovery (StAR) and municipal procurement technical assistance (TA) are also
cross-cutting themes.


World Bank Group Program
Bank support for governance and public institutions shifted from lending to
knowledge activities. The Bank supported Bolivia’s public sector reform endeavors
intensely in the period before this evaluation. During the evaluation period,
however, a number of planned credits and studies never materialized. Support
delivered consisted of one credit, two grants from the Institutional Development
Fund (IDF), and 11 pieces of AAA that covered financial management, public sector
governance, debt management, and a reimbursable advisory service on PFM to the
Department of Santa Cruz.

The International Finance Corporation (IFC), through four sequential projects,
provided technical assistance to nine municipalities for simplifying the procedures
for granting operation licenses and for issuing construction permits in three
municipalities. A key component in all these projects was to improve local
governmental capacity and tools for regulating business activities.

Overall, the Bank Group program in governance covered three main issues: public
financial and investment management; decentralization; and institutional
strengthening.

PUBLIC FINANCIAL AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
At the beginning of the evaluation period, the Bank provided substantial PFM
diagnostic work, including a comprehensive Public Expenditure Review (2004), an
Institutional and Governance Review on Decentralization (2006), and a Country
Financial and Accountability Assessment (CFAA, 2006). These identified the PFM
areas needing improvement, including budget formulation, internal and external
control and audit functions, budget arrears, and reporting on budget execution.

CHAPTER 4
GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF RESOURCES
Based on the CFAA findings, in 2005 the Bolivian government presented the
“Strategic Framework for Strengthening Public Finances,” which was fully endorsed
by the donor community. Its approval and some early progress in its
implementation were key triggers for the debt relief granted to Bolivia in 2006 under
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.

Bank support for modernization of the public investment management (PIM) system
was delivered through multiyear programmatic nonlending technical assistance,
converted from the cancelled Strengthening State Efficiency Project. This was
complemented by an IDF grant for strengthening PIM-related functions within the
Ministry of Development Planning. The Bank followed a two-pronged strategy: (i)
focused reports and just-in-time policy advice for improving the national regulatory
framework; and (ii) the Rapid Action Plan to streamline financial, fiscal, and
procurement regulations over the entire investment project cycle. To implement the
action plan, the government amended some core legislation,1 which allowed
simpler, quicker, and more transparent public procurement. It also simplified the
methods for local project evaluation and approval, which supported participation of
private contractors in subnational procurement. The government now uses Bank
bidding procedures and documents even for some procurement that is not funded
by the Bank. Nonetheless, investment implementation still lagged due to a
continued lack of local capacity and delays by the Ministry of Finance in committing
and releasing funds to subnational governments during the annual budget cycle.2

The 2009 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) report identified
several areas of progress, but more areas are in need of improvement (World Bank
2009b). Progress included the expansion of an integrated financial management
system for budget control and monitoring at both the central and subnational levels,
implementation of a functional classification of expenditures and the Treasury
Single Account, and improvement in treasury-related functions. However, more
than half of the PEFA areas were rated unsatisfactory, including facilitating
participation in the annual budget exercise, controlling the public-sector wage bill,
controlling nonwage expenses, using external auditors, making prompt and accurate
annual financial statements, and having legislative scrutiny of the budget and
audits. The government rejected Bank offers of assistance in these areas.

In 2012, a joint team of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund prepared a
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC). However, it still awaits a
response from the Ministry of Finance. Among other things, it found that Bolivia is
far from meeting International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Bolivia is the
only country in South America that has not yet endorsed the IFRS.

                                 GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF RESOURCES
DECENTRALIZATION
In the 1990s and early 2000s, the Bank provided intensive and wide-ranging
assistance on issues of decentralization. After 2006, the Bank tried to support
decentralization through two Participatory Rural Investment Projects (PDCRs) and
AAAs. The 2006 Institutional and Governance Review on Decentralization identified
three groups of problems, including inadequate strategy with inappropriate
sequencing, a weak institutional framework and capacity, and an extremely
inequitable distribution of fiscal resources. It also presented options for addressing
them in the short, medium, and long term. The government did not use this holistic
approach to address the problems, but pursued a new, unconventional model of
decentralization and has not welcomed Bank advice on how to implement or
improve the model.

In addition to financing infrastructure improvements (see chapter 5), the PDCRs
worked with the Ministry of Autonomías to strengthen the capacity of rural
municipalities. The projects targeted poor rural municipalities and provided training
to the communities, which helped improve their capacity to implement the small
investment program that the credits financed. Government departments were also
strengthened. However, both the communities and subnational governments
require additional capacity building and clearer authority for implementing the
works that could be financed with transfers from the central government.

At the end of the evaluation period, the Bank started advisory work on a
reimbursable basis with the Department of Santa Cruz on a range of public sector
management issues. The results remain to be seen, but this type of activity has the
potential to support decentralization in spite of reluctance at the national level.

TRANSPARENCY AND INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING
During the evaluation period, the Bank and IFC provided financial and technical
support for building capacity at various government agencies. However, they did
not address the main problems affecting public sector governance. Since 2006, while
proclaiming the importance of fighting corruption, the government has generally
rejected measures to promote transparency. In the area of budget transparency, for
example, Bolivia’s overall rating by the Open Budget Project declined from just over
20 (out of 100) in 2006 to around 10 for the remainder of the evaluation period. The
2009 PEFA revealed that the quality of external scrutiny was the weakest area in
Bolivia. The Contraloría General, the government’s supreme audit institution, is
weak and considers itself underfunded. The internal audit units of ministries are
often weak as well. The Bank provided some training for personnel in the
Contraloría, but gave no in-depth support to its programs. In 2012, the Ministry for

CHAPTER 4
GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF RESOURCES
Anti-Corruption participated in the StAR initiative with Bank encouragement and
provision of training for some personnel. Bolivia has not joined the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative. On several occasions, the Bank offered assistance
in preparing the necessary information and applications, but the government
declined.

The only new Bank lending for public sector improvement was the 2011
Strengthening Statistical Capacity and Informational Base for Evidence-Based
Planning credit. It financed the 2012 census and subsequent analysis. There was also
a $240,000 trust fund for Ensuring Quality in the National Statistical System.
Although these tasks are not yet closed and officially evaluated, they seem to be
relevant and effective uses of Bank financial and technical resources.

With regard to IFC’s municipal business simplification projects, although the
ultimate goal was to promote private sector development, the clearest impact so far
lies in more streamlined administrative procedures, computerized tools and
monitoring systems, and strengthened municipal capacity for implementing
business regulations. Some municipalities (for example, Montero) started regulatory
simplification reforms in other areas after the completion of the IFC projects.


Assessment and Lessons
In its efforts to remain engaged with the government, the Bank Group focused on an
ever-narrower set of issues in governance and public sector reform. The Bank
overlooked past attacks by the government for having “forced” neoliberal measures
on the country and let the government be highly selective in taking the aspects of the
governance assistance that would further its own aims. Staying engaged became at
times an end in itself. Consequently, most of the institutional reforms envisioned by
the Bank in the early years of the evaluation period were not achieved. In the later
years, the agenda narrowed to a few areas, in which the Bank program had a
positive impact, although the scope was too narrow to change the overall picture of
governance and public sector operations. The Bank Group’s contribution to the
outcomes in pillar 2 is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

Bolivia’s NDP focused on poverty reduction and social inclusion, but gave little
attention to PFM. After the debt relief and with the boom in hydrocarbon revenues,
the government showed little interest in the Bank’s support for further PFM reforms
except in a few limited areas. Consequently, although there was some progress in
strengthening PFM and PIM areas, the Bank did not contribute to the development
of a modern monitoring and evaluation system because none of the proposed

lending projects that would have strengthened the government’s capacity to monitor
and evaluate the outcomes of public expenditure materialized.3

During the evaluation period, Bolivia’s earlier progress in decentralization stalled.
Only toward the end of the evaluation period did the Bank find a potentially
meaningful engagement to support the decentralization and autonomy agenda.
There are no results yet. Similarly, the Bank did not find an entry point to assist
Bolivia to improve its institutional transparency, and the country regressed in this
area. Finally, the impact of the Bank and IFC’s capacity building activities was
positive, although total impact remains to be seen.

5. Economic Diversification and Job Creation
 Highlights
  Diversification was not an explicit objective of President Morales’s
   government. Rather, it emphasized state-led natural resource exploitation and
   road development, and saw small-scale production in the private sector,
   including agriculture, as a means to generate jobs and incomes, especially
   among poor, unskilled workers. The country’s dependence on natural
   resources deepened over the last decade.
  The World Bank Group strategies consistently gave high priority to developing
   the nonresource sectors through support for agriculture, private sector
   development, and infrastructure. The assistance achieved varying degrees of
   success.
  In the agriculture sector, the Bank successfully implemented a number of rural
   development and income generation projects, although the sector continued to
   perform poorly overall.
  Regarding private sector development, despite some successful projects with
   localized results in trade finance, operation licensing, and support for select
   small and medium enterprises, the Bank Group program had little impact on
   expanding private sector activities.
  In infrastructure, the Bank Group contributed to improvements in the living
   conditions for the poor in major cities, in the national road network, and in
   access to electricity in rural areas.

Over the last decade, the Plurinational State of Bolivia became increasingly
dependent on natural resources, whereas jobs were created in the nontradable
sectors. Although the extractive industries account for 80 percent of Bolivia’s export,
80 percent of the national gross domestic product (GDP) comes from nonresource
sectors. While seeking to increase state participation in strategic sectors such as
hydrocarbons and mining for revenues, the government strove to boost labor-
intensive sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing, especially small and
medium enterprises (SMEs), as sources of jobs and incomes. Infrastructure
development was emphasized to enhance all productive activities. However, the
Bolivian economy became more resource dependent during 2000–2012, as the share
of agriculture, manufacturing, and services in GDP declined from 85 to 74 percent,
while that of agroindustry and manufacturing in exports dropped from 52 to 23
percent. Employment in both agriculture and manufacturing contracted, whereas
the rapid expansion of transport, commerce, and construction sectors led to

CHAPTER 5
ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND JOB CREATION
important job creation among unskilled workers. The urban unemployment rate
declined from about 8 percent in the early 2000s to less than 4 percent in 2011
(World Bank 2014b).

Agriculture employs about 40 percent of Bolivia’s labor force, but productivity is
low and has remained unchanged for the last 10 years.1 The sector has grown
through expansion in cultivated areas, which rose from 1.8 million hectares in 1995
to 3 million hectares in 2011. Soybean accounts for 32 percent of planted areas. If
continued land expansion is still an option for expanding production in the
lowlands, the limit seems to have been reached in the Altiplano, where small
farmers have cultivated about 1 million hectares since 1980 and land quality has
deteriorated as a result of desertification and soil erosion. Productivity improvement
is also constrained by the absence of an effective research and extension system as
well as by low levels of human capital in the rural sector.

Under the sovereign vision of a state-led economic model, the private sector was
marginalized, although there are some recent signs of improvement. The market-
oriented reforms of the 1990s, though widely acclaimed and instrumental for
modernizing key sectors of the Bolivian economy, were resented by the poorer
segments of the population who did not see a tangible benefit from the
capitalization process.2 Since 2006, the policy environment has created considerable
uncertainty for private business. Consequently, private investment has stagnated at
7 percent of GDP, much lower than the Regional average of 16.5 percent.3 More
recently, improved stability and macroeconomic performance have given more
confidence to private investors. Foreign direct investment (FDI), after contracting
sharply in the first half of the 2000s, started to grow again (see figure 5.1).
Hydrocarbons and mining remained the main sectors for FDI inflow.

Despite process in the last 10 years, Bolivia continues to lack transport
infrastructure, and many Bolivians lack access to electricity, telecommunications,
and water and sanitation services. The country faces difficult challenges in meeting
its infrastructure needs. Its topographical and geological conditions, coupled with
sparse population and low density of economic activity, make infrastructure
development difficult and expensive. In the last decade, Bolivia has made inroads in
improving its infrastructure, expanding the road network by 40 percent, and
increasing paved roads and road density by 20 percent.4 Similar improvements have
been observed in water and sanitation. However, substantial challenges remain. For
example, in 2010 there were only 8 kilometers of road per 100 square kilometers
with just 8 percent of the roads paved, and 73 percent of the population still lacked
access to sanitation (12 percent for water), with worse indicators in rural than in
urban areas.

World Bank Group Strategy
Although diversification did not feature prominently in any of the Bank Group’s
strategies, productive development and job creation have always been an important
area of engagement. The 2004 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) sought to support
programs that would foster the creation of income generating opportunities in rural
areas to address exclusion, inequality and poverty (World Bank 2004). The 2006
Interim Strategy Note (ISN) selected fostering jobs through growth as a strategic
area for Bank Group assistance (World Bank 2006). Specifically, it sought to improve
productivity and competitiveness, access to land and markets for rural producers,
and infrastructure services in major urban centers and around Lake Titicaca.

The 2009 ISN highlighted the importance of Productive Development by placing it
as the first pillar of the Bank Group strategy (World Bank 2009a). It sought to
increase agricultural productivity and food security; boost productivity and job
creation; and improve delivery and access to services in both urban and rural areas.
The 2011 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) maintained the high priority of
Sustainable Productive Development and aimed to support: (i) upgrading
sustainable agricultural productivity; (ii) improving productive infrastructure in
rural areas; (iii) promoting economic integration of the country through the

ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND JOB CREATION
provision of transportation infrastructure; and (iv) fostering greater private sector
activity, especially among job creating SMEs (World Bank 2011a).

Within each joint strategy of the Bank, International Finance Corporation (IFC), and
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, IFC articulated its own approach, which
emphasized selective financing in viable, high-impact projects in key sectors and
technical assistance for SMEs and microenterprises. In the first two strategy
documents, IFC targeted a wide range of sectors for potential investments (i.e.,
extractive industries, mining, infrastructure, financial markets, and the social
sectors) and offered the whole array of advisory products available at that time (i.e.,
business enabling environment, corporate social responsibility, access to finance,
and sustainable supplier development). Gradually, IFC’s strategy became less
ambitious, narrowing to investment opportunities in financial markets and
agribusiness and forestry while advisory services focused on simplification of
business procedures and SMEs training.


World Bank Group Program
The Bank Group delivered its assistance to agriculture and infrastructure mainly
through International Development Association credits, but relied on analytical
work and technical assistance to support private sector development. Lending to
these sectors accounted for nearly 60 percent of the Bank’s financial support to
Bolivia during this period. IFC saw its portfolio decline, but used advisory services
to test new models of intervention.

AGRICULTURE
The Bank’s program in agriculture continued to address the issues identified in
previous strategies as the nature of the problems affecting the rural sector remained
unchanged. Reflecting its long history of supporting the Bolivian agricultural sector,
Bank strategies sought to improve living conditions in rural communities, increase
the productivity and incomes of farmers, and improve the land tenure system and
security for farmers.

Bank interventions consisted of 10 loans and one report. The lending program
supported territorial development, land administration and land ownership, and
conditions of production and farmers’ access to markets. The only analytical work
delivered during this period was a 2011 Agriculture Public Expenditure Review,
which found that public spending in agriculture continued to be unequal and highly
concentrated, was inefficient and ineffective in increasing agricultural productivity,
and had not prioritized public goods such as research and extension (World Bank

                                                ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND JOB CREATION
2011b). The 2011 CPS sought to address the last issue. The Bank approved the
Agricultural Innovation and Services Project in 2012 to support the Instituto
Nacional de Investigación Agrícola y Forestal and Bolivia’s agriculture and forestry
innovation system. With about 30 percent of the credit disbursed so far, there are no
significant outcomes to report.

Territorial Development

To improve rural incomes in indigenous districts and municipalities where basic
needs were the least satisfied, the Bank delivered three credits—the 1998
Participatory Rural Investment I (PDCR I), which was closed in 2006, the 2008 PDCR
II, and the 2012 Community Investment in Rural Areas. These credits filled the
financial gap of rural communities for infrastructure projects such as roads,
irrigation, and generation of electricity. To ensure that rural communities had the
capacity to carry out the works, the credits also funded institutional development
activities to improve the planning and executing capacity of municipalities and
other agencies (see chapter 4).

The Bank credits filled a long-standing gap between what rural communities
wanted (75 percent of expenditures going to infrastructure) and what the
municipalities delivered (25 percent of expenditures in infrastructure). Roads and
vehicular bridges accounted for 70 percent of the total investments under the Bank
projects. The assistance benefited more than 380 municipalities and contributed to
improving the welfare of those it reached.5 The improved capacity and institutions
at the local level allowed municipalities to increase the speed with which they
executed the budgets and use of donor funds. Moreover, the results are likely to be
sustained because financial resources for infrastructure maintenance have ceased to
be a major constraint for executing works at the local level.6

Land Administration and Ownership

 The Bank program supported land administration system in the late 1990s and early
2000s and focused on land acquisition by farmers during the review period.
Problems in the land tenure system constituted a major roadblock for agricultural
development, natural resource management, and protection of the land rights of
indigenous peoples. The government began to clarify the land tenure situation in the
early 1990s, implementing legal and procedural reforms needed for land
regularization and registration. To support the government’s efforts, the Bank
launched the Land Administration Project in 1995, which received additional
funding in 2002 and closed in 2005. In 2008, the Bank continued its support with the
Land for Agricultural Development Project (known as Protierras). Although the first

CHAPTER 5
ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND JOB CREATION
project contributed to improving the land administration system, the Bank’s main
intervention during the evaluation period was not successful.

With support from the 1995 Land Administration Project, the Instituto Nacional de
Reforma Agraria (INRA), created in 1996, improved its financial management
system, enhanced its capacity to address policy issues, and developed a property
registry, the Legal Cadastral Registry. The reforms included the involvement of
women in the titling process. Women were informed of their land rights and
provided with identification cards. In 1999, the government established a National
Agrarian Tribunal to resolve land disputes. Five years later 50 tribunals had been
equipped, staff trained, and 1,684 cases resolved. At project closing, the government
had succeeded in creating a more transparent and efficient land administration
system. This in turn made it possible to regularize land titles and transfer large tracts
of land to indigenous peoples under the present administration.7

Protierras sought to help poor but organized landless farmers acquire land in areas
where the state was absent and participate in income-generating activities.
However, it failed to achieve this objective because in the Santa Cruz project area,
land prices increased sharply, and the government did not support the land
purchase plan. Instead, the project supported other contractual arrangements such
as leasing (arrendamiento), rights for land use (derechos de uso de suelo), and
community shares (aparcería comunal) to gain land access for farmers. The program
exceeded its numerical targets of families covered, but failed to convert landless
farmers into landowners.

Market Access for Rural Producers

Informed by the Bank’s experience in Bolivia and other countries, the Bank and the
authorities decided to use an integrated approach to increase farmer productivity
and incomes; the program has succeeded beyond expectations. Targeting groups of
small farmers, the 2005 Rural Alliances Project (PAR I) and additional financing
helped them identify market opportunities, and provided them with technical
assistance to prepare business plans. The project also financed the venture and
assisted farmers in signing contracts with potential buyers for their crops (the
“alliance”). The assistance exceeded its target for alliances supported (770 versus a
target of 675). A preliminary evaluation by the Food and Agriculture Organization
of 140 rural alliances found that net income per family increased by 46 percent
thanks to increased yields (more than doubled in some products) from better
seedlings and seeds.8 Another evaluation by a Bolivia-based nongovernmental
organization found that: (i) 60 percent of the alliances had higher profits; (ii) 81
percent of the alliances thought that the quality of their products improved or much

                                               ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND JOB CREATION
improved; and (iii) 94 percent of the alliances were willing to accept more
requirements from PAR to have access to it (Fundación Sembrar and Interdisciplina,
2012). The success of the program led the government and the Bank to agree to a
new credit, the PAR II, in 2013 before the closing of PAR I.

With the objective of supporting cluster development in sectors that have high
potential for poverty alleviation, IFC targeted the forestry industry as a strategic
sector. In 2004, IFC financed a wood supply chain analysis by Fundación Bolivia
Exporta as a first step to support wood sector SMEs. In 2006, IFC partnered with the
World Wildlife Fund to pilot an advisory project to address issues that had
prevented the Bolivian forestry sector from reaching its economic and employment
generation potential. Working with four indigenous communities and 27 wood
sector SMEs, the project helped strengthen community and business value chains
and improve market access of certified woods in some communities.

In 2012, IFC invested in a Bolivian forestry company and provided advisory services
to the local communities that supplied wood to it. The project was the first direct
IFC investment in tropical forestry in more than 20 years and promised to have a
significant demonstration effect for responsible forest exploitation, export
promotion, and the development of indigenous communities. However, the project
encountered numerous problems right from the start and had to be closed after only
one year of execution.9 The advisory component was progressing well but had to be
terminated because it was tied to the IFC investment.

In 2011, IFC began preparing the Responsible Soy Advisory Services Project as part
of the umbrella soybean program in the Latin America and the Caribbean Region. It
aimed to support small and medium soybean farmers in improving crop
productivity and sales and in adopting good environmental and social standards. As
of March 2014, however, the project was on hold due to internal discussions of the
project’s strategic fit, which not only affected the team’s ability to meet strategic
targets, but also posed a reputational risk with its project partner, the National
Association of Soybean Producers.

PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
Since 2006, the Bank Group strategy became more of an effort to “reconcile the need
to maintain the role of the private sector and market-driven mechanisms with the
government’s intention to increase the role of the state in the economy” (World Bank
2005a). The Bank used knowledge services to highlight the role that private
investment could play and the conditions that it needs to grow.

CHAPTER 5
ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND JOB CREATION
In 2007, the Bank approved the Productivity and Job Creation Advisory Services
grant to support the development of a possible World Bank loan to Bolivia to build
productivity and create jobs. The grant financed a number of activities,10 which were
appreciated by the government. However, changes in key government personnel
and policy priorities limited the project’s effectiveness. The potential lending project
was dropped in 2009 and replaced by the Private Sector Development/Urban
Alliances NLTA. The aim was to continue dialogue with the government and
explore the possibility of another lending project that would replicate the successful
PAR model in urban areas. Three studies were undertaken to provide analytical
underpinnings for the lending project, which never materialized.

In 2008, the Bank delivered two reports— Strengthening Bolivian Competitiveness:
Export Diversification and Inclusive Growth and Bolivia: Policies for Increasing Firms’
Formality and Productivity (World Bank 2008, 2009b). These reports highlighted the
importance of productivity improvement in Bolivia’s diversification and job creation
agenda as well as the need to address long-standing investment climate concerns.
Both reports were of high quality, contributing to a deeper knowledge of the
challenges and options facing Bolivia’s business sector. There is no evidence of
follow-up.

Before 2004, IFC had a small presence in Bolivia, which was concentrated in the
mining, hydrocarbon, and infrastructure sectors. Since then, IFC investment has
steadily declined. IFC encountered several adverse events, including the contract
cancellation and the nationalization of its investees. As a result, IFC used advisory
services as the focus of its engagement. Under the newly established SME Facility in
the Region, IFC initiated many pilot projects to explore assistance models. Some of
the pilots were successful; others were not. With dwindling donor funding, few
were replicated.

Overall, Bank Group assistance for private sector development targeted three main
issues: access to finance, the business environment, and SME development.

Access to Finance

Bolivia is known for its vibrant and mature microfinance market. Under the strong
push from the Morales government to expand financial access for SMEs and rural
producers, significant improvement has been achieved as microfinance banks and
finance companies expanded their branches around the country while the
unregulated closed cooperatives were incorporated. Of the three studies that the
Bank prepared under the 2009 PSD/Urban Alliances NLTA, two explored
mechanisms to improve access to finance through the establishment of a national

                                                 ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND JOB CREATION
partial credit guarantee scheme and a moveable asset as a collateral system. No
follow-up has taken place.

In 2011, the Bank delivered the Financial Sector Review, which helped to further
dialogue with the government and provide inputs into government reforms.11 The
review assessed the role of the financial system for enhancing growth in rural areas
and the productive sector as well as possible vulnerabilities and bottlenecks for
outreach to underserved segments of the population and economy. The report and
the discussions that the Bank team had during its preparation contributed to fine-
tuning some reform measures (for example, sequencing of measures to bring closed
cooperatives into the regulatory sphere and regulation on moveable collaterals). The
Ministry of Finance indicated interest in follow-up in several areas, for example, in
leasing, factoring, and reform of second tier support. However, no action has been
undertaken.

During the evaluation period, IFC provided small loans ($2.5 million to $10 million)
to expand its clients’ activities in microfinance or for on-lending to SMEs. Most were
not successful. In one transaction, IFC’s loan allowed the client for the first time to
access longer-term credit and contributed to its substantial growth in subsequent
years. In the other cases, however, IFC’s impact was negligible either because it was
a small and late lender among many or because its loan was quickly prepaid or
cancelled before disbursement.

Between 2006 and 2011, IFC provided trade finance guarantees to four major
Bolivian banks under the Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP), which supported
$80 million of international trade. Despite low nonperforming loans and abundant
liquidity, most banks have difficulty accessing international markets because Bolivia
is perceived as a high-risk country. The GTFPs were thus much appreciated. For
example, one bank found IFC’s guarantee instrumental for convincing international
issuing banks. Even for one of the premier banks in Bolivia, which has not needed to
use the facility, IFC’s guarantee were useful as it sought to develop a long-term
partnership with IFC. However, one of the beneficiary banks complained that IFC
could have done more to assure the issue banks because even with its guarantee
some international banks still would not work with Bolivia.

IFC also tried to offer advisory services to three of its investee banks for expanding
their SME and rural finance businesses, but its efforts have been frustrated so far. All
projects either are on hold or terminated. During 2004–2008, IFC implemented a
Leasing Development Program to help draft and submit to Congress a new financial
leasing law to encourage entry of new leasing companies. Although the draft law
incorporated international best practices and IFC conducted nationwide seminars,


                                                                                       33

workshops, and a public education campaign on the use of this financial instrument,
the project failed to achieve its objectives at closing due to low receptivity. Five years
later, however, most of the ideas in the draft were included in the new Financial
Services Law.

Business Environment

The 2005 Country Economic Memorandum noted, “The binding constraints on
growth today relate to [private] investors’ uncertainty as to whether they can realize
returns on their investments” (World Bank 2005b). The two reports delivered in 2008
also highlighted the impact of complex, costly and anachronistic regulations on the
performance of exporting firms and their decisions about formality (World Bank
2008, 2009b). Reflecting Bolivia’s difficult regulatory environment, its Ease of Doing
Business ranking declined steadily during the evaluation period, from 111 out of 155
countries in 2005 to 155 out of 185 countries in 2014. The widening gap between
private savings and private investment is another indication of the poor investment
climate in Bolivia.12

 Box 5.1. IFC Support for Business Regulation Reforms in Bolivia

 In 2001, the newly elected mayor of La Paz took office on a platform of transparency and
 anti-corruption. In 2003, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) launched a pilot
 project to improve the business licensing process in the Municipality of La Paz. A website
 on administrative procedures was developed and maintained for 12 months with IFC
 support. Based on this pilot, the Ministry of Economic Development launched the
 National Plan for the Simplification of Business Regulation at Municipal Level to be
 implemented in three phases: first in major centers, then in leader municipalities, and
 finally in follower (smaller) municipalities.
 Between 2004 and 2005, IFC implemented a second project to simplify the procedures for
 obtaining operating licenses in three leader municipalities, while the Foundation for
 Sustainable Development in Latin America worked in the major centers.
 During 2006–2009, IFC extended license simplification reforms to five follower
 municipalities. Based on the assessment that it would not be cost-efficient for IFC to
 replicate business entry reforms to smaller municipalities, IFC turned its attention to
 construction permits.
 During 2009–2013, IFC worked with four municipalities to simplify the procedures for
 granting construction permits. Finally, in 2013, IFC began to prepare a second-generation
 business regulation reforms project in the Latin America and the Caribbean Region to
 push for reforms at the national level as well as for green regulations to promote energy
 and water efficiency in buildings.

                                                ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND JOB CREATION
To help improve the regulatory environment for doing business, since 2003 IFC
implemented a series of advisory services projects to simplify business entry and
construction permit procedures in municipalities. There are clear impacts in terms of
more streamlined administrative procedures, improved tools and municipal
capacity for implementing business regulations, and enhanced learning and
exchange among participating municipalities. However, evidence is scant of the
reforms’ impact on Bolivian businesses, especially SMEs which are the target
beneficiaries. In Santa Cruz, the Chamber of Small Industry and Artisan is not aware
of IFC’s project and continues to struggle with basic business regulations. In La Paz,
improved inspection and construction permitting procedures concern only large real
estate developers whereas SMEs and informal businesses, which are responsible for
much of the capital’s new construction, remain unregulated.

SME Development

Through the Region’s SME Facility, IFC explored various modes of intervention to
support local businesses and income generation opportunities for indigenous
communities. Bolivia’s business sector is dominated by SMEs, which have expanded
rapidly with the growing economy. IFC’s investment support to micro and small
enterprises, which was provided through financial intermediaries, has not been
successful. Instead, IFC focused on using advisory services to strengthen SMEs. In
the early years, some of the assistance that targeted artisans and indigenous
enterprises (for example, the Indigenous Business Development Program, Dress for
Development, and the Trickle up Program) were small and not well designed. These
projects were generally unsuccessful. To enhance the development impact of IFC
investments, the advisory team actively explored opportunities to work with the
local communities impacted by IFC-supported projects to ensure that they shared
the benefits in a sustainable manner. Most of these interventions were negatively
impacted by difficulties on the investment side, resulting in cancellation or scale-
back of planned technical support.

In 2006 through its Grassroots Business Initiative (GBI), IFC provided financial and
management advice to two socially responsible businesses to expand their
operations. Both projects produced excellent results. With IFC support, Irupana, a
small baked goods company in La Paz that worked with producers of organic
quinoa and other indigenous products, adopted formal accounting systems,
improved operating efficiency, and attained full financial sustainability. The
company grew and successfully entered the export market. Similarly, the Social
Enterprise Fund (FES) of Prodem Foundation, a nonprofit microfinance institution,
made important changes to its management practices, revamped its SME strategies,
and implemented a monitoring and evaluation system. These changes helped FES

better service its SME clients and led to significantly increased incomes of the small-
scale farmers and artisans who supplied them. However, with the spin-off of GBI in
2008, this kind of targeted business support was never replicated or scaled up.

In 2010–2011, IFC implemented Business Edge, an SME training program. So far, it
remains a pilot. Working with local training institutions, IFC tried to develop
sustainable training services to provide local SMEs with access to applicable and
customized business training. The program succeeded in strengthening the capacity
of one local partner (Nueva Economía), but the program’s scope was reduced as two
other partners had to be dropped due to poor performance. Several ministries
expressed an interest in receiving Business Edge training, with the state-owned
Banco de Desarrollo Pruductivo being identified as a potential future partner.
However, according to Nueva Economía, Business Edge training only worked for
large Bolivian companies because the time and cost involved made them prohibitive
for Bolivian SMEs, which required an entirely different kind of business training.

INFRASTRUCTURE
To close the large gaps in infrastructure, sustained efforts are required from the
government and the development community. Bank assistance included nine credits
and two studies that addressed issues in urban development, transport, and energy.
Although it contributed to bridging that gap, given the scope of the problems and
the relatively small size of the assistance, its impact was small.

Urban Development

The Bank support for urban development was implemented through two projects,
which successfully improved urban infrastructure in La Paz, El Alto, and Santa Cruz
but not in the communities around Lake Titicaca. All three components of the 2007
Urban Infrastructure Project, which received additional financing in 2013, achieved
good results. In La Paz, the Bank program was immersed in a well-established
national program, Barrios de Verdad, enabling it to achieve broader impact. Dealing
with neighborhood problems in a comprehensive way, the credits financed one-
third of the activities in the municipality’s program during 2005–2013. It upgraded
roads, drainage systems, communal fountain waters, and other basic infrastructure
in 22 of the poorest neighborhoods and regularized 3,700 property titles. More than
54,000 people benefited from reduced travel time, improved living conditions, lower
crime rates, less damage from natural hazards, and higher property values. In El
Alto, the municipal authorities commended better mobility as a result of the Bank’s
work (i.e., trunk roads, drainage, and sidewalks), especially in the commercial route
to La Paz.13 In Santa Cruz, all of the targets were met for poor neighborhood

coverage, water treatment capacity, sewerage connections, and underground water
contamination—sometimes exceeding the expected results by a large margin.

By contrast, the 2008 Lake Titicaca Local Sustainable Development Project did not
achieve its goals. Designed as a project to promote tourism in the communities
around Lake Titicaca, the Ministry of Culture was the main executing agency. Yet,
the project consisted mainly of water and sanitation interventions—but without the
involvement of the Ministry of Water. The ambivalence of its goal and its weak link
to national programs reduced its relevance. Moreover, insufficient attention to social
safeguards in project design, especially concerning the hard-to-get land titles in rural
areas, created a major roadblock for project execution. The Bank supervised the
project regularly, but its solution was to extend the deadlines when time was not the
issue. By the end of 2013, the disbursement rate was less than 20 percent.

The NDP featured a strategy for road development and maintenance aimed at the
physical integration of the country in support of the productive sector. The high
priority given to the sector is demonstrated by the fivefold increase in the budget for
road rehabilitation and maintenance (from $115 million in 2002 to more than $500
million in recent years), while the total budget for transport increased from $190
million to almost $900 million. To support the government’s objectives, both the
Andean Development Corporation and the Inter-American Development Bank have
had significant portfolios in transport.14 By contrast, the Bank Group’s engagement
has been limited. Yet Bank assistance succeeded in strengthening the country’s
capacity to manage its road assets and to making the national and secondary road
networks more passable.

The 2002 Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project was implemented during a
period of significant institutional change. However, at project closing, the entire
primary road network was maintained adequately in a routine manner and the
conditions of the primary paved roads improved.15 Coupled with rapid economic
growth, this led to big increases in freight and passenger traffic along the two
rehabilitated links and generated significant returns.16 In addition, some progress
was achieved in building the capacity of the National Road Administration (ABC)—
although not in establishing an effective collaboration between the ABC and the
prefectures which manage the secondary roads. An important development was to
use microenterprises rather than government personnel for routine maintenance of
the entire national road network, a positive sign in road management.

The 2011 National Roads and Airport Infrastructure Project just started to disburse.

ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND JOB CREATION
Energy

World Bank Group’s strategies evolved in how they viewed interventions in
energy17 but maintained the ultimate objective of providing better electricity service
to the poor. Bank assistance succeeded in increasing electricity coverage in target
areas. The Bank program consisted of two credits and a NLTA project in 2010 on
Strengthening Small Scale Off-Grid Energy Suppliers, which analyzed the market
for photovoltaic cells in Bolivia. Both the credits and the study focused on electricity
access in poor rural areas.

During 2003–2011, the Bank implemented the Decentralized Infrastructure for Rural
Transformation Project as the first of three planned adaptable program credits. It
supported electricity and telecommunications, although the telecommunications
component was subsequently cancelled. The 2007 ISN envisioned a second phase of
the credit plus a grant by the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA).
The second credit never materialized, but the Decentralized Electricity for Universal
Access grant became effective in 2008. Through photovoltaic solar home systems
and connections to the grid, the credit enabled more than 30,000 households (about
9.8 percent of the households that lacked the service in 2011) to gain access to
energy. The grant, in turn, made it possible for more than 13,000 households to
access portable solar lanterns, including 5,705 of the poorest households. It also
installed solar systems in schools, clinics, and SMEs. Although the project targets
have been met, the long-term sustainability of this achievement cannot be taken for
granted as it will depend on the beneficiaries’ renewal of service contracts after their
initial two-year warranty period expires.

In 2003, IFC provided a short-term bridge loan to a leading global transmission
company for its acquisition of the largest transmission company in Bolivia. With
IFC’s involvement, the Bolivian company implemented an investment program that
improved the coverage, capacity, and reliability of the national transmission system.
To help expand its corporate social responsibility program, IFC provided technical
assistance in 2005 to identify pilot activities that would deliver rural electrification
services from renewable energy resources, with an emphasis on isolated,
unelectrified communities. IFC also partially financed the GPOBA grant.


Assessment and Lessons
Despite the government’s policy objective to promote agriculture and
manufacturing for employment and incomes, its role in the economy and job
creation has declined as Bolivia has become more dependent on natural resources.
Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of the services sector has created many low-skilled

                                                ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND JOB CREATION
jobs in the nontradable sector. The Bank Group supported the diversification and job
creation agenda through interventions in agriculture and rural development, private
sector development, and infrastructure. The results are mixed. The Bank Group’s
contribution to the outcomes in pillar 3 is rated as moderately satisfactory.

The assistance for agriculture and rural development achieved all of the expected
outcomes, with few shortcomings. In designing the PAR, the Bank listened to
government officials and drew from its experience in Bolivia and elsewhere about
what farmers needed to succeed. By targeting poor farmers with productive
potential instead of the poorest farmers without such potential, the Bank was able to
separate social assistance programs from income-enhancing programs, thereby
showing how effective the latter can be in reducing poverty and improving living
standards in a sustained manner. In the context of the low and stagnant productivity
in Bolivia’s traditional agriculture, especially in Altiplano, the PAR demonstrated
the potential for productivity and income gains even in traditional agriculture.

By contrast, Protierras resembled more a social assistance program for a small
number of farmers. It cannot be replicated at a national level because of its large
budgetary implications. Moreover, the success of the Bank’s earlier assistance to
INRA that led to the regularization of 2.9 million hectares of land and the granting
of land titles to over 9.2 million hectares in the previous decade suggests that
assistance like that of Protierras had little relevance.

Akin to community-driven development projects, the participatory rural investment
projects produced good results for the communities reached. It did so by improving
the link of rural producers to the market, irrigation infrastructure, and economic
inclusion of the population. However, it is unlikely to have created the conditions to
raise farmer incomes in a sustained manner as the PAR did.

The Bank Group’s program in private sector development was delivered under very
challenging conditions. While relevant, the assistance was ineffective at improving
productivity and export competitiveness. Both the Bank and IFC were clear about
what the strategic objectives were, but neither knew how to achieve them in
Bolivia’s policy, legal, and regulatory environment. Indeed, the environment was
unfavorable for large, export-oriented companies but encouraged a booming, largely
informal, domestically oriented small business sector.

The Bank’s analytical work addressed the critical issues in private sector
development. It updated the Bank’s and other stakeholders’ knowledge of the
challenges facing Bolivia, maintained a dialogue with the government at a time
when it was not receptive to the Bank’s ideas, and provided inputs to some specific

reforms. Little could be expected from this work without follow-up. The
government was not interested in any additional work; little impact was achieved.

IFC’s support through the GTFP helped Bolivian companies overcome the country’s
negative image abroad and increase its trade. IFC’s technical assistance for
promoting leasing as an alternative financial instrument did not achieve the
expected outcomes initially but eventually succeeded in advancing the agenda to
some extent. However, IFC’s investment and advisory support for expanding SME
and rural finance failed to have much impact, because either the clients did not need
IFC resources or insurmountable regulatory obstacles existed.

IFC’s municipal regulatory reform program was quite successful for a time.
However, the government lost interest (often from key personnel changes) before
enough had been done to affect the business environment in a significant way.
Similarly, although IFC’s technical assistance program rightly focused on SMEs and
indigenous enterprises and communities, most of the interventions never went
beyond the pilot stage. Very often, they touched a small number of firms with little
broad impact. IFC’s only real sector investment was in the forestry sector, which for
all its potential positive impact was doomed to fail almost from the start as a
complex set of risks proved to be beyond IFC’s ability to mitigate.

Overall, IFC has had tremendous difficulties finding business opportunities in
Bolivia despite the booming economy. This raises the question as to whether IFC’s
business model is suitable for helping countries like Bolivia, where the SME sector
has the most financing needs and offers the most investment opportunities. In light
of other financial institutions’ success during the same period (see box 5.2), IFC’s
product mix and transaction process seem to be ill adapted to Bolivia’s market
conditions.18

World Bank Group assistance succeeded in alleviating some of the constraints in
urban development, transport, and energy but fell short of achieving all of its
objectives. In urban development, the Bank’s program succeeded in improving
living conditions in poor neighborhoods in La Paz, in alleviating some of the
transport bottlenecks in El Alto, and in expanding the coverage and quality of the
sewerage system in Santa Cruz. However, it failed to improve water supply and
sanitation in the communities around Lake Titicaca. The Bank’s emergency
assistance in the aftermath of El Niño and La Niña arrived too late to deal with the
immediate problems created by these natural hazards. However, it helped to
rehabilitate more infrastructure facilities and at a lower cost than anticipated. It also
helped Bolivia improve its ability to deal with natural hazards.

 Box 5.2. Inter-American Investment Corporation: SME Investment in Bolivia

 Inter-American Investment Corporation (IIC) is a member of the Inter-American
 Development Bank Group. It lends directly to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), as
 well as through financial intermediaries, and offers a wide range of technical assistance
 support to SMEs. As a SME-dedicated bank, IIC has managed to maintain decent
 profitability, with low nonperforming loans (NPL) and a good credit rating as a stand-
 alone financial institution.
 During 2004–2012, IIC approved 16 private sector loans for a total of $26 million with 62.5
 percent of its loans (10 out of 16) under $600,000. In 2012, IIC provided loans of $200,000
 to a fertilizer producer and banana exporters. Despite the heightened risks entailed by
 such small transactions, IIC has not had any NPLs in Bolivia.
 This outstanding performance is delivered through a specialized program, FINPYME
 Credit, which uses standardized loan documentation and an expedited internal approval
 procedure to process loans of between $100,000 and $600,000 for eligible SMEs. This
 allows IIC to complete its investment due diligence and loan disbursement within three
 months.
 In addition, IIC provides a range of services through FINPYME Diagnostics, FINPYME
 ExportPlus, FINPYME Family Business, FINPYME Integrity, GREENPYME, and
 FINPYME Technical Assistance.

In the transport sector, the Bank’s assistance was limited. However, it delivered
important results both in better conditions of the road network and, more important,
in a new and successful institutional setup for road maintenance whereby
microenterprises rather than government personnel carry out routine maintenance
of the entire primary road network. In the energy sector, the Bank Group’s
assistance focused on rural electrification. It succeeded in expanding access to
electricity to more than 10 percent of the rural households that lacked energy in
2011. However, this result faces moderate-to-high risks of not being sustained in
isolated rural areas since their success depends on the continuity of service delivery
to the systems after the contracts expire.

1Although commercial agriculture has much higher productivity than traditional agriculture, Bolivia
presents one of the lowest agricultural productivities in South America. Yields per hectare in rice,
barley, corn, wheat, sugar cane, and soybean are between one-third and one-half of those of its
neighbors.
2Under the capitalization program, new shares of major state-owned companies in electricity,
hydrocarbons, water, telecommunications, and transportation were sold to foreign investors, who
were required to invest in the companies. Meanwhile, dividends from the state’s share in the
companies were used to create a universal old-age pension.

about 2.9 million hectares, slightly below the 3 million hectares expected. In the next nine years,
INRA issued 277,200 titles to more than 1 million beneficiaries for over 63 million hectares. A notable
accomplishment was to grant titles to indigenous peoples of over 22 million hectares of land in
indigenous territories in the Altiplano (highlands).

9Several reasons explain the project’s failure: excessive bureaucracy and lack of capacity at the sector
regulatory agency; organizational problems within the indigenous communities; and more
important, insufficient due diligence by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to fully
understand the circumstances surrounding the project. The Andean Development Corporation
(CAF), for instance, had considered but rejected the viability of the project before IFC entered.

6. Human Capital Development
 Highlights
  Recent poverty reduction is mostly attributable to the country’s economic
   performance, with a much smaller role played by redistributive policies.
  The Bank’s previous success in supporting health and education reforms came
   to a virtual halt when the government of President Morales came to power and
   the ministries became politicized with frequent change of leadership and no
   clear strategy.
  Although the Bank’s strategies in the human development sectors remained
   largely unchanged, its support program increasingly lost traction.

The Plurinational State of Bolivia has been among the poorest countries in Latin
America over the past two decades. The robust growth since then has led to a
substantial reduction in poverty, especially extreme poverty. In 2006, almost 60
percent of the population lived in poverty and 38 percent in extreme poverty. Levels
of income inequality were very high as reflected by a Gini index of 0.56. Conditions
were significantly worse in rural areas where poverty rates were 76 percent
compared to 50 percent in urban areas, and the Gini index was 0.64 versus 0.51.
Although incomparability between recent poverty data with the older data makes it
difficult to say with precision the extent of poverty reduction, there is evidence of
strong improvement in many human development indicators, which confirms
significant social gains in recent years. For example, infant mortality rates have
dropped from 49 per 1,000 live births in 2005 to 39 in 2011; maternal mortality has
declined from 240 to 190 per 1,000 live births.

The recent poverty reduction in Bolivia was mostly attributable to its economic
performance, which created many low skilled jobs in the nontradable sectors. A
much smaller role was played by redistributive policies such as cash transfers to the
elderly and conditional cash transfers (CCTs) to encourage primary school
attendance and maternal and child health care. To ensure that revenues from natural
resources are used for human development, the government has increased public
investments significantly, earmarking 10 percent of hydrocarbon revenues for
municipal capital investment in human development, especially for health care for
the elderly. However, a lack of clarity in the intergovernmental framework has
reduced the effectiveness of the mechanism. Tying health care for the elderly to
hydrocarbon revenues also places this important safety net at risk should the
revenues decline.

Progress in human development has been stronger in urban areas, and important
challenges remain in improving quality and access to social services. In particular,
developing institutions and policies to achieve President Morales’s goals of
improving household welfare has been made difficult with all the social sector
ministries in a state of flux. For example, the Ministry of Development Planning
changed ministers four times during 2007–2009 and the minister of health changed
six times in the past few years. Developing coherent strategies and dialogue with
partners has been very difficult under these circumstances.


World Bank Group Strategy
During the past decade, the Bank Group gave human development high priority in
its country strategies for Bolivia. The 2004 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
sought to improve the coverage and quality of health and education services,
including maternal and child health and employment programs for youth (World
Bank 2004). The 2006 Interim Strategy Note (ISN) placed Support for Providing
Better Services to the Poor as a key pillar of the strategy (World Bank 2006).
Specifically, it noted the goal of expanding coverage and quality of health services
and secondary education and supporting the reform of the country’s social
protection and safety net strategy. The subsequent 2009 ISN upheld these objectives
and defined three expected outcomes: (i) increased promotion rates in secondary
education for the target population; (ii) a reduction of chronic malnutrition among

children under two years of age and of critical maternal health risk factors in
targeted rural areas; and (iii) an increased percentage of low-income youth in urban
and peri-urban areas with regular employment and improved labor incomes (World
Bank 2009).

The 2011 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) dedicated the third results area to
human development (World Bank 2011). Once again, it focused on access to social
services and safety nets to address health and education challenges as well as the
problem of youth urban migration and the disintegration of the informal safety net.1
It highlighted the government initiatives to develop universal health insurance and
medical infrastructure and equipment to promote the use of maternal and child
health services, including through the CCT Bono Juana Azurduy. In addition, it
aimed to improve coverage and quality of education. While broad strategic sectoral
objectives were translated into specific targets for Bank projects, the results
framework did not specify the results chains, including complementary efforts
necessary to achieve the expected outcomes.


World Bank Group Program
The Bank program in human development areas changed dramatically during the
evaluation period, evolving from being a best practice example during the previous
decade to one having little traction. Although the Bank’s previous support led to
major achievements in the health and education sectors, poverty and inequality
remained high, and the government blamed the Bank. As a result, it was not
interested in Bank analytical or financial support on significant policy issues. Rather,
it selectively sought support on various small investment or technical issues. Social
protection offered more opportunity to engage fully given the government’s stated
interests. Yet, as the decade progressed, it became apparent that opportunities for
input were also very constrained.

EDUCATION
During the evaluation period, Bank support shifted from national reforms to
smaller-scale municipal pilots. During the previous decade, the Bank successfully
supported primary education reform as well as education decentralization through
lending. As the Morales government showed little interest in policy reform and
Bank assistance, the Bank had to scale back its program. These approaches were
relevant, but only somewhat effective.

The lending instruments included two investment loans and a technical assistance
loan. The 1998 Education Quality Project was closed in 2007 and with little

                                                               HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT
achievement. As the government was no longer interested in decentralized service
provision that had been developed with Bank support, the Bank had to drop
preparation of the 2008 Secondary Education Project which supported
decentralization of secondary and higher education nationwide. Eventually, it was
agreed that the Bank would continue the project as a pilot at the municipal level.
Lessons from the 1998 Education Quality Project were brought in and the Bank’s
long-term engagement paid off as the municipal pilot project is achieving good
results. Unfortunately, the ability of the pilot to serve as a testing ground for broader
reforms has not materialized as the government has not shown interest in
sectorwide reforms.

The nonlending instruments included the 2006 Education Sector Report, the 2009
Support to Ministry of Education as nonlending technical assistance (NLTA), and
the 2011 Social Sector NLTA. Overall, this knowledge support had little impact. For
example, the Bank’s work on developing objective standards to assess educational
attainment was rejected by the government. Similarly, only one out of three
components of the 2009 Support to Ministry of Education NLTA project was
completed, and there is no evidence to substantiate the Bank’s claim that the project
allowed reengaging in the education sector in Bolivia, strengthening a relation of
trust and rapport, or engaging constructively on policy dialogue.

HEALTH
The Bank was strongly engaged in the health sector in the late 1990s and the first
half of the 2000s. Since 2006, the Bank lost traction with the Ministry of Health and
has provided modest investment support on specific items rather than a more
comprehensive assistance involving policy dialogue for sectoral development. No
health-related analytic and advisory activities (AAA) were delivered during this
period.

The Bank supported the government’s health sector reforms through a series of
Adaptable Program Loans (APLs) over 12 years, including the 1999 Health Sector
Reform Program APL, the 2001 Health Sector Reform APL II, and the 2008
Expanding Access to Reduce Health Inequalities (APL III). This support included
the establishment of a health insurance program for mothers and children, an
insurance scheme for the elderly, and a national program for extending coverage to
rural areas. The Bank also supported performance agreements between the central
government and nine regional departments to sharpen objectives and results. All of
these have outlived many changes in government and are still its main health
programs. However, this progress was made before the period under review.




                                                                                        49
CHAPTER 6
HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT
Since 2006, the government has shown no interest in the Bank’s broader policy
analysis or advice. The ongoing APL III has encountered many difficulties,
including instability of leadership and politicization of the sector. The government
altered the criteria for targeting investments by insisting that certain areas (in the
lowlands) not receive project benefits. One of the original components of the APL III
was to support universal health insurance, but it was cancelled because the
government no longer wanted to transfer the required greater share of fiscal revenue
to the municipalities. Even technical components, such as development of
information systems, have become politicized as the Ministry of Health did not want
to provide tools to the localities. As a result, the project has advanced little, with
only 15 percent of the commitment disbursed after five years of execution.

The 2008 Investing in Children and Youth Project had two components, one of
which supported maternal and child health via Bono Juana Azurduy. However, it
was cancelled because at mid-term review the Bank and the government agreed that
the component’s objectives would not be achieved at project closing.2 Finally, the
2008 National Food Fortification Program, a small nutrition project, achieved very
few of its objectives. Over half of the committed funds were cancelled due to
implementation difficulties.

SOCIAL PROTECTION
This is the one area of human development where Bank engagement has accelerated
since 2006, but without commensurate results. With President Morales’s discourse
focused on reducing inequality and poverty (“Vivir Bien”), the Bank viewed this as
an opportunity to expand involvement. Since ministers, institutions, and policies
were in flux, the Bank designed a multiyear, flexible, and programmatic AAA
program which was implemented in four phases between 2008 and 2011, namely,
the Social Safety Net I–IV.

Starting with poverty and vulnerability analysis, the program did a number of
things. It assessed the roles of subnational agencies, developed a map of existing
programs, provided technical assistance to national and local governments to help
implement the Social Protection strategy, and continued to develop a Youth
Employment Program for Urban Areas. However, as the government continued to
change and interest in supporting local governments waned, the Bank’s potential for
impact declined as well. Although these AAA efforts evolved into financial support
for the Investing in Children and Youth Project, the impact was not realized. The
Bank had designed this lending project to include two very different components—a
CCT program to promote maternal and child health and a youth employment
program—partly as a hedge because it was not sure which component would have
traction. The program was complex and difficult to expand nationally.3 Eventually,


50
                                                                             CHAPTER 6
                                                             HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT
the CCT component was cancelled due to “reputational risk” (e.g., difficulties in
fulfilling minimum audit requirements). Also, as the government program changed
from a targeted program envisioned during Bank project design to a universal
program, inadequate funds reached intended beneficiaries. The youth employment
component continued but faced implementation challenges.


Assessment and Lessons
The Bank’s objective in the human development area consistently sought to improve
access to better quality social services and help develop the social protection system
and safety nets. Yet, the Bank’s projects did not strongly align with achieving these
objectives. The Bank’s objectives were determined on the basis of important country
development needs and government goals. However, these objectives became
unrealistic over time as Bank projects were modified significantly (because of
political interference) and faced implementation challenges (from both the
government execution and the Bank’s supervision). In the end, the Bank was
supporting areas where it could but contributed very little toward the stated
objectives in the strategy documents. Government officials complained about the
difficulty of working with the Bank, which was compounded by the lack of
sufficient local support in the La Paz office. Compared to the Inter-American
Development Bank and the Andean Development Corporation, the Bank’s in-
country staff presence is much smaller, which led to problems in the Bolivian
context. The Bank Group’s contribution to the outcomes in pillar 4 is rated as
unsatisfactory.

Throughout the decade, the Bank’s support to education transitioned from national
reforms to pilot projects at the municipal level. Given the political transition, the
government’s stated goal of improving equality, and the Bank’s profound
knowledge and experience in the sector, it was relevant for the Bank to seek creative
instruments for maintaining engagement and being able to respond to the
government’s technical needs in a flexible way. However, the government has not
shown an interest in learning from the pilots or in possible scaling-up. When this is
done at the municipal level within a weak intergovernmental framework, the Bank’s
support could be counterproductive as it would lead to larger fiscal responsibilities
for the municipalities to support the operation of these investments.

In the health sector, the Bank’s relevance and effectiveness was very low during the
evaluation period. Issues such as universal insurance and decentralized (and
adequately funded) health care provision were no longer of interest to the
government, despite their relevance for broad-based access to services. As a result,



                                                                                    51
CHAPTER 6
HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT
the Bank’s efforts became increasingly distanced from the strategic objectives as
areas for Bank involvement dwindled. Moreover, the Bank did not address an
important risk with regard to health care financing. In Bolivia, the financing of
municipal health services depends on revenues from hydrocarbons, which creates
vulnerability in health care provision should the price of energy decline. This risk
was addressed in the Bank’s work on decentralization, which had little traction, but
it was not raised in the Bank’s work in the social sectors. Failure to link the
municipal finance issues with project support meant that the Bank lent funds in a
potentially vulnerable situation.

The Bank’s programmatic knowledge support in social protection was highly
relevant. However, as the actual program was driven by political realities, the
impact of the Bank’s technical work was reduced. The government was keen to
address poverty and inequality and sought technical inputs. Bank support helped
technicians strengthen capacity for poverty analysis and program formulation. The
AAA led into the formation of the Investing in Children and Youth Project,
reflecting a strategic alignment of Bank instruments. However, to maintain some
degree of government interest in its support, the Bank had to accept significant
changes in project design, adopting a much more selective approach and staying
away from comprehensive health sector reform. The obvious politicization of the
project also forced the Bank to reduce the scope of its support program.

sanitation, which are addressed in chapter 5.
2The government changed the originally intended targeting and basically made it a
universal program. The Bank’s supervision report indicated that households were not
reliably receiving the grants, and the amounts varied greatly.
3Although program design involved targeting Bono Juana Azurduy to address malnutrition
and maternal and child health issues in the poorest areas, the government wanted the
program to become universal.

7. Cross-Cutting Issues
 Highlights
  The Plurinational State of Bolivia faces growing pressures on its fragile natural
   environment. World Bank Group strategies targeted climate change and
   disaster risk management. The assistance was small and contributed to
   building the institutions and organizations required to protect the
   environment and to deal with natural hazards, but it had little impact on
   reducing the overall environmental pressures.
  On gender, despite recent improvements, Bolivian women face multiple
   challenges. Bank Group strategies paid increasing attention to gender issues,
   and many projects incorporated gender components. Indicators were
   important for maintaining a focus on women whereas outcomes depended on
   the overall success of the projects.

Two of the common challenges arising from a country’s high dependency on natural
resources involve the cross-cutting issues of environment and gender.


Environment
The Plurinational State of Bolivia faces growing pressures on its natural and
environmental resources from overgrazing, the expansion of the agricultural
frontier, and unregulated small-scale mining. In the highlands, the expansion of
livestock herds has led to overgrazing with subsequent erosion and desertification.
In the eastern lowlands, the expansion of soy cultivation has accelerated the
degradation and deforestation of the Amazon forest. Forest losses have reduced
biodiversity and the potential for carbon sequestration, and now constitute the
largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Bolivia. In addition, the expansion of
small-scale mines, mostly without proper tailings disposal and water treatment
systems, has led to a growing contamination of rivers and water bodies close to
urban areas.1 The country’s topography has also made it highly vulnerable to
climate change. There has been increased frequency and intensity of floods and
droughts, such as those associated with El Niño and La Niña, as well as glacier
retreat. The government is taking measures to improve environmental management,
investing in water supply and sanitation, education and hygiene programs, and the
restructuring of the legal framework for managing natural resources.

                                                                    CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES
ENVIRONMENT IN WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGIES
The coverage and substance of the Bank Group involvement in the environment
changed during the review period. The 2004 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
identified three important challenges—expanding the potential of the natural
resource base to promote growth; avoiding negative environmental impacts from
productive activities; and using and managing water resources (World Bank 2004).
However, it did not propose any interventions because there was no demand. The
2006 Interim Strategy Note (ISN) mentioned a Global Environment Facility (GEF)
project under preparation with further discussion (World Bank 2006). The 2009 ISN
highlighted the importance of sustainable development by making it a stand-alone
pillar (World Bank 2009). Specifically, it was focused on mitigating the effects of
natural disasters and the environmental damage of productive activities; increasing
knowledge about the impacts of climate change; and improving the capacity of
public authorities to plan for and respond to change. Under the 2011 Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS), climate change and disaster risk management continued
to be a key engagement area (World Bank 2011). The CPS objectives sought to
reduce social, economic, and environmental vulnerability to climate change and to
restore access to basic infrastructure.

ENVIRONMENT IN WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAMS
The Bank’s assistance consisted of four grants for a total of $20 million, including an
emergency recovery credit, and two nonlending technical assistance (NLTA)
projects—all of which produced satisfactory results. The 2001 GEF Sustainability of
Protected Areas grant for $15 million was the Bank’s biggest intervention in the
environment. It financed the first phase of a program aimed at consolidating the
core functions for managing the National System of Protected Areas. The assistance
succeeded in strengthening management capacity of Protected Areas National
Service of Bolivia (SERNAP) and in establishing a financing mechanism through the
Foundation for the Development of the National System of Protected Areas. The
support helped to raise the visibility of the environmental problems in Bolivia. It led
to the creation of 22 protected areas (out of a total of 49) which contain about 80
percent of Bolivia’s biodiversity. However, despite a stronger system of protected
areas and increased knowledge and technical capacity, some recent decisions to
allow encroachment in a national park have raised serious concerns about the extent
of the government’s commitment to maintain the integrity of the protected areas.2

The 2003 GEF grant to Protección del Medio Ambiente Tarija (PROMETA), a
Bolivian nongovernmental organization (NGO), demonstrated that private efforts
can complement SERNAP’s biodiversity conservation efforts. With support from the
project, private parties identified and managed 90,000 hectares of land in seven areas


                                                                                     55

CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES
critical for biodiversity. More than 100 private landowners became members of the
Bolivian Private Conservation Forum. In particular, the project included collective
landowners—mostly indigenous communities—who in the past had been
overlooked for private conservation activities, and other social groups who were
skeptical of the benefits of private activity in conservation.

The 2007 Urban Wastewater Methane Gas Capture grant to the Cooperativa de
Servicios Públicos Santa Cruz, the provider of water and sanitation services in Santa
Cruz commonly known as SAGUAPAC, helped to reduce carbon dioxide emissions
by about 250,000 tons per year, exceeding the target of 44,000 tons. The 2011 grant
from the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience Phase funded a pilot to demonstrate
the improved management and control of fires in areas affected by slash and burn
practices for land clearing. More importantly, together with the GEF grant to
PROMETA, the grant demonstrated that NGOs and private parties could work
together to manage natural hazards.

 In response to extensive flood damage caused by the 2006 La Niña, the Bank
approved the Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project plus
additional financing to finance reconstruction works in the five affected regions.
Prepared under Operational Policy 8.0 (Rapid Response to Crises and Emergencies)
and in spite of a two-year delay in implementation, the project exceeded its targets
in terms of rehabilitated infrastructure facilities and rural roads. In addition, with
support from the project, the authorities developed a methodology to analyze risk
and vulnerabilities and to develop prevention plans. Communities are more aware
of what they can do for themselves versus what the central government can do for
them.3 These achievements portend a better response to future disasters, but the test
will come when the emergencies arise.

Among the NLTA projects, the 2011 Water Related Adaptation to Climate Change
built hydrological models of climate scenarios to assist policy makers in assessing
vulnerabilities to climate change, developing strategies to adapt to such change, and
defining response. The 2013 Strengthening Environmental Management delivered
analysis and direct technical assistance to key Bolivian agencies that addressed
sanitation, water resources, and mining pollution problems.

ASSESSMENT AND LESSONS
Bank assistance, though limited, generated positive results for strengthening
Bolivia’s capacity to manage its natural resources. In particular, it helped to create
institutions and organizations needed to manage and conserve biodiversity and to
respond to natural disasters. Although much more remains to be done and the

                                                                  CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES
country’s development needs sometimes conflict with its nature conservation needs,
the progress represents a small but important step in the right direction.


Gender
Women in Bolivia face multiple challenges: most are employed in the informal
sector and face difficulties accessing credit; fewer of them own land compared to
men; female wages are lower than male wages for similar jobs; and violence against
women remains high. At the same time, Bolivia performs better on average than
lower-middle-income countries with regard to several gender indicators, including
births attended by skilled health staff and gender parity for secondary school
enrollment. Laws have also been enacted to promote social inclusion and economic
opportunities for women.4 The recent boom in commerce has benefited indigenous
women as traditionally they have engaged in trade while men work in agriculture.

GENDER IN WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGIES
The Bank Group strategies paid increasing attention to gender issues over time. The
2004 CAS and the 2006 ISN made little mention of gender issues. The 2009 ISN
raised the profile of gender by focusing on maternal and child issues under its
human development pillar. It proposed a project (Investing in Children and Youth)
to support the government’s Social Protection and Integrated Community
Development Strategy. It also emphasized gender issues through the Bono Madre-
Niño program, which was part of the Zero Malnutrition Program. Gender gained
further prominence in the 2011 CPS, which incorporated it as a cross-cutting theme
in the strategy. Gender was to be mainstreamed into the portfolio and the CPS
pointed to several projects having a gender dimension.5 The CPS further suggested
that all results areas have a gender focus, and that project design and
implementation include voices of women through participatory mechanisms.

GENDER IN THE WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM
Consistent with Bank Group strategies, gender was incorporated into several Bank
credits in education, health, and agriculture and rural development. Even though
the emphasis on gender issues varied, most projects in these sectors addressed them,
particularly including the number of female beneficiaries in the results matrix. Some
of the Sustainable Business Advisory projects of the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) emphasized working with women. However, the majority of IFC
projects did not have a gender focus and did not include gender-disaggregated data
for beneficiaries.

CHAPTER 7
CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES
Education

The Second Education Transformation Project (2008) had a module on gender and
equity that sought to raise awareness of civic values. The Early Childhood Care and
Development in the Poorest and Most Vulnerable Urban Districts of La Paz and El
Alto (2012) focused on reducing childcare constraints for unemployed and
precariously employed young mothers, and supported early childhood
development for their children. At project completion, women comprised half of the
direct beneficiaries of the former project; there is no information about the latter.

Health

A strong gender focus was incorporated in the Expanding Access to Reduce Health
Inequities Adaptable Program Loan (APL) series. Under the first two operations that
were implemented prior to the evaluation period, an important set of policies and
interventions included the establishment of a health insurance program for mothers
and children. The APL III (2008) continued to focus on increasing access to good
quality and culturally appropriate health services for the population in general and
for mothers and children in particular. However, five years into project execution, it
has met only two out of six maternal and child health care targets. Similarly, both
the Investing in Children and Youth (2008) and the Global Alliance for Improved
Nutrition (2008) projects originally supported maternal and child health objectives,
only to see the relevant components cancelled or scaled back due to implementation
problems.

Agriculture and Rural Development

Most projects in this area emphasized gender issues. The Rural Alliances Project
(PAR) I (2005) and PAR II (2013) considered gender dimensions in addressing the
constraints faced by rural communities. PAR I achieved a relatively high
participation rate of women (women headed more than 30 percent of direct
beneficiary households); PAR II sought to improve further by encouraging women
to participate in capacity building activities, improving training activities with
regard to language and method, and further adapting the communication strategy
to women’s daily activities and education levels. The results are highly positive.
During a field visit of the IEG evaluation team in March 2014, women reported that
the project-financed activity (pig rearing) changed household dynamics by allowing
them to have more power and earn an income. Raising pigs at home, in particular,
allowed them to multitask and take care of other household chores.

Protierras (2008) also had a strong gender focus and included indicators on female
beneficiaries and participation of women on the board of productive associations

                                                                            CHAPTER 7
                                                                  CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES
and in training sessions. Gender issues and gender-differentiated impacts gained
further attention after project restructuring.

The Second Participatory Rural Investment Project (2008) did not establish gender
indicators at project design. During implementation, however, several gender-based
challenges were identified. For example, men on average owned twice as much
arable land as women and were often the decision makers representing the family in
the local governance institutions and in water user associations (Tuchschneider and
Stanley 2014). Subsequently, there was an attempt to set a target for women
beneficiaries and to include women in training and negotiations. However, the lack
of gender indicators from the beginning makes it difficult to assess gender actions.
Experience showed that having more women in different phases of the project did
not always translate into their effective participation (voice and decision making).

Finally, the 2012 Agricultural Innovation and Services Project and the 2012
Community Investment in Rural Areas Project are relatively new. The former does
not have a specific gender focus but monitors the percentage of women farmers who
are satisfied with the technical assistance provided. The latter is a community-driven
development project with a clear intention to track women beneficiaries as well as
their engagement.

Knowledge Services

Several Bank studies, such as the 2005 Bolivia poverty assessment (Arias and
Bendini 2006), public policy note (Fretes-Cibils, Giugale, and Luff 2006) discussed
the various aspects of gaps in wages, employment, earning differentials, legal and
judiciary practices, and the informal business sector. As with most Bank analysis
during this time, these studies did not have significant influence on government
policies.

IFC Advisory Services

Projects such as Dress for Development, the Trickle-Up Program, Business Edge
Bolivia, and Responsible Soy Bolivia targeted women as beneficiaries of financial
and technical assistance. However, most IFC projects, although working with
indigenous and farming communities as well as small and medium enterprises, did
not explicitly incorporate gender dimensions by including gender-disaggregated
data for project beneficiaries or tracking project impact on women.

ASSESSMENT AND LESSONS
There was increasing recognition of gender issues in the Bank Group’s strategies as
well as increasing efforts to include gender dimensions in project design and results


                                                                                      59

measurement. Gender impact depended on overall project success. The Bank’s focus
on gender was manifested most explicitly through its interventions on maternal and
child health. However, the failure of the Bank to gain traction in health in general
meant that the expected outcomes were not achieved. Most of the Bank’s
interventions in agriculture and rural development had a gender dimension.
However, results were mixed and depended on the projects’ overall success at
achieving project development goals. IFC implemented several advisory services
projects that targeted women entrepreneurs, but gender issues were not
mainstreamed in its interventions.

land use and disaster risk management based on pilot risk-mapping exercises in Oruro and

8. Conclusions and Recommendations
The Plurinational State of Bolivia experienced a dramatic transformation during the
evaluation period. Favorable terms of trade and prudent macroeconomic
management led to unprecedented growth in gross domestic product, an
accumulation of substantial fiscal and current account surpluses, and significant
poverty reduction. Important social gains were made in access to basic services and
transport infrastructure. At the same time, the period saw a reversal of many
reforms that previous governments had initiated. Although some progress
continued in the area of public financial management and procurement,
decentralization process stalled, civil service became more politicized, and
transparency and accountability weakened. Frequent changes in key ministry
personnel made policy making difficult. Moreover, as private companies in key
industries continued to be nationalized, uncertainties for private businesses
increased and private investment stagnated, especially in the tradable sectors.
Bolivia became more resource dependent.


Outcomes of World Bank Group Support
Given the high degree of uncertainties during much of the evaluation period, it was
judicious for the World Bank Group to pursue strategies with a limited time horizon
and commit to a longer-term strategy only when sufficient stability returned.
Overall, the strategies had relevant objectives that were aligned with the
government’s development priorities. The interventions were generally well
designed, but implementation faltered in many areas because of a challenging
environment. The program became increasingly opportunistic and narrower in
scope, reflecting an engagement with areas of support selected by the government.
However, it was not always coherent for achieving the intended results outlined in
the country strategies.

The Bank Group’s support was effective in areas where its objectives and
approaches were aligned with those of the government. More specifically, the Bank
Group provided useful assistance in select aspects of public financial and
investment management, agriculture and rural development, urban infrastructure,
roads, and access to energy in rural areas. It also built some institutional capacity for
managing natural resource and disaster risks. Furthermore, it made progress in
mainstreaming gender issues in Bank-supported interventions but not in those
supported by the International Finance Corporation (IFC).

                                                        CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The experience in rural development is informative about the importance of
defining the right objectives and designing proper interventions to achieve results.
The Land Administration Project, launched in 1995 and expanded in 2002, highlights
the significance of supporting institution building with advice and financing. The
gains achieved in improving the land administration system made it possible to
distribute large amounts of land to indigenous groups and to landless peasants. The
Protierras project, on the other hand, aimed at supporting land purchases for
landless peasants. It succumbed to changes in government attitudes toward market
mechanisms for distributing land as well as to the eventual irrelevance of the
intervention.

The Bank’s intervention in transport underscores the importance of focusing on
areas in which the Bank has particular expertise for delivering results. The Road
Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project was the Bank’s only intervention in
transport during the evaluation period. By focusing on road maintenance— where
the government demands assistance and the Bank has the expertise to meet those
demands—the project was able to introduce the idea of using microenterprises
rather than government personnel for routine maintenance of the entire national
road network. The success of this intervention suggests that the same model can be
applied to managing the secondary road networks. However, it will require deeper
institutional changes to ensure good coordination between the National Road
Administration and state and local governments.

The Bank Group had virtually no influence in macroeconomic, resource
management, and broad areas of governance during this period. In addition, it lost
traction in the area of human development. The Bank was able to help improve data
collection on spending and subnational investment design and procurement.
However, it did little in all other areas of governance because there was no interest.
In human development areas, although the government and the Bank shared the
same goals and the Bank successfully implemented a small pilot in education,
fundamental differences as to how to achieve the goals resulted in very little interest
in Bank support.

Bank Group contributions to private sector development were also limited. The
Bank’s analytical work did not lead to a dialogue on promoting the private sector as
a driver of growth and export diversification. IFC, with its traditional focus on large
investments in key industries, struggled to find a role in Bolivia. It provided (or tried
to provide) many different types of advisory services, leaving virtually no stone
unturned. Ultimately, however, it could not achieve much impact.

CHAPTER 8
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Taking into consideration the relevance and effectiveness of the Bank Group program under
the four pillars, this evaluation rates the overall outcome as moderately unsatisfactory.


Recommendations
The medium-term growth outlook for Bolivia is favorable. Prudent fiscal policies
have saved a sizeable portion of the hydrocarbon revenue windfall, reducing the
country’s main vulnerabilities and providing ample buffers against external shocks.
After nearly a century of absence, Bolivia successfully returned to international
credit markets in 2013. It is a sign of investor confidence in the country and opens
the door for future debt sales.

In the long run, however, Bolivia faces serious development challenges. Although
the country enjoys a virtually guaranteed market (mainly from Brazil) for its gas
exports, years of lack of investment threaten its capacity to meet contractual
obligations. Because the country is flush with hydrocarbon revenues, the
government has not yet felt the need to improve governance or to manage its natural
resources more efficiently. At the same time, the growing role of the state and
natural resources in the economy have discouraged private investment in other
tradable sectors.

The Bank Group’s experience in Bolivia over the last two decades has seen intense
highs and lows, yielding lessons for a more mature relationship in the future. In the
1990s, the Bank had considerable influence over all major decisions of the
government; after 2006, the Bank largely let the government dictate its program.
Neither situation is optimal or sustainable. As Bolivia graduates from IDA and relies
less on external resources to meet its financing needs, there is an opportunity for the
Bank to construct a new type of partnership based on shared goals and mutual
commitment.

The Bank Group strategy constitutes the first step toward establishing a formal
program rather than tentative actions for staying engaged. The last two strategy
documents called for selectivity in Bank Group interventions, and the support
program has indeed become more focused. However, the selectivity has largely been
exercised by the government, while both the Bank and IFC tried to engage wherever
they could. This flexible approach was appropriate while the Bank Group explored
entries for dialogue and possible future financing with a publically antagonistic
client. It allowed the Bank Group to maintain a presence and deepen its
engagement.1 However, after eight years, the Bank Group should begin to exercise
selectivity based on the strategic selection of goals and its comparative advantages

                                                       CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
for delivering results. For the Bank Group to provide effective support under these
circumstances, the Independent Evaluation group makes five recommendations.

Recommendation 1: Develop long-term partnerships with the government as well
as other groups outside of the government.

The Bank’s engagement in Bolivia has focused strongly on working with the
government and donors but has overlooked building partnerships with other local
stakeholders. This has backfired in the past. Its close relationship with the
governments before 2005 led to animosity and distrust of the Bank by many
Bolivians, including the Morales government. Its recent emphasis on not
antagonizing the administration in any way has been criticized as evading its role as
an unbiased source of knowledge and trusted development partner. Keeping open
communication with all major Bolivian stakeholders, including different political
factions, academia, civil society, and the private sector, will help build
understanding of and support for difficult reforms that the country needs for
sustainable growth, but that it does not always recognize.

In this process, Bank Group management needs to recognize promptly the changing
needs of Bolivia and adjust its assistance accordingly. During the early years of the
evaluation period, the Bank Group continued to offer traditional types of support
without fully understanding, or accepting, that Bolivia had different priorities and
was searching for a different development model. The Bank Group accommodated
the government’s requests, but its flexibility was largely reactive. Going forward, the
Bank Group should accept the country’s desire to find an alternative path to
prosperity and support its exploration constructively. This requires that the Bank
Group abandon the belief that solutions may be universally applicable, reassess its
offerings of assistance, and if needed, develop new products and approaches to help
Bolivia meet its unique development challenges.

Recommendation 2: Scale up the good practice assistance programs in agriculture
and help the government develop a strategy for raising agricultural productivity
and developing the rural sector.

Most of the poor people in Bolivia live in rural areas. To achieve the goal of
substantially reducing extreme poverty, the government has to focus on improving
agricultural productivity and living standards in rural areas. The Bank’s support
program used various interventions that showed different results. The rural
alliances projects succeeded in raising productivity and rural incomes at the farm
level, thereby helping to reduce poverty among program participants. The
participatory rural investments improved infrastructure and living conditions at the



                                                                                      65
CHAPTER 8
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
community level, but their impact on on-farm productivity is less clear. The
Protierras program, still active, consists of a mixture of social assistance and
productivity-enhancing interventions whose impact on poverty remains to be seen.

The Bank should take stock of these interventions and evaluate their impact on
poverty reduction. In doing so, it is important to distinguish between social
assistance and productivity enhancing aspects of the interventions. This stocktaking
exercise should be undertaken together with the government in a broader context of
identifying the main problems in the sector, diagnosing its causes, and setting
priorities for a long-term development strategy for the sector.

Recommendation 3: Continue to focus on improving road and urban
infrastructure where the Bank has expertise to complement the infrastructure
programs of the government and other partners.

Inadequate transport infrastructure constitutes a major roadblock to creating a
national market and to integrating Bolivia’s economy with the world. The
government is aware of the problem and has expanded its investment in roads. Bank
assistance in transport, though small, has produced good results. Support for
transport should continue to be a major part of Bank’s program. The Bank can use its
expertise in road maintenance programs to help improve the quality of the existing
road network while the government continues expanding its transport
infrastructure. To ensure smooth execution of the projects, the Bank must devote
resources to help its Bolivian counterparts learn about and comply with Bank
procedures, especially its procurement and contracting aspects.

Bank assistance in urban infrastructure has produced good results in La Paz, El Alto,
and Santa Cruz. The gaps in basic services remain large, so there is room for more
Bank support. The assistance is likely to be more effective if it is embodied in a
government program, especially when the program has a national reach such as the
Barrios de Verdad and where its scope can be expanded. Again, helping
municipalities understand and comply with Bank procedures should be an integral
part of Bank support, especially if the Bank wishes to reach less developed
municipalities and to enhance the development effectiveness of the program.

Recommendation 4: Reassess whether and how to engage in governance, public
institutions, and the human development sectors, and adjust the scope of Bank
Group objectives and support programs accordingly.

During the evaluation period, the Bank put enormous emphasis on staying engaged
and has maintained some connection in all of these sectors. Although this may have
been appropriate for some transitional period, it may no longer be the right

                                                      CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
approach now given the lack of traction and competing needs. In broad governance
areas, the Bank has already scaled back its engagement. However, in the human
development sectors, particularly for health and education, the Bank has persisted in
trying to provide support despite the lack of a policy dialogue and very minimal
results. Careful consideration is required as to whether engagement should continue
and how far one can bend the original criteria for project design without
jeopardizing project effectiveness and incurring reputational risk from supporting
politicized projects.

Going forward, the Bank should use analytic work to stay current on developments
in these areas in Bolivia, and to respond to the government’s requests for assistance
on specific topics. For example, the Bank should continue to support the
government’s efforts to improve investment planning and procurement as well as its
statistical capacity. The Bank should also continue to make known the benefits of
developing impersonal institutions and using public accountability to citizens as a
channel to enforce rules. However, it should not encourage reliance on the hope that
individuals with discretionary power will continue to hold it and use it wisely. It
should also not put more substantial resources into decentralization unless the
government clarifies the intergovernmental framework. In this context, if the Bank
decides to support decentralized service provision, for which municipalities want
Bank financial and technical assistance (and this support has been implemented well
in Bolivia), it should carefully consider the cost implications of investments
undertaken by municipalities for both the central and municipal governments and
help municipalities find sustainable solutions.

Recommendation 5: The International Finance Corporation should take a long-
term view of its engagement and further adapt its products and processes to
respond to the market demand of countries such as Bolivia.

Since 2006, the sovereign vision of a state-led economy has closed virtually all
investment opportunities for IFC in the extractive industries and infrastructure
sectors. Outside of these, the Bolivian economy consists mainly of small businesses
that do not meet IFC’s investment criteria. Abundant domestic liquidity and
availability of alternative funding sources also reduced IFC’s value proposition to
Bolivian companies. IFC rightly emphasized advisory services for promoting private
sector development, but many of the interventions never went beyond pilot stage
with limited impact. In FY14, IFC decided to cancel the resident representative’s
position and substantially reduce its presence in Bolivia.

Given how little development impact it has achieved in the last decade, IFC’s
decision appears rational in a context of budget constraint. However, part of the


                                                                                    67
CHAPTER 8
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
reason for the lack of impact is that IFC’s product offerings do not correspond to
Bolivian market conditions today. With a reduced in-country presence, IFC will
further lose its relevance and any potential development impact in Bolivia as it is
difficult, if not impossible, to develop new businesses from afar. Meanwhile, as the
Inter-American Investment Corporation example demonstrates (box 5.2), profitable
business opportunities do exist, especially in the small-and medium-size (SME)
sector. An increasing number of Bolivian private companies are optimistic that the
government, in seeking to develop the productive sector, is gradually coming to
terms with a bigger role of the private sector in the economy. To seize these
opportunities, IFC has to be present and adapt its products and processes to Bolivian
realities. Together with the Bank, IFC can help promote public-private dialogue and
partnership in providing basic goods and services. IFC’s recent decision to
streamline the approval process for small investments in fragile and conflict-affected
situations (FCS) is a welcome step in the right direction. The efforts to reduce project
processing time and costs for small investments should not be limited to FCS.


1 A Development Policy Financing was approved in February 2015 to strengthen Bolivia’s
legal and institutional framework for the comprehensive management of disaster and
climate risks. It was the first such public policy financing to which Bolivia is eligible in 10
years with equal shares of IDA and IBRD funds.

Appendix D. Guide to Country Program
Evaluation Methodology
This methodological note describes the key elements of country program evaluation
(CPE) methodology of the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). Sentences in bold
and italic represent …

CPEs rate the outcomes of World Bank Group assistance programs, not the
country’s overall development progress.

A World Bank Group assistance program needs to be assessed on how well it met its
particular objectives, which are typically a subset of the country’s development
objectives. If a Bank Group assistance program is large in relation to the country’s
total development effort, the program outcome should be similar to the country’s
overall development progress. However, most Bank Group assistance programs
provide only a fraction of the total resources devoted to a country’s development by
development partners, stakeholders, and the government itself. In CPEs, the IEG
rates only the outcome of the Bank Group’s program, not the country’s overall
development outcome, although the latter is clearly relevant for judging the
program’s outcome.

The experience gained in CPEs confirms that Bank Group program outcomes
sometimes diverge significantly from the country’s overall development progress.
CPEs have identified Bank Group assistance programs that had:

        Satisfactory outcomes matched by good country development;
        Unsatisfactory outcomes in countries which achieved good overall
         development results, notwithstanding the weak Bank Group program; and
        Satisfactory outcomes in countries that did not achieve satisfactory overall
         results during the period of program implementation.

Assessments of assistance program outcome and Bank Group performance are not
the same.

By the same token, an unsatisfactory Bank Group assistance program outcome does
not always mean that Bank Group performance was also unsatisfactory, and vice
versa. This becomes clearer in considering that the Bank Group’s contribution to the
outcome of its assistance program is only part of the story. The assistance program’s
outcome is determined by the joint impact of four agents: (i) the country; (ii) the
Bank Group; (iii) partners and other stakeholders; and (iv) exogenous forces (e.g.,

                                       GUIDE TO COUNTRY PROGRAM EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
events of nature, international economic shocks). Under the right circumstances, a
negative contribution from any one agent might overwhelm the positive
contributions from the other three and lead to an unsatisfactory outcome.

IEG measures Bank Group performance primarily on the basis of contributory
actions the Bank Group directly controlled. Judgments regarding Bank Group
performance typically consider the relevance and implementation of the strategy,
the design and supervision of the Bank Group’s lending and financial support
interventions, the scope, quality and follow-up of diagnostic work and other analytic
and advisory activities (AAA), the consistency of the Bank Group’s lending and
financial support with its nonlending work and with its safeguard policies, and the
Bank Group’s partnership activities.

Rating Assistance Program Outcome
In rating the outcome (expected development impact) of an assistance program, IEG
gauges the extent to which major strategic objectives were relevant and achieved,
without any shortcomings. In other words, did the Bank Group do the right thing,
and did it do it right. Programs typically express their goals in terms of higher-order
objectives, such as poverty reduction. The country assistance strategy (CAS) may
also establish intermediate goals, such as improved targeting of social services or
promotion of integrated rural development, and specify how they are expected to
contribute toward achieving the higher-order objective. IEG’s task is then to validate
whether the intermediate objectives were the right ones and whether they produced
satisfactory net benefits, as well as whether the results chain specified in the CAS
was valid. Where causal linkages were not fully specified in the CAS, it is the
evaluator’s task to reconstruct this causal chain from the available evidence and
assess relevance, efficacy, and outcome with reference to the intermediate and
higher-order objectives.

For each of the main objectives, the CPE evaluates the relevance of the objective; the
relevance of the Bank Group’s strategy toward meeting the objective, including the
balance between lending and nonlending instruments; the efficacy with which the
strategy was implemented; and the results achieved. This is done in two steps. The
first is a top-down review of whether the Bank Group’s program achieved a
particular Bank Group objective or planned outcome and had a substantive impact
on the country’s development. The second step is a bottom-up review of the Bank
Group’s products and services (lending, AAA, and aid coordination) used to achieve
the objective. Together these two steps test the consistency of findings from the
products and services and the development impact dimensions. Subsequently, an

GUIDE TO COUNTRY PROGRAM EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
assessment is made of the relative contribution to the results achieved by the Bank
Group, other development partners, the government and exogenous factors.

Evaluators also assess the degree of country ownership of international
development priorities, such as the Millennium Development Goals, and Bank
Group corporate advocacy priorities, such as safeguards. Ideally, any differences on
dealing with these issues would be identified and resolved by the CAS, enabling the
evaluator to focus on whether the trade-offs adopted were appropriate. However, in
other instances, the strategy may be found to have glossed over certain conflicts, or
avoided addressing key country development constraints. In either case, the
consequences could include a diminution of program relevance, a loss of country
ownership, or unwelcome side effects, such as safeguard violations, all of which
must be taken into account in judging program outcome.

Ratings Scale
IEG utilizes six rating categories for outcome, ranging from highly satisfactory to
highly unsatisfactory:

Highly satisfactory:                 The assistance program achieved at least
                                     acceptable progress toward all major relevant
                                     objectives, and had best practice
                                     development impact on one or more of them.
                                     No major shortcomings were identified.
Satisfactory:                        The assistance program achieved acceptable
                                     progress toward all major relevant objectives.
                                     No best practice achievements or major
                                     shortcomings were identified.
Moderately satisfactory:             The assistance program achieved acceptable
                                     progress toward most of its major relevant
                                     objectives. No major shortcomings were
                                     identified.
Moderately unsatisfactory:           The assistance program did not make
                                     acceptable progress toward most of its major
                                     relevant objectives, or made acceptable
                                     progress on all of them, but either (i) did not
                                     take into adequate account a key
                                     development constraint or (ii) produced a
                                     major shortcoming, such as a safeguard
                                     violation.

                                         GUIDE TO COUNTRY PROGRAM EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
Unsatisfactory:                        The assistance program did not make
                                       acceptable progress toward most of its major
                                       relevant objectives, and either (i) did not take
                                       into adequate account a key development
                                       constraint or (ii) produced a major
                                       shortcoming, such as a safeguard violation.
Highly unsatisfactory:                 The assistance program did not make
                                       acceptable progress toward any of its major
                                       relevant objectives and did not take into
                                       adequate account a key development
                                       constraint, while also producing at least one
                                       major shortcoming, such as a safeguard
                                       violation.
The institutional development impact can be rated at the project level as high,
substantial, modest, or negligible. This measures the extent to which the program
bolstered the country’s ability to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use
of its human, financial, and natural resources. Examples of areas included in judging
the institutional development impact of the program are:

      The soundness of economic management
      The structure of the public sector, and in particular, the civil service
      The institutional soundness of the financial sector
      The soundness of legal, regulatory, and judicial systems
      The extent of monitoring and evaluation systems
      The effectiveness of aid coordination
      The degree of financial accountability;
      The extent of building capacity in nongovernmental organizations
      The level of social and environmental capital.

IEG is, however, increasingly factoring institutional development impact ratings
into program outcome ratings, rather than rating them separately.

Sustainability can be rated at the project level as highly likely, likely, unlikely, highly
unlikely, or, if available information is insufficient, nonevaluable. Sustainability
measures the resilience to risk of the development benefits of the country program
over time, taking into account eight factors:

      Technical resilience
      Financial resilience (including policies on cost recovery)
      Economic resilience
      Social support (including conditions subject to safeguard policies)


                                                                                          83
APPENDIX D
GUIDE TO COUNTRY PROGRAM EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
        Environmental resilience
        Ownership by governments and other key stakeholders
        Institutional support (including a supportive legal/regulatory framework,
         and organizational and management effectiveness)
        Resilience to exogenous effects, such as international economic shocks or
         changes in the political and security environments.

At the program level, IEG is increasingly factoring sustainability into program
outcome ratings, rather than rating them separately.

Risk to development outcome. According to the 2006 harmonized guidelines,
sustainability has been replaced with a “risk to development outcome,” defined as
the risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) of a project or program will not be maintained (or realized). The risk to
development outcome can be rated at the project level as high, significant, moderate,
negligible to low, and nonevaluable.
