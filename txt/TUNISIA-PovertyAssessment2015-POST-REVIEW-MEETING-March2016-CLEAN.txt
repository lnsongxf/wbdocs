                             Executive Summary: Key Messages
Tunisia emerges today the only success story of the Arab Spring revolution that swept the Arab world
five years ago. Yet, substantive economic, political, social and security challenges remain, preventing
demands by Tunisians on inclusive growth, good governance and sustainable development from truly
materializing. This report is intended to help fulfil those demands by providing the Government of
Tunisia and civil stakeholders new and useful evidence on the links between poverty, inequality,
vulnerabilities, opportunities and specific policy alternatives.

The starting point is the Jasmine revolution in Tunisia that took the world by surprise. The revolution
took place in a country that for 10 years had grown at an annual rate of 4.5 percent; had managed to halve
its poverty incidence from 35 percent to 16 percent in a decade; and had delivered impressive
achievements in social development, from universal access to electricity and primary education
enrollment to substantive reductions in child malnutrition and maternal and infant mortalities. Poverty
reduction, in particular, was recognized as exemplary by local and international observers alike. Despite
these achievements, a revolution has taken place and multiple challenges still curb citizens’ aspirations.

Far from trying to explain why there was a revolution in Tunisia (already treated in depth elsewhere else,
see for example World Bank 2014a), this Poverty Assessment seeks to learn from the pre and post
revolution periods with a view of avoiding the repetition of past mistakes in the future. Specifically, it
will provide Tunisians with a more detailed and updated diagnostics of poverty, regional disparities,
trends over time and the strong links between poverty, inequality, opportunities and vulnerability. Beyond
statistics, this report would also provide a somber but more balanced alternative explanation of
socioeconomic development in the country, which will hopefully complement the efforts of the
Government of Tunisia to develop and implement its strategic development plan. This Poverty
Assessment questions the extent to which growth was truly pro-poor in Tunisia and, more importantly,
capable of reducing inequalities and increasing inclusion in society. This questioning sheds light on
Tunisia’s prospects for a more prosperous society if substantive changes in the socioeconomic model are
not introduced. To deepen that understanding, this assessment provides a fresher look at poverty and
disparities in Tunisia by focusing on poverty and disparities over time, extending the current period of
analysis beyond 2010, the latest year for official statistics on poverty. Furthermore, the Poverty
Assessment analysis goes into a post-2010 analysis; expanding as well the analysis of monetary poverty
to broader concepts of vulnerability and equal opportunities; and by enriching traditional instruments with
more sophisticated tools to measure poverty, analyze poverty dynamics, and simulate the effects of
certain policy reforms for the first time in Tunisia. Key findings from the analysis are structured around a
few specific questions.

1. Growth in Tunisia has contributed to reduce poverty but not inequality

Certainly, the development of an export-oriented labor-intensive sector (inclusive of low-skilled females)
such as textile and garments manufactures; the expansion of the tourism industry; control of inflation;
increasing investments in rural agriculture; and generous food subsidies that facilitate and incentivize the
increase in agricultural output all contributed to increasing living standards of Tunisians while also
increasing economic growth. Other interventions were implemented, reportedly also with a view on
reducing poverty: increases in minimum wages; strong investments in human capital (including
education) and birth control programs; rural development programs that expanded infrastructure, roads,
water supply and sanitation; generous—although poorly targeted—energy subsidies; and microcredit
programs. Since the mid-1980s, a plethora of social assistance programs, funds for employment creation,
training programs, and social investment funds have all been launched to benefit the poor.
However, several fundamental features of the Tunisian economic model have simultaneously failed to
bring about more economic productivity and social inclusion. Investment policy has long been founded
on a separate treatment of companies producing for export (offshore) vis-à-vis domestic (onshore)
markets. The result is greater imports of (tax-free and higher-quality) intermediate products; fewer
domestic jobs; low demand for high-skill workers; and low salaries. Incentives to attract investments and
favor job creation are highly concentrated in sectors that are not labor intensive and in coastal regions,
thus exacerbating regional disparities. Vital sectors of the economy have been hindered by excessive
regulatory policies, which has created opportunities for rent extraction. The sustainability of the entire
financial system is at risk due to lack of competition and a weak portfolio. In terms of labor policies,
Tunisia lacks a strong social security system and effective unemployment insurance. Workers’ protection
has been traditionally achieved by rigid hiring rules favoring open-ended contracts. More flexible
contracts in the early 2000s contributed to investments in low-skill and informal jobs in low-value-added
activities, away from high-skill jobs. Similarly, agricultural policies have contributed to shifting
production away from labor-intensive crops produced in the interior toward crops in the coastal northern
regions for which Tunisia is not competitive. Finally, many of the resources that were originally designed
to improve people’s welfare went unaccounted for and were distributed through clientelistic networks by
the ruling party. As recently argued by World Bank (2014a), many have traditionally seen social policy
foremost as an instrument of power and control in the hands of a regime that has traditionally discouraged
the emergence of a democratic order, insofar as most Tunisians were willing to accept the lack of political
freedom as the price to pay for socioeconomic development and welfare.

Welfare trends also question, to a certain extent, the pro-poor nature of growth and its ability to reduce
inequalities. On the one hand, evidence from decomposition exercises of poverty reduction strongly
connects those achievements with growth. Growth incidence curves show that most Tunisian households’
consumption benefited from economic growth, including the poorest segments of the distribution, who
saw their consumption grow at a higher pace than the richest segments. The Gini coefficient, the standard
measure of monetary inequality, also went down for most periods for which data are available, and,
between 2000 and 2010, across all regions in the country. On the other hand, the reduction of inequality
among regions was not large in magnitude nor uniform across regions; and while the standards of living
of residents in the same region converged, the standards of living of residents of different regions
diverged.

The most recent poverty estimates –based on simulations and projections– suggest that poverty rates
increased in 2011 immediately after the revolution and decreased in 2012. The poverty impact of the
revolution in 2011 oscillates between 0.9 and 2.2 percentage points, depending on the assumptions used
to project post-revolution poverty rates. The recovery of GDP and employment in 2012 contributed to
reversing the poverty increase of the previous year. All in all, estimated poverty rates in 2012 are slightly
below 2010 levels. Projected extreme poverty rates for 2011 and 2012 suggest similar trends. By and
large, projections are confirmed when using the alternative methodology, cross-survey imputation. Cross-
survey imputation results suggest that poverty rates in 2012 were between 1.1 and 2.2 percentage points
above the levels estimated in 2010, depending on the assumptions made to impute consumption across
surveys (see Figure a).

2. The profiles of the poor and bottom 40 percent have not changed in the last decade despite
sustained growth and dramatic sociopolitical events.

Most recent profiles are very similar to those observed pre-revolution. In fact, the 2012 profile does not
provide evidence in favor of substantial changes with respect to 2010 in most of the tracked
demographics, locations, labor, access to services, and asset ownership. The poor in 2012 continued to
live in more crowded households than the nonpoor. The share of rural poor exceeded that of the urban
poor. In 2012, the poor are concentrated in western regions (60 percent), while only 25 percent of the
nonpoor lived in those regions in 2012. The proportion of unemployed poor was 3.5 times larger than the
unemployed nonpoor and the sector of activity and profession of the household head still matters a lot to
explain the poverty status of the household. Gaps in access to basic services and asset ownership are also
found between the poor and nonpoor across the years analyzed.

The bottom 40 percent of the population based on consumption per capita (b40 group) in Tunisia
comprises all the poor and a substantive share of nonpoor. So, by the very composition of this group, its
socioeconomic profile falls between that of the poor and the nonpoor. Interestingly, the b40 profile aligns
itself closer to that of the poor due to multiple factors (see Figure b). The concentration of poor and b40
households geographically is similar in western regions (60 percent of the poor lived in these regions in
2012, and 50 percent of the b40) and contrasts with the concentration of nonpoor in those regions (only
25 percent). Relative to labor, the distribution of sectors among the poor and b40 aligns closely (each
category comprising about one-third of working household heads), as is also the case for the professional
categories considered in this analysis. Regarding basic services, access rates to tap water, flush toilets,
and sanitation services of b40 households are closer to the access rates of the poor than the nonpoor. This
close alignment between poor and b40 percent populations is observed for 2005, 2010, and 2012.
Evidence also suggests that there have not been substantive changes in the profile of those households
within the b40 group in 2005, 2010, and 2012. It is worth noting that, for some of key features profiled
(such as demographics or education, for example), the relatively short period of time—two years—passed
after 2010, and the technical issues in the cross-survey imputation model on which the identification of
the poor in 2012 is based, may all contribute to small estimated changes over time.

3. Vulnerability continues to be high in Tunisia, which implies that many nonpoor remain at risk of
falling into poverty.

Based on the cross-survey imputation model of consumption, the vulnerability to being poor in Tunisia
for 2005 and 2010 is calculated as the probability of a household to be poor given their sociodemographic
features, geographical location, labor status, access to basic services, and asset ownership. Findings first
suggest that shocks of any nature that would have reduced Tunisian households’ per capita consumption
by 5 percent (that is, TD 41 and 64 yearly in noncommunal areas and cities, respectively) would have led
to poverty increases of 2.3 percentage points in 2010. Shocks reducing per capita consumption by 20
percent would have increased poverty levels by almost 10 percentage points. Alternatively, building from
a recent internationally accepted definition of households vulnerable to poverty as those nonpoor
households with a probability of 10 percent or higher of being poor (Lopez-Calva and Ortiz-Juarez 2014),
results for Tunisia suggest that 56 percent of the population in 2005 and still 46 percent in 2010 would be
considered vulnerable. As a result, 21 percent of Tunisian households in 2005 and 39 percent Tunisians in
2010 would be considered economically secured along the lines defined by Lopez-Calva and Ortiz-Juarez
(2014).

In addition, an analysis of cohorts –groups of people of same age and gender, typically used to understand
poverty dynamics– confirms that most cohorts saw their poverty incidence decline between 2005 and
2010, including those with initially higher levels of poverty. Thus poverty reduction has been a
generalized trend that has also included the poorer segments of the population. But, interestingly, other
segments—cohorts—of the population have also benefited from poverty reduction. All in all, initial
poverty conditions and education and age of household head are found to be the most significant
determinants of poverty reduction across cohorts in Tunisia, while labor conditions and wealth did not
provide additional contributions to reduce poverty over time.

This high vulnerability, increasing poverty and regional disparities likely contribute to the deterioration
of subjective wellbeing and life satisfaction. Even before the Revolution, an increasing proportion,
30%, of the population reported to be unhappy, widely exceeding the share of poor individuals in the
country. This subjective wellbeing measure has substantively worsened after the Revolution, rising to
levels close to 40% in 2012 and it might even be larger today amid changes in the perceptions of political
and economic stability, public security, quality of public services, corruption or quality of jobs available
in the economy, to cite some.
4. The record of equal opportunities in Tunisia is far from impeccable, with education gaps and
geography still responsible for unfair lags in some citizens’ access to basic opportunities.

Circumstances that individuals are born into, and therefore have no direct responsibility for, do still
matter in Tunisia and unfairly affect the chances of children to access key basic services needed to lead a
decent life. Therefore, unequal opportunities exist in Tunisia. Interestingly, the extent of inequality of
opportunities varies by opportunity. Inequality of opportunities is hardly present when it comes to
attending school or starting school on time—which is almost universally achieved. However, it matters
for education attainment and access to water, and became clearly apparent for sanitation. In fact, Tunisia’s
record of unequal opportunities lags behind the best performers in the Middle East and North Africa for
such services (water and sanitation), is comparable to the average Latin American country, and only
better than most African countries.

Addressing unequal opportunities is a key component in the reduction of poverty. Circumstances also
affect the vulnerability of Tunisians to fall into poverty, not only access to services. Today in Tunisia,
factors other than talent and effort determine to a large extent the chances of Tunisians to become and
remain poor. The 10 most disadvantageous population groups have a poverty incidence much higher than
the country’s average: for example, poverty rates among households residing in western regions headed
by a young individual, male or female, with low education are triple the national average.

Robust to the choice of opportunities analyzed, education of the household head, urban/rural location,
regional residence, and wealth are systematically the most relevant circumstances to explain unequal
opportunities in Tunisia. Combined, they account for between 75 and 90 percent of the total differences in
coverage of multiple opportunities across population groups (see Figure c). Interestingly, labor-related
circumstances do not seem to have a large impact on unequal access to opportunities. In fact, changes in
occupation status between 2005 and 2012 are not aligned with observed poverty trends for many
population groups analyzed. It is worth noting, however, that other circumstances such as age, gender,
and education also capture experience, extent of gender discrimination and skills, all of which are
important aspects of labor markets. So, it cannot be concluded that labor does not matter for creating and
maintaining unequal opportunities in Tunisia: rather, the occupation status of a household head alone does
not appear to matter much for unequal access to basic services when other circumstances are considered.

5. Bolder cuts in the current regressive energy subsidies along with better targeted compensations
could go a long way to reduce poverty and disparities

According to official sources, subsidies represent 7 percent of GDP. Two-thirds of total subsidies are
spent on energy. The current price-differentiated structure for residential electricity consumption is
progressive while the non-differentiated prices of gasoline, diesel, and LPG are regressive and pro-rich.
More precise estimates of energy subsidies suggest that they are all regressive and pro-rich, with gasoline
and diesel being the most regressive and LPG and electricity the most pro-rich. In this context, raising
electricity prices for consumers and completely removing subsidies for other energy sources would
immediately—that is, without behavioral responses from users—increase poverty by 2.5 percentage
points. “Easy” compensation mechanisms— that is, either universal or using current structures—will not
bring substantive poverty reductions, even if the government channels the entire TD 817.5 million saved
from the subsidy reform to poverty eradication (see Table a). Perfect and costless targeting would slash
poverty incidence down to 5 percentage points. Yet while this ideal scenario would imply a substantial
reduction in poverty, it would still fall short of eradicating poverty, and inequalities would be reduced
only in modest terms. Moreover, Tunisia is still far from having such an ideal targeting system with
comprehensive and updated lists of beneficiaries and minimal transaction costs. In addition, it should not
be expected that all fiscal savings from the energy subsidy be invested back into poverty reduction. Bold
reforms of energy subsidies need to be accompanied by equally bold improvements to the targeting
schemes of public spending if both poverty and disparities are to be substantively reduced.

6. Multiple interventions integrating water, sanitation, health and food security investments will
have positive impacts on child nutrition –a key manifestation of multidimensional wellbeing– but
these interventions need to be targeted to specific population groups and locations to be most
effective.

Child malnutrition is a salient nonmonetary dimension of welfare that has been long recognized as having
multiple impacts on human development, human capital accumulation and future earnings, and requires
the successful integration of multisectoral interventions before substantive declines are observed. Even
though Tunisia has already achieved its hunger-related MDG and it is a good regional performer, progress
toward reducing child stunting has not been steady over time, and socioeconomic differentials still persist
in the country. Results from this assessment suggest that adequate access to basic services matters in
understanding improved child nutrition in Tunisia. More and better access to improved water and
sanitation sources and non-shared toilets are likely to have significant beneficial effects on child nutrition.
In fact, adequate access to WASH services is found to more likely have a significant impact on nutrition
than food-, health-, and care-related interventions. Estimated effects differ across samples of poor,
nonpoor, urban, rural, and poorest quartile of rural households. For policy purposes, progress toward
satisfying a strict level of adequacy in water and sanitation or any other dimension of public services
alone may not bring the expected gains in child nutrition unless similar gains in other services are also
attained. Unbalanced investments in water and sanitation—or for that matter, food, care, or health—might
not bring visible nutrition benefits unless they are combined. Yet, there is not a single package of
multisectoral improvements that will bring uniform benefits in terms of child nutrition across different
types of households. In fact, the effects of improved access across sectoral interventions vary by group
and area: “more everywhere” will not do the job either.

A final reflection regarding the analysis of poverty and inequalities in Tunisia.

7. The analysis of poverty and disparities in Tunisia could improve from better integration of and
access to data collection

Tunisia is fortunate to have a rich stock of household surveys from which to conduct meaningful welfare
analyses. This stock comprises seven household budgetary surveys (ENBCVs), collected every five years
from 1980 to 2010, and nine annual ENPEs from 2005 to 2013. Tunisia also has three Multiple Cluster
Indicator Surveys (MICSs), collected in 2000, 2006 and 2011–12, and one Demographic and Health
Survey (DHS) that dates back to 1988. The latest census is very recent, from 2014. By 2016, Tunisia will
also have a new ENPE and a new ENBCV with which to update poverty, inequality, and labor analyses.
However, the integration of the different surveys to enhance the analysis of poverty and inequality has so
far been rather limited. This is to be expected to some extent, due to the different objectives and focus of
each type of surveys. However, other preventable factors magnify the difficulties of mobilizing the whole
stock of household surveys for evidence-based policy making. First and foremost, INS only fully releases
data for a few existing ENPEs. Out of the nine existing ENPEs, only 2009 and 2011 ENPE household and
individual-based data files are publicly available. The 2010 and 2013 ENPEs are not available online—
ENPE 2010 is available through a memorandum of understanding—and the remaining ENPEs only report
individual data files. Moreover, data files on labor incomes from ENPEs have never been made publicly
available on the grounds of anonymity. Another factor is that DHS and MICS collection years do not
coincide with ENBCVs, thus making their integration more difficult. There are also important differences
in terms of sampling, representativeness, and definitions among these surveys. A less restricted access to
existing surveys; specific improvements in terms of consistent definitions across surveys; and a more
integrated timing of surveys would surely expand the possibilities for evidence-based policy design in
Tunisia.

I: TUNISIA IN CONTEXT: WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT PRO-POOR
GROWTH IN TUNISIA?
Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1 The Starting Point: A Revolution That Took the World by Surprise

“As a republic with a strong central authority vested in the President, Tunisia has experienced political
stability at a time when its neighborhood has been experiencing significant turmoil. Tunisia has
committed itself to deeper international integration…Past positive development outcomes have fostered a
large middle class that will press for more participation in the development process, greater transparency
and accountability through a strengthened role of civil society and the private sector.” (World Bank
2004:9)

That is how the World Bank described Tunisian prospects in 2004, a few years before the Jasmine
Revolution. Shocking the world in January 2011, the revolution took place in a country that for 10 years
had grown at an annual rate of 4.5 percent; had managed to halve its poverty incidence from 35 percent to
16 percent in a decade; and had delivered impressive achievements in social development indicators, with
close to universal access to electricity and primary education enrollment and substantive reductions in
child malnutrition and maternal and infant mortalities. Tunisia has a long tradition of a competent public
administration dating back to the 1960s; relatively good infrastructure; strategic proximity to the
European market; a skilled labor force; and an established tripartite dialogue process among government,
trade unions, and employers’ associations (World Bank 2014a). This certainly did not foretell a
revolution.

But beyond statistics and indicators, for decades, a less optimistic reality has dominated the economy and
society in Tunisia. A cursory review of the socioeconomic and political history of the country makes
evident a somber truth that many accounts—both international and national—seemingly overlooked
before the revolution.

1.2 Not So Shocking After All: Learning (Late) from History

With its independence in 1956, Tunisia began experiencing progressive social reforms along with a
steady concentration of political power and economic decision making. A dominating state-led model
emerged during the 1960s at the time when the country was building its infrastructure and administrative
and financial institutions. State banks and state-owned companies were also created in vital sectors of the
economy at the cost—according to most analysts—of preventing a strong and vibrant private sector
(World Bank 2014a).

In the 1970s, Tunisia changed course toward a program of economic liberalization in response to the
world crisis (and ailing socialist advances related to collectivization of land; Ayadi et al. 2005). Some
state-owned enterprises were privatized. An investment code was introduced deliberately aimed at
promoting export-oriented growth. Growth and job creation boomed. However, the liberalization process
did not prevent price control practices and lucrative parts of the economy were heavily protected from
external competition (World Bank 2015a). Flourishing export-oriented enterprises were concentrated in a
small number of regions, which resulted in urbanization to the northeast and widening regional disparities
that continue today. Mounting social discontent led to a general strike in 1978. Socioeconomic instability
continued brewing in the following years associated with the massive return of Tunisian workers from
Libya and the rise of Muslim political movements. At that point, Tunisia embarked on an International
Monetary Fund (IMF)–supported structural adjustment program in 1986. In addition to preserving
macroeconomic stability, the program also aimed at further integrating the Tunisian economy into the
world economy in the hope that this would also reduce poverty and economic disparities. Results from the

                                                    17
structural adjustment program have been typically assessed as favorable, as domestic and external deficits
were curtailed at a “relatively small” short-run cost in terms of growth, poverty, and inequality (although
higher in terms of unemployment [Ayadi et al. 2005, 8]).

After a constitutional coup, Ben Ali seized power in 1987. High economic growth and prudent
macroeconomic policies constituted key priorities. Higher levels of political stability were achieved, but
involved repression and suppression of Islamic aspirations, preventing Ennahdha from gaining access to
office after their successful electoral performance in 1989 (Tamimi 2013). Ben Ali embarked on further
attempts to integrate Tunisia into the world economy and revitalize its competitiveness. Tunisia acceded
to the World Trade Organization in 1995, implemented numerous free-trade agreements with main
partners, and sought an association agreement with the European Union (fully implemented in 2008). In
parallel, a host of programs and interventions sought the consolidation of tax and financial legislations
reforms; more deregulation of investments, trade, and prices; rebalancing of the roles of the public and
private sectors; modernization in the administration of the financial and banking systems; and
improvements in infrastructure (World Bank 2014a).

In the absence of democratic progress, Ben Ali used social policy as a legitimacy instrument. The level of
public expenditure for social policies remained consistently high, at around 19 percent during 1987–2005,
doubling the expenditure on health and education (Ben Romdhane 2007). Minimum wages were also used
to compensate for reductions in food subsidies and, at the end of his tenure, generous subsidies were used
to appease social tensions. Programs deliberately aimed at helping the poor were created: the National
Programme for Aid to Needy Families (1986), the National Solidarity Fund, also known as “26–26”
(1992), and the National Employment Fund, dubbed “21–21” (2000), to improve basic infrastructure in
deprived areas and promote employment opportunities. Significant development of rural roads also
sought to benefit the poor by improving the rural poor’s ability to access urban markets for their
agricultural and livestock production (Ayadi et al. 2005).

Ironically, the use of generous social policies took its toll in the form of a pervasive lack of civil and
political liberties. Many of the resources that were originally designed to improve people’s welfare went
unaccounted for and were distributed through clientelist networks by the ruling party (Kallander 2011).
The ruling party itself directly approved the list of families that benefited from state social services. The
regime eventually inhibited the chances for Islamists to gain terrain in poorer areas (Harrigan and El-Said
2009). Social policy thus served to discourage the emergence of a democratic order insofar as most
Tunisians were willing to accept the lack of political freedom as the price to pay for socioeconomic
development and welfare (Ben Romdhane 2007). However, this current report dubs “development before
democracy” as a highly risky and shortsighted strategy. And so it proved to be for Tunisia. If successful,
it might eventually lead to unrelenting democracy aspirations of a more prosperous society—as China and
the Asian Tigers demonstrated—and, if a failure, it might increase both the demand for freedom and
development, thus causing social and political tensions to increase along with poverty and disparities.
Neither had “development before democracy” to be an inevitable strategy in Tunisia. The well-known
modernization theory (Lipset 1959; Rostow 1960; Jackman 1973; Acemoglu and Robinson 2001, 2005;
Boix and Stokes 2003; Inglehart and Welzel 2005; Robinson 2006)1 argues that it is possible to both

1
  Economic growth and increasing incomes favor better collective action among (nonelite) citizens demanding
democracy; increase the costs of concessions (from elites) to maintain authoritarism; increase the costs of repression
to pro-democracy opposition; and favor changes in the economy and its institutions (from agrarian to industrial and
post-industrial economies) that facilitate the functioning of a democracy over lack of freedom (Robinson 2006).
Robinson (2006) also argues that whether economic growth takes place with increasing or decreasing inequality is
essential for democratic aspirations, and at low levels of inequality, increasing inequality may facilitate democracy.
But if inequality gets too high, democracy becomes less likely because elites use repression. However, empirical and
historical evidence are inconclusive in terms of an unequivocal role of inequality on democratization
(Wucherpfennig and Deutsch 2009).

                                                         18
increase democratization along with prosperity. Ultimately, regardless of its legitimatizing function and
its contributions to improve Tunisians’ welfare, many still see social policy foremost as an instrument of
power and control in the hands of the regime (Hibou 2006; Ben Romdhane 2007; Paciello 2011)2 and the
limiting freedom on behalf of economic growth—and, as seen below, limited inclusion—a strategy that
should have not been expected to be sustainable over time.



1.3 The True Paradox in Tunisia: Pro-Poor Growth with Limited Inclusion

The Tunisian economy grew at an annual rate of 4.3 percent during 1980–2010, and at 4.5 percent since
2000. Yet, the economy has been mired in low-wage low-productivity jobs with a state-led model that is
stifling competition while feeding cronyism; and regional disparities—coastal versus interior—persist due
to the lack of broad social inclusion. These economic vulnerabilities have long hindered the Tunisian
economy. Critically, the Tunisian economy has low productivity, which has resulted in insufficient and
low-quality jobs creation figures and a high unemployment rate. According to the World Bank (2014a,
42), about 95 percent of Tunisia’s observed growth between 1990 and 2010 is explained by factor
accumulation, and only 5 percent is due to total factor productivity.3 Unemployment has never achieved
single digits throughout its monitored history. Inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, stalled in the
2000s at a relatively high range of mid-30s (out of a 100 point scale), even in the presence of robust
economic growth and poverty reduction.

Several fundamental features of the Tunisian economic model have simultaneously failed to bring about
more productivity and inclusion (World Bank 2014a). Its investment policy is founded on a separate
treatment of companies producing for export (offshore) and domestic (onshore) markets. A highly
protected onshore sector (about 50 percent of the economy) is characterized by low-productivity firms
surviving thanks to the privileges and protection in the form of entry barriers. The other half of the
economy open to competition does not demand services and intermediate goods produced by the onshore
sector due to low quality, high prices, and substantive bureaucratic burdens of dealing with domestic
regulation.4 The result is greater imports of (tax free and higher quality) intermediate products; fewer
domestic jobs; low demand for high-skill workers; and low salaries. Incentives to attract investments and
stimulate job creation are highly concentrated in sectors that are not labor intensive and in the coastal
regions, thus exacerbating regional disparities (World Bank 2014a).

Vital sectors of the economy have been hindered by excessive regulatory policies. In fact, the numerous
regulations have reportedly led to many legal monopolies and omnipresent restrictions on a long list of
key sectors of the economy such as water, electricity, telecommunications, roads, air transport, tourism,
health and education, among others (World Bank 2014a). World Bank (2014b) estimates that 13 percent
of firms’ annual sales are devoted to regulation-related expenses, which constitutes a “tax” that reduces
firms’ competitiveness and induces small firms to remain informal. Further, the sustainability of the entire
financial system is at risk because of the lack of competition and a weak portfolio, with three large state-
owned banks accounting for about 40 percent of the sector. Heavily regulated market access has created
opportunities for rent extraction. World Bank (2014a) estimates that firms owned by the Ben Ali’s clan
represented about 21 percent of total net benefits of all private firms in Tunisia (or about 0.5 percent of

  A few disagree, however, Ayadi et al. (2005) stresses the high degree of political will and commitment needed to
implement a social spending policy clearly destined to improve living conditions, including those of the most
disadvantaged, and create employment opportunities.

  The meager contribution of 5 percent to economic growth by factor productivity rises to 33 percent if total factor
accumulation adds to human capital accumulation (Ayadi et al. 2005).

  Even though Tunisia exports finished products, including some high tech goods like sewing machines, television
sets and medical instruments, Tunisia does not produce, but simply assembles these products (World Bank 2014a).

total GDP [gross domestic product]). Furthermore, fear among Tunisian entrepreneurs of attracting
attention from government officials—which might lead to expropriation—has led to a rational response of
an “under the radar, stay small” strategy that discourages productivity growth and limits job creation
(World Bank 2014a). Compounding these disincentives are gaps in Tunisia’s labor policies. Tunisia lacks
a strong social security system and effective unemployment insurance. Instead, workers’ protection was
achieved by rigid hiring rules favoring open-ended contracts. But in the early 2000s, adjustable fixed-term
contracts were introduced to allow firms more flexibility. Such contracts are reported to have contributed
to investments in low-skill and informal jobs in low value-added activities, and away from high-skill jobs.
Similarly, agricultural policies have contributed to shifting production away from labor-intensive crops
produced in the interior toward cereals, beef, and milk produced in the coastal northern regions, and for
which Tunisia is not competitive. In addition to regional disparities, the subsidies (of about 0.8 percent of
GDP) are also thought to increase inequalities, since coastal producers for exports tend to be larger
landowners than smallholders in the interior.

All of these economic policy miscues actively hindered the broadening of social inclusion in Tunisia. All
of the jobs that could have been created, but were not, are missed opportunities for integrating the
unemployed into the economy. Consumers as a whole pay higher prices for products from monopolistic
and heavily regulated industries. Because only a few people have access to those in power and the ability
to capture benefits, the majority of Tunisians missed these economic opportunities, leading to deep
feelings of social injustice and frustration. The underwhelming prosperity and increased sense of social
injustice generated by the regime’s economic model made the intrinsically risky “development before
freedom” strategy in Tunisia more likely to fail.



1.4 Today’s Difficult Trade-Off: Abrupt Economic Overhaul versus Social Stability

The constraints in the economy and the strong feelings of social injustice may have not only prompted the
demise of the Ben Ali regime, but may have also raised important post-revolutionary challenges.
Marginal reforms to a model stuck for decades in low productive activities, regionally biased, mired in
cronyism and exclusion from economic opportunities will not be sufficient. Instead, the inevitable
economic overhaul needed to bring about inclusive prosperity is of a large caliber, involving deep
changes in the regional development strategy, investment incentives and consumption subsidies, just to
name a few. Such changes—especially on consumption subsidies—threaten to produce a social instability
on its own that renders reform implementation more difficult in the first place. This catch-22 situation has
recently deteriorated, with highly visible terrorists attacks from Islamists (at the Bardo Museum in Tunis
and Port El Kantaoui) making Tunisia even more vulnerable to social tensions.

In effect, during the transition period (2011–14), the country navigated through social and security
tensions; slow growth; and spillovers from regional conflicts, such as the Libyan civil war. Alongside its
political transition, Tunisia also embarked on economic reforms aiming at macroeconomic stabilization in
the short run, while laying the foundation for more inclusive growth on a longer timeline. Chief among
the interventions needed for inclusive growth is the recapitalization of public banks and a more decisive
strategy for protecting the vulnerable (World Bank 2015b; IMF 2014a). Progress has been mixed in the
implementation of that structural reform agenda (IMF 2014a), and large external and fiscal balances, high
unemployment, and increased banking fragilities still remain main challenges. Likewise, progress toward
a better-targeted social safety net is taking place against a backdrop of a pension system that is in need of
urgent reform to ensure financial sustainability (ibid).

Despite these difficulties, by mid-2015, Tunisia had, by most accounts, completed a successful political
transition that culminated in fair legislative and presidential elections. Undeniable progress toward a new
consensus took place during the transition period. That consensus, enshrined in the Social Agreement

                                                     20
(Pacte social), paved the way for the drafting of the new constitution (World Bank 2015a). The pact
covers industrial relations and social protection, employment and vocational training policy, and
underlines the importance of social dialogue as a genuine pillar of a democratic transition toward greater
social justice. The general agreement is that the constitution represents a compromise across all political
fronts5 that has created a space for “public debate” that had not previously existed in Tunisia (World Bank
2015a).

The new administration has set as key priorities focusing on lagging regions and rebuilding the trust
between citizens and the state. It has launched an active program to favor economically disadvantaged
regions, including civil society and media as meaningful participants in the process. The new government
clearly understands that social stability will depend critically on its ability to listen to and communicate
with citizens and to ensure that any action taken on the identified priorities is recognized by the
population as a step forward toward a more inclusive development model (World Bank 2015a). In fact,
Tunisia has seen a deterioration of subjective wellbeing and life satisfaction, which started even before
the Revolution, while monetary poverty rapidly dropped to 15.5 percent after decades of sustained
reduction. Even in that context, a much higher and increasing proportion, 30%, of the population reported
to be unhappy. This subjective wellbeing measure has substantively worsened after the Revolution, rising
to levels close to 40% in 2012 (Dang and Ianchovichina 2015). It might even be larger today amid
increasing poverty, widening regional disparities and potential changes in the perceptions of political and
economic stability, public security, quality of public services, corruption or quality of jobs available in the
economy, to cite some (World Bank 2016).

Ultimately, the success of the changes already initiated and the ability of the country to meet its short- and
long-term—economic, social, and political—objectives remains to be seen, more so in the context of
demanding structural reforms, increasing instability caused by terrorism and increasing dissatisfaction
among citizens. This poverty assessment does not assess the ability of Tunisia to succeed or provide a
solution to Tunisian short- and long-term social, economic and political prospects, nor does it aspire to
find the right equilibrium between the depth and pace of reforms and a durable stability. Instead, it aims at
providing original and additional evidence on the magnitude of the poverty and inequality challenge that
Tunisian citizens, population groups, and regions really confront. It does so by analyzing poverty and
inequality trends, drivers, and regional disparities after the revolution, a period for which little hard
evidence exists. The analysis also provides further evidence on issues of vulnerability, equal
opportunities, and distributive capacity of public policies to redress such gaps.


1.5. The Need For a Fresher Look at Poverty and Shared Prosperity in Tunisia


In light of these complex trends and challenges, this report aims at providing a fresh look at the issues of
poverty and inequality—including shared prosperity—in Tunisia. The analysis focuses on several new
approaches and issues not covered in previous studies in Tunisia. Of these, this report first looks at
poverty trends post-revolution, that is, after 2010. To do so, it combines projection techniques with
survey-to-survey imputation methods merging consumption models across surveys—National Survey on


5
  This political compromise includes Ennahdha, who had a total of 85 seats out of 217 within the National Constituent Assembly,
and the other political parties with more secular tendencies. Extensive deliberations were held especially around the topics related
to the national identity of the country, the place of Islam, the definition of rights and freedoms, and the equality between men and
women. It took more than two years to complete every article of the new constitution. Civil society (including trade and business
unions) was very vigilant and influential during the drafting process. Over 6,000 citizens, 300 civil society organizations, and 320
university representatives provided input to a nationwide dialogue on the constitution. The document was approved, in the end,
by an overwhelming 200 of Tunisia’s 216 members in the National Constituent Assembly.

                                                                21
Households’ Budget and Consumption (ENBCV) and the Labor Force Survey (ENPE)—and over time,
that is, 2010 ENBCV and 2012 ENPE. Chapter 2 details those techniques and updates poverty estimates.

Secondly, this report provides a more comprehensive look at poverty profiling in Tunisia, both before and
after the revolution. Benefiting from the knowledge currently existing (presented in this chapter), the
proposed poverty profile expands the dimensions previously analyzed for 2010 (and before), and then
expands this analysis to 2012. It also applies the analysis to the bottom 40 percent of the population,
consistent with new approaches looking at a broader and more inclusive concept of growth known as
“shared prosperity.” Chapter 3 reports the results of this enhanced profiling.

Third, this poverty assessment explores the drivers of poverty, adding a few innovations to the work
completed to date. Chapter 4 triangulates evidence on poverty, vulnerability, and mobility using a
common framework of drivers to tie together these related, but different, concepts of welfare. The
analysis expands the traditional notion of vulnerability as “closeness” to the poverty line. It instead bases
the analysis of vulnerability in terms of opportunities or, more specifically, inequality of opportunities—
associated to key basic services. The vulnerability analysis, outlined in chapters 5 and 6, examines the
extent to which labor drives unequal opportunities in Tunisia. With this fresher look, these drivers are
grouped by sociodemographic characteristics, location of residence, labor status, access to key basic
services, and ownership of assets (and consumer durables). This analysis of drivers is then formalized in
an econometric analysis that helps understand the roles of different factors, along with initial conditions,
in driving poverty changes.

Fourth, the role of policies is carefully analyzed. The assessment explores the poverty and distributional
implications of the single most important safety net intervention—at least in magnitude—in Tunisia:
energy subsidies. Chapter 7 analyzes the impact that the recent post-revolution changes have had on
poverty, inequality, and fiscal balances. Equally importantly, it shows the absolute relevance of linking
energy subsidy reforms with other safety net mechanisms, specifically, better-targeted cash transfers. All
of this analysis is conducted through simulations of several policy reform scenarios that substitute for a
concrete reform proposal currently being discussed.

Lastly, this report examines issues regarding the effectiveness and synergy of Tunisia’s public
interventions. Specifically, the focus is on multidimensional, integrated, and synergistic interventions in
the area of child malnutrition, taking advantage of a holistic food security framework developed by the
United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). Child malnutrition in Tunisia has improved over the last
decades, but progress has not been sustained and socioeconomic differentials persist. While the UNICEF
food security framework, which underscores the importance of multiple interventions for successful
reduction of malnutrition, is well known, it has not been previously applied in empirical studies. Tunisia
constitutes one of the first applications. This assessment (developed in chapter 8) suggests that
investments in one sector alone are unlikely to deliver the needed improvements, unless accompanied by
multisectoral progress. But not any set of multiple interventions should be expected to generate desired
synergies in reducing malnutrition among Tunisian children. Thus, different contexts may require a
different set of interventions to be effective: one size does not fit all.

This fresher look at poverty and disparities in Tunisia has as its final objective—to fill some of the gaps in
current knowledge about poverty and inequality trends in the country. The areas selected for analysis
respond to three intermediate objectives:

        (i)     shed more light on poverty incidence after the revolution, even though the latest available
                ENBCV to calculate poverty rates dates back to 2010, and a new ENBCV (to be collected
                in 2015) is not expected to be available until 2016;



                                                     22
        (ii)    use a combination of traditional instruments and more sophisticated tools to measure
                poverty, analyze poverty dynamics, and simulate the effects of certain policy reforms;
                and
        (iii)   strengthen the understanding of the links between poverty, disparities, vulnerabilities, and
                equal opportunities in Tunisia.
Consistent with these objectives, this poverty assessment aims at addressing the following questions:

        Q1      Did poverty in Tunisia increase after the revolution?

        Q2      Who are the post-revolution poor and the bottom 40 percent (b40) population?

        Q3      What factors have caused poverty to decline in the last decade?

        Q4      Has vulnerability to poverty increased in Tunisia in the post-revolution period?

        Q5     To what extent is Tunisia an equal opportunity society? What is behind unequal
        opportunities in the country?

        Q6      Can reforms to energy subsidies substantially improve poverty and inequality in Tunisia?

        Q7     How can public policy be more effective in improving the living conditions of Tunisian
        households?

It is worth noting that current knowledge on poverty and inequality in Tunisia—as reviewed in chapters 2
and 3—does not come from sophisticated analytical models, either partial or general equilibrium models.
Recently, however, analytics in Tunisia have benefitted from the use of computable general equilibrium
(CGE) models to understand the costing implications of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs;
Chemingui and Sanchez 2011) and simulation techniques to understand the distributive implications of
subsidies (World Bank 2013b). Interestingly, existing CGE modeling has not yet analyzed the
implications of several domestic policies and external shocks on poverty and have used 2005 as reference
year. In this regard, the assessment attempts to overcome some of these limitations by providing new
techniques to the analytical landscape in Tunisia. This is, in effect, the application of survey-to-survey
imputation to approach poverty incidence in 2012. This is also the case of the Human Opportunity Index–
based framework of unequal opportunities developed by the World Bank to analyze the links between
poverty, opportunities, and labor markets. Subsidies will be analyzed using the recently developed
SUBSIM simulation model (Araar and Verme 2012) and pioneered in Middle Eastern and North African
countries. The analysis of synergies among policy interventions will benefit from a recent econometric
application of the UNICEF food security framework pioneered by Skoufias et al. (forthcoming). These
techniques will add value to standard poverty profiles, mobility and poverty dynamics analyses.

It is also worth noting that the proposed questions in this poverty assessment do not address all the issues
related to poverty and disparities, nor will this report produce definite answers to all the identified
questions. For instance, incidence of poverty post-revolution does not go beyond 2012, even when using
survey-to-survey imputation techniques. Also, poverty profiles post-revolution are based on the imputed
distribution of consumption rather than observed consumption. In so far as imputed distributions of
consumptions come from a model that assumes a similar behavior over time, the resulting profile can be
understood as a first-round diagnostic of poverty post-revolution. As a result, the comparison of pre- and
post-revolution profiles is illustrative and tentative rather than conclusive. Another example is the
analysis of poverty drivers. Results from the econometric analysis cannot—should not—be automatically
interpreted as causality effects in the presence of more than likely reverse causality among poverty and
labor decisions, asset ownership, and access to public services. Furthermore, the analysis of drivers does
not include explicitly social benefits, which are analyzed separately. And the separate analysis of social


                                                     23
interventions is limited to energy subsidies and malnutrition-related interventions. Even if comprehensive,
the analysis is not complete.

There are several reasons why the analytics in this assessment are incomplete. First and foremost,
limitations in terms of both data quality and access prevent the assessment from providing a more recent
analysis of poverty trends than 2012 and including dimensions such as health, food subsidies or cash
transfers. Box 1 details what are those limitations and what are their implications. Secondly, even the
most cutting edge techniques proposed have their intrinsic limitations, as discussed in each of the
chapters. Finally, a proper—and deeper—analysis of policy interventions would require a more
comprehensive sector analysis. This is, however, beyond the scope of this poverty assessment and have
been or are currently covered—to different extents—by more comprehensive initiatives such as the
Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCD) and Country Partnership Framework (CPF) being developed by
the World Bank (2015a, 2015d), the recent development policy report (World Bank 2014b), development
policy loan (World Bank 2015b), regional jobs diagnostics (World Bank 2013a), the Tunisia jobs report
(World Bank 2015e), and labor and social protection sector notes (World Bank 2015f). Ultimately, this
poverty assessment seeks to complement and contribute added value to—rather than substitute or
replicate—existing knowledge from previous analyses.

Box 1. Data Limitations for the Analysis of Poverty in Tunisia
Tunisia has a rich stock of household surveys. This stock comprises seven household budgetary surveys
(ENBCVs), collected every five years from 1980 to 2010, and nine annual labor force surveys, from 2005
to 2013. In addition, Tunisia has three Multiple Cluster Indicator Surveys (MICs), collected in 2000,
2006 and 2011–12, and one Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) from 1988. The World Bank also
collected a dedicated survey on youth employment in 2012. The latest census was conducted in 2014, and
updates the previous census of 2004.

This extensive array of surveys enables analysis of a wide range of poverty- and inequality-related issues
over time and across space. However, the integration of the different surveys to support the analysis of
poverty and inequality has proven rather limited. This is to be expected to some extent, because of the
different objectives and focus of each type of survey. However, other preventable factors magnify the
difficulties in mobilizing the whole stock of household surveys to analyze poverty and disparities in
Tunisia.

First and foremost, at this moment, only a few of the existing labor force surveys (ENPEs; by the Institut
National des Statistiques [INS] ) fully release data to the public. Out of the nine existing ENPEs, only the
2009 and 2012 ENPE rounds make both household and individual-based data files publicly available. The
2010 ENPE is not available on line—though it was made available to the World Bank through a
memorandum of understanding. The remaining ENPEs only report the individual data file. Moreover, on
the grounds of anonymity, data files on labor incomes from ENPEs have never been made publicly
available for analysis. Second, DHS and MICS collection years do not coincide with ENBCV collection
surveys, thus making their integration more difficult. Third, there are important differences in terms of
sampling, representativeness, and definitions among these surveys. For example, ENBCV is, in practice,
the only survey that reports a monetary metric to measure poverty—household expenditures. No other
survey provides expenditures or incomes. MICSs are representative of the population of women and
children, but not the entire population. The definition of urban areas has changed over time, and ENBCV
recently began differentiating cities from small and mid-sized towns, while ENPEs do not make this
distinction. Also, differences in the enunciation of questions concerning education make the comparison
of educational attainment between ENBCV and ENPE difficult. Finally, the sets of access to basic
services and ownership of assets and consumer durables that are monitored in ENBCV and ENPE are not
identical. ENBCVs typically provide information on more services and assets than ENPEs, but do not
include quality considerations of basic services such as MICS do.

Despite these difficulties, this poverty assessment expands the integration of data across surveys by
imputing ENBCV-based consumption models into ENPEs (chapter 4) and incorporating MICS-related
quality variables on access to basic services in the analysis of synergies among policies (chapter 9).
Increased access to existing surveys and punctual improvements in terms of consistent definitions across
surveys would surely greatly expand the possibilities of survey integration in Tunisia.

Chapter 2: Poverty, Inequality, and Growth in Tunisia

2.1 The Good News: Pro-Poor Growth between 1980 and 2010

Poverty reduction in Tunisia has been consistently showcased as a “model” for other developing countries
(World Bank 1995a). Ayadi et al. (2005, 41) conclude that “with limited resources and poor natural
endowments both a good growth performance and a significant reduction in poverty can be achieved in a
relatively short period of time.” In November 2009, before the Jasmine Revolution, World Bank (2009)
highlighted the substantive achievement of the country in terms of reduction of poverty, equitable growth,
and social progress [author’s emphasis].

However, assessing poverty reduction achievements in Tunisia is not straightforward. Until 2012,
different methodologies existed to measure the incidence of poverty. That year, a joint Institut National
des Statistiques (INS), African Development Bank, and World Bank (2012) methodological revision
aligned the official measurement of poverty for the years 2000, 2005, and 2010. Prior to this
methodological convergence, the INS and the World Bank used different methodologies (appendix 1),
leading to large discrepancies (table 1). Despite their discrepancies and regardless of the methodology
used, INS or World Bank, total poverty incidence between 1980 and 2000 declined (table 1).

This poverty reduction trend is observed in both urban and rural areas. However, it remains unclear which
were the specific contributions of rural and urban poverty reductions to the overall decline in poverty in
that period. According to World Bank’s estimates, the initial poverty incidence in 1980 was four times
higher in urban than in rural areas. Urban poverty reduction was larger than rural poverty in those two
decades and, as its result, the remarkable reduction in total poverty over the period 1980-2000 was mainly
due to reduction in urban poverty. In contrast, according to the INS, the incidence rural poverty was much
closer to urban poverty in 1980 than the World Bank’s estimates suggest. INS estimates also suggest that
the overall reduction in poverty between 1980 and 2000 came from a more balanced reduction of both
rural and urban poverty rates.

The INS and World Bank joint methodology adopted in 2012 re-estimates poverty lines for 2000 and
revises the poverty incidence from that year on (see Appendix 1). Consequently, it provides a single and
consistent set of extreme and moderate poverty estimates for 2000, 2005, and 2010. Reported in table 2,
the new poverty estimates unambiguously conclude that both extreme and moderate poverty incidences
went down in Tunisia between 2000 and 2010, a trend that is consistently observed among cities, small
and medium towns, and noncommunal (or rural) areas. This declining trend was also observed across all
regions in Tunisia. A second conclusion drawn from these results is that growth had been pro-poor during
this period. Pro-poor growth is understood in this analysis along the lines of Ravallion and Chen’s (2003)

                                                               26
and Kraay’s (2003) definition of a growth capable of reducing poverty in absolute terms, regardless of its
distributional consequences—that is, irrespective of the welfare effects that growth brings about to the
nonpoor segments of society.6 In effect, in Tunisia, GDP growth averaged an annual rate of 4.3 percent
between 1980 and 2000, and 4.5 percent between 2000 and 2010 alongside sustained reductions in
poverty incidence (figure 1).

Beyond numbers, multiple analysts conclude that choices in the composition of economic growth and
other developmental strategies pursued a deliberate poverty reduction objective. Ayadi et al. (2005), Bibi
(2005), Chemingui and Bchir (2008), Chemingui and Sánchez (2011), World Bank (1995a, 2004, 2009)
all consistently make this argument. Even after acknowledging the limitations of the Tunisian economic
model (presented in chapter 1), those analysts underscore a common pro-poor bias of the successive
economic strategies consistent with a commitment to a type of growth able to reduce poverty. It is that
unambiguous commitment to poverty reduction in Tunisia, they argue, that explains its sustained poverty
reduction trends throughout successive decades and distinctive growth periods, from low economic
growth (1980–85), to macroeconomic stabilization and adjustment years (1985–90) and a faster economic
growth (1990–2010) post adjustment (Ayadi et al. 2005).

 Another stricter definition of pro-poor growth requires that incomes or consumption of the poor grow faster than the rest of the
population, thus leading to reductions in inequality. In other words, poverty reduction is larger than the level that would have
been attained from a uniform increase of the incomes or consumption of all groups in society (Klasen 2001; Kakwani and Pernia
2000; McCulloch and Baulch 1999).

                                                               27

Those pro-poor growth strategies refer to the development of an export-oriented labor-intensive sector
(inclusive of low-skilled females) such as textile and garments manufactures; the expansion of the tourism
industry; control of inflation; increasing investments in rural agriculture; and generous food subsidies that
facilitate and incentivize the increase in agricultural output. Other interventions reportedly with poverty
reduction objectives were also implemented, such as: increases in minimum wages; strong investments in
human capital (including education) and birth control programs; rural development programs that
expanded infrastructure, roads, water supply and sanitation; generous—although poorly targeted—
subsidies; and microcredit programs such as the “Solidarity Bank” (albeit limited in the scope of credit
disbursed and employment created; Ayadi et al. 2005). Social assistance programs launched since 1985
include the National Program of Assistance to the Needy Families, aimed at the elderly poor, poor
widows, and the handicapped; several funds for employment creation and productive capacity-building
and training programs; and social investment funds, such as the National Solidarity Fund, to develop
infrastructure (roads, housing, electrification, potable water, or schools) benefiting the poor. Overall, in
recent years, social spending—on education, consumption subsidies, health, direct cash transfers and in-
kind social assistance and active labor market programs—comprises about 40 percent of total public
spending, or 25 percent of GDP in Tunisia (World Bank 2015a).



2.2 Beyond Growth and Poverty Reduction: Group Inequalities and Regional Disparities

In contrast to the thesis of an unambiguous commitment to growth with poverty reduction in Tunisia, the
World Bank (2014a, 2015a; see chapter 1 arguments) stresses that missed opportunities to simultaneously
increase productivity and economic growth have led to reducing poverty while increasing regional and
group disparities and deepening the perceptions of social injustice. The strategy labeled in chapter 1 as
“development before democracy” was shortsighted in thinking that growth and poverty reduction would
quell freedom demands without achievements in terms of more inclusion and fewer disparities.

                                                            28
These two views lead to an obvious question: to what extent did economic growth in Tunisia reduce
disparities? A first piece of evidence shows that growth has been the main contributor to the observed
reduction in poverty, while the contribution of redistribution has been meager. Using the Datt and
Ravallion (1992) method of poverty decomposition, Ayadi et al. (2005) report that household
consumption growth explains about 82 percent of the total poverty reduction observed between 1980 and
2000. The redistribution component, that is, changes in the distribution of household consumption would
explain only 11 percent of the reduction of poverty in the period.7 For the most recent period for which
there is available data, 2005 to 2010, the Datt and Ravallion decomposition exercise conducted for this
poverty assessment also confirms the larger impact of the consumption growth component over
redistribution, 77 percent and 27 percent, respectively (table 3). This finding holds for the whole country
as well as for urban and rural populations. 8

A second piece of evidence suggests that, despite redistribution only playing a limited role in explaining
poverty trends, reductions in consumption inequality took place before the revolution. Growth incidence
curves (GICs)9 for 1980–2000—estimated by Ayadi et al. 2005—show that the consumption growth of
the poorest segments of the distribution (percentiles 1st to 15th of the household consumption distribution)
was superior to growth among the remaining percentiles (figure 2). Up to the 75th percentile, consumption
growth among households was positive. Then, consumption growth for the richer segments hovered
around average consumption rate. This finding holds for urban and rural separate distributions, although
differences in growth across percentiles narrow down in the case of urban households. This is consistent




7
 The remaining 7 percent of the reduction of poverty incidence is explained by the interaction factor in the methodology of Datt
and Ravallion (1992).
8
  Results also confirm that redistribution has played a more substantive role in explaining poverty reduction in rural
areas than in urban areas—a contribution that increased in the second half of that decade. In fact —not shown here—
there are also marked differences in the contribution of growth and redistribution prior to 2000, and redistribution
played a larger role than growth in 1985–90. It was in that five-year period, 1985-90, when economic growth was
low; macroeconomic stabilization and structural adjustment programs were implemented; and social assistance
gained relevance with the introduction of new programs (Ayadi et al. 2005).
9
 The growth incidence curve is a conceptually useful tool to analyze the impact of aggregate economic growth over a wide range
of the distribution that displays the growth rate in income or consumption between two points in time at each percentile of the
distribution (World Bank 2015c).

                                                               29
with a larger reduction in inequality among rural than urban households.10 Ultimately, the GIC analysis
shows that some inequality reduction took place along with poverty reduction from 1980 to 2000.

An updated GIC analysis for 2005–10 also suggests a pro-poor growth benefiting Tunisian households,
although the salience of its inequality reduction appears more limited than it was for 1980–2000 (figure
3). After adjusting for inflation between years and for spatial price differences, consumption growth rates
are mostly uniform across the distribution of households. In fact, the poorest 10 percent of the distribution
report consumption growth rates below the average. What makes growth pro-poor is that the top 20
percent of the distribution for consumption growth rates are below average, with the richest top 2–3
percent actually experiencing negative growth rates in the period.

  This evidence suggests that growth in Tunisia during 1980–2000 was pro-poor in Kakwani and Pernia’s (2000) stricter
definition of poverty reduction accruing, from disproportionate growth among the poor compared to the nonpoor.

                                                               30
Estimates of the single most used measurement of inequality, the Gini coefficient, show that consumption
inequality among Tunisian individuals declined between 2000 and 2010, although only slightly. Much of
the meager decline in Gini coefficients in that decade—down to 32.7 from 34.4—is due to improvements
of the distribution between 2005 and 2010 that reversed a slight increase in Gini coefficients observed
between 2000 and 2005—a period with lower growth rates than the second half of the decade.
Unsurprisingly, the overall decrease of inequality between 2000 and 2010 is half of the 5 percentage point
change reported during 1980–2000.11 Consequently, while consumption inequality trends in the two
periods, 1980–2000 and 2000–2010, were both declining, their magnitudes were quite different.12

Inequality also declined among regions, although this was not large nor uniform. The only exception is
the northeast, which achieved levels of inequality below 0.3 in 2010, after a 21 percent reduction of its
Gini coefficient since 2000 (table 3). The center west, southwest, and southeast witnessed much more
modest declines in their level of inequality in 2000, while Greater Tunis ended up in 2010 with the same
level of inequality measured in 2000, which is explained by an initial increase in inequality in the first
five years of that decade, and a reduction in inequality by the same magnitude in the following half of the
decade. Within strata, modest reductions in the Gini index were also observed between 2005 and 2010.
Large cities went from a Gini of 35 in 2005 to an index of 33 in 2010, small and medium towns declined
from 33 to 30, and rural areas also saw a small decline in their Gini index, from 33 to 32.

Notes: Gini based in consumption (total expenditure minus expenditure on capital goods). The household consumption to
calculate the Gini index at the national level is adjusted for price differences at the stratum level, using the upper threshold for
poverty as a price index. Gini coefficients are multiplied by 100 to scale them between 0 and 100.

  In fact, INS, ADB, and World Bank (2012) conclude that although statistically significant, these changes in the
distribution observed between 2000 and 2010 are not significant in magnitude. And specific for 2000–2005, the
change in Gini is minimal and does not point to economically nor statistically significant changes.

With limited inequality reduction across regions, INS, ADB, and World Bank (2012) show that it is the
decrease in intraregional inequalities that explains the modest decrease in overall, countrywide inequality
during 2000–2010. While intraregional Gini fell from 23 in 2000 to 20.1 in 2010, interregional
inequalities increased from 11.4 in 2000 to 12.6 in 2010 (table 5). Combining intra- and interregional
inequalities in an index of polarization (intraregional Gini over interregional Gini) constructed by INS,
ADB, and World Bank (2012), this measure of polarization increased from 49.9 in 2000 to 62.5 in 2010.
As noted before for regional poverty and inequality, this increase in polarization was not uniform. Most of
the variation took place between 2000 and 2005 and stagnated thereafter.

Official sources (INS, ADB, and World Bank 2012, 24) have interpreted these results as confirmation that
the “identification and alienation problems felt by the citizens of disadvantaged Governorates” intensified
during 2000–2010. Whether or not such trends can be associated with identification and alienation may
need further analysis, but clearly suggest that standards of living of residents in the same region were
converging in the period, while standards of living of residents of different regions diverged. In concrete
terms, the estimated annual average growth per capita between 2000 and 2010—in 2005 real prices—for
the poorest regions of center west and northwest (2.3 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively) was the
lowest of all regions (table 5). Those consumption levels were well behind the consumption of regions
with the lowest levels of poverty, Greater Tunis and the northeast, which grew at 2.8 percent and 2.7
percent, respectively, faster than the consumption level of the poorest regions. As a result, the gap in
aggregate consumption (in 2005 prices), per capita between Greater Tunis and center west was well
known: TD 2,624 compared to TD 1,212 respectively (up from the TD 2000 versus 968 gap in 2000).

Over the past decade, increasing gaps in living standards across regions have gone hand-in-hand
with stark and increasing regional disparities in poverty, with coastal regions and urban areas
being the least affected by poverty. In effect, poverty incidence continues in 2010—as reported in Table
2—to be nearly twice as high in noncommunal areas of Tunisia than in urban areas. For extreme poverty,
that gap is even larger—and has worsened in the last 10 years: extreme poverty in communal areas was
four times higher in 2000, and seven times higher in 2010, than in cities. Across regions, the overall
poverty decline did not benefit the center west and southwest regions, where the disparities with the rest
of the country increased during that period. In 2010, poverty rates ranged from a low rate of 8–9 percent
in the center east region and Grand Tunis, to a high of 26 and 32 percent in the northwest and center west
regions, respectively. Thus, the ratio of high to low regional poverty incidence hovers around 3 to 1 in
2010, while it was around 2 to1 in 2000. Interestingly, the regions with highest poverty incidences, the
center west, northwest, southwest and southeast, account for 60 percent of the poor population and 40
percent of the population. In contrast, those regions with lower incidence rates account for 40 percent of
the poor population and 60 percent of the total population of the country. Finally, extreme poverty has
become more concentrated than before: the poorest regions of the country, namely all the western regions,
in 2010 were home to more than 70 percent of the extreme poor, and 55 percent of all poor.




3.3. Recent Evolution of Poverty


4.1 Poverty Projections

There are no official poverty estimates in Tunisia after 2010. The last ENBCV collected, processed, and
with results officially released dates back to that year. The new 2015 ENBCV is expected to be completed
in 2015 (box 2), with results not released until mid-2016. In the absence of updated evidence, poverty is
expected to have increased immediately after the January 2011 revolution, as the economy plunged into
recession with a growth rate of -1.9 percent (World Bank 2015a). It becomes harder to predict poverty
trends thereafter, as the economy recovered in 2012 with a 3.6 percent growth rate in that year, and then
slowed to 2.6 percent in 2013.13 According to INS official figures, unemployment increased in 2011 to 18
percent, up from 13 percent in 2010. Since then, unemployment has declined to 16.9 percent, 15.8 percent
and 15.1 percent,14 respectively, in 2012, 2013 and 2014, but still above pre-revolution levels. The
Consumer Price Index (CPI) has strengthened progressively, going up 3.5 percent, 5.1 percent, 5.8
percent and 4.9 percent, respectively, between 2011 and 2014, and making the satisfaction of basic needs
more expensive (Tunisia Central Bank 2015).

These and other developments expectedly influenced post-revolution poverty incidence. Lacking a post
revolution ENBCV, the current analysis proposes a methodology that projects post-revolution poverty
rates for the first time in Tunisia. The proposed technique includes developments relative to GDP growth,
sector composition, unemployment, and CPI as inputs within a partial equilibrium model. Other
determinants should be expected to affect poverty, however, but cannot be easily traced back in
household surveys; do not change dramatically in the short run; or are hard to measure. For example,
changes in human capital accumulation are unlikely to have changed dramatically in a one- or two-year
span, for which skill changes are not considered in the analysis. Other factors such as social transfers or

   Official figures from INS on GDP growth for 2011 to 2014 are -1.0 percent, 4.5 percent, 2.8 percent and 2.7 percent,
respectively (INS 2015b).

subsidies cannot be traced back in the household survey with precision (see chapter 8) to improve the
accuracy of projections.

For those changes considered in the exercise—GDP, unemployment, and CPI—the proposed analysis
imputes the observed changes in those variables in 2011 and 2012 back into the original distribution of
households’ consumption obtained from ENCBV 2010. So the distributions of consumption for 2011 and
2012 result from “shocking” the observed consumption distribution in 2010 with the changes in GDP,
unemployment, and CPI observed in 2011 and 2012. Those resulting distributions of consumption post-
revolution are then used to estimate the proportion of households under CPI-updated poverty lines for the
years 2011 and 2012, respectively. This simple methodology projects poverty rates for such years.



Box 2. Latest Available Information to Project Poverty Estimates
The proposed projection exercise can be implemented to the extent to which updated information is available. At a minimum, the
analysis would benefit from a combination of micro- and macrolevel information on households’ consumption, GDP, sector
value added, inflation, and unemployment. The most updated microlevel information available refers to 2010, which is taken as
reference year upon which projections are estimated for successive years. The next ENBCV is being collected in 2015—
fieldwork collection expected to be finalized by May 2016. It is expected that INS will release its first results from the survey by
end-2016 (after definitive results of 2014 census are made public, by December 2015 or early 2016). However, it is unknown
when survey data files will be made accessible to the public for independent analysis.

Regarding macro data, the latest available GDP growth figures as reported by INS refer to the first quarter of 2015. Aggregated
unemployment rates, however, refer to 2014, but their disaggregation by socioeconomic groups—education-related groups—is
only available for 2012. There is disaggregated information on education more updated than 2012, in fact to up the first quarter of
2015, but it only refers to tertiary education graduates so it cannot be used for projection purposes. In effect, this implies that the
most recent year for which a human capital–based disaggregation of unemployment can be made is 2012. Interestingly,
disaggregation of unemployment by age groups and gender is also available (up to 2014), but these disaggregations are kept
independent from each other and it is not possible to cross these two dimensions. This is to say that a multidimensional
disaggregation of unemployment by education, age, and gender simultaneously is not possible with the information currently
available post-2010.

For the cross-survey imputation exercise explained in section 4.2, the proposed methodology to impute a consumption
distribution from the ENCBV and ENPE can be updated to the extent that ENPEs are available. As already indicated, the latest
ENCVB available is for 2010, and they are collected every five years. ENPEs, however, are annual surveys. The latest ENPE
collected is 2013, but their data files have not been made available for analysis. The latest year for which both individuals and
households data files are available for analysis is 2012. For the purpose of independent analysis, it is worth noting that between
2005 and 2013, INS has made available both individual and household data files only for 2009 and 2012 (INS 2015).

Finally, the World Bank is currently working on developing and improving a new projection methodology for countries across
the world that would make simultaneous macroeconomic and poverty projections every year (the so called Macro Poverty
projection notes). These projections will be based on several methodologies, including historical elasticities between GDP and
poverty trends that can be either distribution neutral or distribution sensitive.




In its simplest version of the projection exercise, simulation 1 (GDP only), the GDP growth observed in
2009, 2011, and 2012 are successively imputed to each household in the 2010 ENBCV. Figure 4 presents
the steps to construct this simulation scenario. Under simulation 1, per worker consumption of each
household is adjusted by the officially reported GDP growth for the projected years. The underlying
assumption is that there is a perfect pass through between income and consumption growth in any given
year. The poverty line is then adjusted based on each year’s CPI, as reported by the INS. The resulting
new distribution of consumption is compared with the updated poverty line, and those households below
the new poverty line are classified as poor.

A first alternative projection scenario includes sector-specific GDP growth. Under simulation 2 (sector
GDP), the mechanics of simulation 1 are repeated, but now workers in each of the three broad sectors of
the economy (agriculture, manufactures, and services) are imputed their sector-specific growth rate. The
main assumption in this simulation is that sector-specific growth rates are a good approximation for
describing the growth experienced across all activities comprising the three sectors of the economy, thus
averaging out any heterogeneity that takes place across activities within each sector.

A third and more sophisticated projection, simulation 3 (sector GDP, unemployment, and CPI)
explicitly includes the observed unemployment rates in 2011 and 2012. In Tunisia, official data on
unemployment rates is disaggregated by educational level (that is, unable to read, individuals with
primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education). Unfortunately, INS reports disaggregate
unemployment rates for 2011 and 2012, but not for 2013 or 2014, for which projections in this scenario
(and the rest for comparability) are limited to 2011 and 2012 (box 3 earlier). Also, unemployment rates by
education level could not be further disaggregated by age and gender, which would have provided a
higher-resolution simulation. The annual changes in unemployment observed in each year are imputed
back randomly across the distribution of households in ENBCV 2010. Individuals who are assigned
unemployment status in the simulation are imputed no consumption per capita from labor. Finally, annual
poverty lines are adjusted for inflation using the national CPI to reflect the increasing cost of living. This
simulation procedure is replicated 100 times and a projected poverty rate is obtained from the average
poverty rate of all replications.

A final projection, simulation 4 (sector GDP, unemployment, and no CPI adjustment) is conducted to
better understand the effect that poverty line adjustments have on projected poverty estimates. This
simulation allows to differentiate the effects on poverty accruing from socioeconomic developments from
those resulting from methodological issues (that is, the adjusting of the poverty line). This simulation
simply replicates simulation 3, except for the CPI adjustment of poverty lines. Instead, the original
poverty line in 2010 –without further adjustment based on CPI–is used to determine whether or not a
household in 2011 and 2012 is poor, after sector-specific growth and unemployment rates are imputed.
Once again, the allocation of observed sector GDP growth and unemployment rates into 2010 ENCBV
households is replicated 100 times and all of these poverty rates are averaged out to report the final
poverty projection for this scenario.

Table 7 and Figure 5 present the average point estimates of poverty incidence under the four projection
scenarios. The estimates indicate, first, that poverty rates increased in 2011 and decreased in 2012.
According to these results, the poverty impact of the revolution oscillates between 0.9 and 2.2
percentage points, depending on which of the four simulations is considered. When the effect of
specific-sector GDP and unemployment are included (simulation 3), the impact is largest with 2.2
percentage points. If, simplistically, only GDP growth is considered (simulation 1), the effect is the
smallest, with a 0.9 percentage point increase in poverty incidence.

Second, the recovery in 2012 was enough to reverse the increased poverty observed in 2011. Had it not
been for the observed increase in prices (as reported in simulation 4), the economic recovery of that year
would have brought poverty levels below those observed in 2010. It is indeed the increasing cost of
basic needs that counteracted to some extent the positive impact on poverty of (sector-specific) GDP
growth and reduction in unemployment observed in 2012. All things considered, sector growth,
unemployment and CPI, poverty rates in 2012 were similar to those observed pre-revolution.

Figure 6 reports additional estimates for extreme poverty and compares them with the official and
projected poverty rates pre- and post-revolution. Poverty estimates reported in figure 6 are based on
scenario 3 projections that include GDP, unemployment, and CPI changes over time. Projected extreme
poverty trends show similar results to those reported for poverty: a sizable increase in 2011 and a
notable decrease in 2012. However, in contrast to poverty trends, the reduction in extreme poverty in
2012 is not sufficient to fully revert increases observed in 2011. This is because of the larger impact that
unemployment had on extreme poverty than on poverty in 2011 (and the more limited impact of the
employment recovery in 2012 on the larger pool of extreme poor in 2011).

It should be noted that these projected rates are likely an upper bound of the true poverty variation that
took place in those years. This is because the effects of consumption subsidies, social transfers,
remittances and private transfers, and labor coping strategies (increasing work supply, changing labor
status, for example) are not considered in these projections. To the extent that coping strategies were
adopted by households and/or government initiated compensation interventions, estimates failing to
include them might overestimate poverty impacts.

4.2 Survey-to-Survey Imputation

New survey-to-survey imputation techniques, only recently developed, can help overcome the lack of
frequent budgetary surveys from which directly estimate poverty incidence. In a nutshell, survey-to-
survey imputation techniques consist in developing a consumption (or income) model from household
expenditure (income) surveys that can be used to impute a distribution of consumption (income) among
households in another survey—labor force, for example—in the same or a different year. Early
foundations of this technique stem from the “poverty-mapping” approach by Elbers, Lanjouw, and
Lanjouw (2003), which predicted consumption data into the census from a consumption model estimated
in a previous household survey. More recent applications of this technique have imputed consumption
between household surveys and DHSs—as in Stifel and Christiaensen (2007), Ferreira et al. (2011),
Christiaensen et al. (2012), and Mathiassen (2013).15 Closer to the Tunisian case, Mathiassen (2009) in
Mozambique, Douidich et al. (2013) in Morocco, and Newhouse et al. (2014) in Sri Lanka have imputed
consumption from a household expenditure survey into a more recent ENPE and subsequently estimated
poverty rates.

In Tunisia, as elsewhere, survey-to-survey imputation estimates a consumption model in one survey (call
it “survey A”), and then uses its parameters to impute consumption in another survey (call it “survey B”).
Box 3 outlines the consumption model used in Tunisia for this cross-survey imputation exercise.
Critically, all variables included in the model estimated in survey A must also be available in survey B to
ensure that observed and imputed poverty rates are comparable. This means that variables that potentially
could be relevant in explaining consumption in survey A, but are not present in survey B, will not be
included in the consumption model. Also, differences in the definition of the same variable in the two
15
     Tarozzi (2007) imputes consumption using the same type of survey, a budgetary survey, over time.

                                                           38
surveys (for example, in the case of Tunisia, the definition of urban areas) may have consequences in the
replicability of the model. Furthermore, differences in sampling design of the surveys involved in the
imputation may also have consequences in the quality of the estimates (Newhouse et al. 2014).

Consumption models used in cross-survey imputation typically have limitations in their prediction
capacity, thus they are unable to account for all of the consumer’s behavior. A strategy developed to
account for consumption behavior not captured directly in the consumption model consists of imputing
the estimated residuals of the consumption model in survey A16 into survey B (see, for example, Ferreira
et al. [2011] and Douidich et al. [2013]). These analyses impute the “average residual” of households
pertaining to each decile of a distribution of wealth in survey A into the households pertaining to the
respective wealth deciles defined by the same set of assets in survey B.17 This strategy is believed to be
more precise than a random inclusion of residuals as it minimizes the chance that residuals obtained in
households of low socioeconomic status in survey A may end up allocated to a household of a very
different socioeconomic extraction in survey B.

Dang, Lanjouw, and Serajuddin (2014) provide an alternative to decile-based residual imputation. Their
approach estimates a clustered random effects consumption model using survey A information. Next, it
applies the estimated coefficients from that regression in survey A to individuals in survey B to obtain a
predicted consumption. Finally, they randomly allocate both the clustered random effects and error terms
of the regression in survey A to each individual in survey B. This process is bootstrapped and the
projected poverty rate is obtained from the average of all repetitions. By separating two sources of error
terms—one related to imputation-specific limitations and the other to design limitations—their estimates
can potentially control better for survey data and design limitations, thus estimating more precisely the
standard errors of imputed consumption estimates.


 Box 3. Modeling Consumption using Data from Tunisia’s ENCBV and ENPE
 The survey-to-survey imputation analysis is based on data from the 2010 round of the ENBCV. Information at the
 household and individual levels was used to estimate an ordinary least square (OLS) household consumption
 model. In particular, the variables used as regressors in the model are the following:

         Sociodemographic variables: Household size and its square; dependency rate; household head
          characteristics such as age in logarithm form and its square, gender, and marital status; education
          (primary, secondary, or university as highest level attended); and education of members of the household
          other than its head;
         Labor characteristics: Employment status (unemployed or otherwise); sector of work (agriculture or
          otherwise) of the household head and other members of the household;
         Access to basic services: Such as tap water and electricity;
         Asset/durables ownership: Car, motorcycle, and/or bicycle; television and/or radio; washing machine,
          refrigerator, freezer, dishwasher, or oven;a and
         Location variables: Rural areas and regional controls.

 The dependent variable of the model is the logarithm of annual household consumption per capita. Household
 consumption includes monetary expenditures for the consumption of food and non-food items (clothing, hygiene

16
   These estimate residuals capture the difference between each individual or household’s observed consumption and
its predicted consumption by the model used in survey A.
17
   In Ferreira et al. (2011), deciles are defined over the first principal component of an index composed of household
ownership of durable goods (such as refrigerators, televisions, cars, computers, and so forth), on housing
characteristics (such as the type of roof materials and floor cover), and on access to utilities (such as water and
sanitation). Obviously, it is essential that wealth deciles must be defined in each survey according to the same set of
assets, for which these assets must be both present and identically defined in each of the surveys used in the cross-
survey imputation.

                                                          39
 and care, leisure); housing investment expenditures; expenditures on transport; own consumption of food; gifts in
 kind and in-kind benefits received; imputed rent of owner-occupied household or household which enjoys free
 housing. Consumption does not include capital expenditures, durable goods expenditures, or exceptional
 ceremony expenditures (INS et al, 2012). Household consumption was divided by the number of household
 members to obtain a per capita measure without accounting for any age or gender based scaling.

 Additional information on type of employment (self-employed, salaried worker, private or public employment)
 was available in the ENBCV 2010, but absent in the 2009 round of the Labor Force Survey and thus discarded
 from the final estimations. In contrast, ownership of assets and dwelling characteristics is widely available in the
 ENBCV 2010. This information is not incorporated into the model, but used to calculate a wealth index for the
 imputation of errors following Ferreira et al. (2011)’s imputation approach.

 Before applying the cross-survey imputation, it was confirmed that the common variables in both the ENBCV
 and ENPE surveys were consistent in terms of their definitions. Sample design was also comparable, both
 consistent with the 2004 census. The ENBCV 2010 contains information on 11,281 households across seven
 regions, while the sampling frame was stratified by the governorate and living area (large cities, medium and
 small towns, and noncommunal areas). Surveys used are only one and two years apart, imputing consumption
 from the ENBCV 2010 into ENPE 2009 and ENPE 2012. Underlying the imputation exercise, it is assumed that
 the consumption model in 2010 is appropriate to explain consumption in 2012. The short period of time, two
 years, between imputations support this assumption, but the fact that a revolution took place between both years
 may question the validity of this assumption. In fact, abrupt changes in the returns to poverty determinants will
 not be captured by the cross-survey imputation. While this is a cause of concern, it is believed that changes in
 returns might have been more likely a challenge for imputation in 2011 than in 2012. This is the case because the
 largest economic changes following the revolution—in terms of GDP and unemployment—took place in 2011,
 while they returned to pre-revolution levels in 2012. Hence, the comparability of returns between 2010 and 2012
 should arguably be a closer fit than returns in 2010 and 2011.

 a. This final list is the result of an iterative process where additional variables (for example, referring to durable ownership
 and access to basic services) and alternative specifications of the variables (for example, regarding different groupings of
 educational attainment) were tried in search of a robust model maximizing statistical performance (that is, statistical
 representativeness of variables and explanatory power).




The incipient empirical body of work on cross-survey imputation has not yet concluded which of the
alternative methods is superior and under what circumstances. Issues such as simplicity of the approach,
comparability of surveys, treatment of residuals, consumption modeling, and data quality and
accessibility, among others, should all play a role in the selection of the most appropriate imputation
methodology. Rather than choosing a single cross-survey imputation approach among the presented
alternatives, the current analysis produces multiple survey-to-survey imputation sets of results using all
the described approaches.

First, residuals from survey A are randomly allocated to survey B, regardless of the characteristics and
location of the households in each survey. Results under this method are reported under the scenario
called “random residuals imputation.” Second, following Ferreira, Gignoux, and Aran (2011) method,
residuals from survey A are more precisely imputed in survey B by randomly allocating residuals within
predefined groups in both surveys. As reported above, Ferreira, Gignoux, and Aran (2011) use deciles of
a generated wealth index (and defined by ownership of durable goods, housing characteristics, and access
to utilities) to allocate residuals between surveys.18 It is only possible to conduct this allocation of

18
  Thus, from a set of commonly available assets in survey A and B, an index is calculated from factor
decomposition analysis. From the resulting index, asset-based deciles are estimated. The distribution of residuals

                                                                 40
residuals among surveys when the same assets can be identified in both surveys. This method produces
estimates of poverty under the scenario called “wealth index deciles imputation.” An extension of this
methodology is also attempted by further dividing asset-based deciles by urban and rural populations,
effectively separating deciles of wealth between urban and rural households. This is captured in the
scenario “wealth index deciles and urban-rural imputation.” A final method follows the Dang, Lanjouw,
and Serajuddin (2014) survey-to-survey imputation method described above, consisting of imputing
cluster random effects and errors across surveys. Results are presented under the scenario described as
“DLS imputation.”

Data availability determines the actual application of these alternative methods to the Tunisian context. In
the case of Tunisia, ENBCV 2010 constitutes “survey A,” that is, the most recent survey from which
official poverty incidence is estimated from households’ consumption. ENPEs constitute “survey B.”
They have been collected every year since 2005. However, INS has only made available the entire ENPE
2009, 2010, and 2012. So, for the purpose of this exercise, the different imputation methods are applied to
those surveys. The definitions of all variables of the consumption model are confirmed to be comparable.
This turns out to be the case for the 2010 and 2012 ENPEs, but not for the 2009 ENPE. In that year, the
ENPE did not include the occupation of individuals. This means that the full consumption model
estimated in the ENBCV 2010 cannot be replicated in 2009. Two options are presented to overcome this
problem. One is to retain the preferred model for 2010, the “full model,” and apply it only to ENPE 2012.
A second option is to find a model that is truly comparable for all years, which implies simplifying the
full model by not including number of children in the household and household head and members’ labor
occupation. This model, “comparable model,” is applied to both the ENPE 2009 and 2012. Figure 6
describes step by step each the simulation mechanics under each simulation scenario.

The use of this rich array of methods—four residual imputation techniques and two full and comparable
consumption models—provides a wide range of poverty estimates from survey-to-survey imputation that
take into account best international practices while customizing their application to the specific
circumstances of Tunisia. At the same time, those sets of results also underscore the limitations of
imputed poverty estimates, which are proportional to the capacity of the consumption model to reproduce
observed poverty estimates. In the case of Tunisia, table 8 shows that the estimated consumption model
provides a reasonable approximation to the observed poverty rates in 2010 (see also appendix 2). Looking
at the first column, “ENBCV 2010 predicted,” the consumption model estimated in ENBCV 2010 yields a
national poverty estimate of 16.8 percent using the random residuals method—compared to the observed
official poverty rate of 15.5 percent. Poverty estimates using wealth deciles for imputing residuals predict
a rate of 17.8 percent—and only a slightly lower poverty estimate of 17.6 percent when urban and rural
populations are separated. Using models that are comparable for all years confirms the results obtained
from the full model. Estimates under the comparable model suggest that the Dang, Lanjouw, and
Serajuddin (2014) method of imputation, with a predicted rate of 16.1 percent, provides a closer estimate
of poverty to the official rate in 2010.

When consumption models from the ENBCV 2010 are imputed into the 2010 ENPE (table 8, column
“ENPE 2010 predicted”), results from the different methods all show lower poverty rates than the
officially reported numbers. Imputed poverty incidence ranges from 14.3 percent to 14.6 percent of the
national population. In other words, the predicted poverty rate—resulting from consumption models—
within the 2010 ENBCV overestimates the true or observed poverty rate of 15.5 percent, while the
predicted poverty rate within the 2010 ENPE underestimates the true poverty rate in that year.




specific to each decile from survey A are then imputed into survey B according to constructed deciles based on the
same asset-based index.

a. This step (along with subsequent steps) is typically boostrapped. DLS model refers to the Dang, Lanjouw, and Serajuddin
(2014) cluster random effects model that includes asset ownership and dwelling characteristics.


With these results in mind, poverty estimates for 2012 resulting from survey-to-survey imputation into
that year’s ENPE (table 8, column “ENPE 2012 predicted”) are found significantly lower than poverty
incidence estimates for 2010. This result is robust to the method used—full or comparable—and the way
residuals are allocated—random, by decile, and by urban/rural location. Interestingly, the decrease in

                                                              42
poverty rates across methods suggests a range between 1.1 and 2.2 percentage points, when comparing
ENPE 2010 and ENPE 2012 distributions, reassuringly close to those reported for 2012 following the
projection methodology presented in the previous section: a reduction in poverty ranging between 1 and
2.3 percentage points.

Results also suggest that much of the change in poverty between 2010 and 2012 typically came from
reductions across urban households, with more modest decreases in rural poverty. Comparing the
predicted poverty rates in ENPE 2010 and ENPE 2012 suggests that the method of random allocation of
residuals renders the largest reductions in poverty, both in urban and rural areas. The other
methodologies, allocating residuals based on assets ownership and urban/rural location and DLS, show
much more modest decreases in poverty than the random allocation. A simple decomposition exercise—
not shown here—indicates that the contribution of urban poverty changes to national poverty reduction
between 2010 and 2012—comparing ENPE 2010 and ENPE 2012 predictions—lies between 65 percent
and 90 percent of the total change, depending on the simulation method used.

Chapter 3. Who Are the Poor and the Bottom 40 Percent?
3.1. Poverty Profiles

The analysis of poverty and inequality thus far has focused on individuals, households, and regions.
Another dimension requiring analysis is population groups, which are typically studied using poverty
profiles, by looking at the levels and differentials in poverty incidence across population groups defined
by some features or attributes (education level, household composition, occupation and residence, to cite
a few). In this respect, previous poverty analyses—World Bank (1995a, 2000, 2004), Ayadi et al. (2005),
Bechir (2011)—have all emphasized that, both in rural and urban areas, poor households tended to be
larger in size; have a large proportion of children and a high dependency ratio; and are headed by adult
breadwinners. The poor disproportionally belonged to households whose breadwinner had no formal
education. School enrollment rates were lower for the poor. In rural areas, most poor household heads
had lower educational attainment, were wage earners, and many also owned land and livestock.19 Poor
rural households that were engaged in production activities typically had access to land, but their
landholdings were small (averaging 2 hectares [ha]), rarely irrigated and often exhibited low productivity
(especially in rain-fed areas). The incidence of rural poverty was highest among households whose head
was employed in construction, followed by services and agriculture. In urban areas, more than 60 percent
of the poor earned their living as wage earners, many in low-skill occupations, followed by self-
employment in non-agricultural activities. They faced scarce job prospects because employment
opportunities had been shifting toward jobs requiring higher skills, while—owing to high dropout rates
from the primary school system—the ranks of the unskilled working-age population had grown. By
occupation of the household head, the highest incidence of urban poverty was in construction.

A fairly high proportion of people remained clustered above, but close to the poverty lines. Forty percent
of the rural population and 15 percent of urban residents had consumption levels that were inferior to
double the lower poverty line. These are sizable shares of the population in a country exposed to various
risks (for instance, droughts) and external shocks (related to tourism, exports and, more recently,
terrorism). Interestingly, two other aspects of the poverty situation in 2000 caused concern in Tunisia
(World Bank 2004). One was the appearance of poverty in periurban areas and the inability of a large
number of young graduates to secure jobs. The second is an increase in vulnerability, as measured by the
number of people having expenditures less than 30 percent above the poverty line. Thus defined, the share
of vulnerable people within the total population rose from 14 percent in 1990 to 17 percent in 1995 (from
1.1 million to 1.5 million people).20

More recent analyses covering 2000–2010 (INS, ADB, World Bank 2012) emphasize, in addition to the
location of the household, the labor status of the household head and his or her educational level. As table
6 shows, unemployment is reported as a major cause of poverty. The unemployed represent the largest
contributor to poverty across all professional categories. The most affected households are also those
whose head is a farm worker, followed by those headed by a nonfarm worker or a farm operator.
Professionals and the self-employed are virtually free from poverty. By education level, as attainment
increases, the likelihood of being poor significantly diminishes. About 90 percent of all the poor are
concentrated in households headed by individuals with either no education, or primary education as
highest level (table 6).

Table 7. Incidence and Contribution to Poverty in 2010

   The rural poor derived their incomes primarily from agricultural activities (own-farm activities and agricultural
wage labor), but often also earned income outside agriculture. The need to diversify their sources of income
stemmed in part from the inability of small farms to provide a full-time occupation, and in part from the variability
of agricultural incomes because of fluctuations in rainfall.

3.2. A More Updated and Extensive Poverty Profile in Tunisia

Official poverty profiles in Tunisia have typically been focused on a few characteristics. This is the case
of the latest INS, ADB, and World Bank (2012) profile, which relates poverty incidence with
geographical location, educational levels (of household head), and occupations (of household heads).
Section 2.4 summarized the key results of that recent official profile. This study argues that its focus has
been narrow, and there is still a lot of ground to explore in Tunisia’s poverty profiling. In particular, it is
possible to:

           (i)      provide a more comprehensive and systematic profiling of poverty for 2005 and 2010
                    that includes additional sociodemographics, asset ownership, and access to basic services;
           (ii)     expand that analysis to 2012; and
           (iii)    include the bottom 40 percent of the population.

This chapter reports the key findings of expanding the official profile exercise. It profiles the
characteristics of the poor (P), the bottom 40 percent (b40), and the nonpoor (NP) in Tunisia and then
compares the profiles for 2005, 2010, and 2012. Profiled characteristics include sociodemographic and
location features; labor conditions; asset ownership; and access to basic services. Statistical means tests
are conducted to assess the differences of observed characteristics across profiles, both within and
between years. Notwithstanding these improvements, multiple gaps remain, even after those extensions.
This is a result of absent data (for example, there are no household expenditure or ENPEs after 2013),
limited access to existing data (for example, access to the ENPE 2012 data is only incomplete), and
methodological limitations (that prevent, for example, a full comparison of educational attainment across
surveys due to discrepancies in definitions). These issues are all discussed below.

3.3. The 2005 and 2010 Profiles Revisited

Pre-revolution poverty profiles in Tunisia show few surprises with respect to their correlates.
Looking at the 2005 and 2010 profiles obtained from ENCBVs suggests that profiles among the poor and
nonpoor converge only in a few dimensions in both years.21 Both population groups live mostly in
households headed by males (close to 90 percent in both years) aged 40–64 years (two-thirds for both the
poor and the nonpoor). Dependency rates are low both for the poor and nonpoor, 0.43 and 0.33,
respectively, in 2010—with similar rates observed in 2005.

Beyond these similarities, the poor live in more crowded households: they have more than one additional
member and about 50 percent fewer rooms per capita than nonpoor households. The poor are
concentrated in western regions (about 55 percent of the poor reside in those regions, despite representing
only 30 percent of the total population), with less educated members in poor households than among
nonpoor households (figure 7). Adding the southeast region to western regions, about 65 percent of the
poor live in these interior regions (60 percent in 2005). Among the nonpoor, the situation reverses: 65
percent live in the coastal regions of Grand Tunis, northeast and center east, while the remaining 35
percent live in interior regions. Poor households are equally concentrated in urban and rural locations, 50
percent of poor households in each area in 2010. In 2005, some 53 percent of the poor lived in urban
households. Among nonpoor households, the situation is different: 69 percent live in urban areas and 31
percent in rural areas (both in 2005 and 2010).

Other stark differences between the poor and nonpoor exist in education attainment (figure 8). Forty-three
percent of poor households in 2010 were headed by individuals with no education, compared to 26

21
     See appendix 3 for statistical mean tests across socioeconomic groups.

                                                           46
percent among nonpoor households (43 percent and 31 percent, respectively in 2005). Less than 12
percent of poor households are headed with someone who attended at least secondary or higher education
in 2010, compared to 37 percent of nonpoor households. Not shown in table 8, a substantial gap also
exists when looking at the education of household members other than the head. Only about 10 percent of
poor households have at least one member who attended tertiary education, whereas about 30 percent of
nonpoor households have at least one educated member in 2010. Having higher levels of education does
not prevent a household from escaping poverty, but it is clearly correlated with higher living
conditions (that is being a nonpoor household).

Poor households are less likely to be headed by someone out of the labor force than the nonpoor (24
percent and 31 percent, respectively, in 2010) but are more likely to be unemployed (5 percent) than the
nonpoor (1.5 percent). Nonpoor household heads are twice as likely to have a salaried job in the public
sector than poor household heads. Yet their relative shares are rather low: only 15 percent of nonpoor
household heads have such coveted jobs, compared with 7 percent among the poor in 2010 (19 percent
and 9 percent, respectively, in 2005). This implies that having a salaried job in the public sector does
not guarantee an escaping from poverty. Nor does having a salaried job in the private sector. In
fact, about 40 percent of poor household heads have such jobs—compared to 27 percent of nonpoor heads
(with similar proportions in 2005). In contrast, differences are not large with respect to self-employment
among poor and nonpoor (23 and 24 percent, respectively, in 2010, and 26 percent each in 2005),
although this is not entirely surprising given that self-employment includes a wide range of heterogeneous
occupations, from highly skilled professionals to low-skilled street vendors. Interestingly, nonpoor
household heads are four times more likely to work as professionals or mid-level professions than poor
heads (only twice as likely in the case of office workers), both in 2005 and 2010. By sector, the poor work
in similar shares (one-third) in agriculture, industry and services (both in 2005 and 2010), while more
than one half of the nonpoor (53 percent) work in services, followed by industry (28 percent) and
agriculture (20 percent in 2010).

These profiles indicate that labor is a relevant correlate of poverty in Tunisia, but by no means a
critical one. In effect, households headed by someone with a job in the public sector are not
guaranteed a path out of poverty. Neither does having a job in the private sector, being self-employed,
or working in services. Contributing to this is the fact that both poor and nonpoor households have a
similar distribution of occupations among members other than the household head. Thus, on average,
other household members’ occupations do not seem to ensure that certain households will escape from
poverty.

Notable gaps in the access to basic services are also observed between poor and nonpoor
households. In 2010, about 66 percent of poor households had access to tap water, compared to 87
percent among the nonpoor. Wider differences are observed for access to sanitation services, such as a
flush toilet within the home, are enjoyed by only 14 percent of poor households, but by half (49 percent)
of nonpoor households. Connection to sanitation services for the poor in 2010 was 35 percent, compared
to 61 percent of nonpoor households. Where differences narrow down significantly is in access to
electricity, which is almost universal in Tunisia. Regarding access to education, children for both poor
and nonpoor start on time—more than 95 percent in both cases. Yet, when looking at those who finish
school, there is a clear socioeconomic gap: a 20 percentage point chasm exists between those children
from poor households finishing sixth grade (57 percent) and children from nonpoor households (77
percent). So, even if poverty status does not seem to matter at the beginning of schooling, it does in terms
of performance. And these gaps appear to have increased between 2005 and 2010.
Poverty status also matters in terms of asset ownership (see figure 8). Durables such as televisions,
refrigerators, and cell phones are the assets most frequently owned by Tunisian households and where
differences between the poor and nonpoor are low. Almost 98 percent of nonpoor households own a
television, 97 percent a refrigerator, and 85 percent a cell phone. Among the poor, ownership is 92

                                                     47
percent, 83 percent and 73 percent, respectively. Differences are also narrow for those assets rarely owned
across Tunisia, such as freezers and bicycles (less than 5 percent of households, regardless of
socioeconomic status). Instead, differences are starker among assets such as cars or motorcycles (some 30
percent of nonpoor households own a car or motorcycle compare to 8 percent among the poor), phones,
and radios. These findings for 2010 apply closely to 2005 as well.22

In conclusion, while the previous—and official—profiles correctly stress the relevance of region,
education, and profession as key correlates of poverty, a more comprehensive profiling exercise
shows that there are a limited number of sociodemographic features that the poor and nonpoor
share. Furthermore, neither the education of the household head nor that of other members is critical to
determine who will either escape or be condemned to poverty. Neither will professional categories,
occupation, and sector. Access to some basic services (but not all) and asset ownership vary between the
poor and the nonpoor. In other words, there does not exist a dominating correlate to poverty, but a set of
marked differences across different dimensions of human capital, physical access, labor and demographic
features.

  In statistical terms, t-tests of the means of key variables in the profiles of poor and nonpoor (appendix 2) suggest
that even though changes in the characteristics of the poor between 2005 and 2010 may not have been substantive in
magnitude, they may have been statistically significant. In fact, all categories monitored show statistically
significant different means between both years, except for the shares of poor in households headed by individuals
aged 40–64 years with tertiary education, who are unemployed and located in Grand Tunis and the center and
southern regions. Also, access rates to flush toilets, sanitation, children finishing sixth grade, and ownership of cars
or motorcycles among the poor did not show statistically significant differences in either years (see test 3 in table

3.4. Post-Revolution Updated Poverty Profile

Post-revolution poverty correlates in 2012 are very similar to those observed pre-revolution. In
effect, household size, rooms per capita, age, and gender features of household heads, labor
characteristics regarding inactivity shares, sector and professions of working household heads, and
dependency rates within the household are all rather similar between the poor in 2010 and 2012 and for
the nonpoor in both years (table 9). And so is their distribution between urban and rural locations and the
shares of poor households across regions in both years. The poor’s access to basic services regarding tap
water and electricity,23 and their ownership rates among most assets considered,24 are also similar between
2010 and 2012. This is also the case among nonpoor households in both years (appendix 3 reports the
statistical difference means tests for all of these features across years and socioeconomic groups).

Interestingly, there are a number of categories that cannot be compared intertemporally between the
ENPE and ENBCV because the former does not report information on a number of variables, or the
categories reported are not strictly comparable with ENBCV. Regarding lack of information in ENPE,
this is the case of active labor status categories (that is, self-employment and salaried—unemployment is
reported along with out of labor market in both surveys) and public and private sector jobs. In terms of
access to services, it is not possible to determine access to flush toilets, sanitation, and start, attendance

23
  Those are the only ones for which both ENBCV 2010 and ENPE 2012 both report information.
24
  Such assets include television, computer, phone, cell phone, bicycle, car or motorcycle, refrigerator and freezer,
except for radio, where differences are notable between both years.

                                                                51
and completion of education services by children of the household from ENPE surveys. ENPE surveys
also fail to provide information on computer, phones, cell phones, and freezers. In addition, ENPE
surveys do not provide information on consumption nor the share of household expenditures on food.
Finally, in the case of educational variables considered in the profile, that is, educational attainment of
household heads and other members, differences between the reported categories from both ENPE and
ENBCV make their comparison troublesome.25

In post-revolution 2012, the poor continued to live in more crowded households than the nonpoor (almost
6 compared to 4.5 members, respectively; table 9). The concentration of the poor in rural areas exceeds
that of urban poor (56 percent versus 44 percent, respectively), while the opposite occurs among the
nonpoor: 72 percent live in urban areas and only 28 percent in rural locations (figure 9). The post-
revolution poor are also concentrated in western regions (60 percent), while only 25 percent of the
nonpoor lived in these regions in 2012. The shares of out of labor force and unemployed household heads
in 2012 are very similar to those observed pre-revolution in 2010: almost one-third of the nonpoor are out
of the labor force compared to some 27 percent of the poor. The proportion of unemployed poor is 3.5
times larger than the unemployed nonpoor (5.5 versus 1.5, respectively) among household heads, and less
than 2 percent among members other than household heads. The post-revolution household head poor
keep working in agriculture, industry, and services in equal shares, about 33 percent each (figure 9). In
the case of the nonpoor, 53 percent of household heads worked in services, 31 percent in industry, and 16
percent in agriculture in 2012. About 24 percent of nonpoor household heads are professionals compared
with only 5 percent among the poor. Dependency rates have hardly varied between 2010 and 2012,
reaching 0.44 among poor households and 0.33 among nonpoor.

Access to tap water in 2012 report the same important gaps between the poor and nonpoor (63 percent vs.
89 percent, respectively) than observed in previous years, while for electricity, such differences do not
exist with an access close to universal (over 99 percent for both poor and nonpoor). Among assets,
televisions and refrigerators continue to be reported as those most frequently owned by Tunisians, with
narrow gaps of ownership between the poor and nonpoor. Thus, 93 percent of poor households and 99
percent of nonpoor have a television set; while 85 percent of poor and 96 percent of the nonpoor have a
fridge. About a third of nonpoor household own a car or motorcycle while only 15 percent of poor
households do. Radios are more likely owned by the nonpoor (69 percent) than the poor (43 percent),
while freezers and bicycles are owned by very few Tunisians, with no marked differences among the poor
and nonpoor (less than 5 percent in both cases).26

Comparing profiles does not provide the ability to determine the causes for intertemporal changes or lack
thereof. However, it is reasonable to think that many of the key dimensions considered, such as

25
   In terms of definitions, ENBCV-based attainment is obtained from an interaction of two variables: the highest
level of education completed (with 9 categories) and the education cycle to which the individual is currently
attending (with 16 possible categories). In the case of the ENPE, the education variable reports four levels of
instruction (none, elementary, secondary, and tertiary). In terms of samples, the ENBCV reports education for each
individual aged 3 years and older, while the ENPE does for individuals aged 10 years and older. In terms of
member’s residency status, it is unclear how the variable is constructed in the ENPE. Given these differences, trends
for educational attainment of household head and other household members in the profiling of pre- and post-
revolution for the poor, nonpoor, and b40 population should be considered tentative. Results for ENBCV-based
years are considered consistent given the same definition and categories officially provided by INS, ADB, and
World Bank (2012).
26
   In terms of statistical differences, means t-tests for the 2010 and 2012 profiles suggest statistically significant differences
across most categories (appendix 2, tests 5 and 6, table A3.1). These results should, however, be taken very cautiously given the
t-tests are affected by very low standard variations, common in population-expanded estimations. This results in very large
estimates of the mean t-test differences and a high probability of accepting differences, even though they do not appear to be
substantive in magnitude. The same applies to t-tests among poor, nonpoor, and b40 categories for 2012.


                                                                52
demographics, location, asset ownership and access to basic services, are unlikely to suffer substantive
changes—at least in absolute terms and magnitudes—within a two year span. Also, for those variables
more susceptible to rapid change, for example, labor conditions, it is also reasonable to think that changes
in 2012 would have possibly compensated for changes that occurred in 2011—when the revolution might
have taken a harsher toll on unemployment. In other words, by looking at 2012 rather than 2011, changes
with respect to pre-revolution 2010 that might have been taken place in 2011 may well have been
partially reversed. Finally, the very imputation of consumption in 2012 and, ultimately, the resulting
identification of poor and nonpoor categories among 2012 households, is based on the observed
consumption in 2010 without structural changes allowed in 2012 (that is, keeping constant their structure
of consumption or, in other words, imposing returns to factors to be constant over time). All these factors
are consistent with the reported similarities found by and large between the 2010 and 2012 poverty
profiles.

3.5. Who Are the Bottom 40 Percent of the Population?

The profile for the Tunisian b40 population reported in table 9 suggests that they live in crowded
households: in 2012 the average size of a b40 household was 5.3. The b40 are concentrated in western
regions (50 percent of total b40 population in 2012, figure 10). About 81 percent of the b40 household
heads have primary or less as highest educational attainment. Over 60 percent of b40 individuals live in
households whose head is in the 40–64 age group, and close to 90 percent have a male head. Only 9
percent of b40 household heads have a salaried job in the public sector; 37 percent a salaried job in the


                                                         53
private sector, and 25 percent are self-employed.27 Their sectoral composition is balanced among
agriculture, industry and services, 33 percent each. Almost all b40 households have access to electricity;
some 70 percent have access to tap water, and only 17 percent have access to flush toilets. In terms of
education, 96 percent of b40 children start on time, 92 percent attend school, and 64 percent finish sixth
grade. Most b40 households have televisions (94 percent), refrigerators (89 percent), and, to a lesser
extent, cell phones (76 percent). About one-third have a radio, about 12 percent a car or motorcycle, 9
percent a phone, and less than 5 percent have a computer, a bicycle, or a freezer. In terms of consumption
patterns, they spend 39 percent of their expenditures on food.28

Given the levels of poverty in Tunisia—23 percent in 2005, 15 percent in 2010, and around 13 percent in
2012—the b40 population comprises all the poor and a relevant share of the nonpoor. Consistent with that
fact, the b40 socioeconomic and demographic profile described above systematically falls between
those of the poor and the nonpoor (table 9). In effect, the size of b40 households lies between that of
average poor household and the nonpoor. So does their number of per capita rooms, the distribution of
educational attainment among their household heads, distribution between urban and rural locations, and
all occupation, sector, and professional categories of labor. This is also true for access rates to the basic
services monitored in the analysis and the ownership of assets and household durables. In terms of per
capita consumption and the share of food as part of total expenditures, b40 averages once again fall
between poor and nonpoor categories. This is the expected result of the very composition of the b40
socioeconomic group and is systematically observed in 2005, 2010, and 2012.

What it is perhaps more important is that the profile of the bottom 40 percent appears more closely
aligned to that of the poor than the nonpoor for multiple variables considered in each year. When
looking at the magnitude of key variables analyzed (table 9), a close alignment of the profiles between the
poor and b40 is evident for the urban and rural distribution of both groups: thus, 44 percent and 43
percent, respectively, of poor and b40 households live in urban areas compared to 72 percent among the
nonpoor in 2012. For those years with reliable information, 2005 and 2010, between 75 percent and 80
percent of heads of poor and b40 households report incomplete primary education or less as their highest
educational level attended compared to 53 percent of the nonpoor. Concentration of poor and b40
households geographically is similar in western regions (60 percent of the poor lived in these regions in
2012 and 50 percent of the b40), compared to the concentration of nonpoor in those regions, at only 25
percent. Relative to labor characteristics, the distribution of sectors among the poor and b40 aligns closely
(each category comprising about one-third of working household heads) as is the case also for the
professional categories considered in this analysis. Regarding basic services, access to tap water, flush
toilets, and sanitation services of the b40 households are closer to those access rates of the poor than the
nonpoor. Instead, for services close to universal access (such as electricity and children’s start to
schooling), there are no substantive differences among the poor, b40, and nonpoor households. For most
of the assets considered, b40 ownership of radio, car or motorcycle, computer, phone, and cell phone
aligns closely to the ownership profile of the poor. Finally, in terms of consumption per capita of
households, the average consumption for a poor household in 2010 is much closer to that of a b40 than a
nonpoor household. In effect, at US$104 2005 PPP (purchasing power parity), the per capita monthly
consumption of b40 households is 40 percent above the per capita consumption of the poor (US$74 2005
PPP), but less than half of the average consumption of a nonpoor household (US$256 2005 PPP; table 9).

Notwithstanding the closer alignment between the poor and b40 profiles for multiple categories, there are
also several categories where b40 profiles do not align closely with the poor. This is the case for
household size and rooms per capita; age structure among household heads; labor status and occupation
of household head; children’s school attendance and rate of children finishing sixth grade; and b40
ownership of durables such as televisions, refrigerators, and freezers. Among consumption variables, the

27
     It refers to 2010 because the 2012 ENPE does not report such categorization.
28
     Assets and access to services also refer to 2010 due to a wider set of indicators available.

                                                                    54
share of food expenditures on total expenditures of the household also suggests that the b40
approximately fall midway between poor and nonpoor shares.

Like the profiles for the poor and nonpoor, the b40 population have not changed much post-
revolution. In general terms, the structure of educational attainment of household heads hardly varied
between 2010 and 2005. Nor did their age structure or the share of households headed by males or
residing in urban (compared to rural) areas between 2005 and 2012 (table 9). The distribution of b40
households across regions is also fairly consistent across all the years considered. In terms of labor, the
shares of inactive and unemployed household heads do not show large discrepancies for 2005, 2010 and
2012. Sector of activity and professional grouping are also similar for all years considered, and so is the
dependency rate among b40 households. Access rates to tap water and electricity are very close during
2005–2012, and so is sanitation and children’s school attendance.29 Among assets, ownership rates of
Televisions, refrigerators, freezers and bicycles remained rather stable over time. Average consumption
per capita of b40 households in 2010 is comparable to 2005 once inflation is taken into account, that is,
there is not a substantive variation of purchasing power in both years among b40 households.30



29
   For these two indicators, however, the valid reference period is 2005 and 2010 for lack of information reported for such
indicators in the 2012 ENPE.
30
   In effect, the 88.20 US$ 2005 PPP per capita household consumption would have a value of 108 US$ 2005 PPP in 2010 after
correcting for annual inflation in between years, very close to the reported 104 US$ consumption observed in the 2010 ENBCV.

                                                             55
In contrast, changes over time for the b40 profiles are observed in regards to household size, with declines
over time; increasing access to flush toilets, children starting on time and finishing sixth.31 Ownership of
cell phone hiked between 2005 and 2010, in detriment of phones, while that of Televisions and radios
also improved notably. Computer also increased although did not shift substantially their low density
among this population group. Finally, the share of spending on food went down substantially in both
years.

In conclusion, the b40 group in Tunisia comprises all the poor and a substantive share of the
nonpoor—closer to the poverty line than the remaining b60 group. So, by the very composition of
this group, its socioeconomic profile does fall between that of the poor and the nonpoor, aligning itself
closer to that of the poor in multiple dimensions. This is so for 2005, 2010, and 2012. Evidence suggests
that there have not been substantive changes in the profile of those households pertaining to the b40 group
in 2005 and 2010; and for comparable features, this has also been the case between 2010 and 2012. As
argued before, the nature of key features profiled, the relatively short period of time—two years—after
the revolution, and technical issues in the identification of the poor based on the cross-survey imputation
all may have contributed to small changes over time.

It is worth concluding that the cross-survey imputation technique has for the first time made possible the
construction of a rich and extended poverty profiling exercise in Tunisia. Not shown in this chapter, but
presented in appendix 4, a profile for 2009 was also constructed following this methodology. The 2009
poverty profile confirms all key results found between 2005 and 2010. But the current analysis also shows
the limitations of an enhanced profile exercise in Tunisia. First, it is not possible to extend the analysis
beyond 2012, because there are no complete ENPEs available after that year (and the 2015 ENBCV is
currently being collected). Second, even though the post-revolution profile has been compared to that of
2010—and 2005—for all socioeconomic, geographical, labor, service access and asset ownership
dimensions, there are some notorious missing features—in ENPEs—that limit a more thorough
intertemporal analysis. This is the case for occupation categories, several basic services, and a number of
household assets. More substantive work in terms of increasing the availability of existing data
sources, collecting regularly updated sources, and eliminating definitional discrepancies among
sources is needed to better understand poverty and disparities profiles over time.

Chapter 4: Has Vulnerability to Poverty Increased in Tunisia?
4.1 Defining Vulnerability to Poverty: The Simple Notion of “Robustness” to (Monetary) Poverty

INS, ADB, and World Bank (2012) acknowledge that, despite sustained poverty reduction, the
consumption of many households in Tunisia is just above the poverty line. Consequently, those
households remain vulnerable to economic shocks—loss of employment, price rises—or shocks of other
sorts—illness, catastrophic events—that would plunge them back into poverty, especially in rural areas.
Measured by the number of people having expenditures about 30 percent above the poverty line, old
estimates by the World Bank (2004) suggest that the share of the vulnerable among the total population in
Tunisia rose from 14 percent in 1990 to 17 percent in 1995. Unfortunately, there have been no recent
official or alternative efforts to capture the degree of vulnerability among Tunisian households in more
systematic and quantitative terms. Box 4 presents a succinct description of definitions and measures of
vulnerability to poverty used elsewhere, providing the basis for the analysis conducted in this section.
This analysis presents a set of alternatives based on both monetary and nonmonetary approaches to
vulnerability to poverty. These approaches—applied gradually to Tunisia, from simplest to more
sophisticated—all share the basic notion that vulnerability to poverty captures an expectation or
probability to future poverty.

Box 4. Defining and Measuring Vulnerability to Poverty
In its simplest form, vulnerability to poverty is an ex ante notion that reflects future prospects of poverty in the
presence of risks (Chaudhuri 2003). This definition goes beyond a mere concept of an individual, household or
community’s ability to smooth consumption in the face of shocks; or a notion of households’ exposure to adverse
shocks that ignores the current poverty status of the household (Chaudhuri 2003). Vulnerability to poverty captures
today’s expected poverty, taking into account a household’s exposure to shocks, that is, risks, its capacity to
prevent/mitigate or cope with them; and its long-term income-generation capacity.

Ideally, the notion of vulnerability to poverty as expected poverty would be estimated as the proportion of the
population with a consumption level above a current poverty line Z0 in time 0 that will fall below the poverty line Z1
in time 1 within a certain probability (Dang and Lanjouw 2014). In this line, Pritchett, Suryahadi, and Sumarto.
(2000) define a vulnerability line for Indonesia as the level of income below which a household experiences a
greater than even chance of experiencing an episode of poverty in the near future. However, their 50 percent
probability threshold is arbitrary and allows as “vulnerable” even those households that are currently poor. Dang a nd
Lanjouw (2014) define, instead, a population that is clearly not poor, but that face a real risk of falling into poverty.
They apply this definition to India, the United States, and Vietnam and exclude the current poor from the
measurement of vulnerability. Lopez-Calva and Ortiz-Juarez (2014) define vulnerability to poverty as the opposite
notion to remaining economically secure—which they equate to belonging to a middle class that is characterized by
a status of food security. Using panel data for Mexico, Chile and Peru, they define the vulnerable as those nonpoor
households with a 10 percent or higher probability of becoming poor in five years.

Other analyses have used more ad hoc measurements. World Bank (1995b) defined multiple poverty lines in
Ecuador and simply designated the highest of those lines as a “vulnerability line .” For India, NCEUS (2007) defined
vulnerability as simply occurring within a fixed income range, between 1.25 and 2 times the national poverty line,
and World Bank (2004, 2012) defined it as some 30 percent above the poverty line in Tunisia and Vietnam.
Similarly, a number of studies focusing on identifying the middle class has set an income falling within an interval
defined in absolute values (Banerjee and Duflo 2008; Ravallion 2010) or relative to the whole income distribution
(Pressman 2007) or some combination of these two (Birdsall 2010). Once the middle class is defined, the vulnerable
are those between the poor and the middle class. A well-known examples of this practice is Banerjee and Duflo
(2008), who define households in developing countries as belonging to the middle class if their daily expenditures
are between US$2 and US$10 PPP. In Latin America, Ferreira et al. (2013) following a similar approach, define
vulnerable households as those between US$4 and US$10 PPP.

                                                           57
A first approach to assess vulnerability to poverty simply recalculates new poverty rates after the
reference poverty lines are changed. More than a proper analysis of vulnerability, this exercise is a
robustness assessment of poverty incidence across alternative poverty lines and shows the share of the
nonpoor population that would become poor after changes in their consumption equivalent to a certain
change in the reference poverty line. Using data for 2010, this robustness exercise in Tunisia finds that an
additional 2.3 percentage points of the population (about 250,000 Tunisians) would have fallen into
poverty if the poverty lines had been some 5 percent higher than the official lines, that is, between TD 41
and 64 per capita per year (for noncommunal areas and cities, respectively). In other words, shocks of any
nature that would have reduced Tunisian households’ per capita consumption by TD 41 and 64 would
have led to poverty increases of 2.3 percentage points (table 10). If poverty lines had increased by 20
percent in 2010, the incidence of poverty would have increased by 60 percent of the level observed in
2010, or almost 10 percentage points.

Similarly, decreasing the value of the poverty line by 5 percent would have reduced poverty by 2
percentage points. Had the decrease been 20 percent of the value of the poverty line, the reduction in
poverty would have been about 7 percentage points. This confirms that there is a substantive share of the
country’s population—17 percent—spending within 80 percent and 120 percent of the equivalent value of
the official poverty line, and therefore, relatively close to changing their poverty status following changes
in their consumption around 20 percent. This is particularly serious in a context like the Tunisian
revolution, relatively volatile GDP growth, increasing inflation, fluctuating unemployment rates, and
subsidy reforms in the agenda that can lead to sizeable consumption swings in the short term.

By urban and rural location, poverty rates among cities are those with the highest sensitivity to changes in
their poverty lines. A 5 percent increase in the urban poverty line would lead to a 21 percent jump in their
poverty rate, or less than 2 percentage points. Rural or noncommunal areas are those presenting the lowest
impacts from increases in their poverty lines (in relative terms, about half the variation found among
cities).

4.2 Vulnerability as Probability of Being Poor

However, the notion of vulnerability as “robustness to poverty” is fairly simplistic and tells little about the
identity of the vulnerable or what factors put them at risk. More importantly, vulnerability to monetary
poverty defined in terms of sensitivity to changes in the poverty line completely ignores the notion that
certain individual and household characteristics and conditions make households more (or less) at risk of
falling into poverty, and less equipped to cope with risks and shocks that push them into poverty. If that is
the case, one would like to know the extent to which several characteristics and decisions of individuals
and households (also of communities if systemic risks are considered) determine households’
vulnerability to being poor. Tying the analyses in chapters 4 and 5 with the current notion of vulnerability
to poverty, the four key dimensions used in poverty profiling and consumption modeling—
sociodemographics and location; labor; access to services; and asset ownership—are also considered in
assessing the determinants of vulnerability to poverty.

Based on the consumption model estimated in chapter 4 (and appendix 2), figure 11 shows the
vulnerability to being poor in Tunisia for 2005 and 2010 as a probability conditional to certain household
characteristics. Specifically, figure 11 shows the average predicted probability of being poor across each
percentile of the distribution of household per capita consumption. Probabilities are first predicted
according to a simplified model, the “standard model,” which contains only sociodemographic and labor
features. To that model, a few select assets32 are added, leading to probability estimates labeled as
“individual assets.” Next, a new set of estimates is produced using an “asset index,” which captures all
assets for which information is available. A final model is estimated after adding access to basic services
to the already included standard sociodemographic and labor characteristics. Results are presented under
the “access to services” label.

Figure 11 confirms that the predicted probability of being poor decreases as consumption increases.
This was totally expected as it simply reflects the fact that at higher levels of economic security—
captured by higher consumption levels—the probability of being poor diminishes. In the case of Tunisia,
this result is robust to the choice of determinants used in the modeling exercise. What remains an
empirical mystery are the exact probabilities of being poor across consumption levels. And this analysis
for Tunisia shows that, despite the overall reduction observed in poverty rates between 2005 and
2010, the probability of falling into poverty for any household in 2010 still remains considerably
high. For example, households in the percentile 40th of the distribution, that is, those that separate the
bottom 40 percent and nonpoor categories, had an average 34 percent probability of being poor in 2005.
Their probability of being poor in 2010 was 24 percent.




32
   The extension of the standard model labeled “individual assets” includes binary regressors that control for
whether the household owns an air conditioner, satellite dish, washing machine, oven, car, and the number of rooms
in the dwelling. The asset index model includes as a regressor an index calculated from the first component of a
principal components analysis of the same set of assets owned by the household and the number of rooms of the
dwelling.

Notes: “Standard model” refers to a model that predicts being poor based on socioeconomic and demographic characteristics,
without including assets or access to services. “Individual assets” adds ownership of specific assets to the standard model. “Asset
index” includes an asset index obtained from applying principal component analysis to the distribution of assets reported by
households. “Access to services” adds the household coverage of basic services (water, electricity and sanitation) to the sta ndard
model.


Building from the Lopez-Calva and Ortiz-Juarez (2014) definition of households vulnerable to poverty as
those nonpoor households with a probability of 10 percent or higher probability of being poor, figure 11
suggests that 56 percent of the population in 2005 and still 46 percent in 2010 would be considered
vulnerable.33 As a result, 21 percent of Tunisian households in 2005 and 39 percent Tunisians in 2010
would be considered economically secure using the Lopez-Calva and Ortiz-Juarez (2014) definition.



4.3 Vulnerability to Poverty as “Poverty Mobility”

Thus far, the analysis of vulnerability to poverty has been analyzed from a static point of view, that is, in
a given year. But vulnerability to poverty has an intrinsic dynamic sense, capturing today’s expectation of
future poverty in the face of risks. This dynamic sense intrinsically entails a notion of mobility, that is,
nonpoor households falling into poverty over time and, the other side of the coin, poor households
escaping poverty over time. Interestingly, by looking at any type of mobility across poverty status—and
not only mobility out of poverty—an analysis of mobility assesses the role that certain determinants have
in changing poverty, that is, how a factor like education can affect the chances of a household to move
out of poverty, but also into poverty.34 Based on Field’s (2005) notion of time dependence, a society is



33
   The threshold to be above the vulnerable categorization was US$260 2005 PPP of monthly household per capita
consumption in 2005, and US$216 2005 PPP in 2010.
34
   Ultimately, this analysis assesses the more comprehensive question of how “mobile” a society is in terms of
poverty and not just how today’s nonpoor may fall into poverty tomorrow.

                                                                60
deemed mobile in terms of poverty over time if one’s initial position does not bear relevance in
determining his or her future poverty status in society.35

Box 5 describes in detail the methodology used to capture poverty mobility in Tunisia. The data for this
analysis comes from the 2005 and 2010 ENBCV rounds.36 Using the demographic and economic data
available, cohorts of individuals defined by age and gender are created and tracked between 2005 and
2010. Some 23 age groups are first created in the ENBCV 2005, delimited by three-year bins starting with
individuals aged 15 and 17 years old, followed with those between 18–20 years old, with a final bin of
those aged 81 years and older. Each of these cohorts are then further disaggregated by gender, thus
obtaining a final set of 46 cohorts in 2005 that will be followed in 2010.

Each cohort has its own characteristics in terms of sociodemographics, labor conditions, and a wealth
index (which now combines assets ownership and dwelling characteristics, such as being connected to the
public electrical network and having tap water available inside). Thus, for example, each cohort has an
average age of the head of the household to which each member of the cohort belongs; a percentage of
members residing in urban areas; and a share of members working in agriculture, to name a few.
Averages and percentages of all these determinants are obtained for each cohort and year using the
reported sampling weights of each survey.37 To estimate equations (4) and (5) in box 5 that capture
poverty mobility, the consumption per capita variable is converted into 2005 PPP to take into account
changes in prices that may affect the observed level of consumption.

Box 5. Capturing Poverty Mobility
The starting point of poverty mobility analysis is the measure of income or consumption mobility, as defined by Lillard and
Willis (1978), where the relationship between past and present income/consumption was established as follows:

                                                                                                                     (1)


where      is the total income/consumption for household I at time t,     is a disturbance term, and parameter , the coefficient of
the slope in a regression of the income over its lagged value, is the measure of mobility. A value of equal to 1 represents a
situation where previous (or initial) income/consumption completely determines current income/consumption, and current
income perfectly predicts the income expected in the future. This is a situation of where there is no income mobility. An extreme
case is = 0, in which mobility would be total (as there would be no relationship between past and present incomes). The
mobility estimator obtained from (1) is called unconditional in the sense that it does not take into account the presence of
covariates (other than past income) that may explain present income. When the estimation is performed with additional controls,
we have the time-dependence conditional estimation of mobility:

                                                                                                                           (2)

where X is a vector of covariates and is intended to measure the impact of those covariates on income. However, the
implementation of (2) requires the ability to follow individuals (or households) over time, with the direct implication of a need

35
   A more detailed description of these and other mobility measures can be found in Fields (2005) and Ferreira et al. (2013).
Other notions of mobility refer to individuals’ changes in economic positions; changes in individuals’ shares of incomes; income
flux or size of the fluctuations in individuals’ incomes, but not their sign; how many people move up or down and by how many
dollars; and mobility as an equalizer of longer-term incomes that is, a comparison of the inequality of income at one point in time
with the inequality of income over a longer period.
36
   Note that this analysis is based on the actual incidence of poverty as found in the ENBCV. We are precluded to extend this
analysis to the 2012 ENPE as the predicted incidences would have come from a prediction itself rather than observables. In
practice, the assumption of no change in the coefficients of the estimated consumption model in 2010 when predicting 2012
consumption or the assumption of identical error terms in both years determine the predicted poverty rates in 2012. This would,
by construction, minimize the change in poverty observed between 2010 and 2012. While this lower bound estimate is useful to
inform the order of magnitude and direction of post-revolution poverty change, it may not be fully appropriate to be used in
poverty dynamics analysis.
37
   Appendix 5 presents the basic descriptive statistics of sociodemographics, labor, access to services, and asset ownership
features that characterize the “synthetic” household heads of the constructed pseudo -panel cohorts.

                                                                61
for longitudinal data. Unfortunately, in the Tunisian case, such panel data are not available. To investigate mobility, analysis
must rely on pseudo-panel techniques (Deaton 1995) and create synthetic observations (called cohorts) obtained from averaging
real observations with similar characteristics in a sequence of repeated cross-sectional data sets. That is, individuals are grouped
according to certain characteristics (age and gender) that define them over time, and then the average of their characteristics
within each group are used. Since groupings are based on characteristics that can be tracked, the synthetic units of observations
can be “followed” over time. The estimation equation can be modified then to:

                                                                                                                         (3)

where the individual index, I, has been replaced by a cohort index, c(t), that is time-dependent. Analogously to equation (1), the
slope is the parameter of interest.

This analysis is complemented by examining not only the mobility of consumption, estimator , but also changes in the poverty
incidence for the pseudo-panel observations. For that purpose, for each cohort the percentage of individuals whose income is
below a poverty threshold is computed, and then, denoting that percentage by p, the extent to which this change is related to
initial levels of poverty can be estimated. That is:

                                                                                                                         (4)

As with the unconditional and conditional version of the mobility equation, this equation can be expanded (4) to account for other
possible determinants of the evolution of poverty, as found in other studies. Thus, the estimate:

                                                                                                                         (5)

Results from this equation will inform how certain covariates in a past time determine the probability of a given
individual and household to remain in, fall into, or escape from poverty in a subsequent period.

All cohorts experienced a decrease in poverty between the years 2005 and 2010, with only one
exception, the cohort of females aged 63–65 in 2005 (figure 12). Cohorts experienced a drop in poverty
incidence that ranges from almost 16 percentage points to a mere 0.1 percentage point, with wide
variation among cohorts. Yet, more than half of the cohorts registered a drop of at least 5 percentage
points between both years. This confirms that the observed reduction of poverty between 2005 and
2010—of 8 percentage points—is the result of a generalized improvement in poverty conditions
across the population, with a large share benefiting from sizeable—average—reductions.


What is behind those reductions in poverty across cohorts? To answer this question, the analysis focuses
on the indicator that captures changes in poverty incidence within cohorts over time. Poverty rates are
defined according to the poverty line relevant for each strata where a household resides (city, medium-
sized towns, and noncommunal areas). Poverty rates are averaged within cohorts using sampling weights.
Thus, for each synthetic observation in each year, the percentage of individuals that have an average per
capita consumption below the poverty cutoff is calculated. Based on that estimate of poverty within a
cohort, the change in poverty over time results from subtracting each cohort’s poverty rate in 2005 from
the cohort’s poverty rate in 2010.38 These cohorts’ poverty changes are then regressed on the key
determinants of mobility described in box 5. Table 11 reports the results of the estimation of equation (4)
in column 1—unconditional poverty mobility—and of several specifications of equation (5) in columns
2–5, capturing poverty mobility conditional to several determinants. Column 2 includes controls for

     That difference constitutes the left-hand side of equations (4) and (5) described in box 5.

sociodemographic, wealth and access to services, while columns 3–6 add controls for labor market
characteristics.

2010.




The initial level of a cohort’s poverty is a significant determinant in the expected change of poverty over
time. Cohorts with higher poverty rates in 2005 experienced larger drops in poverty between 2005
and 2010 than cohorts with lower poverty levels. This result is in line with previous results
suggesting that poorer population groups experienced large improvements in welfare (see chapter
2)—though large differences still remain. Figure 12 illustrates this finding: the predicted change in
poverty between 2005 and 2010 for each of the 46 cohorts increases with initial levels of poverty in 2005.

This result holds across different specifications modeling poverty mobility (table 12). Column 1 in table
12—unconditional poverty mobility—points to a statistically significant effect of initial poverty in 2005
in explaining poverty reductions between that year and 2010. Columns 2–6 also consistently confirm that
effect as other determinants are gradually controlled for. Interestingly, the estimated coefficient for initial
poverty varies relatively little across specifications (from -0.531 to -0.649), and only two other
determinants are found significant once initial poverty is controlled for: the average age of the household
head and the percentage of individuals whose household head had primary studies.

Cohorts of individuals living in households with older heads experienced, on average, larger drops in their
poverty rates between 2005 and 2010. Education seems to have an impact as well, but only among
relatively lower levels of education: cohorts with a higher concentration of individuals in households
whose head attended only primary school also experienced, on average, larger decreases in poverty rates.
This appears consistent with the country’s economic growth model based on low skills dominating
Tunisian development, as discussed in chapter 1. After controlling for demographics and initial poverty,
other characteristics such as location, wealth, and labor market are not found statistically significant
determinants of poverty mobility. This does not mean that these determinants are not relevant in
explaining poverty levels in Tunisia. Instead, when cohorts have similar average poverty rates and
demographic characteristics, differences in labor market status or wealth do not create by themselves
significant differences in their capacity to reduce poverty over time. However, other labor variables not
considered here—due to lack of data—such as changes in wages, earnings, job quality, and productivity
may matter for poverty reduction over time for these cohorts. Also, productive assets rather than
consumption assets may have more of an impact in explaining poverty reduction trends, which may
explain the lack of significant effects found among assets in these poverty mobility equations.

The analysis of consumption mobility (reported in appendix 5) confirms by and large the key findings of
poverty mobility in terms of the extent of mobility and its significant determinants. In conclusion, it can
be argued that vulnerability to poverty—from a dynamic perspective—has decreased in Tunisia,
consistent with evidence discussed earlier. Most cohorts saw their poverty incidence decline
between 2005 and 2010, including those with initially higher levels of poverty. Thus poverty
reduction has been a generalized trend that did not exclude the poorest cohorts of population. Initial
poverty conditions and education and age of household head are found to be the most significant
determinants of poverty reduction in Tunisia, while labor conditions and wealth did not provide additional
contributions to reduce poverty—other than their effect on the starting level of poverty.

Chapter 5: Is Tunisia an Equal Opportunities Society?


5.1 To What Extent Does Tunisia Offer Equal Opportunities to Its Citizens?

The analysis of vulnerability so far has been anchored in the notion of monetary poverty, that is, how and
why households are vulnerable to fall into monetary poverty, remain poor, or change their poverty status.
Yet those approaches do not go beyond monetary metrics of poverty and therefore miss nonmonetary
dimensions of welfare. How can the concepts of vulnerability and poverty be linked from a multi-
dimensional perspective?

Equality of opportunities provides a promising extension to the traditional focus on monetary poverty
(Roemer 1998; Molinas et al. 2010; Cuesta 2014). The framework is based on two basic concepts:
opportunities and circumstances. Opportunities are the goods and services that a society agrees are critical
for a decent life and individual development. Hence, universal access to such opportunities is a desired
goal that is commonly accepted. Primary education, adequate access to water and sanitation, or timely and
affordable health care are examples of opportunities. Circumstances are the attributes of an individual’s
environment (social, genetic, or biological) with which he or she is born into. Those attributes are
considered beyond the control of the individual, and society does not regard him or her responsible for
such traits. Circumstances typically include gender, age, parental background, and ethnicity. Equality of
opportunities prevails when an opportunity can be achieved with the same level of effort irrespective of
an individual’s circumstances. That is, under equality of opportunities, circumstances do not affect the
access to key goods and services that are necessary for enjoying a decent life.

The Human Opportunity Index (HOI; Paes de Barros et al. 2008) is one of the most commonly used
analytical tools to measure equality of opportunities. The HOI synthesizes in a single indicator how close
a society is to universal coverage of a given opportunity and how equitably coverage of that opportunity
is distributed. Simply put, the HOI is a measure of coverage of a good or service that takes into account
the degree of access inequality among citizens. The HOI “penalizes” the extent to which different
circumstance groups—that is, population groups defined by certain circumstances—have different
coverage rates of a given opportunity. When coverage rates among multiple circumstance groups are
equal, the penalty is zero and the HOI is equal to the opportunity’s overall coverage rate. As coverage
rates differ among circumstance groups, the penalty increases and the HOI decreases. Higher inequality in
coverage rates leads to lower HOI. Box 6 provides a more technical representation of the HOI construct,
while table 11 presents the opportunities and circumstances used in the analysis for Tunisia.

Box 6. Constructing the HOI
According to Molinas et al. (2010), Paes de Barros et al. (2008) and Narayan and Hoyos (2012), from
which this box draws, constructing the HOI requires to estimate the conditional probabilities of access to
opportunities for each child based on his or her circumstances. A simple way to do so is to fit a logistic
model, linear in the parameters β, where event I corresponds to accessing the opportunity (for example,
access to clean water), and x the set of circumstances (for example, gender of the child, education, gender
of the head of the household, and the like) on household survey data. One can fit the logistic regression
using survey data:




                                                    66
where xk denotes the row vector of variables representing the k dimension of circumstances, hence, x =
(x1, ..., xm) and β’ = (b1, ..., bm), a corresponding column vector of parameters. From the estimation of this
logistic regression from a household survey data, one obtains estimates of the parameters {βk}, denoted
by “^” while n denotes the sample size. Given the estimated coefficients, one can obtain for each
individual in the sample his or her predicted probability of access to a given opportunity as:




Finally, from these estimates, the overall coverage rate, C, can be computed, as well as the D-index, the
penalty, P, and the HOI, using the predicted probability p^ and sampling weights, w, from the household
survey data used as:




D, or the dissimilarity index, is typically interpreted as a share of the total number of opportunities that
needs to be reallocated among all groups of the population with different circumstances to ensure equality
of opportunity, that is, an equal coverage rate for all groups. D is commonly referred as the inequality of
opportunity index. When this similarity index is combined with coverage, the resulting figure indicates
the penalty that should be imposed to the observed coverage rate to inequality among population groups.
The HOI is the adjusted coverage rate after that inequality-based penalty is subtracted.

Decomposition methods can be used to determine the contribution to each circumstance, x, to the total
intergroup inequality, that is, to the D-Index. One of the most recently used decomposition methods is
Shorrocks (2013). This methodology develops a decomposition based on Shapleys original game theory
work. The proposed decomposition allows us to quantify the role of each circumstance as its marginal
contribution to the D-Index. For a given set of circumstances, the “contribution” of an additional
circumstance to the index can be interpreted as the marginal change in the value of the D-Index after
adding the “new” circumstance. Circumstances that add more to the D-Index are then considered as
contributing to (or explaining) a larger share of the inequality between groups, the contribution of a
circumstance to the D-Index is estimated as the average addition to the value of the D-Index of that
circumstance over all the possible permutations in which all considered circumstances can be combined.a

Figure 14 presents both the observed coverage rate and the estimated HOI for education-, water-, and
sanitation-related opportunities among Tunisian children. In 2010, educational opportunities such as
attending school and starting school on time are almost universal in Tunisia. Their access rates among
children of the specific age exceed 90 percent. These opportunities, therefore, do not bear much of a
distributional penalty, and the coverage rate and the HOI are very similar. However, completing six years
of education and having access to tap water both have lower coverage than the previous opportunities,
between 70 percent and 80 percent coverage rates, respectively. Unsurprisingly, the access to these
opportunities is not uniformly distributed across different population groups defined by the circumstances
accounted for in table 13. As a result, their HOI is lower than the observed coverage. In fact, in the case
of access to tap water, the gap between coverage and HOI is about 10 percentage points. This gap
constitutes the “penalty” to the observed coverage to tap water access due to the unequal access among
population groups. Finally, the last two opportunities considered, access to sanitation and presence of a
flushing toilet in the household, both have the lowest coverage and the largest inequality of access across
population groups. In other words, not only do fewer Tunisian children have access to such services, but
there are large inequalities in coverage across different population groups. About 53 percent of
households have access to sanitation and 41 percent to flush toiled connected to a piped sewer. As
penalties for inequality among population groups are considered in the HOI measurement, HOI rates
decline to 36 and 26 percent, respectively.

Looking at the changes across time (figure 14), it is clear that most opportunities experienced an
improvement between 2005 and 2010. The share of children finishing six years of education on time
increased from 68 to 74 percent; access to sanitation went from 47 to 54 percent; and the proportion of
children living in dwellings with a flush toilet connected to a piped sewer increased 10 percentage points
to 42 percent in 2010. Unfortunately, the equity among the children with access to these opportunities
improved at much lower rates. The HOI for finishing primary school on time increased a mere 6
percentage points, for sanitation the change was 5, while access to a flush toilet improved by 7 percentage
points. Other opportunities such as attending school, starting school on time, or having water piped to
premises were practically the same between 2005 and 2010, given that they were almost universal
services in 2005.

These results conclude that circumstances do still matter in Tunisia and affect the chances of
children to access key basic services. Unequal opportunities are observed in Tunisia, although to
different extents depending on the opportunity considered. While inequality of opportunities is hardly
present when it comes to attending school or start school on time, it matters for education attainment and
access to water and becomes notorious for sanitation and flush toilets. World Bank (2015e)—not shown
here–confirms this conclusion: gaps between HOI and observed rates persist for education opportunities
that capture quality aspects beyond access—such as children’s proficiency in math and reading measured
by PISA test results.

Tunisia’s record of equal opportunities pre-revolution (2010) is similar to its closest neighbors in the
region. In terms of school attendance, its coverage and HOI is comparable to the Arab Republic of Egypt
(2012) and Palestine (2010), and superior to Jordan (2010), Morocco (2007), and Iraq (2012)—three
countries with lower coverage rates and larger inequality-related penalties than Tunisia (figure 14). When
it comes to water, Tunisia’s unequal opportunities in access are worse than Egypt and Palestine, and only
better than Jordan and Morocco. Moreover, along with Morocco, Tunisia has the largest inequality-based
penalty on water access coverage in the region. This underwhelming opportunity record is also observed
for sanitation—its coverage rate is far from the best in the region (Egypt and Palestine), and the gap
between its observed coverage and HOI is the largest in the region, along with Morocco.

In conclusion, Tunisia’s record of unequal opportunities lags behind the best performers in the Middle
East and North Africa for those key basic services that are far from universally distributed. Interestingly,
compared to other regions in the world, Tunisia’s record of equality of opportunities aligns more closely
with the top Latin American and African performers when it comes to school attendance (whose access is
close to universal). Moreover, Tunisia’s performance is systematically better than most African countries
and comparable with the average Latin American performer, both in terms of access to water and
sanitation (figure 14). Thus, significant improvements in equal opportunities in water and sanitation
opportunities are needed before Tunisia’s record of coverage and equal opportunities in access become
comparable with the best among the developing world.

5.2 What Drives Inequality of Opportunities in Tunisia?


If Tunisians enjoyed equal opportunities, specific circumstances—such as gender, socioeconomic
background, or residence—would not explain any gaps in access to basic services on education, water,
and sanitation. But, as shown above, such circumstances do still matter in Tunisia. Interestingly, the HOI
approach is able to identify the most relevant circumstances explaining access disparities and quantifies
its relative contribution to unequal access (box 6). This section presents both the observed coverage rate
and the estimated HOI for education-, water-, and sanitation-related opportunities among Tunisian
children. In 2010, educational opportunities such as attending school and starting school on time are
almost universal in Tunisia. Their access rates among children of the specific age exceed 90 percent.
These opportunities, therefore, do not bear much of a distributional penalty, and the coverage rate and the
HOI are very similar. However, completing six years of education and having access to tap water both
have lower coverage than the previous opportunities, between 70 percent and 80 percent coverage rates,
respectively. Unsurprisingly, the access to these opportunities is not uniformly distributed across different
population groups defined by the circumstances accounted for in table 13. As a result, their HOI is lower
than the observed coverage. In fact, in the case of access to tap water, the gap between coverage and HOI
is about 10 percentage points. This gap constitutes the “penalty” to the observed coverage to tap water
access due to the unequal access among population groups. Finally, the last two opportunities considered,
access to sanitation and presence of a flushing toilet in the household, both have the lowest coverage and
the largest inequality of access across population groups. In other words, not only do fewer Tunisian
children have access to such services, but there are large inequalities in coverage across different
population groups. About 53 percent of households have access to sanitation and 41 percent to flush
toiled connected to a piped sewer. As penalties for inequality among population groups are considered in
the HOI measurement, HOI rates decline to 36 and 26 percent, respectively.

Looking at the changes across time (figure 14), it is clear that most opportunities experienced an
improvement between 2005 and 2010. The share of children finishing six years of education on time
increased from 68 to 74 percent; access to sanitation went from 47 to 54 percent; and the proportion of
children living in dwellings with a flush toilet connected to a piped sewer increased 10 percentage points
to 42 percent in 2010. Unfortunately, the equity among the children with access to these opportunities
improved at much lower rates. The HOI for finishing primary school on time increased a mere 6
percentage points, for sanitation the change was 5, while access to a flush toilet improved by 7 percentage
points. Other opportunities such as attending school, starting school on time, or having water piped to
premises were practically the same between 2005 and 2010, given that they were almost universal
services in 2005.




Figure 15 presents the relative weight of all the circumstances considered in the analysis of Tunisian
opportunities. Relative weights capturing the contribution of each circumstance to the intergroup
inequality are calculated using a Shapley decomposition methodology for each opportunity analyzed.
Results confirm that, robust to the choice of opportunities analyzed, education of the household head,

urban/rural location and regional residence, and wealth are systematically the most relevant circumstances
to explain unequal opportunities in Tunisia. Combined, they account for between 75 and 90 percent of the
total differences in coverage of multiple opportunities across population groups.

5.3 Inequality of Opportunities and Poverty in Tunisia

Using the information on the most salient circumstances to explain access gaps among Tunisians (for all
the opportunities considered), the entire population is divided into circumstances groups that can be
tracked over time. These groups are used as a pseudo-panel to analyze how opportunities, poverty, and
employment evolved between 2005, 2010, and 2012. Note that it is not manageable to use all 10
circumstances to generate population groups as, even with a conservative use of categories within each
circumstance, more than 26,000 population groups would result from combining each possible category
of each circumstance.39 Furthermore, household wealth was omitted from the initial choice of key

39
  In effect, combining two possible groups for gender (male vs female), two categories for number of children; five
quintiles of wealth; seven regions; three age groups for household head; two categories for elderly presence; whether

                                                               73
circumstances that will define the population groups of this analysis. In effect, adults’ decisions have a
direct bearing on wealth levels, so individuals can be held accountable to some extent for their observed
levels of wealth. Instead, the economic status of the household is approximated by the level of education
of the household head. Circumstances are also based on the gender and age of the household head, the
urban/rural location, and region of residence. By combining the different categories of each selected
circumstance (for example, male and female categories for gender; and Grand Tunis, western, and eastern
Tunisia for regions), some 108 circumstance groups are generated. It is upon these 108 groups that the
joint analysis of opportunities and poverty and then, poverty, opportunities, and labor are conducted.

The incidence of poverty is estimated for each of the 108 groups for 2005, 2010, and 2012 as the share of
individuals in each group that are defined as poor within each year analyzed. Appendix 6 reports the
poverty rates for each of the 108 population groups generated and ranks them accordingly. Figure 16,
however, limits the analysis to the top 10 most disadvantageous population groups and the top 10 most
advantageous groups. The latter are the 10 population groups with a set of circumstances that make them
more prone to poverty among the 108 population groups constructed in Tunisia. For example, the most
disadvantageous group is composed of female individuals, younger than 18 years of age, who belong to
households in rural areas located in western regions and where the household head has at least primary
education. Individuals in this group had, in 2005, an average poverty incidence of 57 percent. The most
advantageous group, in contrast, refers to males over 60 years of age, with at least a secondary education
and residing in Grand Tunis. Their observed poverty incidence was just above 3 percent. A cursory
assessment indicates that most disadvantageous groups are found among young individuals residing in
western regions. In contrast, most advantageous groups are typically found in households where the
household head has secondary or higher education and resides in Grand Tunis.

This evidence suggests that addressing unequal opportunities is a key component in the reduction of
poverty because inequality of opportunities and poverty are closely linked in Tunisia. The 10 most
disadvantageous population groups in Tunisia have a poverty incidence much higher than the country’s
average. For example, households in western regions headed by a young individual (male or female) with
low education (under six years of schooling) are those households simultaneously less likely to access
basic services and more likely to be poor. They had a poverty incidence in excess of 60 percent in 2005,
almost three times higher than the country’s average poverty incidence. But the most disadvantageous
population groups also benefited from the overall decline in poverty observed between 2005 and
2012. Poverty incidence among the 10 most disadvantageous groups declined between 2005 and 2012
(figure 16, upper panel), the only exception being urban households headed by an uneducated female
minor (under age18) in eastern regions. For that group, there is an increase of poverty incidence observed
between 2010 and 2012. A similar message comes out from the same comparison across the most
advantageous population groups. The poverty incidence for each of these groups declined, from already
very low rates well below national poverty rates in 2005. Exceptions are urban households in eastern
regions headed by females over 60 years of age with secondary or higher education attainment (figure 16,
lower panel). This result is consistent with the previous findings—from the analyses of growth
incidence curves, cohorts, and poverty mobility in chapters 2 and 6—of a generalized reduction of
poverty in Tunisia that benefited most population groups and cohorts, including the poorest in the
country.




or not the household head works in the public sector; four categories of education; whether or not both parents are
present and a binary variable for rural location produce 26,880 population groups.

However, even though the most disadvantageous groups have typically reduced their poverty
incidence between 2005 and 2012, their incidence still remains substantially apart from the most
advantageous population groups. In fact this reduction has not been uniform across population groups.
For example, between 2010 and 2012, poverty incidence increased for one of the most disadvantageous
population groups in 2005—urban households headed by young, uneducated females in the eastern
region. 40 Other disadvantaged groups, such as rural households in Western regions headed by individuals
with primary education, experienced only small decreases in poverty incidence between 2010 and 2012,
well below a faster reduction in poverty for that period among other groups.




5.4 Is Labor the Key Factor Behind Unequal Opportunities in Tunisia?

Tunisia exhibits marked socioeconomic differences among key labor variables such as occupation status,
private versus public employment, and sector of employment (chapter 5). For instance, in all 2005, 2010
and 2012, the share of unemployment among the poor is three times higher than the share among the
nonpoor. In contrast, access to a public salaried jobs among the poor is half as likely as among the
nonpoor. Nonpoor workers are about five times more likely to be professionals and mid-level
professionals than poor workers, and half as likely to work in agriculture as the working poor.
Unambiguously, poverty and labor are closely related in Tunisia—as is the case with other
determinants—but does labor status critically affect the country’s unequal opportunities?

Evidence from the decomposition of the impact that circumstances have on unequal access to
opportunities initially points to a limited impact. Section 7.2 concluded that education, gender, age, and
location are the most important drivers of unequal opportunities in Tunisia. In contrast, the variable on the
occupation of the household head did not prove to be significant once other circumstances are taken into
consideration. It is worth noting that circumstances of age, gender, and education also capture experience,
extent of gender discrimination and skills, all key aspects in labor markets. However, once these
dimensions are controlled for, occupation status does not have much of an additional impact on the
inequality of opportunities by itself.

This finding of a limited impact of labor circumstances on opportunities is confirmed by the fact
that changes in occupation status are not much aligned with poverty trends among certain
population groups between 2005 and 2012. Focusing initially on the most disadvantageous population
groups, figure 17 panel a, shows compares the evolution of poverty and key labor conditions across
vulnerability groups. It shows that changes in the poverty incidence observed among those groups do not
closely correlate with changes in their occupational composition: that is, as poverty incidence declines for
those disadvantaged groups, there are no marked reductions in their unemployment rates or substantive
increases in their access to public or private salaried occupations. After their incidence of poverty
declines, they continue to have the largest out of labor force rates and the lowest share of quality jobs—
salaried in the public and private sector—among all the categories considered.


40
  There is another exception (female individuals younger than age 18, living in rural Gran Tunis in low-educated
households). This group shows a sharp decline in poverty incidence. Exploratory analysis showed that this group
contains a mere eight observations, therefore their estimated poverty rate should be taken with caution.

                                                        76
Other population groups show a similar trend of poverty reduction with little improvements in labor
conditions. For example, quality jobs among females do not change much between 2005 and 2012—as
the share of salaried public jobs increased and of salaried private jobs decreased—while unemployment
and out of the labor force appear to increase between those years. Yet, poverty rates among females went
down between both years (figure 17, panel b). The youth and, within those, the skilled youth, saw their
poverty incidence slightly increase between 2010 and 2012. That increase in poverty took place without
any substantive change in their occupation: neither their share of quality jobs nor the shares of
unemployment and out of labor force changed perceptibly between 2010 and 2012 (figure 17, panel c).
By location, the reduction in poverty among urban and rural households took also place without large
changes in occupational status within each area (figure 17, panel d).41

In conclusion, labor—at least occupational status—cannot be credited as being instrumental in explaining
the unequal opportunity trends observed in Tunisia. This confirms previous results on the greater
relevance of education, gender, and location as determinants of unequal access to basic services rather
than labor status. However, aspects of labor conditions other than occupation—say, earnings—and factors
other than circumstances—such as policies—might also contribute to explain the changes behind unequal
opportunities. Unfortunately, the HOI analysis does not provide an appropriate approach for a more
comprehensive analysis (box 7). Expanding the current analysis to include the role of public spending and
key policy decisions such as subsidies and targeting will help better understand poverty and vulnerability.



Box 7. Expanding the Analysis of Equal Opportunities to Labor

It is widely recognized that the concept of labor opportunities is less straightforward than that of opportunities
related to basic services such as education, health, or water and sanitation (World Bank 2015b). First, labor
opportunities need to be assessed among working-age individuals, that is, individuals who make decisions and
choices and decide their effort when it comes to labor outcomes. To a large extent, they are responsible for their
observed labor outcomes. Second, it is not so clear which labor opportunities constitute a desirable universal good:

                                                         78
for example, being employed may not be a desirable opportunity after all if the individual is employed in a
precarious and dangerous job. Also, an individual may prefer an informal job over a formal job because of a
personal preference for flexible labor conditions. Third, some argue that it is not a labor outcome –such as
occupation– but employability, a hard to define and measure attribute, that constitutes a true labor opportunity.
Fourth, in practice it is difficult to separate the role that circumstances may have in today’s labor opportunities
regarding their effect on earlier human capital accumulation, which critically determines today’s labor outcomes.
That is, separating direct and indirect effects of circumstances becomes a very complex exercise.

For these reasons, the analysis of equal opportunities on labor is still being developed. Current analyses measuring
an HOI for labor (Abras et al. 2012; World Bank 2015f) acknowledge these difficulties and provide a first set of
results that they characterize as tentative and preliminary. In the case of Tunisia, World Bank (2015d) uses a youth
employment survey from 2012, designed and collected by the World Bank, to analyze the role of gender, father’s
and mother’s education, region of birth (considered to be circumstances), and age and education of individuals
(considered to be characteristics capturing individuals’ experience and skills) to explain unequal access to several
labor opportunities: being employed; employed full time; employed at least 20 hours a week; having a contract job;
and having a public sector job.

Results reported by the World Bank (2015f) show that none of these labor opportunities are equally distributed
among population groups in Tunisia. As the opportunity refers to a more desirable job —full time, contract, public
sector—its coverage expectedly decreases. Interestingly, the penalty, however, remains quite similar across
opportunities in Tunisia (figure A) and does not seem to widen with quality of jobs. When accounting for the
individual effects that circumstances and characteristics have on this estimated inequality to access labor
opportunities, circumstances jointly explain the largest share (between 55 percent and 90 percent) of all access
inequality, depending on the opportunity analyzed. But as jobs become more desirable, the role of education and age
gain significance (figure B).

Chapter 6: Can Energy Subsidy Reform Improve Poverty and Inequality in Tunisia?
6.1 Energy Subsidies in Tunisia

6.1.1 Role of Energy Subsides in Development Strategy

Subsidies represented 7 percent of Tunisian GDP in 2013, the latest available estimate (figure 18). Public
spending on subsidies exceeds that of social assistance, employment, health, education, and individual
programs for youth, children, or women (World Bank 2013b). Total spending on subsidies increased
during the revolution, and recently reached one-fifth of all public spending. In the case of energy
subsidies, spending also substantially increased post-revolution, totaling two-thirds of all subsidies in
2013, up from one-third in 2010. This evidence confirms that generalized price subsidies constitute a
deliberate cornerstone of social protection in Tunisia, a strategy initiated in the 1970s and that has
remained in place (box 8). Advocates justify universal and general subsidies because of: the large size of
the informal sector—whose competitiveness and survival is de facto protected by subsidies providing
them with cheap energy sources; high levels of poverty in the past; and lack of information systems and
registries to identify and target the poor. Furthermore, lack of political legitimacy of the previous
authoritarian regime and the sensitive welfare implications of any subsidy reform—which inevitably
generates winners and losers—have prevented for decades the decisive overhaul of subsidies in Tunisia.

It has been widely recognized—including by the transition government (Government of Tunisia 2014)—
that current subsidies fail to protect the poor. It is estimated that the bottom 40 percent of the distribution
captures only 29 percent and 34 percent of energy and food subsidies, respectively (World Bank 2014b).
Past attempts to reform energy subsidies have also contributed to social tensions (box 8) and have
generated concerns in terms of governance and transparency. For example, Tunisia lacks precise
estimates of total subsidies for oil and natural gas generated by the national oil company selling imported
crude oil and natural gas at a fraction of international prices to state-owned companies (IMF 2014a).
Furthermore, subsidies typically introduce a whole series of economic distortions from relative price
distortions; overconsumption and underinvestment in subsidized sectors; adverse effects on health and the
environment; the crowding out of more productive investments; delays in economic diversification;

                                                                 81
weaker current accounts; and increasing budget deficits (IMF 2014b; Cuesta et al. 2015). These fiscal,
equity, social, and transparency concerns have prompted the government of Tunisia to consider changes
in its subsidy policy, particularly for energy. Such a reform, however, constitutes a difficult balance
between a decisive energy subsidy overhaul that reduces distortions and an intervention that does not
increase inequality and social tensions.

Box 8. Evolution of Energy Subsidies in Tunisia

Tunisia has a long tradition of generous energy and food subsidies. Subsidies deliberately became the backbone of
the new social protection strategies of the 1970s. In the early 1980s, however, Tunisia went through a painful
experience reforming its food subsidies. In 1983, food subsidies reached 3 percent of GDP, but included significant
leaks to the nonpoor. Overnight, the government announced the doubling of prices of cereals and their products,
including bread, semolina, pasta, and couscous (IMF 2014b). The hasty decision took the public by surprise, and
after a month of widespread protests, the reform was abandoned. Later, during the Ali regime, the government did
not attempt any in-depth reform of the subsidy systems in place, managing instead to maintain the generous system
throughout both difficult and prosperous times. During 1991 –93, however, the government launched a gradual
reform on food subsidies, favoring foods largely consumed by the poor —such as lower-quality bread—and phasing
out subsidies on foods consumed by the rich. A well-timed awareness campaign coupled with increases in minimum
wages and strengthening of other social protection programs helped simultaneously improve the targeting and fiscal
burden of food subsidies. During the final years of the Ali regime and the recent post-revolution period, the
spending and composition of Tunisia’s subsidies have notably changed. During the last 10 years, the combined
spending on energy, food, and transportation subsidies has more than tripled, rising from 2 percent of GDP in 2005
to 7 percent in 2013. Energy subsidies, in particular, increased fourfold during that period. Energy subsidies reached
4.7 percent of GDP in 2013, with sustained increases since 2010, reflecting the partial (rather than the full) pass-
through of international oil prices to domestic prices sought by the government (ibid).

Post-revolution, the prices of gasoline, diesel, and electricity increased by 7 percent in September 2012, followed by
similar increases in March 2013. Energy subsidies to cement companies were halved in January 2014 and fully
removed in June 2014. Electricity tariffs on low- and medium-voltage consumers were increased in a two-step
process, by 10 percent in January 2014 and another 10 percent in May 2014. The government introduced a lifeline
electricity tariff for households consuming less than 50 kilowatt hours (kWh) per month in 2014. Also in January
2014, the government established a new automatic price formula for gasoline to align domestic price convergence to
international prices over time, but without a smoothing mechanism or a clear calendar. In parallel, the government
launched a new social housing program, increased income tax deductions for the poorest households, and committed
to creating a unified registry of beneficiaries of social programs and improvement of social spending targeting (to be
finished in 2015). In addition, plans are also in the works to expand the current cash transfer program (PNAFN) to
250,000 beneficiaries and to reduce its exclusion errors.

6.1.2 Residential Energy Consumption and Expenditures in Tunisia

This analysis focuses on residential energy subsidies; that is, subsidies on electricity, gasoline, liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG), and diesel. They constitute the lion’s share of the total consumer subsidies funded
by government and about 45 percent of the total energy consumption among Tunisian households.42 The
current structure was introduced in May 2014 and continues to be in effect at the time of this writing.
Reported estimates draw from the distribution of consumption and spending reported in the 2010
ENBCV, the most recent survey detailing households’ expenditures. The 2010 structures of consumption
and spending are then updated to May 2014 using growth rates, population growth, and official CPI rates.

42
  Specifically, solid biofuels constitute the main source of energy expenditure among households (42 percent), followed by LPG
(18 percent), electricity (15 percent), and natural gas (10 percent). Diesels and gasoline are very low sources of energy
expenditures, according to World Bank (2013b).

                                                             82
It is on those updated distributions that simulations of the impacts of a hypothetical reform in 2014 are
conducted. Therefore, the analysis assumes that consumption patterns and their drivers, such as
preferences, in 2010 are a good proxy for 2014 consumption patterns. Finally, poverty status is defined in
this exercise around the official poverty lines established by INS, ADB, and World Bank (2012) as the
monetized cost of a food basket that ensures minimum caloric needs, further adjusted by nonfood needs,
and updated annually according to observed CPI trends. A simulation package, SUSBIM, developed by
Araar and Verme (2012) produces all consumption and expenditure trends and analyzes alternative price
scenarios.

The current price structure for residential electricity consumption is progressive, but hardly pro-
poor. Tariffs follow a two-tier system (table 12)43 that differentiates households consuming less than 200
kWh per month from those with higher volumes. For low-volume consumers, a volume-differentiated
tariff is applied to three consumption blocks. In contrast, households consuming more than 200 kWh per
month are subject to an increasing block tariff that includes multiple prices across different blocks of
consumption (table 12). This tariff structure is progressive in that those consuming more pay higher
marginal costs per kilowatt hour consumed. In effect, both low-volume and high-volume consumers face
an increasing marginal cost from usage. In addition, high-volume consumers pay more than low-volume
users for the first 200 kWh and face increasing fees as their consumption rises.44 However, the tariff
system falls short of benefiting the poorer population. The concentration of poor consumers on the
lifeline block—low-volume consumers in 1–50 kWh tier—is only 48 percent (table 13), despite being
deliberately aimed at the most disadvantaged consumers. Expectedly, households from the poorest
quintile only represent a minimal proportion of consumers in the higher-volume tier (between 3 and 6
percent of tier 2 consumers).

The prices of energy sources other than electricity are not subject to differentiated price segments
and they are neither progressive nor pro-poor. The prices of gasoline, LPG, and diesel do not vary
across consumption levels. The market price of gasoline is TD 1.67 per liter; the price of 0.2 diesel
(containing 0.2 percent of sulfur) is TD 1.25 per liter; and a 13 kilogram cylinder of LPG costs TD 7.4 (or
TD 0.57 per kg). The price structure of these sources is not progressive because prices do not increase as
consumption increases. Besides, in absolute terms, high-volume consumers benefit from a higher public
subsidy, making those subsidies not pro-poor.




43
   Three prices apply for low-usage consumers: TD 0.075 per kWh, if consumption is 1 –50 kWh; TD 0.108 per kWh (applied for all kWh
consumed) if consumption is 51–100 kWh; and TD 0.140 per kWh if consumption is 101–200 kWh (also from the first kWh consumed). For
high-volume consumers, TD 0.151 per kWh is charged for each of the initial 200 kWh consumed; TD 0.158 for each of the subsequent kWh in
the 201 and 300 kWh block; TD 0.301 for the next 200 kWh block; and, finally, TD 0.501 per kWh for each of those in excess of 500 kWh per
month. A different structure—of which analysis is beyond the scope of this chapter—is applied to nonresidential users (which also differentiates
between low and high tension use).
44
   However, the pace at which marginal tariffs increase is not linear, which implies that the degree of progressivity declines as consumption
increases among nonpoor households. When looking at the 50 kWh increments in consumption, moving from a consumption level of 50 kWh to
100 kWh, the price of the second 50 kWh is 44 percent higher than for the first tranche (from 75 to 108 millimes TD) among low-volume
consumers. For those consumers moving toward the highest block of the second tier, that is, moving from 301–500 kWh to the 501 plus kWh
block, the residential tariff increase is 25 percent or 70 millimes TD. In short, nonlinear features (in terms of marginal prices per additional
consumption) are combined across different segments of the two-tier system, making the system far from progressive in its entirety.

The structure of prices and consumption patterns across socioeconomic groups reviewed above both lead
to substantive inequalities in the per capita consumption and expenditures on energy among Tunisian
households (see appendix 7). In effect, the average consumer in top consumption quintiles, that is, the
richest quintiles, consume much more energy than the poorest quintiles. The largest consumption
differences are observed for gasoline, followed by diesel (table 14, panel a). On average, an individual
from quintile 5 consumes 200 times more gasoline than someone from the poorest quintile! That ratio is
still a whopping 38 to 1 in the case of diesel. Much narrower differences are observed for electricity and
LPG: a richer individual consumes 4.5 times more electricity and 1.4 times more LPG than an individual
from the poorest household.

Large differences also become evident when spending is compared across quintiles of the consumption
distribution. Households in the richest quintile spend more than six times the amount spent on energy on
residential energy by the average household in the poorest quintile (in per capita terms, table 14, panel b).
For gasoline and diesel, socioeconomic differences in terms of per capita spending are striking. For LPG
and electricity, differences are less acute.

Appendix 7 reports that that the expenditure of energy represents between 5 and 6 percent of households’
total spending, regardless of the socioeconomic status of the household. In other words, energy spending
as share of household total spending is similar across socioeconomic groups, without marked differences
across quintiles.


6.1.3 Quantifying Energy Subsidies in Tunisia

As indicated above, energy subsidies represent a substantive share of the national budget and the entire
Tunisian economy.45 However, official estimates on subsidies refer only to the actual budgetary costs
publicly spent on energy subsidies; implicit sources of subsidies are not accounted for. This is the case,
for example, of the generalized practice of the national oil company selling imported crude oil and natural
gas at a fraction of international prices to state-owned companies. In the absence of official estimates,
World Bank (2013a) suggests that these practices may have exceeded 2 percentage points of GDP in
2012. To account for both explicit and implicit subsidies, the current analysis recalculates energy subsides
based on the observed final—market—prices, price structures, international prices (of imported sources),
and local production costs. Box 9 summarizes the methodology used to recalculate subsidized price
shares. Based on these estimates, it is possible to estimate the distribution of monetized benefits accruing
from subsidies across quintiles of households (table 17).

45
  Most energy sources are publicly subsidized in Tunisia, but to different extents. Exemptions are other forms of energy
commonly utilized by households, such as charcoal, natural gas or solid biofuels, which are not subsidized.




                                                               85
Box 9. Estimating Shares of Subsidized Prices

For energy products consumed by the household, namely electricity, LPG, gasoline and diesel, a subsidy level S for
each product is estimated using the price gap approach. According to this approach, a first price is calculated by
adding to the international reference price, IP, all local taxes and domestic distribution costs. The resulting price is
assumed to reflect the cost of efficient market supply, given the conditions and regulations of a given country and
international prices. This price is called the “nonsubsidized price” (NP). Subsidies (S) are calculated as the
difference between the estimated NP and the observed domestic sale price, or market price (DP): Si = NPi —DPi,
where i refers to each energy source for residential consumption. The subsidy rate SRi for source i is the ratio of Si to
NPi. In the case of Tunisia, domestic prices used in this analysis are from the Ministry of Finance, and the IPs were
obtained from the Ministry of Industries (Direction Générale de l'Énergie) for electricity, LPG, gasoline, and diesel.

Table A presents the rate of subsidized energy prices with respect to the observed market prices since May 2014.
The rate of subsidized LPG prices is estimated at 68 percent of the nonsubsidized price. In other words, for every
liter of LPG consumed at a final price of TD 0.570, some TD 1.220 have been subsidized from the estimated price
of TD 1.790 (reflecting international reference prices). Likewise, a similar calculation shows shares of subsidized
prices of 10 percent for gasoline and 21 percent for diesel. In the case of electricity, the subsidized rates for each
block decrease with consumption. This is the case for the two-volume tiers. In fact, the two top consumption blocks
of the high-volume tier—consumers of more than 300 kWh per month—receive negative subsidies. That is, they are
net contributors to the subsidies of consumers of lower-volume consumption. Consumers from the two levels of
highest consumption end up paying a higher price than the international reference price plus taxes and distribution
costs.

Table A. Estimated Subsidy Rates for Energy Sources in Tunisia (valid May 2014)




In fiscal terms, estimated LPG subsidies amounted to TD 749 million, 15 percent of all energy subsidies publicly
transferred and 1 percent of GDP in 2013. Diesels have subsidies between 16 and 26 percent of final prices
(depending on type of diesel), which represent 1.5 percent of GDP, 23 percent of energy subsidies, and TD 1,146
million in 2013. The energy source most highly subsidized in terms of public spending was electricity, with 3.4
percent of GDP, 51 percent of all energy subsidies, and more than TD 2.5 billion a year (in 2013). Its subsidized
price share oscillated between 27 and 50 percent. The remaining 12 percent of energy subsidies were distributed
among gasoline, kerosene, and heavy fuel.

Energy subsidies accruing to households are mainly for LPG and electricity. Together they account
for more than 93 percent of all residential energy subsidies: 53.3 percent and 40.4 percent of total
subsidies among all Tunisian households consist, respectively, of LPG and electricity subsidies. For the
poorest quintile of households, these shares slightly increase to 54.5 percent and 42.2 percent,
respectively (table 13, column a). For the rest of the quintiles, second to fifth, subsidies from LPG and
electricity also capture the lion’s share of total energy subsidy benefits across each quintile. When all
energy subsidies are considered together, evidence suggests that they favor the rich to the detriment of the
poorest quintiles. In fact, the poorest quintile captured the lowest share of all benefits associated with
energy subsidies, 14.9 percent, and the richest quintile captured 25 percent (table 15, column b). Energy
subsidies are clearly not pro-poor in Tunisia.

When benefits are analyzed in monetized terms, all energy subsidies are found to be regressive. The
absolute amount of (per capita) subsidy benefits increases as individuals and households become
richer (table 16). This regressivity is more marked for gasoline and diesel subsidies, where the average
benefit of an individual in the richest quintile exceeds 202 and 38 times the monetized benefit of gasoline
and diesel subsidies, respectively. LPG and electricity also exhibit regressive benefits from their
subsidies, but not as significantly.

Inequalities in the distribution of subsidy benefits reflect inequalities in the consumption of energy
sources across quintiles and do not seem to accrue from the universal versus targeted nature of
subsidies. Even though gasoline, diesel, and LPG subsidies are all universal, their distributional patterns
vary. In contrast, electricity subsidies, with their complex interplay of progressive and regressive features,
do not perform differently from the universal LPG subsidy.

Benefits from energy subsidies represent a significant share of total household spending, ranging
from 8.8 percent of total household expenditures for the poorest quintile to 2.4 percent for the richest
quintile household expenditures (table 17). Consistent with previous results, LPG and electricity subsidies
constitute the largest share of household expenditures, while gasoline and diesel do not represent any
substantive share of total spending. For all households, these two sources of subsidies represent about 0.3
percent of total household spending, a small share of the 3.9 percent total household expenditures
transferred from energy subsidies.

All in all, the energy price structure results in a regressive and pro-rich transfer system that
produces a huge fiscal bill. Distributive patterns across energy sources are heterogeneous, with LPG and
electricity providing the largest share and amounts of subsidies among the poor (and among the nonpoor)
consumers. This is not different from other subsidies in Tunisia (box 10) and has to do with the price and
subsidy structure, on the one hand, and differences in the consumption patterns across socioeconomic
groups, on the other. Whether the subsidy is universal or targeted does not make much of a distributional
difference in the current Tunisian context.



Box 10. Are Other Public Benefits Pro-Rich and Regressive in Tunisia?

World Bank (2013a) details the average food subsidy benefits across socioeconomic groups in Tunisia. Figure A
shows that those subsidies are regressive as the average subsidy increases across households with higher
consumption levels. A foodstuff-specific analysis suggests that subsidies to cereals mostly determine the regressivity
of aggregate food subsidies, because subsidies for sugar and vegetal oil follow a uniform pattern. Not shown here,
but reported by World Bank (2013b, 12), food subsidies are not pro-poor either: the poorest consumption quintile
benefits from 15 percent of total food subsidies, while 25 percent of such subsidy benefits accrue to the richest
quintile.

Conclusions change when the distribution of implict benefits to households with children attending public education
is added to the analysis. The implicit benefit is that obtained by any child attending primary school for a service that
receives mainly for free. This benefit is then netted out from the costs incurred by the household to send the child to
school (fees, transportation, materials, uniforms). Substracting the costs reported directly by households on
education to the estimated average cost of provision to the state to provide preschool, primary, and secondary
education per governorate, figures B and C show that these implicit benefits are progressive. In effect, the average
benefit provided by the state decreases along with the socioeconomic level of the household to which the child
belong (gross benefit in figures B and C). Also, the average cost of each family to send their children to school
increases along with the socioeconomic level of the household (household expenditure in figures B and C). As a
result, the net benefit also decreases alongside socioeconomic levels, making public spending on education
progressive.

6.2 Simulating the Distributional Impacts of a Subsidy-Reducing Reform

6.2.1 Simulation Methodology

Although the Tunisian authorities have recently announced their intention to reform energy subsidies,
policy is still in the planning stages and final details remained unknown at the time of this writing. The
limited existing information, however, points to a complete elimination of LPG, diesel, and gasoline
subsidies; a uniform 10 percent increase in the price of electricity; and the introduction of compensation
mechanisms to residential consumers (Jomaa 2014). The present analysis first simulates the impact of the
increase in energy prices that would follow a reform of energy subsidies along the general lines just
described (box 11 details the methodology used for that simulation). In a second stage, the analysis
constructs several scenarios that simulate the additional poverty and inequality impacts of increasingly
effective targeting mechanisms accompanying the subsidy reform. Those targeting mechanisms make use
of the total fiscal savings freed from the reform in energy subsidies to compensate consumers. In other
words, the analyzed simulations of compensatory initiatives postreform are all fiscally neutral. They are
bold and ambitious in that they assume that all fiscal savings from the energy reform would be fully
destined to poverty reduction. The scenarios are also ideal in that they assume no additional
administrative costs. Still, they are useful to assess the distributive limits that compensation measures will
have after energy subsidies are reformed.

6.2.2 Consumption, Expenditure, and Poverty Impacts of Uncompensated Energy Subsidy Reforms

Table 18 presents the monetary impact of price increases resulting from the removal of subsidies for
gasoline, LPG and diesel, and the partial reduction in electricity subsidies. Final results from this
simulation are disaggregated between direct and indirect effects in appendix 8. The average total impact
of this set of interventions is a reduction in the transferred benefit from subsides equivalent to TD 109 per
capita per year. The largest effect on consumption comes from the removal of LPG subsidies, followed by
diesel, electricity, and gasoline. In effect, about 62 percent of all the reduction in consumption comes
from the elimination of LPG subsidies. By type of effects, direct effects represent two-thirds of the total
aggregated effect, and indirect effects the remaining one-third. However, the relative weight of direct and
indirect effects are not uniform across energy sources.46


Box 11. Distributive Simulations of Energy Subsidy Reforms

Given the preliminary stage of the policy discussion, simulations consider two broad effects. One is the
direct effect of price increases following the partial or full removal of subsidies. Direct effects have
unequivocal impacts on individual and household budgets proportional to the increase in prices of energy
sources. No immediate changes in consumption are assumed, which is consistent with limited
substitutability among energy sources in the short run (due to both technical and financial reasons and,
presumably, individual preferences). So, immediately after the reform is introduced, everyone consumes
the same, but at higher prices. This result implies that individuals and households have fewer resources to
purchase other goods and services. Changes in prices are equivalent to a proportional increase in the

46
   Among direct effects (appendix 6, panel b), it is the effect of LPG that once again has the largest impact on
household consumption (four-fifths of all direct effects), followed by electricity, gasoline, and diesel. In contrast, it
is the removal of diesel subsidies that has the largest indirect effect on consumption (43 percent of total indirect
effects), followed by LPG, electricity, and gasoline (appendix 8, panel c).


                                                            90
poverty line faced by the household (weighted by its relative composition in the basic consumption
basket). The second effect considered is the indirect impact, and it relates to changes on prices of goods
and services that result from energy price changes. The indirect effect captures the change in relative
prices for the rest of the economy and, consequently, on the prices of the other components of the
consumption basket. Price changes across sectors are estimated by applying the price changes of energy
to final products that use energy as an intermediary input. Using the 2010 input/output (I/O) table for
Tunisia, constructed by the INS, a simple approximation of such economywide changes following energy
price subsidies can be calculated.

The analysis draws from the distribution of consumption and spending reported in the 2010 ENBCV—
the most recent survey. The 2010 structures of consumption and spending are then updated to January
2014 using growth rates, population growth, and official CPI rates. Poverty status is defined in this
exercise around the official poverty lines established by INS, ADB, and World Bank (2012) as the
monetized cost of a food basket that ensures minimum caloric needs, further adjusted by nonfood needs.

Among quintiles, the total impact of the reform increases among richer households. Thus richer
households would stop receiving larger energy subsidy benefits following their reform. Thus, in
absolute terms, the reform is progressive. The largest differences of foregone benefits across quintiles
are observed for gasoline. The differences are less marked for diesel and electricity and relatively close
for LPG. The increasing impact on consumption among richer quintiles is also observed for both direct
and indirect effects.

In relative terms, the impact of the reforms averages 4.7 percent of households’ expenditures (figure 19).
The magnitude of the impact decreases with household expenditure levels, so in relative terms the
reform is regressive. It regressively declines from 6.7 percent of the poorest households’ expenditures to
3.1 percent of the richest households’ expenditures. Similar to the case in absolute terms (that is, in TD
terms), it is the LPG subsidy reform that brings the largest relative impact on households’ expenditures:
some 3.2 percent of all households’ expenditures (and more than 5 percent of the poorest quintile
households’ expenditures).

The reduction in benefits that households receive after the reform would lead to a 2.69 percentage point
increase in the incidence of poverty in Tunisia, which represents an increase of 17 percent with respect to
the prereform baseline poverty incidence (table 19). Table 19 also shows a Gini coefficient increase of
0.61 percentage points, or a 1.7 percent increase in the prereform levels of inequality. A large portion of
those changes in poverty result from direct effects, both in poverty and in inequality, and LPG is the
largest contributor to poverty and inequality deterioration.

Note: The reason the prereform poverty and inequality rates are not the official rates for 2010 is that prices have all been updated
for this specific exercise to 2013 prices using growth rates and population growth rates. The poverty line has also been updated
using CPI trends. Therefore, the starting point of this exercise is a poverty rate of 14.9 in 2013 rather than the 15.4 percent
official estimate obtained in the 2010 original household budgetary survey. This adjustment enables comparisons across other
countries. However, the rest of the simulation exercise will be conducted using the 2010 household budgetary survey. A
subsample of the 2010 survey is used, and not the full sample of the original survey. In effect, it is a subsample of the original
sample that is used to capture beneficiaries of the subsidized universal health care card. Even after reweighting the subsample,
the exact official poverty number of 15.4 percent could not be fully replicated, only a slim margin (15.3 percent). Similarly, the
estimated prereform Gini of 36.5 percent differs slightly from the official 35.8 percent from the full sample.

6.2.3 Subsidy Reforms with Compensating Transfers

The reduction of energy subsidies are estimated to generate some TD 817.5 million in fiscal savings
(table 20). Fiscal savings accrue disproportionally from the removal of subsidies in LPG (77 percent of all
fiscal savings) and electricity (13 percent). Furthermore, savings accruing from the removal of subsidies
affecting the poorest quintile represent some 13 percent of all fiscal savings, a share that increases across
quintiles. Thus, savings accruing from benefits removed from the richest group represent 28 percent of
the total savings. These shares are very similar to the proportions of benefits from subsidies that each
socioeconomic group captured prior to the reform (table 15). This is unsurprising since these simulations
do not introduce behavioral effects (only direct and indirect effects are allowed). Consequently, fiscal
savings from the elimination of subsidies for the most part reflect the initial socioeconomic distribution of
subsidies.

A final step in the simulation exercise includes assessing the poverty and distributional effects of
disbursing the total savings from the energy subsidy reform for poverty-reducing purposes. Once again,
there is no clear guidance from the government of Tunisia on how these compensation programs will be
implemented. For that reason, this analysis considers three hypothetical scenarios. Simulation 1 uses total
savings to provide a universal transfer to each Tunisian. This scenario is called “universal transfer”
because it includes a transfer to every Tunisian without discrimination. Simulation 2, or “current
targeting,” uses the current social assistance program, the subsidized health cards, as the targeting
mechanism. This label does not intend to judge the current capacity of subsidized cards to reach the
poorest. Instead, it simply indicates that no additional targeting efforts take place and authorities use
existing structures to channel all the savings accruing from energy subsidy reforms. Finally, in
simulation 3, “perfect targeting,” all the savings are distributed exactly to those who are poor after the
reform. This is an idealistic scenario that describes a situation in which all the poor after the reform are
perfectly identified and compensated on a per capita basis. It also assumes perfect and costless targeting;
in other words, no additional resources are needed to identify the poor and distribute cash benefits to
them. Although these three scenarios vary in terms of implementation feasibility, they are still useful in a
context where no detailed plans are known. In effect, these results provide information on the boundaries
of the distributional effects of the reform, from no compensation following the reform to the complete use
of fiscal savings from the energy subsidy reform to reduce poverty under perfect targeting. The true
impact of the reform and of feasible compensation policies will lie somewhere in between. Table 23
summarizes the simulations’ results.

These simulations suggest that the complete use of fiscal savings from the energy reform would not
reduce post reform poverty levels by any significant amount with the current targeting mechanism
or via an universal transfer to the entire population (simulations 2 and 1 in table 21, respectively).The
fiscal savings accruing from a universal transfer reform (simulation 2) would bring down postreform
poverty levels by 2.5 percentage points—or some 272,000 persons. Using the current health card
targeting mechanism (simulation 1) would reduce postreform poverty by an additional percentage point,
to 13.83 percent of the population. A perfect and costless targeting of fiscal savings (simulation 3) would
lead to a postreform poverty incidence reduction of 12.5 percentage points, up to 5.25 percent of the
population. Despite the slash in poverty incidence, the fiscal resources freed from the current level of
energy subsidies would not be sufficient to completely eradicate poverty in Tunisia. Neither would it be
sufficient to make a notable dent on consumption inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient. The
three compensation initiatives would fully reverse the initial increase in inequality following the subsidy
reforms, but the reduction in inequality would by no means be large. The best results, accruing from the
perfect targeting scenario, indicate gains of 3 percentage points in the Gini coefficient, with respect to the
postreform Gini. In relative terms, the compensation mechanisms simulated after the reform would
improve inequality by less than 10 percent.

In conclusion, results from simulations underscore two critical results. First, raising electricity prices to
consumers and removing subsidies for other energy sources would immediately—that is, without
behavioral responses from users—increase poverty by 2.5 percentage points. Second, “easy”
compensation mechanisms— that is, either universal or using current structures—will not bring
substantial poverty reductions, even if the government channels the entire TD 817.5 million estimated to
be saved from the subsidy reform toward poverty reduction. Perfect and costless targeting would slash
poverty incidence down to 5 percentage points; yet while this ideal scenario would imply a substantial
reduction in poverty, it would still fall short of eradicating poverty, and inequalities would be reduced in
even more modest terms. Tunisia is still far from having such an ideal targeting system with
comprehensive and updated lists of beneficiaries and minimal transaction costs. In addition, it should not
be expected that all fiscal savings from the energy subsidy be invested back into poverty reduction. What
becomes clear from these proposed simulations is that bold reforms of energy subsidies need to be
accompanied by equally bold improvements to the targeting schemes of public spending if both poverty
and disparities are to be substantively reduced.

Chapter 7: How Can Multidimensional Poverty Be Improved: The case of Child
Malnutrition?

7.1 Linking Multiple Public Interventions to Nonmonetary Welfare in Tunisia

The analysis of energy subsidy reform in the previous chapter suggests that Tunisia still has ample room
for better integrating its public policies aimed at reducing poverty, disparities, and vulnerabilities. An
overhaul of the energy subsidies in Tunisia will have significant poverty and distributional effects unless
substantial improvements in social protection are synchronized to the subsidy reform. But this analysis on
energy subsidies focuses on the role of public policy interventions on monetary poverty and disparities
and does not connect policy making with nonmonetary dimensions of welfare. To fill that gap, this
section explicitly analyzes public interventions from a nonmonetary welfare perspective while also
underscoring the need for further integration among multisectoral interventions. Ultimately, this analysis
addresses the fundamental question of how can public interventions be better integrated to reduce poverty
and vulnerability in Tunisia.

For this analysis, child malnutrition was selected as the nonmonetary dimension of welfare (box 12). This
is an interesting dimension to analyze for several reasons. Tunisia has already achieved its hunger-related
MDG and it is a good performer in terms of child nutrition among its regional neighbors. Yet, progress
has not been steady over time, and socioeconomic differentials still persist within the country (box 12).
More generally—that is, not specific to Tunisia—child malnutrition has long-term welfare consequences
in terms of impaired cognitive ability and reduced school and work performance (Haas et al. 1996;
Glewwe, Jacoby, and King 2001; Hoddinot and Kinsey 2001; Maccini and Yang 2009). It has been long
known that the determinants of nutrition are multisectoral and therefore the solution to malnutrition
requires multisectoral approaches (UNICEF 1990). Strong synergies among multiple determinants need to
happen before real progress in nutritional status takes place, especially for those first, critical 1,000 days
in the life of a child. In other words, concrete improvements in malnutrition are typically the result of
integrated policies that include nutrition interventions—such as fortification of foods, promoting
breastfeeding, treating malnourished children with therapeutic foods—as well as interventions from other
sectors, such as childcare programs for working mothers, improvements in agriculture productivity; and
the strengthening of safety nets and more (SUN 2012).

Box 12. Child Nutrition in Tunisia

With prevalence levels around 1 percent, Tunisia has long achieved MDG Target 1C to halve, between 1990–92 and
2015, the proportion of people suffering from undernourishment —that is, inability to meet a minimum level of
dietary energy consumption—or reduce this proportion below 5 percent (FAO 2015).

Most recent statistics specific to children nutritional status report a 7 percent incidence of low birth weight; 2
percent of moderate and severe underweight; 10 percent moderate and severe stunting; and 3 percent moderate and
severe wasting for 2008–12 (UNICEF 2014).a These numbers suggest that Tunisian children’s nutritional status is
better than the average for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, which averages 7 percent, 18 percent
and 8 percent, respectively, for moderate and severe underweight, stunting, and wasting. Tunisia’s record for these
three indicators is comparable with Morocco, Jordan, Algeria, and Palestine’s records for 2008–12, and markedly
more favorable than the region’s worst performers, Djibouti and the Republic of Yemen.

Practices including introduction of breastfeeding and semisolid and soft foods as well as consumption of iodized salt
all place Tunisia among the best performers in the MENA region —for countries for which information is available.
Other nutritional indicators, however, such as moderate and severe overweight or prevalence of anemia among
women at reproductive age are not so favorable and remain short of international targets (the Global World Health
Assembly targets, as reported in IFPRI 2014). Also, important determinants of child nutrition such as water and


                                                         95
sanitation suggest high levels of access. However, when quality aspects are taken into consideration, such as non-
shared toilets and safe disposal of child feces, very few Tunisian households have adequate access to water and
sanitation (less than 2 percent, see appendix 9). This lack of adequate access should be expected to affect the
nutritional status of Tunisians in some or another way.

Importantly, improvements in stunting among Tunisian children have proven not to be steady and sustained over
time, as indicated in figure A. In addition, socioeconomic differences among children prevail in terms of their
nutritional status, as clearly suggested by height-for-age outcomes by socioeconomic status (table A). Consequently,
notwithstanding its achievements, Tunisia still has work ahead to eradicate child malnutrition.

a. Low birth weight is defined as the percentage of infants weighing less than 2,500 grams at birth. Moderate and severe
underweight is the percentage of children aged 0–59 months who are below -2 standard deviations (SD) and below -3 SD from
median weight for age of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Child Growth Standards. Moderate and severe stunting
captures the percentage of children aged 0–59 months who are below -2 SD from median height for age of the WHO Child
Growth Standards. Moderate and severe wasting is the percentage of children aged 0 –59 months who are below -2 SD from
median weight-for-height of the WHO Child Growth Standards.



Conceptually, the analytical framework in this section follows UNICEF’s integrated approach to food
security and nutrition. UNICEF’s framework—and a recent extension by Skoufias et al. (forthcoming)—
emphasizes the role that food security, environmental health, water and sanitation, and child care
practices play in food insecurity—approximated in this study by stunting rates among children in
developing countries (figure 20).47 This framework suggests that increases in access to only one of these

47
  Food security measures the availability and consumption of various food. Environmental health measures the child’s
susceptibility to diseases due to lack of improved infrastructure (such as sanitation and drinking water) or lack of preventive
health measures taken. Care measures the quality of care provided by the caretaker based on feeding and hygiene practices
adopted and by the availability of the caretaker. Furthermore, this measure includes how well caretakers are supported in their
child-rearing endeavors.

                                                                 96
factors cannot substitute for inadequate levels of other factors. Thus, for example, policies than improve
food security alone cannot resolve the issue of malnutrition if the community does not have appropriate
levels of safe water and sanitation or prenatal health services.

Another important contribution of the UNICEF framework is the notion of adequate access to basic
services that introduces a quality dimension that goes beyond merely access to a service. For example,
food adequacy implies more than access to sufficient food to cover minimum caloric requirements, but
also requires access to a balanced, diverse, and affordable diet. Similarly, adequate water access goes
beyond accessing a source of safe water—it implies a continuous, predictable, and affordable supply of
water. In practice, however, there is a gap between ideal or desired definitions of adequacy and practical
definitions of adequacy feasible from available data. Table 22 compares ideal definitions of adequacy for
all of the dimensions considered in UNICEF’s framework with information available in the Tunisian
2011–12 MICS.

This comparison highlights serious data limitations preventing a comprehensive definition of adequacy
across food security dimensions in Tunisia. Yet, it is still possible to capture adequacy with available

                                                              98
information to some or other extent. In fact, the extent to which the definition of adequacy captures all the
ideal aspects of each policy dimension differs by dimension. Thus, a relatively restrictive definition of
adequate access for care and environmental health contrasts with more inclusive definitions for food,
water and sanitation. For example, in the case of sanitation, the definition of adequacy can be adjusted to
account for several criteria, following the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme recommendation
to include improved sources of water and sanitation, non-shared toilet facilities, and safe disposal of child
feces. Another variable of interest, hygienic hand-washing practices, is captured in the MICS, but its
incidence is very low (less than 70 observations). This discourages its use in the empirical analysis.


7.2 Estimating the Impact of Interventions on Nutrition in Tunisia

Various international organizations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the World Food Programme (WFP), have
adopted the UNICEF framework as a common conceptual background to analyze nutrition. Recently, the
World Bank extended the conceptual approach to provide evidence-based empirical insights on the
nutritional returns of policy interventions when limited financial resources or capacity on the ground do
not permit simultaneous improvements on all fronts. In concrete, Skoufias et al. (forthcoming) estimate
both the individual effects of several adequacies (that is, adequate access rates of basic services) and
the effects of their combined interactions on the nutritional status of children captured by height-for-
age z-scores (HAZ scores) for children aged 0–2 years and 0–5 years. They estimate an econometric
specification correlating HAZ scores with the four adequacy measures and their interactions (box 13) and
assess which of those interactions are significant in reducing stunting among children in several
developing countries. These interactions are interpreted as additional gains or losses to child nutritional
status derived from the simultaneous adequate access to basic services.

Box 13. Econometric Application of the UNICEF Framework

Skoufias et al. (forthcoming) estimate a single equation that links adequacies to basic services (As) with the
nutritional status of children, or stunting, captured by the HAZ score. Specifically, the equation is:


                                                                                                             (1)


where HAZi is the HAZ score for child i, and where i, j, k = 1…4 denotes each of the four dimensions considered,
that is, food, water and sanitation, environmental health, and care. Thus, Ai denotes access to each of the four
adequacies for each child i. Namely, A1 is 1 when the household has adequate food (F) and is 0 otherwise; A2 is 1
when the household is adequate in environmental health (H) and is 0 otherwise; A3 is 1 when the household has
adequate in water and sanitation (W); and A4 is 1 for households with adequate care (0 otherwise). These measures
are independent of whether the child has access to each of other three adequacies considered.

In this specification, the constant term provides an estimate of the mean value of HAZ scores for children without
access to adequate food security ( = 0), environmental health ( = 0), water and sanitation (A3), and care (A4= 0).
That is, the constant term capture E ( HAZ | X = x) or the expected (or mean) value of height for age, conditional on
a control variable X when none of the adequacies are met (and assuming also that E (i | A1, A2, A3, A4)=0 ):

E (HAZi | A1=0, A2=0, A3=0, A4=0)= α         (2)

The coefficient β1 in (1) yields an estimate of the increase in the mean HAZ score for children that have access to
adequate food security only (A1= 1), but do not have access to adequate environmental health (A2= 0), adequate
water and sanitation (A3=0), and no access to adequate care (A4= 0). The reference group is the group of children


                                                          99
satisfying no adequacies, that is, the mean HAZ score for the reference group summarized by the constant term. The
coefficients β2, β3, and β4 have analogous interpretations for environmental health, water and sanitation, and care,
respectively. The coefficients’ γs yield estimates of synergies or complementarities from having access to more than
one determinant of nutrition. Specifically, the mean HAZ score for children with access to adequate food security
( = 1) and adequate environmental health ( = 1) is summarized by the expression:

E (HAZi | A1=1, A2=1, A3=0, A4=0)= α + β1 + β2 + γ12           (3)


Thus, the mean value of HAZ scores for children in households with access to adequate food security and adequate
environmental health can be considered as consisting of the sum of three components: the first component is the
increase in HAZ scores associated with children in households with adequate food security only (that is, ); the
second component (that is, ) is the increase in HAZ scores associated with children in households with adequate
environmental health only; and the third component (that is, ) is the increase in HAZ scores associated with
children in households that have access to both adequate food security and adequate environmental health. Thus, the
coefficient yields information on whether there are additional (extra) gains (or losses) in HAZ scores derived
from joint access to adequate food and health compared to exclusive access to adequate food and exclusive access to
adequate health. A significant and positive value of the coefficient   implies synergies from the simultaneous
access to adequate food security and adequate environmental health in the production of child nutrition.

In the case of Tunisia, equation (1) is estimated using data on children age 0 to 24 months from the 11 –12 MICS.
Results are presented for the entire country as well as disaggregated for the poor and nonpoor samples, and for urban
and rural households. A final sample combines rural and the poorest quartile of the distribution of households (based
on their assets) in an attempt to capture particularly disadvantaged groups. This allows for a better understanding of
differences that policies may have across differentiated sets of households.

Unfortunately, the model does not allow for causal inference on the effects of the various adequacy
components on nutrition. Instead, this specification allows for the exploration of the correlation between
the various adequacy measures and nutritional outcomes as measured by HAZ scores. A second caveat is
that the estimation of the model is affected by the few observations of some of the synergies considered.
Likewise, to the extent that adequacies are more strictly defined (table 24), the observations satisfying
each adequacy may be very few, thus compromising the quality and precision of the econometric
estimation.


7.3 Which Policy Synergies Are More Likely Improve Nutrition in Tunisia?

This section uses stunting, measured by the HAZ score, as the dependent variable capturing child
malnutrition. The sample analyzed includes observations of children aged 0–24 months. Table 23 reports
the effects of food, health-, WASH-, and care-related interventions on child stunting. As indicted above,
each of these dimensions has individual and combined—or interaction–effects that are reported
separately. Thus, for example, the coefficient “adequate in WASH only” captures the effect—
correlation—across Tunisian children of moving from no adequacy on WASH access to achieving
adequate access to those services. That is, this effect quantifies the nutritional benefit of providing
adequate access to WASH to all those Tunisian households that currently lack it. The same effect is
estimated for each of the other dimensions considered. Beyond these individual effects, other variables
capture the effects of achieving, say, WASH adequacy when households benefit from one, two, or three
other adequacies. That is the case of, for example, adequate WASH access and adequate food access.
Those estimates include the effects of the specific satisfied adequacies plus the interaction or synergy


                                                        100
effects of having achieved these two adequacies. Results specific to WASH adequacies (table 23) are then
compared with the correlations estimated for other dimensions that do not include WASH (that is, food,
environmental health, and care adequacies; table 23).

Results shown in table 23 confirm that adequacy on any single dimension is not sufficient to make a
(statistically) significant impact on nutritional status. This is not only true for WASH, but also for food,
environmental health, and care. The findings hold across samples of poor, nonpoor, urban, and rural
households. Only multiple adequacies are correlated with—statistically—significant improvements in
children’s nutritional status. Results also show that not any combination of adequacies will lead to
significant improvements in child stunting. In fact, significant sets of integrated interventions vary across
types of households (poor versus nonpoor, rural versus urban) and, for some households, such as urban
households, none of the combinations of these integrated interventions appear to lead to significant
improvements in child stunting.48

Importantly, adequate water and sanitation combined with adequate food and health access have positive
correlations with improvements in children’s nutritional status for the full sample (table 23). In rural
areas, adequate WASH and health access are correlated with significant child HAZ score improvements.
For nonpoor households, adequate WASH and food access have positive and significant effects. For the
poorest quartile of rural households, positive and significant improvements in nutrition are only observed
when adequate access to food, health, WASH, and care are all present (table 23).

Interestingly, the vast majority of coefficients reported for WASH have a positive sign, even though they
are not significant. This indicates that WASH and other interaction effects may still be positively
correlated with nutrition even though the magnitude of such effects is not sufficiently large to lead to
significant effects. Adequacies other than WASH (see lower panel in table 23) show similar results; while
their synergy effects are positively correlated with improved child nutrition, these effects are not
statistically significant. This is true for all considered samples. It is only when combined with adequate
access to WASH services that some specific effects of other dimensions become significant.

Note: Using adequate WASH access definition 1.

When using a stricter definition of WASH adequacy that includes safe removal of child feces to improved
water and sanitation, adequate access still brings significant and positive correlations with improved child
nutrition (table 24). But as this adequacy on WASH becomes harder to achieve, effects become
significant only when environmental health adequacy is also achieved. In fact, no other synergy appears
significant. And this positive correlation appears strong even as it manifests among the most
disadvantaged groups, that is, the poor, rural, and poorest quartile of rural households. In this case,
adequacies of food and health have a statistically positive effect on child nutrition on their own (table 24),
with differences observed among urban and rural, poor and nonpoor, and poorest quartiles of the
distribution. Appropriate care does not appear to have a significant effect on improving nutrition, except
when its adequacy complements that of environmental health in the urban sample. This turns out to be the
only synergy that reduces stunting among Tunisian households. Appendix 9 shows the implications of
using even more demanding definitions of adequacy.

In conclusion, adequate access to basic services matters in understanding improved child nutrition in
Tunisia. WASH has a (statistically significant) positive link with improved child nutrition: more and
better access to (improved) water and sanitation and nonshared toilets are likely to have significant
beneficial effects on child nutrition. In fact, this adequacy is the one more likely to have a significant
impact on nutrition compared to adequate access to food, health, and care. Further, estimated effects
differ across samples of poor, nonpoor, urban and rural, and poorest quartiles of rural households. Finally,
as the definition of adequacy becomes stricter, its statistical significance falls because fewer households
meet such conditions, therefore impacting the quality and precision of estimates.

For policy purposes, two key messages stand out. In Tunisia, progress toward satisfying a very strict level
of adequacy in any single dimension of public services may not bring the expected gains in child nutrition
unless similar gains in other services are also attained. Unbalanced investments in WASH—or for that
matter, food, care, or health—might not bring visible and substantive nutrition benefits. Yet, there is not a
single package of WASH improvements combined with a single other intervention that will bring uniform
benefits across different types of households. Effects of improved access vary by group and area:
unsurprisingly “more everywhere” may not be the best policy option in the presence of limited resources
to ensure improvements in nutrition for those most in need, especially Tunisian children.

Finally, these findings accrue from correlations rather than unambiguous causal effects. More analysis is
needed on synergies between drivers of nutrition not included so far among the services considered—
because they are not captured by the MICS—or other interventions such as public awareness campaigns,
improved education among future parents, and so forth. More effort is also needed to disentangle
endogenous relationships; after all, investments are expected to be (even desired to be) targeted toward
those most in need, that is, among groups and areas most lagging in adequate access. Another area for
further work is the estimation of correlations of adequate services to other health dimensions, for
example, weight-for-age or the incidence of child diarrhea. So, even though the analysis in this section is
clearly incomplete, it suggests that single, sectoral interventions are not sufficient to solve complex,
interrelated, and multidimensional challenges. Neither are universal policies that do not separate the
specific needs of different types of households, locations, and vulnerabilities.

Appendix 1: Poverty Measurement in Tunisia
INS defined poverty lines for the first time in 1980 on the basis of standard, basic nutritional caloric
needs. A unitary value per caloric intake was calculated for each household in a reference group (the
poorest quintile) based on its estimated caloric intake and the household’s food consumption monetary
value. By multiplying the median of unitary value per calorie and the average total calories consumed by
households in the poorest quintile, a food poverty line was defined. The total poverty line was then
estimated by dividing the poverty food line by the share of food in total expenditures of the reference
group. The approach was applied separately for urban and rural areas, resulting in an urban poverty line
that was 63 percent higher than the rural line. Keeping that ratio constant over time, the two 1980 poverty
lines were adjusted by the same CPI (that is, without any further geographical adjustment).

Analysts (Ayadi et al. [2005] and references there) have argued that the estimated value of food from the
reference group turned out to be much higher in urban than in rural households, and that the share of
nonfood consumption was also higher among urban than among rural households in the reference group.
This typically resulted in an overestimation of the urban poverty line in the INS method and a resulting
lower incidence of poverty among urban households. Therefore, the choice of the reference group and
even the choice of year, 1980, a year with historically high levels of poverty, were both decisions with
serious methodological consequences.

The World Bank approach adjusts the reference group used by INS and uses the poor in 1990 (as
defined by the INS method) instead of the first quintile of the population in 1980 as reference. Caloric
unit values and food poverty lines are estimated following the same procedure used by INS for urban and
rural areas. The ensuing gap between urban and rural food poverty lines, however, narrows down to 18
percent (instead of the 63 percent obtained by the INS approach). A second difference from the INS
method is that the food share of total consumption is now estimated econometrically—ordinary least
squares—using an Engel equation for each area. In the Engel equation, the share of food is regressed on
the ratio of total expenditures to the food poverty line (in log), this same ratio squared and on the
difference in size between each household and the average household of the reference group. This
equation is estimated separately for the two areas. The estimated constant of the model (α) represents the
food share of the household having an income just equal to the food poverty line. Once this food share of
the total poverty line is estimated, the total poverty line simply adds to the food component the resulting
nonfood component. Empirically, this methodology results in a smaller nonfood share in urban areas and
a higher share in rural areas than the INS method produced based on the observed shared of food over
total spending by the household (table A1.1).

a. In 1990 the exchange rate was TD 0.878 to the U.S. dollar. This implies a WB poverty line of US$248 for the urban areas and
US$210 for rural areas. With adjustment forward at the CPI up to 2000, these lines are estimates at TD 341 and TD 294,
respectively, for the two areas. In terms of PPP U.S. dollars, these amounts correspond respectively to about US$2 and US$1.8
per capita per day. The upper poverty lines are respectively US$2.9 and US$2.3 for the year 2000 (PPP 1993 ).

The joint methodology, produced in 2012 by the INS, the African Development Bank, and the World
Bank (2012), follows by and large the World Bank methodology explained above. It defines the cost of a
calorie for the reference group, once again the bottom quintile of the population. It then estimates the food
poverty line for each strata defined no longer as urban and rural, but as cities; small-and-medium towns;
and communal areas. It does so by multiplying the median unitary cost of the reference group by its


                                                             105
average energy consumption. This food poverty line for each strata is used to estimate the share of food
consumption on total consumption of those households whose total consumption is equal to the food
poverty line. This share is estimated through a quantile regression of the Engel equation. This share
determines the food component of the total poverty line, while the remaining share determines the
nonfood component (table A1.2). The resulting total poverty line is considered a “lower-bound” poverty
line since it is evaluated at a level of consumption (total consumption equals food poverty line) that is
considered a survival level. When the same analysis is repeated for households whose food consumption
(rather than total consumption) is around the food poverty line, the resulting total poverty line is
considered an “upper-bound” poverty line (table A1.3).

An additional difference between the methodologies lies in the very definition of consumption. The joint
methodology excludes from the consumption aggregate those expenditures related to the purchases of
housing (which was included in the previous methodologies) and cars, major repairs, key assets, and
occasional ceremonies. Imputed rent is estimated according to a regression model, instead of the average
by stratum reported among renters as in the previous methodologies.

Appendix 2: Modeling Consumption in Tunisia
The projections that use survey-to-survey imputation methods relied on the definition and estimation of a
prediction model for household consumption. Using data from the ENBCV 2010, an ordinary least
squares (OLS) regression was estimated that used the logarithm of annual consumption per capita (in
millimes) as the dependent variable. The regressors included a series of demographic, location, labor,
access to services, and asset ownership variables that could be found consistently across the “source”
survey (that is, ENBCV 2010), survey A, and the “destination” surveys, survey B (that is, 2009 and 2012
ENPEs). The results from the OLS regression are shown in table A1.1.

The results from the consumption model provide a good fit and reliable predictions of household
consumption when paired with a process that would randomly assign an error term to the prediction of
household consumption. Figures A1.1 and A1.2 show the superposition of the actual household
consumption found in the ENBCV 2010 and the predictions based on the consumption model and two
methods to randomly assigned error terms to complement the prediction: a decile-specific random
assignment and a fully random assignment. The first process assigns an error term to the household
consumption prediction that is randomly obtained from the same wealth decile to which the household
belongs. Wealth deciles are based on an asset-based index obtained from a principal component analysis.

Appendix 5: Consumption Mobility in Tunisia
Table A5.1 presents the basic descriptive statistics of the pseudo-panel used to analyze poverty and
consumption mobility in Tunisia, that is, the socioeconomic and geographical characteristics of synthetic
household heads of the constructed cohorts. The average consumption per capita in the pseudo-panel is
about US$222 per month, with a standard deviation (SD) of US$28.5 in 2005 PPP terms. Around 86
percent of individuals live in a household where the head is male, while the average age of household
heads is almost 58 years old. About one-third of the synthetic cohorts live in rural areas, and 60 percent
live in the coastal regions (Gran Tunis, northeast, and center east). On average, 30 percent of each cohort
has a household head with only primary studies, and 26 percent has a household head with secondary
studies or above. Agriculture is the largest employment sector across cohorts, employing on average 40
percent of individuals, whereas the services sector comes in second with 37 percent. The variable denoted
as “wealth index” captures the quality of the living conditions of the households. The variable is
computed using information about assets owned by the households including air conditioner, radio,
television, dish, refrigerator, freezer, washing machine, oven, car or motorcycle, and bicycle. The index
also includes dwelling characteristics such as access to electricity and tap water. This variable is
constructed as a principal component that explains most of the variance of the characteristics mentioned
above. While the actual values of the index are not too informative, lower (higher) values of the index
allow to discriminate between households with lower (higher) expected wealth or living conditions.

     and tap water). Observations refer to the age group/gender cohorts created in the data. Primary studies refer to the
     Tunisian education level “enseignement de base.” Secondary studies include secondary schools, “ecole métiers,”
     “C.A.P,” “B.T.P.,” “apprentisage,” “other professional formation,” and “formation continue.”

     In terms of consumption mobility, that is, the extent to which levels of consumption in 2005 affected
     levels in 2010, table A5.2 reports a low unconditional income mobility estimate of 0.71 (that is, the
     relationship between past and current consumption without considering any control; see column 1). To
     put this estimate in context, Cuesta, Nopo, and Pizzolito (2011) find an unconditional mobility estimate as
     high as 0.966 for Latin America using data from the years 1992–2002. The estimated mobility changes
     substantially after controls are introduced. Column 2 introduces controls for location, demographic
     characteristics, and the living conditions of households (via the wealth index). By including such controls,
     the resulting estimate of income mobility (that is, conditional) is 0.555. The estimates show that the
     average level of education is statistically correlated with future consumption and that the higher the level
     of education of household heads, the higher the expected future consumption. Cohorts with older
     household heads are also expected to experience higher levels of consumption. Finally, the location does
     not seem to be related to future consumption and neither does the wealth index of individuals in the
     cohorts.

     Columns 3, 4, and 5 include controls for sector of employment, professional situation and type of
     occupation, respectively. In all cases, it appears that individuals’ labor market situation s are not correlated
     with the level of future consumption once location and demographic characteristics have been accounted
     for. That is, holding other characteristics constant, the labor market composition of cohorts is not
     statistically related to the cohort’s future expected consumption. Column 6 reports the results of a model
     that includes all variables simultaneously, confirming the results from previous estimates on the role of
     initial consumption, education, labor, location, service access, and asset conditions.

Appendix 7: Energy Consumption in Tunisia


The analysis simulates the fiscal and distributive effects caused by changes in the current structure of
energy prices and subsidies. This analysis follows an earlier distributional study of energy subsidies in
Tunisia using SUBSIM, a subsidy reform simulation methodology developed by Araar and Verme
(2012). This present analysis, however, makes two contributions to the earlier analysis. First, it updates
existing estimates (reported in World Bank 2013b) by including the most recent structure of energy prices
and the most recent proposal of subsidy changes considered by the Tunisian government. Second, this
analysis includes a detailed simulation of the distributional effects of alternative compensating cash
transfer schemes financed from the fiscal savings accruing from the subsidy reform. The analysis uses
consumption patterns in 2010. The latest input-output matrix (I/O) for Tunisia is also for 2010. This I/O
matrix enables estimation of the indirect effects of the reforms; that is, the effects on household
consumption and spending accruing from the impacts that energy prices have on other productive sectors
of the economy. Household spending on energy and other products is then updated using successive rates
of the annual Consumer Price Index (CPI), GDP, and population growth to construct a distribution of
energy spending for January 2014. The current energy tariff structures are applied to that distribution of
household spending on energy to derive a distribution of household consumption on energy sources. It is
on these distributions of spending and consumption constructed for 2014 that the subsidy reform is
simulated and its distributive and fiscal effects estimated. The first step before beginning the simulation
analysis is to look at a detailed outline of the current system of energy subsidies.

To better understand the implications of the reforms, this appendix reports the most updated information
on the socioeconomic patterns of energy subsidies, that is, how consumption, spending, and subsidy
benefits of residential energy differ across different socioeconomic groups. Panels a and b in table A7.1
show that total consumption of energy across quintiles varies by energy sources. Richer quintiles
consume more energy, with significantly large differences for gasoline and diesel among these quintiles
and the rest. Consumption of the top two quintiles represents 80 percent and 90 percent of the
consumption of diesel and gasoline, respectively. The bottom 40 percent consumes 2 percent and 8
percent of the total consumption of these two sources, respectively. For the other energy sources, the
distribution of consumption across quintiles is not so skewed: the share of the top two quintiles (bottom
40 percent) consumption of LPG and electricity represents 45 percent to 52 percent (28–34 percent).

Similarly, when it comes to the per capita consumption of energy, the data in table A7.2 unequivocally
confirm that the top consumption quintiles, the richest quintiles, consume much more than the poorest
quintiles. Consumption differences are largest for gasoline, followed by diesel (panel a). On average, an
individual from quintile 5 consumes 200 times more gasoline than someone from the poorest quintile.
That ratio is still a whopping 38 to 1 in the case of diesel. Much narrower differences are observed for
electricity and LPG. A richer individual consumes 4.5 times more electricity and 1.4 times more LPG
than an individual from the poorest household. Individuals from the fourth quintile consume more LPG
on average than anyone else in the distribution. When the analysis is conducted for households (panel b)
—rather than individuals—very similar ratios and distributions are observed, confirming results for
individuals.

In terms of expenditures, figure A7.1 shows that the expenditure of energy represents between 5 percent
and 6 percent of households’ total spending. In other words, energy spending as share of household total
spending is similar across socioeconomic groups, without marked differences across quintiles. Despite
being small, these differences are still interesting. In fact, it is the households in the poorest and richest
quintiles that spend a higher proportion of their budgets on energy (just over 6 percent of their total
spending). But while the poorest spent a larger share on electricity, the richest spent a larger share on
gasoline.

Large differences become evident when absolute spending is compared across quintiles of the
consumption distribution. Figure A7.2 shows that the richest individual spends more than 200 times per
capita than a poor individual. Socioeconomic disparities in spending exist for diesel as well, but are
notably reduced for electricity and LPG. In fact, spending on LPG is more uniform across all
socioeconomic groups, between TD 20 and TD 29, and it is the fourth quintile that spends the most.

Appendix 9: Access and Adequacy of Water and Sanitation Services in Tunisia
To analyze WASH services, the Tunisia diagnostic used categories from the MICS questionnaire, which
offers consistent questions and options in terms of access and levels of services, grouping them into fewer
sets for easier analysis. These categories are consistent with the standard definitions of the
WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme on Water Supply and Sanitation (table A9.1). Thus,
improved drinking water source refers to a drinking water source or delivery point that by nature of its
construction or through active intervention is protected from outside contamination, in particular from
contamination with fecal matter. They include: piped drinking water supply on premises; public
taps/standposts; tubewell/borehole; protected dug well; protected spring; and rainwater. Improved
sanitation facility refers to one that hygienically separates human excrement from human contact. It
included the following facility types: flush or pour-flush toilets to piped sewer system, septic tank, or pit;
ventilated improved pit latrine; pit latrine with slab; and composting toilet.

       Bu the richness of the data collected in the MICS enables a very detailed analysis of Tunisia’s water and
       sanitation services. In particular, by combining several questions, it is possible to get a better picture of
       the adequacy of the country’s water and sanitation services. Such adequacy rates can better measure how
       protected the members of a household are from food insecurity due to poor WASH services. For instance,
       access to an improved water source without access to improved sanitation services may be as detrimental
       to health as only having an unimproved water source. Table A9.2 shows coverage rates for several
       WASH services taken separately, as well as adequacy rates that combine coverage rates across services.
       Only if a household is covered by a set of relevant services is it considered to have adequate WASH
       services. The groups of the population shown are based on location (urban/rural), poverty status (poor,
       nonpoor), and relative position in the wealth distribution (quartiles).

       The first rows show patterns with high levels of improved water and improved sanitation when looking at
       the country as a whole, and among the urban population. Poverty status rather than location is a stronger
       predictor of limited access to improved water or sanitation services. Evidence shows that the urban poor
       tend to have much higher access rates than the rural poor, and higher than those experienced by the rural
       population as a whole. A crucial WASH-related behavior observed in the MICS is whether child feces are
       disposed of safely. This behavior is by far the least common among all household groups analyzed. While
       the full sample shows a rate of 1.9 percent, the urban poor seem to have the highest rate of 5.6 percent,
       and the second quartile has the lowest at 0.9 percent.

       The last three rows of table A9.2 show different definitions of what could be considered adequate WASH
       services. Adequacy under definition 1 includes only having access to improved water, to improved
       sanitation service, and that the dwelling has a private toilet. The second definition also requires the safe
       disposal of child feces. The third definition further characterizes adequate access to include improved
       water as water that is piped, and adequate access to sanitation as being connected to sewage and septic
       tanks. Under definition 1, only 76.5 percent of Tunisian households are considered to have adequate
       WASH services, and most of the households with inadequate services are poor (46.5 percent adequacy) or
       rural (54.5 percent adequacy). It is remarkable that, when WASH behavior is taken into account,
       adequacy rates plummet to close to zero across all household groups. The urban poor group has the
       highest adequacy rate at 3.8 percent, and the third quartile is second at 2.5 percent. Among all the other
       categories analyzed, the adequacy rates are at or below 2 percent.

       As the definition of adequate WASH access becomes even more restrictive and challenging to achieve (as
       compared with that used in tables 25 and 26 in the analysis)—now adequate WASH considers only the
       categories of piped water, sewage, and septic tanks as appropriate—hardly any households meet the
       adequate access level. This is particularly the case among rural households. This implies that attaining
       that level of adequacy does not have a statistically significant effect on improved nutrition among the
       analyzed households, as it is extremely rare that such a state is observed. Significant synergies are also
       rare, and hardly any significant correlations emerge. Instead, satisfaction of adequacies other than WASH
       becomes more statistically significant across the different samples considered. Again, food and
       environmental health adequacies have significant correlations on improved nutrition on their own, and
       follow a very similar pattern to that reported in table A9.3.
