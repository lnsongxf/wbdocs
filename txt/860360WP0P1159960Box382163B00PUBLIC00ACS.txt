Executive Summary
              BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE


              The Government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (hereinafter referred
              to as the Government of Macedonia, or GOM) plans to launch a National Program for
              Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings (NPEEPB) to achieve energy efficiency (EE) improve-
              ments in the buildings sector and meet the strategic targets outlined in the National
              Energy Efficiency Strategy (GOM 2010c) and National Energy Efficiency Action Plan
              ­
              (GOM 2010b). The national EE target is a 9 percent reduction in final energy consumption
              by 2018, compared to the average energy consumption of 2002–06. The NPEEPB, coordi-
              nated by the Ministry of Economy (MOE), aims to retrofit existing public buildings with EE
              measures. Its targets are buildings that are used for administrative and other activities of
              public interest and that are fully owned by government institutions or municipalities. The
              NPEEPB target for energy savings in public buildings is 13.6 ktoe1/year, which is about
              56 percent of the national EE target for the commercial and service sectors.



              Public buildings in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia) are
              major purchasers of energy services and energy-using equipment. Improving EE in these
              buildings is important to reduce the waste of public resources resulting from inefficient
              energy use, provide the users of public facilities an opportunity to learn about and prac-
              tice EE, demonstrate that the government is “leading by example,” and help develop
              mechanisms and institutions to leverage market transformation. The MOE has completed
              an assessment of the technical potential for EE in public buildings (ENSI 2012) and identi-
              fied some potential options for financing the implementation of EE measures. This report
              has been prepared under the World Bank Institute (WBI) regional capacity-building pro-
              gram to provide information to government stakeholders on EE financing and implemen-
              tation issues. It focuses on identifying financing mechanisms that are considered the best
              fit with the existing institutional environment to achieve the goals of the NPEEPB, then
              describes the implementation of these mechanisms in detail. The findings were discussed
              during a consultation process in which the views and feedback of various stakeholders
              were shared. The process served as a means to build coalition among these stakeholders
              and to advance the agenda of EE in the building sector. A regional experience-sharing
              workshop is being planned, where these findings will be shared with other countries from
              southeast Europe.

12   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
               OBJECTIVES


               The principal objective of this report is to assess various financing mechanisms for imple-
               menting EE measures in public buildings to contribute to the achievement of the goals
               of the NPEEPB, and to recommend the most appropriate mechanisms and the related
               implementation plans.




               OVERVIEW OF THE PUBLIC BUILDINGS MARKET


               The NPEEPB will include all public buildings in Macedonia and will be implemented in
               two phases. Phase 1 (2012–18) includes public buildings that are under the jurisdiction
               of the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education and Science, Ministry of Local Self-Gov-
               ernment, Ministry of Labor and Social Policy, MOE, Ministry of Environment and Physical
               Planning, Ministry of Transport and Communications, and Ministry of Finance (MOF),
               as well as the municipal administrative buildings in all 84 municipalities and the city of
               Skopje. These buildings are classified into five types: health care, education, social care,
               municipal administration, and state administration.

13   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB      |   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
              The public buildings of these five types number 2,441; they have a total heated floor area
              of 2.27 million square meters (m2) (ENSI 2012). The education sector is by far the largest,
              with 1,515 buildings (62 percent of the total) and a 1.46 million m2 heated floor area (65 per-
              cent of the total). The next largest is the health sector, with about 20 percent of the build-
              ings and 21 percent of the heated floor area. The social care sector has about 10 percent of
              the buildings and heated area. Municipal and state administrative sectors have very small
              shares of public building stock, both in number of buildings and floor area (see table ES.1).

              The total baseline energy consumption of the buildings in the five sectors was estimated
              at about 475,314 megawatt-hours (MWh) or 40.869 toe. This represents about 20 percent
              of the energy consumption in the commercial and services sector in Macedonia. The av-
              erage specific energy consumption across all building types is 214 kilowatt-hours (kWh)/
              m2 and the average energy cost is €18.7/m2. The major energy-saving measures identi-
              fied in the study, prepared by Energy Saving International AS (ENSI), include thermal
              insulation of walls, roofs, and floors; replacement of windows and doors; installation of
              control systems; replacement of boilers, stoves, radiators, and pumps; and improvement
              of lighting systems. The application of all cost-effective measures can reduce energy
              consumption­by 157,918 MWh (about 33.2 percent) and annual energy costs by €14.0 mil-
              lion. In addition, the reduced energy consumption would result in reducing greenhouse

              BARRIERS TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY


              EE programs in public institutions are difficult to implement due to a number of barriers
              that have slowed down EE improvements in other sectors of the economy, such as lack
              of information on EE potential and benefits, lack of trained personnel, lack of incentives,
              high transaction costs, and scarcity of budgetary resources or external financing. In ad-
              dition, several barriers specific to the public sector further hold back sustained improve-
              ments in EE in this sector. In Macedonia these barriers include the following:

              •	Public accounting, budgeting, and procurement rules that prevent public institutions­
                 from retaining the energy cost savings resulting from EE measures, and make it
                 ­
                 difficult to implement such measures.

              •	Financing restrictions that have put considerable fiscal pressure on the availability of
                 budget funds for investment in EE improvements.

              •	Limited borrowing capacity of municipalities, due in part to incomplete decentralization.

              •	Limited willingness of municipalities to borrow from commercial banks, due to
                 prevailing­high interest rates, MOF restrictions on debt, onerous applications and
                 reporting documentation, and so on.

              •	Limited interest of commercial banks in lending to the public sector, due to concerns
                 over creditworthiness, insufficient available collateral, limited local revenue streams,
                 and so on.

              •	Limited institutional capacity of government institutions, municipalities, and the
                 private sector to identify and implement EE measures.
                 ­

              •	Limited technical capacity in the public and private sectors to prepare bankable EE
                 project proposals.




15   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
              FINANCING OPTIONS FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR


              International experience with EE programs in the public sector indicates that a wide
              range of financing options have been implemented in various countries (Singh and others
              2010). These include:

              •	 Grant financing using government budget or external donor funds.

              •	Budget capture — financing by the MOF or parent budgeting agency, with repay-
                 ments in the form of reduced future budgetary outlays.

              •	Establishment of an EE fund.

              •	Establishment of an EE credit line through an existing financial institution, such as a
                 development or commercial bank.

              •	Creation of a risk-sharing facility, such as a partial credit guarantee program to cover
                 commercial loans.

              •	 Commercial financing from existing banks and financial institutions.

              •	Commercial financing using energy service companies (ESCOs) using an energy sav-
                 ing performance contracting (ESPC) approach.



              While most of these options have been used in southeast Europe, an assessment of the
              current market and regulatory conditions conducted in this report indicates that some of
              them are unsuitable or impractical in Macedonia. For example, municipalities are still very
              reluctant to use debt financing for infrastructure projects, particularly at market interest
              rates. Therefore only very few have accessed commercial financing, including the risk
              guarantee program piloted by USAID using its Development Credit Authority (DCA).
              Some have operated concurrently, resulting in borrowers selecting the program with the
              more advantageous terms, thereby partially undermining those with a more commercial
              approach. ESCO financing is currently not an option because ESCOs do not yet operate
              in Macedonia, and new ones would be unlikely to take on municipal credit risk. Govern-
              ment grants for EE improvement are unavailable in the current environment of fiscal
              austerity. These considerations limit the choice of financing options.




16   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
              FINANCING OPTIONS PROPOSED FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NPEEPB


              This report analyzes the range of financing options, assesses those most suitable to the
              local context, and presents the three most appropriate options: (i) an independent, full-ser-
              vice EE fund; (ii) a dedicated EE credit line; and (iii) a municipal EE improvement program.



              Independent, Full-Service Energy Efficiency Fund

              An independent, full-service EE fund would provide financing and associated services
              to all public sector entities on a commercial basis. The fund would be established as an
              independent, nongovernmental entity managed by a competitively selected, profes-
              sional fund management company (referred to hereafter as a fund manager) that could
              be a consortium consisting of a local or international bank and entities with technical and
              financial expertise, or an existing foreign or Macedonian entity, such as a commercial
              bank operating in Macedonia. It would be staffed with a managing director and staff with
              technical, financial/credit, transaction, procurement, and outreach expertise. The fund
              manager would report to a board of directors chaired by the MOF (or designate) and
              comprised of representatives of the public and private sectors.

              The mission of the fund would be to finance EE projects implemented by municipalities
              and other public sector entities that would use the energy cost savings resulting from the
              EE project to repay the financing costs. The repayments would be used by the fund to
              finance additional projects, thereby making it a revolving fund. If successful, the fund could
              be expanded to other underserved EE markets, such as the residential sector, in the future.

              The fund would offer two financial products, targeted at two different types of public sec-
              tor clients:

              •	For municipalities and public entities with revenue streams independent of the state
                 budget that have demonstrated financial discipline and adequate administrative and
                 institutional capacity for project implementation, the fund would provide loan financ-
                 ing for EE projects. These loans would be treated as municipal debt, with fixed repay-
                 ment obligations to be made within their budget provisions in future years. The fund
                 may also provide certain additional services with associated fees, such as contracting
                 and overseeing energy audits, developing bidding documents for services related to
                 project implementation, carrying out the procurement of design and works on behalf
                 of municipalities, overseeing construction and commissioning, paying the contractors
                 for services provided (from the proceeds of the loan), and monitoring the projects.




17   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
              •	For public sector entities without their own budgets or capacity to implement projects,
                 the fund would offer comprehensive energy service agreements (ESAs) under which
                 the fund would provide turnkey services, performing as an energy service provider and
                 undertaking all of the actions needed to identify and implement the EE project. The
                 ESA would obligate the public sector entity to pay fixed payments equal to 95–100
                 percent of the baseline energy costs (adjusted based on energy prices, changes in
                 comfort levels, and weather variability) to the fund during the life of the agreement.
                 These payments would be used by the fund to pay for all energy bills of the facility
                 and reimburse the fund for the investment cost and service fee. In this way, EE projects
                 could be financed without the public sector entity having to take on debt on its books.
                 To reduce risk to the fund, it would retain the option to adjust the length of the con-
                 tract, extending it to ensure full cost recovery or reducing it to avoid excessive profits.



              Energy Efficiency Credit Line

              Under this financing mechanism, a dedicated credit line or lending window would be
              established through an existing financial institution (FI), such as a local bank, to finance
              public sector EE projects. The FI, which may be selected competitively, would establish a
              program management unit (PMU), with a managing director and several staff, reporting
              to the FI’s executive management, and would identify, appraise, and select projects for
              which funds would be on-lent from the credit line.

              The clients for the credit line would be municipalities and other public entities that can
              demonstrate creditworthiness and are able and willing to borrow. Procurement and
              implementation would be done by municipalities themselves, perhaps with the help of a
              procurement agent. The PMU would be responsible for marketing, review of applications,
              loan appraisals, portfolio management, monitoring and reporting, and so on.



              Municipal Energy Efficiency Improvement Program (MEEIP)

              Under this option funding would be provided by the MOF from budget resources, or by
              international financial institutions (IFIs) and/or other donors through the MOF, to on-lend
              to creditworthy municipalities and public sector entities for EE projects, analogous to the
              current World Bank-funded Municipal Sector Improvement Project (MSIP). The borrowers
              would pay back the loans from the energy cost savings of the implemented EE projects.
              The repayments would be carried out through the “budget capture” approach, in the
              form of lowered outlays to the borrowers in future years. The MEEIP would be imple-
              mented by a PMU within the MOF. For public sector entities without their own budgets or




18   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
              capacity to implement projects, a financing approach may be developed during prepa-
              ration of the project that could allow the borrowers to repay the loan from the energy
              savings generated by the EE project.

              The PMU would be responsible for marketing, review of applications, monitoring and re-
              porting, and providing services to assist public entities with project preparation activities
              (such as review of feasibility studies, preparation of detailed design and bidding docu-
              ments, and supervision of construction activities). The PMU would either have to charge a
              fee to borrowers for the services provided or cover the service costs from public budgets.
              The MEEIP could be implemented by building upon the experiences with the current
              MSIP, but would most likely require the expansion of the staffing and technical skills of
              the existing PMU or the establishment of a new PMU.




              POTENTIAL FINANCING SOURCES


              There is a wide range of potential financing sources that may provide the needed fund-
              ing — for investment capital, equity, and technical assistance (TA) — for the implemen-
              tation of the NPEEPB. These sources include GOM budget allocations, IFIs (such as
              the World Bank and EBRD), the Global Environment Facility (GEF), United Nations (UN)
              organizations such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)
              and UNDP, the European Union (EU) through the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance
              (IPA) facility, Green for Growth Fund, bilateral FIs such as the German Development Bank
              (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, KfW), and commercial banks. TA funds may also be
              available from the USAID, GIZ, and the TA facilities established by the EU in cooperation
              with the European Investment Bank (EIB). For the capitalization of the three suggested
              financing mechanisms — EE fund, EE credit line, or the MEEIP — the choice of funding
              sources is more limited. Based on the current activities and interests of the various financ-
              ing sources, it appears that the World Bank, the European Commission’s IPA facility, GEF,
              EBRD, and KfW may be the most likely sources that need to be explored by the GOM
              for funding the financing mechanisms to support the NPEEPB. Most of these financing
              sources would prefer a sustainable financing mechanism that would leverage commercial
              bank financing in the long term.




19   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
              IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS


              The three financing options identified herein have a number of common features, includ-
              ing: (i) TA for energy audits and development of EE action plans, (ii) a role of the energy
              agency in providing TA, (iii) project eligibility criteria, (iv) cofinancing needs and collateral
              requirements, (v) TA for program marketing and capacity building of municipalities and
              energy service providers, (vi) considerations of sustainability and replicability, (vii) capacity
              building of the PMU, (viii) possible inclusion of a grant-financing component, (ix) encour-
              agement of performance-based implementation and facilitation of the EE services deliv-
              ery infrastructure, and (x) measurement and verification (M&V) of projects and monitoring
              and reporting to the GOM and the financing sources.




              THREE FINANCING OPTIONS: A COMPARISON


              A comparison of the three financing mechanisms shows that the EE fund is the most
              comprehensive mechanism to address the needs of the largest number of municipali-
              ties and public entities and provides the broadest coverage and flexibility of the differ-
              ent implementation considerations. In addition to a loan product similar to the other
              two mechanisms, it provides the ESA option to address the needs of public entities
              without their own budgets or capacity to implement projects. By engaging a competi-
              tively selected professional fund manager, with substantial capabilities in the technical,
              financial, and institutional aspects of the implementation of EE projects, this option
              assures efficient and effective operation of the financing mechanisms to support the
              NPEEPB. It provides the highest probability of establishing a sustainable financing
              program that can leverage commercial financing. The only limitation is the need for
              establishing a new independent organization and engaging in a fairly substantial
              competitive bidding process to select the fund manager. It would also be necessary to
              provide a certain amount of equity for the fund to cover the risk of potential payment
              defaults.

              The dedicated EE credit line would be simpler to implement and would not require the
              establishment of a new organization, but would be limited in its coverage as it would
              only provide loans to public borrowers that are creditworthy and willing and able to
              borrow (which may be limited to a small number). Also the FI responsible for managing
              the credit line may have limited capacity to provide support to clients in preparing and




20   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
              implementing the project as provided in the other two options. And, no banks inter-
              viewed expressed strong interest in the municipal lending market.

              The MEEIP would be structured similar to the existing MSIP and would not require the
              creation of a new organization. It could serve the needs of all public sector organizations
              including public entities without their own budgets or capacity to implement projects.
              But it would require substantial expansion of the staff and technical capacity of the exist-
              ing MSIP PMU or the establishment of a new PMU within the MOF with substantial capac-
              ity in EE technologies, financing, and implementation strategies. There are also issues
              related to the scalability and sustainability of this option.

              Chapter 6 of this report presents detailed information on the organizational structure and
              funds flow for each of the three financing options. A detailed comparison of the three op-
              tions is presented in table 4.3.




              SELECTING THE FINANCING OPTION


              Based on the above analysis, selecting one of the three financing options depends on
              which appears to be the most viable based on the local situation and the feedback
              received during the stakeholder consultation workshop. The EE fund was identified as
              a promising model that could address many of the barriers identified in the report. The
              final selection of the financing option would be made by the GOM with due consider-
              ation of a number of factors such as the difficulties of creating a new organization, the
              prospects of obtaining a qualified and experienced professional fund management
              company, the need to serve all public sector entities, the capacity of the energy agency,
              the suitability of existing financial institutions to manage the EE credit line, the interest
              and willingness of the MOF to establish another PMU, and the availability of funding for a
              particular option.




21   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
              PROPOSED INVESTMENT PLAN


              The proposed investment plan for the years 2013–18 categorizes the public buildings into
              five types based on their building characteristics, energy consumption characteristics,
              and energy-saving opportunities. It assumes that the GOM selects the financing option
              by the end of 2012, and initial funding is obtained in 2013. The available funding is then
              expanded in 2014 or 2015 to scale up the financing and implementation of the EE proj-
              ects. Since it may be very difficult to obtain sufficient financing during the period 2013–
              18 to implement all of the EE projects identified in the ENSI study, the investment plan
              assumes a total funding of €50 million, which would be sufficient to implement about
              52 percent of the projects in the Phase 1 buildings. The investment plan is presented in
              table 7.2.




              TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE


              For effective implementation of the financing options discussed in this report, there is a
              need for considerable TA for removal of administrative barriers to public sector EE proj-
              ects; capacity building of various program participants including the PMU, the municipali-
              ties and other public entities, and private sector implementing organizations; capacity
              building of private sector banks and financial institutions; and development of a com-
              prehensive approach and procedures for M&V of project results and capacity building of
              M&V agents. The specific responsibilities for providing/organizing TA may vary somewhat
              across the three financing options between the fund manager/PMU and energy agency.
              It is anticipated that the TA needs will amount to about €2 million, which may be financed
              by the same financing sources that will provide the funding for investment in the public
              sector EE projects; however, TA funding from some other donors and cofinancing from
              the GOM may also be made available. Coordination among donors will be essential. The
              TA activities, responsibilities, and funding levels are presented in tables 8.1 and 8.2.

    CHAPTER




Introduction
and Country Context
              The Government of Macedonia (GOM) plans to launch a National Program for Energy
              Efficiency in Public Buildings (NPEEPB, or “the program”) to achieve energy efficiency
              (EE) improvements in the buildings sector and meet the strategic targets outlined in the
              Energy Development Strategy of the Republic of Macedonia until 2030, the Energy Effi-
              ciency Strategy until 2020, and the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan in 2010–18. The
              NPEEPB, coordinated by the Ministry of Economy (MOE), aims to retrofit existing public
              buildings and to lead by example in the implementation of EE measures. Its targets are
              public buildings that are used for administrative and other activities of public interest and
              that are fully owned by government institutions or municipalities.

              This report focuses on the financing mechanisms that are considered the best fit with the
              institutional environment to achieve the goals of the NPEEPB, and describes in detail the
              implementation of the proposed financing mechanisms: a full-service EE fund, a dedicat-
              ed EE credit line, and a municipal EE improvement program implemented within the gov-
              ernment. The report builds on the work on the NPEEPB completed by the Energy Saving
              International, AS (ENSI) and others and described in its report to the GOM (ENSI 2012),
              especially the selection of the buildings to be included in the first phase of the NPEEPB
              (2012–18), market potential, and the cost-effective EE measures likely to be carried out,
              as well as an estimation of the resulting investment costs and benefits. The national EE
              target is a 9 percent savings in final energy consumption by 2018, compared to average
              energy consumption in 2002–06. The NPEEPB target for energy savings in public build-
              ings is 13.6 ktoe2/year, which is about 56 percent of the national EE target for the com-
              mercial and service sector.




              IMPORTANCE OF EE IN PUBLIC BUILDINGS


              Government facilities are often major purchasers of energy services and energy-using
              equipment; they typically are the single largest energy user in a country. But the total
              amount of energy consumed by public buildings — for heating, air-conditioning, hot
              water preparation, lighting, and plug loads — is not particularly large compared to the
              rest of the economy, and by itself would not merit much special attention. Although few
              countries have reliable data, the public sector is estimated to account for about 10–20
              percent of a country’s total energy consumption in the region.

              There are, however, good reasons for central and local governments to engage in
              energy-saving activities in the buildings they own and operate. Four key reasons are:

              •	Leading by example. Government laws and regulations to protect the environment
                 and promote sustainable development affect all entities and citizens. To be credible
                 and inspire others, the government must set and follow its own regulations.

              •	Multiplier effect. Public institutions have an important educational role. Energy-sav-
                 ing projects in public facilities provide their users (such as teachers, students, and hos-
                 pital staff or patients) an opportunity to learn about and practice EE in their everyday
                 environment. Energy-saving projects in public buildings worldwide have been known
                 to influence the behavior and lifestyle choices of building users.

              •	Better use of public resources. Tax payments, by citizens and the private sector, are
                 the largest source of public funds. Inefficient energy consumption is a waste of public
                 money, which is exacerbated as tariff reforms are implemented. Energy savings result-
                 ing from improved efficiency can be used for capital improvement projects or to free
                 up budgets for other purposes.

              •	Leveraging effect for market creation and transformation. The public sector
                 can use its market power to help develop mechanisms and institutions for energy
                 conservation in society at large, creating a strong, sustained, buyer-led shift in the
                 market toward EE. The government’s buying power and active, visible leadership
                 can provide a powerful nonregulatory means to stimulate demand for EE products
                 and services. By establishing a reliable market, the government can encourage
                 domestic suppliers to introduce more EE products at competitive prices and also
                 create more opportunities for the EE services industry, including energy service
                 companies (ESCOs), energy consultants, financing businesses, contractors, and
                 equipment vendors.




              POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN FYR MACEDONIA


              During the past few years, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia)
              established a comprehensive strategic and legal framework for a reformed and sustain-
              able energy sector with a strong emphasis on EE. This development is driven by the ob-
              jective of getting full membership in the European Union (EU). As a contracting party to




25   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   CHAPTER 1
              the Energy Community Treaty, FYR Macedonia has committed to harmonize its national
              legislation with the existing EU legislation for the energy sector.

              The main legal and strategic documents for establishing EE improvements as a major
              goal, in general and in the public sector, are the following:

              •	The Energy Law (adopted in February 2011). The law (GOM 2011a) establishes the
                 major regulatory requirements for EE in public buildings. It specifies the following ob-
                 ligations for public sector entities (state bodies, public institutions, and municipalities):
              	 -	 Adopt and implement three-year programs for EE improvements.
              	 -	 Develop annual energy consumption analyses and monitor energy consumption.
              	 -	 Perform energy audits for buildings at least once every three years.
              	 -	  Develop a certification scheme for building energy use and provide building
                     energy certificates.
                     ­
              	 For implementation of the law, secondary legislation needs to be adopted. This in-
                 cludes the Rulebook on Building Energy Performance (that is, building codes) and the
                 Rulebook on Energy Audits. Already adopted is the Rulebook on Labeling the Energy
                 and Other Resources Consumption of Products. The Energy Law also authorizes the
                 establishment of an EE fund by means of a law, which would provide financial support
                 for the public and private sectors to implement the obligations for EE improvement
                 under the law.

              •	Strategy for energy development in FYR Macedonia until 2030 (adopted in April
                 2010). This strategy (GOM 2010a) establishes FYR Macedonia’s long-term goals in
                 energy development for the purpose of safe energy supply. While energy demand will
                 grow during the analyzed period (due to FYR Macedonia’s exceptionally low energy
                 consumption per capita in all sectors), the country is strongly dependent on energy
                 imports and faces a relatively high trade deficit in which the import of energy accounts
                 for a very large share. The fact that EE in all sectors is quite low provides an oppor-
                 tunity to moderate demand growth by significantly increasing EE in the production,
                 transmission, distribution, and utilization of energy. The strategy therefore sets targets
                 to reduce energy intensity by at least 30 percent by 2020 in comparison to 2006.

              •	Energy efficiency strategy until 2020 (Strategy for Improvement of the Energy Ef-
                 ficiency in FYR Macedonia until 2020). This umbrella document (GOM 2010c) for EE,
                 updated in 2010, outlines the institutional, legal, and financial framework for EE activi-
                 ties in the country. It sets national EE targets: a 9 percent savings in final energy con-
                 sumption by 2018 (equivalent to energy savings of 147.2 ktoe), compared to 2002–06
                 average energy consumption, and 20 percent savings of primary energy consump-
                 tion by 2020. Public buildings do not comprise a separate sector under the strategy,




26   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   CHAPTER 1
                 but are combined with the commercial sector. Together they are expected to reduce
                 their energy consumption by 24.19 ktoe/year in the last year of the period 2010–18,
                 compared to 2002–06 average energy consumption. For public buildings the strategy
                 places a high priority on EE investments in educational and health-care buildings, on
                 building energy certification, inspection of boilers, energy management, and informa-
                 tion campaigns. The EE strategy suggests as necessary the establishment of an EE
                 fund to support the implementation of a successful EE program and promotion of
                 investments. To comply with the EE strategy, municipalities are obligated to prepare
                 and submit EE action plans and energy audits of their buildings; a few municipalities
                 have already prepared such plans and submitted them to the energy agency.

              •	National Energy Efficiency Action Plan 2010–18. FYR Macedonia, as a contracting
                 party of the Energy Community Treaty, is required to prepare three National Energy
                 Efficiency Action Plans (NEEAPs) for the period 2010–18, following the EU Directive
                 2006/32/EC on energy end-use efficiency and energy services (ESD). The first NEEAP
                 was prepared and submitted to the Energy Community Secretariat on June 25, 2010
                 (GOM 2010b). The GOM started the adoption procedure in March 2011. The NEEAP
                 presents the recommended programs that will achieve the 9 percent energy savings
                 target specified in the EE strategy, as well as the implementation time frame, financial
                 means, and expected energy savings. As in the strategy, public buildings are included
                 in the commercial and services sector. The NEEAP puts priority on the public sector as
                 the easiest to address in the short term, as well as for its potential to lead commercial
                 sector actors by example. It also emphasizes that capacity for EE needs to be built in
                 both the MOE and the energy agency and that an EE fund should be established.




              NPEEPB ACTIVITIES TO DATE


              A report on NPEEPB was developed in 2011 with financing from the World Bank/Global
              Environmental Facility (GEF) Sustainable Energy Project. Under the coordination of the
              MOE, the work was carried out by a consulting team consisting of ENSI, TIMEL, and E3
              International (ENSI 2012). The objective of the NPEEPB is to prepare public buildings to
              make a significant contribution toward the national target of cutting energy consumption
              by 9 percent by 2018, as outlined in the EE strategy and the NEEAP, and in doing so, to
              support the commercial and services sector. Further program objectives include:




27   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   CHAPTER 1
              •	To provide support and incentivize public entities for implementation of their
                 obligations under the energy law
                 ­

              •	 To improve the conditions in public buildings in the country

              •	 To support the introduction of EE practices in the management of public buildings

              •	 To provide examples of EE practices to other sectors

              •	To encourage and facilitate the development of the market for EE services and prod-
                 ucts in the country

              The National Program will include all public buildings in Macedonia and will be imple-
              mented in two phases. Phase 1 (2012–18), overlapping with the NEEAP period, includes
              public buildings under the jurisdiction of eight ministries (see chapter 2), as well as the
              municipal administrative buildings in all 84 municipalities and the city of Skopje. These
              buildings comprise:

              •	Ministry office buildings

              •	Administrative buildings of all 84 municipalities and the city of Skopje

              •	Educational buildings (of primary and secondary public schools, public universities,
                 research institutes, and other education-related institutions)

              •	Kindergartens

              •	Health sector buildings (including hospitals, clinics, and ambulatories)

              •	Buildings for social care (including shelters and retirement homes)

              The ENSI report provides estimates of the energy use of the public building stock and its
              EE potential, based on the modeling of a large number of different building types (ENSI
              2012). The EE potential was estimated based on applying EE measures aimed at thermal
              and electricity savings that are cost-effective. The energy savings that could be achieved
              during program implementation are expected to amount to about one-third of current
              energy consumption and would require investments of about €95 million with an esti-
              mated average payback time of less than seven years. Details are presented in chapters 2
              and 7 of this report. In addition to physical investments, the program also proposes sup-
              port to public entities for energy audits and measurement and verification (M&V) activi-




28   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   CHAPTER 1
              ties, a capacity-building program for all stakeholders involved, and a marketing campaign
              for the program. These activities are estimated to cost an additional €12 million.

              The MOE will be responsible for the implementation of the NPEEPB. It is recommended
              in the program document that the MOE chair a program supervisory board that would
              include the ministries mentioned in chapter 2 and some nongovernmental actors, such
              as representatives from municipalities (for example, Association of the Units of Local Self
              Government, ZELS), academia, environmental groups, and the private sector. Day-to-day
              management of the program, including its implementation, monitoring, and evaluation,
              would be carried out by a program management unit (PMU). This unit should be autono-
              mous, with a clear mandate and its own budget. It could be located in the energy agency
              as a separate department. Details of the proposed institutional arrangements for the
              NPEEPB are elaborated in the ENSI report.

Characteristics of Public Buildings
Included in the NPEEPB
              As part of the development of the National Program for Energy Efficiency in Public Build-
              ings (NPEEPB), the Ministry of Economy (MOE) commissioned a study conducted by
              a consultant team led by Energy Saving International, AS (ENSI) to develop a detailed
              assessment of the technical characteristics of public buildings in Macedonia, the typical
              energy efficiency (EE) technologies applicable to these buildings, and the potential for
              energy savings through the application of these technologies (ENSI 2012). This chapter
              summarizes some of the major findings of that assessment.




              MAJOR SECTORS


              The ENSI assessment included public buildings under the jurisdiction of the following
              ministries: Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education and Science, Ministry of Local Self-
              Government, Ministry of Labor and Social Policy, MOE, Ministry of Environment and
              Physical Planning, Ministry of Transport and Communications, Ministry of Finance (MOF),
              and municipal administrative buildings in all 84 municipalities and the city of Skopje.
              These facilities were given priority in Phase 1 of the NPEEPB to be implemented during
              the period 2012–18.

              The ENSI study categorized the buildings in the following five sectors:

              •	Health care

              •	Education

              •	Social care

              •	Municipal administration	

              •	State administration	

              These were further subdivided into various subsectors. Using available data from a num-
              ber of sources, the study defined the number of entities, number of buildings, total floor
              area, and heated floor area for all. This information is summarized in table 2.1.

              As indicated in table 2.1, the public buildings market for Phase 1 of the NPEEPB consists
              of 2,441 public buildings with a total heated floor area of 2.27 million square meters (m2).




31   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   CHAPTER 2
               The education sector is by far is the largest, with 1,515 buildings (62.1 percent of the
               total) and 1.46 million m2 heated floor area (64.6 percent of the total). The next largest is
               the health sector, with about 20 percent of the buildings and 21.4 percent of the heated
               floor area. The social care sector has about 10 percent of the buildings and heated area.
               Municipal and state administrative sectors have very small shares of the public building
               stock and floor area.

               AGE OF BUILDING STOCK


               Information on the time of construction of the public buildings was compiled in the ENSI
               study. The data showed that 59 percent of the buildings were constructed before 1970,
               30 percent between 1971 and 1990, and only 11 percent after 1990.




               ENERGY CONSUMPTION


               The ENSI study collected data on energy consumption using a data collection form sent
               to the public buildings by the MOE. Some of the information received was incomplete




32   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   CHAPTER 2
                and inconsistent, and ENSI made appropriate estimations and adjustments to develop
                a profile of energy consumption in public buildings by sector and subsector for heating
                (including heating with fuels and with electricity; a share of 83 percent of total energy
                consumption) and for nonheating electrical usage (17 percent). This information is sum-
                marized at the sector level in table 2.2.

                The total baseline energy consumption of the buildings in the five sectors was estimated
                at about 506,599 megawatt-hours (MWh) or 43,560 toe.3 This represents about 20 percent
                of the energy consumption in the commercial and services sector in Macedonia.

                Table 2.3 shows that the specific energy consumption per unit of floor area is highest for
                the health sector (283 kilowatt-hours [kWh]/m2) and lowest for the education sector (202
                kWh/m2). The total energy cost is the highest for the state administration sector (€27.7/
                m2) followed by the health sector (€24.5/m2). The lowest energy cost is in the education
                sector (€16.2/m2) due to lower specific energy consumption and the use of firewood, the
                lowest price fuel, for heating in many schools. The average specific energy consumption
                across all building types is 214 kWh/m2 and the average energy cost is €18.7/m2.

              ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES


              The major EE measures examined in the ENSI study included the following.

              •	EE measures aimed at thermal energy savings:
              	 -	 Thermal insulation in outside walls
              	 -	 Replacement of existing windows and outside doors with new, energy-efficient
                    ones
              	 -	 Thermal insulation of the roof (attic)
              	 -	 Thermal insulation in the floor
              	 -	 Installation of automatic control (AC) systems in existing heating substations in
                    those public buildings connected to the district heating system
              	 -	 Reconstruction of boiler stations in existing hot water radiator heating systems
              	 -	 Installation of AC systems in boiler stations in existing hot water radiator heating
                    systems
              	 -	 Replacement of existing room stoves operating on firewood with new, highly ef-
                    ficient ones
              	 -	 Replacement of existing radiator masks in kindergartens with new ones, to enable
                    better emission of the heat produced from the radiator units

              •	EE measures aimed at electricity savings:
              	 -	 Improvement of lighting arrangements
              	 -	 Replacement of existing pumps in hot water supply systems with new EE pumps




              POTENTIAL FOR EE IMPROVEMENT


              ENSI estimated the energy savings potential using representative buildings as a model
              and proprietary software. In parallel, the model outputs were compared with the results
              of already implemented projects (by the United States Agency for International Develop-
              ment [USAID], World Bank, and United Nations Development Programme [UNDP]), avail-
              able energy audits, and energy analyses of similar buildings.

              In conducting the analysis, the public buildings were divided in 44 groups, which were
              further studied and subjected to estimations of their energy-savings potential. The EE
              potential was estimated by extrapolating the energy and monetary savings of representa-




34   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   CHAPTER 2
              tive buildings within each group. Only EE measures with an estimated payback time of
              less than 12 years were included.

              The results of this analysis as presented in the ENSI report are shown in table 2.3 for the
              “moderate investment” scenario that included the investments with an average payback
              period of 7 years. These results indicate that the potential energy savings are about 158
              gigawatt-hours (GWh) per year (13.6 million toe/year) or about 33 percent of the energy
              consumption. These energy savings would result in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG)
              emissions by about 39,000 tons CO2/year. The potential cost savings are about €14 mil-
              lion per year.4

              The investment required to achieve these energy and cost savings is €95.2 million, and
              the estimated average payback period is 6.8 years.




              4	Other benefits include the creation of local employment, estimated at 3,000 jobs, and reduction of energy
                 imports. Experiences from other countries show that public funding for EE investments results in addi-
                 tional tax income and reduced unemployment payments. Examples include the programs of the German
                 Development Bank (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, KfW) for energy-efficient building and rehabilitation in
                 the public and private sectors, which resulted in net income for the government in excess of 500 percent of
                 initial program costs (see Juelich 2011).

              to implement. They are impeded by the same barriers that have slowed down EE im-
              provements in other sectors of the economy, such as lack of information on EE potential
              and benefits, lack of trained personnel, lack of incentives, high transaction costs, and
              scarcity of financing. In addition, several barriers specific to the public sector further hold
              back sustained improvements in EE in this sector. Among them are public accounting,
              budgeting and procurement rules, financing constraints, and very limited staff capacity
              and motivation for identifying and implementing EE measures. Figure 3.1 lists the barriers
              to EE in the public sector.

              BARRIERS TO EE IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR IN FYR MACEDONIA


              The following discussion addresses barriers that are specific to the Former Yugoslav Re-
              public (FYR) Macedonia and that constrain the implementation of financial mechanisms
              that could be used to make investments to meet the objectives of the National Program
              for Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings (NPEEPB):

                  ublic accounting, budgeting, and procurement rules. Public institutions currently
              •	 P
                 have a very limited ability to retain the energy cost savings resulting from EE or other
                 cost-saving investments. Municipalities may only borrow in general obligations, to
                 be repaid from general revenues, which limits public sector incentives to pursue such
                 investments. Public tender procedures are complicated and rigid, particularly contract
                 evaluation criteria, awarding procedures, time schedules, fees, and contract condi-
                 tions (UNECE 2009). Procurement generally favors the lowest up-front costs, rather
                 than life-cycle costs. The new Law on Concessions and Public-Private Partnerships
                 allows the combination of design and works/services in one contract. This is relevant to
                 energy service company (ESCO) operations and other performance-based contracting.

              •	Financing restrictions for the central government and municipalities. Because of
                 ongoing austerity measures following the global financial crisis, both the national gov-
                 ernment and the municipalities are facing considerable fiscal pressures that limit the
                 availability of budget funds for investment in general and for EE improvements and
                 implementation of their EE action plans in particular. Most public institutions — with
                 the exception of some municipalities (see below) — cannot take on commercial debt.
                 These public institutions still generally require additional approvals by the Ministry of
                 Finance (MOF) in order to do so.

                  imited borrowing capacity of municipalities. Since 2002 the 84 municipalities in
              •	 L
                 FYR Macedonia and the city of Skopje are undergoing a gradual decentralization
                 process. The decentralization gives them increased responsibilities for the delivery of
                 social services, particularly education (see box 3.1 for details on the current funding
                 responsibilities in the education sector), and some revenue-raising ability. In addi-
                 tion to receiving funds from the central government (conditional and unconditional
                 grants), municipalities have income from communal fees, certain taxes (property tax,
                 property sales tax, and so on), and a share of value added tax (VAT, ~4.5 percent) and
                 personal income tax (3 percent). Most municipalities can now borrow funds within
                 limits as regulated by law (Law on Financing Municipalities, last amended in 2011),
                 provided they get the consent of the MOF (which may depend on their stage of fiscal
                 decentralization) and are able to provide the necessary guarantees and collaterals.

                 Borrowing, however, is subject to conditions, such as: (i) the total amount of short-
                 term debt incurred cannot exceed the revenues of the previous year, and (ii) debt ser-
                 vice for long-term debt is limited to 30 percent of revenues of the previous year. As a
                 result, the overall municipal debt ceiling at the beginning of 2012 amounted to about
                 €100 million. This is a fairly limited amount, considering the vast needs for infrastruc-
                 ture investments (including for EE in public buildings and street lighting). Part of this
                 debt ceiling will be used in the coming years by municipalities to borrow for infrastruc-
                 ture projects from the World Bank-funded Municipal Services Improvement Project
                 (MSIP) (see box 4.3).

                    AMunicipalities receive block grants from the central budget, which are used
                    mostly for teachers’ salaries and operations and maintenance (O&M), particu-
                    larly students’ transportation and utility bills. The MOF still pays for invest-
                    ments, but this responsibility is scheduled to be devolved to municipalities
                    during the next few years. According to an analysis by the Association of the
                    Units of Local Self Government (ZELS), the municipal deficit in the education
                    sector amounts to 1.1 billion denar (about $24 million).

                  imited willingness of municipalities to use debt, especially on commercial terms,
              •	 L
                 to borrow for infrastructure projects. Given their brief experience with fiscal responsi-
                 bility and limited ability to incur debt, even those municipalities with a sufficient debt
                 capacity and available collateral prefer to access concessional financing with some
                 grant components. This is available, for example, from the World Bank’s MSIP. The
                 experience of the World Bank’s FYR Macedonia Sustainable Energy Project (MSEP,
                 World Bank 2012b) has shown, however, that municipalities are willing to gradually
                 move from grant funding of EE projects to forms of financing that require substantial
                 equity or cofinancing contributions.

              •	The limited willingness of commercial banks to lend to the public sector. Access
                 to commercial financing is limited to a few municipalities because local banks are gen-

                   erally not enthusiastic to lend to municipalities. Banks emphasize that little financial
                   information is available from municipalities, since their bank accounts are kept at the
                   Treasury, and budgets are rarely made public in sufficient detail. Furthermore, mu-
                   nicipalities have restrictions on the assets that could serve as collateral: for example,
                   buildings used for essential public services, such as education, cannot be pledged
                   as collateral. The introduction of a partial credit guarantee through the United States
                   Agency for International Development (USAID) Development Credit Authority (DCA)
                   was thought to increase the willingness of commercial banks to lend to municipalities
                   for EE, but has resulted in only one project so far.5 While many countries set up special
                   municipal lending programs through their national development banks, which can
                   be accessed by municipalities through commercial banks (for example, the German
                   Development Bank [Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, KfW] in Germany has several pro-
                   grams for EE retrofits of schools and other municipal infrastructure), this option is not
                   available in FYR Macedonia, since the 2009 Law (GOM 2009) on the FYR Macedonian
                   Bank for Development Promotion (MBDP) does not allow the MBDP to lend to the
                   municipal sector.

              •	Limited institutional capacities of government institutions, municipalities, and the
                 private sector:
              	 -	  Energy Agency. This agency was established under the Law of Energy and is
                     tasked with several important responsibilities, such as: (i) to collect and process the
                     EE programs from the local self-government units and to prepare a report on the
                     compliance of the programs with the EE Strategy and the Action Plan, (ii) to collect
                     the summary reports from energy audits performed in the previous year and to
                     develop and submit the annual reports on energy audits performed every year,
                     and (iii) to develop and submit to the Minister of Economy (MOE) contents and
                     templates of reports from energy audits performed in the public sector entities’
                     buildings during the previous year. These tasks are important for the development
                     of the NPEEPB, but the agency has a staff of only six and thus insufficient capac-
                     ity to manage their completion. In addition, the Energy Agency has important
                     responsibilities in the development of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan
                     (NEEAP) and related reporting tasks, such as preparing relevant rulebooks for
                     energy auditing and labeling and providing energy auditor training.
              	 -	  Municipalities. The capacity to manage debt, carry out procurement for goods
                     and services, and develop and implement EE action plans varies considerably
                     among FYR Macedonian municipalities. Several municipalities are quite advanced,


              5	   The limited interest in the DCA facility is most likely the result of the need for MOF approval for municipal
                   borrowing, the lack of interest by commercial banks to finance public institutions, and the availability of
                   financing from MSIP that provides more attractive terms than commercial financing through the DCA.

                 skills in the preparation of bankable EE projects is pervasive. Municipalities also lack
                 the necessary professional profiles for implementing the required action plans.

              These barriers will have to be addressed before or in parallel with the development and
              preparation of a financing mechanism.

Financing Options
              OPTIONS IDENTIFIED IN PREVIOUS STUDIES


              In general, the financing options available to public sector institutions can be character-
              ized on a scale ranging from full public budget financing to full commercial financing, with
              several options in between. Figure 4.1 shows this range among financing options that are
              typically available to the public sector in the region.

              The following discussion presents a number of financing options that were mentioned in
              the Energy Saving International, AS (ENSI) report.6

              6	   Not described here are two of the options discussed in the ENSI report: municipal bonds and donor buyout
                   of commercial loans. Both mechanisms are untested in the region for the purpose of EE financing in the pub-
                   lic sector. Many other financial mechanisms exist, for example, carbon finance. The NPEEPB would reduce
                   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and could be considered under the clean development mechanism (CDM)
                   to benefit from additional revenues from the sale of the carbon credits. A report by Ryding (2011) provides a
                   complete overview of the financial support facilities that are currently available in the region for the financing
                   of investments and technical assistance (TA) for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. Most of
                   them are targeted at the private sector, however.

              •	Financing by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) may be provided as a grant or repaid
                 through budget capture, using government budget allocations, and/or international
                 financial institution (IFI)/donor funds. Under this approach, the MOF would provide the
                 funds to pay for the up-front cost of energy efficiency (EE) projects. If the Government of
                 FYR Macedonia (GOM) is not willing or able to provide the funds as investment grants,
                 it could take “repayment” in the form of reduced outlays for energy bills of state institu-
                 tions in future years. The size of the reduced outlay would be based on the amount of
                 measured savings. So the flow of funds to pay for EE improvements would follow the
                 same flow as the normal appropriations from the MOF. The repayment to the MOF
                 could be complete or partial. The latter would provide more incentives to public entities
                 to participate in the program, since they would receive a share of the savings achieved.

              •	Energy efficiency fund. In many countries where the availability of commercial fund-
                 ing for EE is quite limited and/or financial institutions (FIs) exhibit high risk aversion,
                 governments have created EE funds that provide direct financing for EE projects,
                 sometimes requiring cofinancing from commercial banks. Such funds can be struc-
                 tured to aggressively seek out projects; market EE loans; work closely with potential
                 borrowers; and perform loan intake, supervision, and collection services. Several funds
                 in the region — the Romanian and the Bulgarian EE funds (box 4.1) among them —
                 are managed by independent professional fund managers. Alternatively, existing
                 financial institutions could manage such funds. Many funds are fairly broad in that
                 they serve a range of different sectors (public/private) and provide financing for EE as
                 well as renewable energy projects. Depending on the needs of clients and the finan-
                 cial sector, they may offer different products such as loans, guarantees, and various
                 capacity-building and project preparation and implementation services.

              •	Dedicated credit line, implemented through commercial banks. Such credit lines
                 may be established by a public entity (such as a government agency and/or donor
                 organization) to enable the financing of EE projects by a private sector organization
                 (bank or financial institution). A credit line is most appropriate when the commercial
                 financial market is less mature and local financial institutions are not undertaking much
                 financing of EE projects, due to lack of knowledge and understanding of the charac-
                 teristics and benefits of EE projects and/or limited liquidity. The donor often requires
                 that the recipient of the credit line contribute an equal share of each loan from its own
                 funds to encourage proper credit and risk analysis and to leverage public funding.

              •	Risk sharing program — partial credit guarantee (PCG). Such a program, with fund-
                 ing from a donor or public entity, is established to reduce the private sector’s risk in
                 financing EE projects (by sharing the risk through a guarantee mechanism), thereby
                 enabling increased private sector lending to EE. This is a suitable mechanism where

                   the commercial financing market is somewhat more mature, and local financial institu-
                   tions are willing to consider financing EE but are concerned about the potential risks
                   of such projects. Experience in various countries shows that loan/credit guarantees
                   have sometimes been successful in stimulating EE lending from primary lenders.7 PCG
                   facilities typically provide a 50 percent guarantee on loss due to defaults on EE loans
                   of a commercial bank participating in the program. This means that, while the risk as-
                   sociated with the loan transaction is reduced, the lender still has a substantial amount
                   of its capital on the line and will therefore carefully appraise the creditworthiness of
                   the borrower and the viability of the underlying transaction. The reduced risk for the
                   lender may result in lower collateral requirements for the borrower.

              •	Financing through energy service companies (ESCOs); creation of a public ESCO
                 or “super” ESCO. ESCOs or other types of energy service providers offer a broad
                 range of services, including providing or arranging commercial financing (to public
                 agencies, industries, housing associations, and so on) under a performance-based
                 agreement, in which guarantees are provided for the energy savings achieved. The
                 client, in this case the public agency, makes payments to the ESCO only upon the
                 satisfaction of the guarantees, thereby eliminating much of the technical and perfor-
                 mance risk for the agency (Singh and others 2010). In cases where the energy services
                 industry is weak or nonexistent, it could be strengthened by initially creating a public
                 ESCO, for example, within a utility. This entity would perform ESCO services and sub-
                 contract project implementation to private sector companies.




              THE PROS AND CONS OF THE DIFFERENT FINANCING OPTIONS


              The five EE financing options introduced in the previous section are all used in the
              region, but they do not all appear viable to support the financing of public sector EE
              activities as envisioned in the National Program for Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings
              (NPEEPB). Table 4.1 provides a list of the conditions under which each option should ide-
              ally be used, its pros and cons, possible issues to be addressed, and examples of where
              in the region and elsewhere the financing option has been introduced.

                   in Bulgaria and Macedonia. These programs have supported both public and private EE project financing.

 47        THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB          |   CHAPTER 4
              The two most flexible financing mechanisms that would be able to serve all public enti-
              ties are (i) financing through the MOF, similar to the current Municipal Services Improve-
              ment Program (MSIP) (World Bank 2009b), and (ii) an EE fund. While the MSIP has some
              limitations, in that municipalities need approval of the MOF to be eligible for project
              financing, these could be overcome with other forms of securitization (see chapter 6).
              For public entities that are dependent entirely on the central budget, financing condi-
              tions and mechanisms that would enable them to participate would have to be explored
              during the detailed design of the financing mechanism. These two financing options can
              also accommodate the provision of other services that are considered necessary for the
              successful implementation of the NPEEPB — assistance and support for energy auditing,
              project design, procurement, and measurement and verification (M&V). One of the main
              questions to be answered for the establishment of an EE fund is whether to establish it as
              a new entity or whether it can be operated by an existing organization, such as a com-
              mercial financial institution. This will be discussed in detail in chapter 6.

              The credit line and PCG cannot, in the near future, serve the largest part of the public
              sector market — that is, those public entities that are not creditworthy. But the dedicated
              credit line is still included as one of the three financing options to be discussed further,
              since there is some, albeit limited, experience with it in FYR Macedonia. Municipal bor-
              rowing on commercial credit terms is taking place in FYR Macedonia on a limited basis.
              Five municipalities have commercial loans, 15 municipalities are participating in a World
              Bank program that provides concessional loans to municipalities, and 1 municipality has
              a loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Each loan
              must be approved by the MOF and the municipal council. Commercial banks are lending
              to municipalities at 7–9 percent for 5 to 7 years, but the maturities can be stretched to as
              long as 10 years depending on the financial condition of the municipality. The banks are
              providing a 1-year grace period on repayment. For private borrowers, the banks require
              collateral up to 130 percent. Meanwhile, the law prohibits municipalities from using
              public property for collateral, but the banks may place a lien on a municipality’s bank ac-
              count, into which it can be asked to deposit its revenues. It is unclear if any bank has ever
              created such a lien mechanism. Instead, loan security is provided by the MOF, through a
              repayment guarantee to the banks. Alongside ongoing decentralization and the increas-
              ing autonomy of municipalities, commercial financing of municipal public infrastructure
              will become more important and widespread in the future, as it already is in other coun-
              tries of the region (NALAS 2012). Of the four banks interviewed, none expressed interest
              in financing municipalities due to concerns regarding collateral, creditworthiness, inde-
              pendent revenues, and other factors.




48   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   CHAPTER 4
              The PCG instrument will be excluded from further consideration since there is already
              one ongoing in FYR Macedonia. The Development Credit Authority (DCA), financed by
              the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), has been established
              with two commercial financial institutions, but there has been only one municipal EE proj-
              ect supported to date. The reasons for the slow uptake appear to be: the reluctance of
              municipalities (they need to be certified by the MOF and are unaccustomed to borrowing
              commercially for infrastructure projects), the availability of better financing terms from the
              MSIP, and banks’ unfamiliarity with this kind of client. The DCA is now being restructured
              to focus more on small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

              The concept of the public entity engaging an ESCO to provide EE services (including
              financing) under the energy saving performance contracting (ESPC) approach — with
              payback generated by energy savings — is intriguing. In FYR Macedonia, however, this
              concept is not yet a reality. Construction companies, design institutes, and energy con-
              sultants are still quite content to stick to their basic lines of business and/or are unable
              to provide the wide range of services required from a full-service ESCO. They may also
              lack the capital and creditworthiness to undertake multiple projects, payments for which
              might stretch out over several years. The most important barriers, however, are related to
              public budgeting, accounting, and procurement rules:

              •	Many public agencies still receive annual budgets for their operating costs (including
                 energy) from the central budget. If energy costs were reduced due to energy savings,
                 budgets could be reduced.

              •	Accounting systems do not clearly distinguish energy savings from other cash items —
                 under the current system, municipalities may only borrow in general obligations, to be
                 repaid from general municipal revenues.

               Some key issues to be considered in the determination of financing mechanisms that
               can be considered viable under the current (or somewhat modified) conditions ruling the
               public, service, and financial sectors in FYR Macedonia are listed in table 4.2. The main
               considerations are:

              their major characteristics will be introduced (see table 4.3 for a comparison). Detailed
              implementation plans are proposed in chapter 6.

              Option 1: Independent, Full-service FYR Macedonia Energy Efficiency Fund

              The Energy Law (GOM 2011a) provides for the establishment of an EE fund (Article 130),
              which would disburse support for the public and private sectors when implementing ob-
              ligations under the law (Article 131). The fund and its institutions would be governed by
              its bylaws; an operational manual would specify the specific rules and regulations under

                    Bulgaria Energy Efficiency Fund (BEEF)

                    The fund was established in 2006 and capitalized with $15 million grant funds
                    from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the governments of Austria and
                    Bulgaria, and several private shareholders. It is overseen by a nonpolitical
                    board of directors, which includes the government, the private sector, and
                    NGOs.

                    A competitively selected fund manager is responsible for the operation of the
                    fund and is compensated on a performance basis. The fund operates on a fully
                    commercial basis, including covering administration costs and defaults.

                    The fund serves mostly the SME industry, and the public and residential
                    sectors, with about 60 percent of projects in municipalities. It provides loans
                    to end users, portfolio loans to ESCOs, and loan guarantees.

                    The fund is financially sustainable and to date has financed or guaranteed
                    over 160 projects totaling $80 million.

              which the fund would finance EE investments in public sector entities. A board of direc-
              tors comprised of representatives from both the public and private/nongovernmental
              organization (NGO) sectors would oversee the fund.

              The fund could be capitalized initially from international financial institution (IFI)/inter-
              national donor funds. Those could be channeled through the MOF or go directly to the
              fund. It would be managed by an independent, professional fund management company
              (“fund manager”). Eligible to participate in a competitive selection of the fund manager
              would be a consortium consisting of local or international banks and entities with techni-
              cal and financial expertise; or an existing FYR Macedonian entity, such as a commercial
              bank operating in FYR Macedonia.

              The mission of the fund would be to finance EE projects implemented by municipalities
              and other public entities on a commercial basis, using the energy cost savings resulting

                    Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund (R2E2 Fund)

                    The fund was established in 2005 and is capitalized with an $8 million Interna-
                    tional Development Association (IDA) credit. The fund is overseen by a board
                    of directors, which includes the government, private sector, and academia
                    and operates on a fully commercial basis.

                    The fund currently implements a World Bank/GEF project that provides EE
                    services in public sector facilities—for example, municipal street lighting,
                    schools, hospitals, and administration buildings (average size about $100,000).
                    It is expected to finance projects worth $8.7 million between 2012 and 2015
                    and to provide technical assistance (TA) for project preparation and capacity
                    building.

                    The fund provides loans to municipalities and public entities with revenue
                    streams independent of the state budget, and energy service agreements
                    (ESAs) to schools and other public facilities, which are not legally independent:

                      Loans will be provided under an ESA, whereby the fund will also provide
                    •	
                      additional services against a service fee (conduct a preliminary screening,
                      carry out the procurement of design and works, oversee construction and
                      commissioning, pay the contractors for services provided, and monitor the
                      subprojects). The loans will be treated as municipal debt, with fixed repay-
                      ment obligations to be made within their budget provisions in future years.
                      The amount of the repayments will be designed to allow fund clients to repay
                      the investment costs and service fees from the accrued energy cost savings.

                      Energy service agreements. The fund will first determine the average
                    •	
                      baseline energy use, identify the general scope of a subproject, develop
                      bidding documents, conduct the procurement, finance the project, oversee
                      construction and commissioning, and monitor the subproject. The ESA will
                      obligate the facility to pay the baseline energy costs (with adjustments for
                      energy prices, usage, and so on) over the life of the agreement. In such
                      cases, there is no loan or debt incurred by the client entity. With these pay-
                      ments, the fund will pay the energy bills on the facility’s behalf and retain
                      the balance to cover its investment cost and service fee of up to 10 years.
                      The agreement will also be designed so that the duration can be adjusted
                      if the fund recovers its full investment earlier or later.

                    To support the build-up of an ESCO industry in Armenia, the fund uses simpli-
                    fied ESCO contracts to shift some performance risks to private construction
                    firms/contractors.

              from the projects to repay the financing costs. The repayments would be used by the
              fund to finance additional projects, thereby making it a revolving fund. Several such funds
              have been established in the region (box 4.1 presents various aspects of the EE funds in
              Bulgaria and Armenia).

              The objective of an independent, full–service fund is to provide EE financing and
              ­
              associated services to all public sector entities. The fund would be established as an
              independent,­nongovernmental entity. It would be staffed with a managing director and
              staff with technical, financial/credit, transaction, procurement, and outreach expertise. It
              would offer different products to different segments of the public institutions.

              Initially, two products would be offered, targeted at two different kinds of public sector
              clients:

              •	The fund would provide loan financing for EE projects for municipalities and public
                 entities with revenue streams independent of the state budget (for example, munici-
                 palities that have completed fiscal decentralization, universities, hospitals, and so on)
                 and with financial discipline and adequate administrative and institutional capacity for
                 project implementation. Loans would be treated as municipal debt, with fixed repay-
                 ment obligations to be made within their budget provisions in future years. With these
                 borrowers the fund would enter into loan agreements that will define the terms of the
                 loans and certain additional services with associated fees. Such services could include
                 developing bidding documents for services related to project implementation, carry-
                 ing out the procurement of design and works on behalf of municipalities, overseeing
                 construction and commissioning, paying contractors for services provided (from the
                 proceeds of the loan), and monitoring the projects.

              •	For all other public sector entities (without their own budgets or capacity to implement
                 projects), the fund would offer comprehensive energy service agreements (ESAs) under
                 which the fund provides a very broad range of services, performing as an energy service
                 provider and undertaking all of the actions needed to identify and implement the EE
                 project. The ESA would obligate the participating organization to pay fixed payments
                 equal to 95–100 percent of the baseline energy costs to the fund during the life of the
                 agreement; these payments would be used to pay for all energy bills of the facility and
                 reimburse the fund for the investment cost and service fee. In this way, EE projects could
                 be financed without the municipality or public entity having to take on debt.

              In addition, to the extent grant funds are provided by the GOM or donors for central
              government facilities, the fund shall have a separate “window” for offering partial grant
              funding for such projects.

                    BOX 4.2 EXAMPLE OF A MUNICIPAL CREDIT LINE IN THE REGION: SERBIA

                    The German Development Bank (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, KfW) is
                    launching a dedicated credit line for municipal environmental infrastructure
                    and EE investments in Serbia. A total amount of €100 million will be made
                    available and disbursed to eligible municipalities and public sector utility
                    companies via Serbian on-lending banks, following the standard procedures
                    for municipal borrowing. This is a continuation of the current KfW project on
                    “Municipal Infrastructure via the Financial Sector.” To provide more incentives
                    for Serbian municipalities to invest in EE and environmental projects, KfW and
                    the European Commission signed an agreement at the end of 2011. A grant
                    scheme will be implemented to award grants of 15−20 percent of the loan
                    amount financed from the KfW credit line after their successful completion.

              Option 2: Dedicated Municipal EE Credit Line with an Existing Financial Institution

              A financial institution would be selected, preferably on a competitive basis, to operate a
              credit line. It would set up a separate program management unit (PMU) with a managing
              director and several staff. The PMU would report to the executive management and be in
              charge of identifying, appraising, and selecting projects and developing loan agreements
              with the public facilities. The final approval of the projects would be the responsibility
              of the executive management of the financial institution. An advisory board with GOM
              participation would provide guidance to the PMU.

              Eligible clients would be municipalities and other public entities that can demonstrate
              creditworthiness. It may not be possible to operate several windows for different types of
              clients and requirements for value-added services in the credit line option. Procurement
              would be done by municipalities themselves, but perhaps with the help of a procurement
              consultant. While a variety of EE credit lines exist in the region, none specifically target
              municipalities and none of the local banks interviewed expressed an interest in lending to
              the municipal sector.

                    A PMU within the MOF is implementing the World Bank Municipal Services
                    Improvement Project (MSIP). The key elements of the MSIP are:

                      A total of $75 million is being made available between 2009 and 2017,

                      including 9 million for TA/grants.

                      Creditworthy municipalities that have received approval from the MOF to

                      provement projects are eligible, but only few have been proposed so far.

56   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   CHAPTER 4
              conditions and mechanisms would have to be explored during the detailed design of the
              financing mechanism that would enable them to participate. For example, some funds
              might be provided as grant funding to central government agencies.

              Public sector entities would pay back loans from the energy cost savings of the imple-
              mented EE projects. This could be carried out through “budget capture,” where “repay-
              ment” would take place in the form of lowered outlays to the public entities in future
              years. The size of the reduced outlay would be based on the amount of measured savings.
              The flow of funds to pay for EE improvements would thus follow the same path as the nor-
              mal appropriations from the MOF. The MOF should allow the institutions to keep a por-
              tion of the savings as an incentive for their active participation and support in identifying
              and implementing the EE projects. This would probably require some changes in public
              budgeting procedures. The development of such procedures could be supported by TA.

              The program would be implemented by a PMU within the MOF. The PMU could de facto
              carry out many of the tasks that the EE fund would carry out under option 1, such as
              marketing, review of applications, monitoring and reporting, and assisting public entities
              with project preparation activities (such as a review of feasibility studies, preparation of
              detailed design and bidding documents, and supervision of construction activities). This
              would build upon experiences with the current MSIP project (see box 4.3) and the pilot
              projects implemented under the World Bank/GEF Macedonia Sustainable Energy Project
              (MSEP). Unless the size and skills of the MSIP PMU can be expanded, this would require
              the establishment of a new PMU with the necessary staffing and technical skills to carry
              out such responsibilities. The PMU would either have to charge a fee to municipalities for
              such services or cover their costs from public budgets.

              But while building some capacity and demonstrating the benefits of EE retrofits in public
              buildings, this financing mechanism is not sustainable — once the funds are disbursed
              and/or the project is closed, the commercial sector is not necessarily going to take over
              funding of public sector EE projects. It might however be an option that the energy cost
              savings are not automatically deducted from next years’ budgets but instead provide
              the basis for a revolving fund that could operate over a longer period (see the Armenian
              example in box 4.1).



              Comparison of the Three Options

              The main characteristics of the three financing options are compared in table 4.3.

Financing Sources
              POTENTIAL FINANCING SOURCES FOR INVESTMENT FUNDS
              AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE


              For implementation of the first phase of the National Program for Energy Efficiency in
              Public Buildings (NPEEPB), the total costs are estimated at about €107 million — €95 mil-
              lion alone for energy efficiency (EE) investments and €12 million for technical assistance
              (TA) (ENSI 2012). It is assumed that the financing mechanisms identified in this report
              would be able to implement about 50 percent of the investments identified8 (see chap-
              ter 7). Most of the funding will have to come from sources other than central and local
              government budgets due to the tight fiscal environment. This section surveys the relevant
              activities and plans of the international organizations that have in the past contributed
              funding for EE activities in Former Yugoslav Republic (FYR) Macedonia.



              Government Budget

              Due to austerity measures, special funding for EE investments is not expected to be
              made available from the central government budget in the near future.



              IFIs/International Donors

              Potential international financial institutions (IFIs) and donors include:

              •	The World Bank is a possible source of financing for the NPEEPB, preferably in the
                 form of an EE fund or through the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Such funding could be
                 available starting in 2014, based on a request from the Government of FYR Macedonia
                 (GOM).

              •	The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is currently pre-
                 paring the Western Balkan Energy Service Company (ESCO) Program for the funding
                 of public sector EE investments and is planning to provide TA to improve the enabling
                 environment for ESCO operations, and to support ESCO project preparation and
                 development of financial products for ESCO projects (see, for example, Miller [2012]).
                 The ESCOs are already eligible to apply for funding from the EBRD’s Western Balkans



              8	   This assumption is based on an informal assessment of the potential willingness of the various financing
                   sources to dedicate resources for EE in public buildings in FYR Macedonia.

                 targeted at private sector lending, but improvements in public buildings with energy
                 savings of at least 30 percent are among the eligible projects. The WeBSEFF includes
                 an institutional capacity-building component to address deficiencies in the regula-
                 tory framework and other obstacles to the development of the market for sustainable
                 energy projects. The EBRD is currently developing a regional municipal infrastructure
                 development fund (MIDF), together with the German Development Bank (Kredi-
                 tanstalt für Wiederaufbau, KfW), and with possible funding from the European Union
                 (EU). The MIDF will focus on those municipalities that have borrowing constraints, low
                 capacity of project implementation, and need for training and support. It is expected
                 to be active from 2013 to 2014. If EE investments in public buildings are eligible
                 investments, the MIDF could support the NPEEPB’s implementation in parallel to any
                 specific financing mechanism as discussed in this report.

              •	 T
                 ergy Efficiency Investments for Climate Change Mitigation Project (FEEI)10 is designed
                 to establish a public-private partnership investment fund with a target capital of €250
                 million and to develop a pipeline of new and existing projects to be financed by it in
                 countries in Southeast Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia. The energy agency
                 is the national implementing agency for FYR Macedonia. A project pipeline was
                 identified (based on a survey of municipalities and project developers) that includes
                 26 proposals with a total project size of €33.8 million, and requests for financing in the
                 amount of €17.4 million. Twelve of those projects were investigated in greater detail
                 with the aim of presenting them to the investment fund developer. Their total project
                 costs were €16.2 million and total finance requirements €9.6 million.11 The project is
                 also providing assistance to national governments and local authorities for economic,
                 institutional, and regulatory reforms for the support of investment projects. The FEEI
                 could thus contribute to accomplishing the NPEEPB goals, but only indirectly, not as a
                 direct financing source for the financing mechanism.

                 support of the NPEEPB is possible, but no decisions will be made before the adoption
                 of the program by the GOM.

61   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   CHAPTER 5
              •	The Global Environment Facility (GEF). FYR Macedonia has an allocation of $2–3
                 million in the next GEF cycle. The GEF funds could possibly fund transactions and
                 institution building under the NPEEPB, perhaps in parallel with an IFI-financed project.
                 If the World Bank were to finance a project from 2014 onwards, it could be coordinat-
                 ed with a GEF project to fund TA and investment incentives.

              •	Carbon finance. EE improvement projects mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions;
                 they could be eligible for carbon finance, thus accessing financial resources to reduce
                 their incremental costs. Financial flows (carbon credits) start only once the underlying
                 project has been successfully implemented and is operational. Given that the NPEEPB
                 would result in reducing GHG emissions by about 39,000 tons carbon dioxide (CO2)/
                 year — based on Energy Saving International AS (ENSI) estimations — development
                 of the carbon finance component should be explored.



              EU Funding

              EU funding can come from the following:

                 nstrument for pre-accession assistance (IPA). There is strong interest among the
              •	 I
                 EU delegation that FYR Macedonia contribute to a potential financial platform for
                 EE in public buildings through IPA funds (grants). In the current (2007–13) planning
                 cycle more than €100 million was made available, mostly for projects in the transport
                 and environmental sector. Building the capacity of the Ministry of Economy (MOE) to
                 implement the energy acquis is another activity to be supported. The 2014–18 cycle
                 might provide an opportunity to apply for investment and TA funds in support of the
                 NPEEPB. Though a new financial framework is currently being developed for the IPA
                 II, funds under this framework will not be available before 2015. Hopefully EE projects
                 will be among the eligible types of projects. Other funds might also become avail-
                 able in the short term, particularly from the Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) operational
                 initiative of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, to support
                 preparatory activities of the NPEEPB.

              •	The Green for Growth Fund12 in Southeast Europe was initiated by the European
                 Investment Bank (EIB) and KfW. Its shares are owned by donors, IFIs, and private in-
                 vestors. The aim is to serve all of the main groups of potential borrowers — small and
                 medium enterprises (SMEs), private households, energy service companies, and so

                 Halkbank received a €5 million loan from the fund, to contribute to the development
                 of the EE lending operations of the Bank with private households and businesses.

              •	European Investment Bank (EIB). The TA facilities established by the EIB and the EU
                 — ELENA European Local Energy Assistance, Joint European Support for Sustainable
                 Investment in City Areas, and JASPERS Joint Assistance to Support Projects in Euro-
                 pean Regions — are in general available to EU member states only.



              Bilateral Donors

              Bilateral donors include the following:

              •	The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) established
                 the Development Credit Authority (DCA) with $9 million, with the participation of two
                 local banks (Unibanka and NLB Leasing).13 As mentioned earlier, demand from the
                 public sector has been low — Karpos is the only municipality that received a loan un-
                 der the DCA — partially because concessionary financing from the Municipal Services
                 Improvement Program (MSIP) is available to municipalities. The USAID has therefore
                 decided to refocus the DCA to private sector clients, and new initiatives related to
                 financing the NPEEPB are not in the USAID pipeline for the next few years; however,
                 the USAID may provide additional training on energy auditing, ESCOs, and so on.

              •	The German Development Bank (KfW) is currently funding a credit line for residen-
                 tial, commercial, and industrial clients with Procredit. In other countries (for example,
                 Serbia; see box 4.2) KfW has credit lines that are targeted at municipalities and are in
                 high demand. KfW and the EBRD are currently developing a regional municipal infra-
                 structure development fund (see above, under the EBRD).

              •	No other donors (such as Austria or Switzerland) are currently supporting energy or
                 public sector projects in FYR Macedonia or have signaled intentions to do so in the
                 near future.

              Commercial Banks

              As mentioned in chapter 2, commercial banks are reluctant to lend to public sector enti-
              ties. Several municipalities have taken commercial loans, but the majority have problems
              accessing commercial financing due to lack of information and, possibly, issues with col-
              lateral. As long as municipalities have access to concessional financing (through the MSIP
              or similar instruments), they will be reluctant to consider higher-cost commercial loans.



              NPEEPB FINANCIAL SUPPORT: CONSEQUENCES AND NECESSARY ACTIONS


              The above survey of potential financing sources shows some availability of international
              funding for direct and indirect support of the NPEEPB. It also shows that many donors
              seem to favor public sector financing through local FIs, since this is more sustainable
              and can leverage commercial financing. Because decentralization is not as advanced in
              FYR Macedonia as in other countries in the region, its public sector has fewer financing
              options than many neighboring countries. Nevertheless, the EBRD and KfW are consid-
              ering programs that might be combined with other funding sources for implementation
              of the NPEEPB.

              A promising direct funding option appears to be a combination of World Bank/GEF/
              EU-IPA funding. All three sources could provide investment funds as well as technical
              assistance for capacity building, and they would be able to do so under any of the three
              recommended financial mechanisms. Other donors could offer investment and TA sup-
              port from their respective programs to complement the financing and implementation
              program adopted by the GOM. In this respect, the upcoming EBRD/KfW regional mu-
              nicipal fund seems particularly relevant. Not only would such an option provide excellent
              leverage, but it would also allow all interested donors to participate in the program while
              ensuring coordination under a single government-led initiative.

              The GOM (MOF) would need to consider these options and determine the most ap-
              propriate ones. Should the GOM agree with the World Bank on financing to support the
              NPEEPB, it could be developed over the next year or two. The GEF focal point in the
              GOM, the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning, would need to endorse such a
              proposal and allocate sufficient funding within the next GEF cycle for submission to the
              GEF Secretariat for consideration. Finally, the GOM (MOE) would apply to the EU Del-
              egation for IPA funds to finance the NPEEPB.

Implementation Plan
              THREE FINANCING OPTIONS: COMMON FEATURES OF IMPLEMENTATION


              As indicated earlier in this report, the former Yugoslav Republic (FYR) Macedonia has es-
              tablished a comprehensive strategic and legal framework for a reformed and sustainable
              energy sector with a strong emphasis on energy efficiency (EE). The Energy Law, adopted
              in 2011, and the related EE strategy and National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP)
              provide the legislative and policy framework for implementing the EE actions in public
              buildings and facilities. This chapter identifies the major elements of the EE strategy for
              municipal and public facilities that are common to the three financing options that are
              identified in this report — the EE fund, EE credit line, and Municipal Energy Efficiency Im-
              provement Program (MEEIP).



              Requirements for EE Plans

              Municipalities in FYR Macedonia are required to develop EE plans and provide them to the
              energy agency. A number of municipalities have already initiated activities for the develop-
              ment of such EE action plans. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has
              assisted some of the municipalities in developing their plans, while other municipalities
              have moved forward without assistance from donors. In all three of the proposed financ-
              ing schemes, there is provision for technical assistance (TA) to assist the municipalities and
              public entities to comply with the requirements of developing their EE plans.



              Energy Audits

              The NEEAP requires the municipalities to conduct energy audits of their buildings and fa-
              cilities. Some activities have been initiated by municipalities to conduct such audits, while
              others may need TA for conducting audits. In all of the proposed financing options, it is
              anticipated that TA funds will be available to assist the municipalities and public entities to
              conduct energy audits.



              Role of the Energy Agency

              Under the Energy Law and NEEAP, the energy agency has been assigned the responsi-
              bility for reviewing the energy audits and the EE plans prepared and submitted by the
              municipalities and public entities. The specific TA to be organized by the energy agency
              (but most likely outsourced and provided by private sector entities) may vary somewhat




66   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   CHAPTER 6
              under the three financing mechanisms (as discussed later in this chapter), but the general
              responsibilities will remain constant.



              Establishment of the Project Management Unit

              All three options identified in this report envision the establishment of a project manage-
              ment unit (PMU) that will be assigned the major responsibilities for the implementation
              of the financing mechanisms to contribute to the NPEEPB. The PMU will be staffed with
              individuals with capabilities and experience in EE project implementation, experience with
              working in FYR Macedonia, and understanding of the financial and technical issues faced
              by FYR Macedonian municipalities. The specific location of the PMU will depend on the
              organizational structure of each option. In the case of the EE fund, the PMU will be estab-
              lished by the fund manager selected competitively to manage the fund. In the second op-
              tion, the EE credit line, the PMU will be established by the financial institution selected to
              manage the credit line, and in the MEEIP, the PMU will be established within the Ministry
              of Finance (MOF).



              Project Eligibility Criteria

              Most of the project eligibility criteria will be common to the three options. To be eligible
              for project financing (from the EE fund, EE credit line, or MEEIP), projects will need to
              meet the following criteria: (i) the building or facility must be publicly owned (for ex-
              ample, be a school, kindergarten, hospital, administrative building, or social facilityand
              so on); (ii) the facility should be structurally sound (without major structural damages that
              may jeopardize the integral stability of the building); (iii) there should be no plans for
              closure, downsizing, or privatization of the facility; and (iv) there should be a comfort level
              of more than 50 percent.14 In addition, the project should meet the following criteria: (i)
              the project should yield a minimum of 20 percent energy savings, (ii) the simple payback
              based on the investment cost divided by energy savings should be less than 10 years,
              and (iii) the project investment should be between $50,000 and $1,000,000.




              14	 Comfort level = Actual consumed energy × 100 /energy for normal conditions (%), where normal conditions
                  mean that the entire building area is heated, and indoor temperature and number of days that facilities are
                  heated are equal to the established norms.




67   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB         |   CHAPTER 6
              Technical EE Measures

              In all three financing options, the technical measures to be implemented include insula-
              tion of walls, basements and attics; repair/replacement of external doors and windows;
              reflective surfacing of walls behind radiators, and improvement/replacement of boilers
              and heating systems; installation of controls on heating systems; replacement of incan-
              descent bulbs with compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs); and replacement of inefficient
              fluorescent tube lights and lighting fixtures with efficient alternatives.



              Cofinancing Needs

              It is anticipated that in all three financing options the municipality or public entity will
              be required to contribute a portion of the total project cost as its cofinancing or “proj-
              ect equity” contribution. Such contribution will be about 20–30 percent of the total in-
              vestment cost of the EE measures. The only exception to this cofinancing requirement
              will be in the case of the EE Fund Investment Model 2, in which the fund will negotiate
              an energy services agreement (ESA) with the municipal or public entity “client” under
              which the fund will provide a full range of implementation services and the client will
              agree to pay an annual fixed amount of about 95–100 percent of the baseline energy
              costs to the fund.



              Collateral Requirements and Securitization

              For the loan agreements signed with municipalities and public entities under the EE fund
              and EE credit line, the borrowers will need to provide appropriate collateral. The PMU
              will define the type of acceptable collateral in cooperation with the MOF. As a result of
              the fiscal decentralization process, many municipalities now have certain assets (build-
              ings, land, and so on) that may be usable as collateral for the loans. It may also be pos-
              sible to establish escrow accounts at the banks where the borrowers may open operating
              accounts. Another possibility is to utilize the payments to municipalities from the MOF
              for their share of the communal fees, certain taxes (property tax, property sales tax, and
              so on), value added tax (VAT) receipts, and personal income taxes. Such collateral re-
              quirements may not be required for the MEEIP, where the loans to the municipalities are
              provided directly by the MOF.




68   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   CHAPTER 6
              The Provision of Technical Assistance

              All financing options will include the provision of TA. Examples include:

              •	Program marketing to and capacity building of the target public sector entities to
                 address the information and knowledge gaps related to EE, build demand for financ-
                 ing, and improve the sustainability of energy savings. Activities will include program
                 workshops and flyers, development of a program
                 Web site, development of successful case studies for broader dissemination, and
                 training on educational programs that schools and other organizations can implement
                 to reduce energy waste and collect/analyze energy consumption data.

              •	Development of the procedures for assisting the municipalities and public entities
                 to engage energy service providers under public-private partnerships (PPPs) such as
                 performance-based contracts; preparation of performance-based bidding documents
                 for procurement of various elements of project implementation services; and refine-
                 ment of these bidding documents based on the implementation experience to pro-
                 vide standard documents for future use in FYR Macedonia. Bundling procurements by
                 multiple public entities implementing similar projects should also be explored, as this
                 would presumably lower transaction and equipment costs through bulk purchases.

              •	Identification, assessment, and recommendation of changes, if needed, in public ac-
                 counting, budgeting, and procurement rules to facilitate the financing of EE projects
                 and procurement of EE services. These may include policy development related to
                 existing public procurement and budgeting rules for EE services (for example, blend
                 of goods, works, and services; use of net present value [NPV] rather than least cost;
                 retention of savings by beneficiaries; use of measurement and verification [M&V] pro-
                 tocols as basis for payments to service providers), development of alternate financing
                 models for EE in the public sector, regulatory support to assess and develop feasible
                 DSM mechanisms, development of methodologies and functions related to energy
                 and EE statistics, and updating of the EE action plan.

              •	Capacity building for energy service providers and other market actors to conduct
                 energy audits; and to screen, design, evaluate, appraise/finance, implement, and
                 measure EE investments in the public sector.

              •	Development/adaptation of methodologies for M&V and providing M&V training to
                 PMU staff, public sector facility managers and engineers, and private sector service
                 providers.




69   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   CHAPTER 6
              The PMU: Capacity Building

              Under all three financing options, a PMU will be established. There will be a need to build
              the capacity of the PMU staff to be able to manage the financing and implementation of
              the EE projects. The TA for such capacity building would include training related to EE
              technologies and relevant implementation strategies, basic concepts and tools for perfor-
              mance-based contracts, guidelines and procedures for M&V of energy savings, and moni-
              toring and reporting of the overall program results to the financing sources. In addition, in
              the case of the EE fund and MEEIP, the capacity building TA may also include funding for
              the initial set-up, administration and operation of the PMU, and for purchase of equipment
              for auditing, data collection, and M&V.



              Possible Grant Financing

              It is possible under all three options that the financing sources may provide some grant
              financing for public sector EE projects. For example, the current Municipal Services
              Improvement Program (MSIP) implemented by the MOF has a grant component. Also,
              some grant funding may be available from the European Union’s (EU’s) Instrument for
              Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) funds. To the extent such grant funds are available for
              public sector EE projects, the fund, credit line, or MEEIP can incorporate these into the
              financing package.



              Encouragement of Performance-based Implementation Contracts

              Under all three financing options, the PMU shall encourage the use of performance-
              based contracts for the energy services to implement the EE projects.



              Sustainability and Replicability

              Under each of the financing options, the PMU will devote efforts to select projects
              carefully to assure sustainability of EE investments. Project eligibility criteria have been
              determined in such a way that EE investments in the eligible public sector facilities are
              financially viable and can provide sufficient energy cost savings to justify the investment.
              EE investments in social and other public facilities can help stimulate the market by creat-
              ing demand for energy-efficient equipment and services, and send a strong signal to the
              private sector and general public about the government’s commitment to EE.




70   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   CHAPTER 6
              The PMU will strive to achieve replicability of EE investments in cooperation with relevant
              government agencies of the GOM by: (i) removal of existing legal, regulatory, procurement,
              and information barriers to EE project implementation in the public sector; (ii) development
              and testing of various financing, implementation, and repayment schemes for EE projects
              in public sector facilities, which will also have a strong demonstration effect; (iii) training
              for public agencies to support implementation of EE policies and regulations; (iv) capac-
              ity building for private sector service providers to strengthen their capacity in carrying out
              energy audits, energy management, financial appraisal of EE investments, M&V, and other
              key areas related to provision of energy services and management; (v) revolving of the in-
              vestment funds by the fund, and (vi) increasing familiarity of municipalities with commercial
              borrowing for EE and of financial institutions with municipal customers, respectively.



              Building the Energy Services Delivery Infrastructure

              In the case of the EE fund and MEEIP, the PMU will make every effort to engage local en-
              ergy service providers in the project implementation to contribute to the development of
              an energy services delivery infrastructure and ensure its sustainability. To accomplish this,
              the PMU will develop approaches for the borrowers to enter into performance-based
              service contracts with contractors, installers, construction firms, and other types of service
              providers. The contracts will include project design, and supply, installation, commission-
              ing, and (possibly) maintenance of equipment, as well as M&V. The contracts will include
              provisions to allocate some of the project performance risks to the service providers
              based on the actual energy savings generated from the project. It may be unrealistic to
              expect that such activities would be undertaken by the financial institution (FI) managing
              the EE credit line; however, in this option, provision may be made to engage international
              experts to provide such support.



              Measurement and Verification of Subprojects

              A key element of EE project implementation is the M&V of energy savings and related re-
              ductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. All financing sources will require formal M&V.
              Therefore, under all of the three financing options, guidelines and procedures for M&V will
              be specified. The specific elements of the M&V approach will depend on the nature of the
              project and individual measures, but in general the M&V procedures will define the speci-
              fication of baseline operating conditions and energy consumption, methods for measuring
              the postinstallation energy consumption, approaches and formulas for adjusting the base-
              line in case the operating conditions change, and formats for reporting the M&V results.




71   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   CHAPTER 6
              A number of different methodologies have been developed for conducting M&V.15 One
              of the most common and internationally accepted approaches is the International Perfor-
              mance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) (EVO 2012). Most M&V protocols
              provide a range of M&V methods and approaches of varying degrees of complexity. The
              IPMVP, for example, provides four options that may be used for different EE measures.
              Some public agencies, particularly in developing countries with nascent EE markets, have
              used simpler methods with a “deemed savings” approach for M&V. Deemed savings
              is a predetermined, validated estimate of energy and peak demand savings attribut-
              able to an EE measure instead of energy and peak demand savings determined through
              M&V activities (Singh and others 2010). Under the deemed savings approach, the public
              agency and the energy service provider agree to a simplified savings calculation proce-
              dure, and the savings are then “deemed” or calculated using this procedure. Under any
              of the proposed financing approaches, guidelines for M&V will be developed, using a
              combination of deemed savings and the IPMVP.

              In FYR Macedonia, an M&V methodology is being developed, with support from GIZ
              (Teskeredzic 2011), to meet the needs of the EU’s Energy Services Directive (ESD) (EU
              2006). One of the major objectives of this directive is to quantify the energy savings
              resulting from energy services and other EE improvement measures. A consortium of 21
              partners has developed, under the Evaluation and Monitoring for the EU Directive on
              Energy End-Use Efficiency and Energy Services (EMEES) project,16 methods to evaluate
              the measures implemented to achieve the 9 percent energy savings target set out in the
              ESD. The project has developed a system of bottom-up and top-down methods and their
              integrated application for the evaluation of 20 types of EE technologies. The proposed
              approach for M&V and the design of the TA will be developed using an appropriate com-
              bination of these methods as well as the approaches and methodologies of the IPMVP.



              Operational Manual

              The PMU shall prepare an operational manual (OM) that will specify project procedures
              for participating public entities and the PMU, and include project documents, such as
              procurement guidelines and terms of and conditions of the loan agreement. The OM
              shall also specify:




              15	 For example, M&V methodologies have been developed by the U.S. Federal Energy Management Program;
                  California Public Utilities Commission; Australian Department of Industry, Science and Trade; and the United
                  Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC).

              Monitoring and Reporting of Program Indicators

              Another important requirement of the financing sources will be the monitoring and report-
              ing of the results of the financing program. Indicators will likely include: number of projects
              financed/commissioned, total amount of financing, energy savings, GHG reductions, and
              so on. Under all of the financing options, the PMU will be responsible for project moni-
              toring, results evaluation, and reporting. It will conduct pre- and postassessment of the
              project development indicators to determine project impact on the performance of mu-
              nicipalities and public entities. The monitoring and reporting of project progress against
              plans will be reflected in the quarterly or semi-annual progress reports prepared by the
              PMU. The progress will include financial management reports and updates on the status of
              the individual loans (and ESAs, in the case of the EE fund). These reports will also outline
              any corrective actions needed to sustain or improve project progress.




              UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY FUND


              Organizational Structure

              The operations of the FYR Macedonia Energy Efficiency Fund (MEEF) will be conducted
              under the supervision and oversight of a board of directors (BOD). The BOD will consist
              of eight members, six of them representing the public sector and two representing the
              private sector and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) engaged in the areas of EE. It
              will be chaired by the MOF. The public sector members will include representatives of the




73   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   CHAPTER 6
              Ministry of Economy (MOE), the Energy Agency, Ministry of Local Self-Government, Minis-
              try of Education, and Ministry of Health. The NGO/private sector members could include
              organizations such as the Association of the Units of Local Self Government (ZELS) and
              Chamber of Certified Architects and Engineers. The BOD will be responsible for strategic
              decisions, including the approval of the annual business plan of the fund.

              Two options are available for the management of the fund: (i) a professional fund man-
              ager, and (ii) an existing financial institution (such as a commercial bank).

              Under the first option, the BOD shall select a professional fund management organiza-
              tion (fund manager) using a competitive bidding process. The fund manager may be a
              single entity/company or a consortium. The selection of the fund manager will be based
              on a specified set of criteria, including the experience and capabilities of the organization
              in managing public funds, knowledge and understanding of EE project implementation,
              experience with working in FYR Macedonia, understanding of the financial and technical
              issues faced by FYR Macedonian municipalities, and so on.

              Under the second option, the BOD shall select an existing organization to be the fund
              manager, using a competitive bidding process with the same terms of reference as in op-
              tion 1. Examples would be the Macedonian Bank for Development Promotion (MBDP) or
              another FI with operations in FYR Macedonia. The organization will be selected based on
              its experience, interest, and willingness to undertake the fund management responsibili-
              ties, and its capacity to implement the actions needed (as described below).

              The fund manager shall be responsible for identifying, appraising, and selecting projects
              and developing the project agreements (loan agreements and ESAs) with the municipali-
              ties and public facilities. The BOD shall be responsible for developing the rules and pro-
              cedures for project approval. The Board may retain the authority to approve large projects,
              but may delegate the approval authority to the fund manager for smaller projects subject to
              the projects meeting certain predefined guidelines and criteria.

              The organization of the fund shall include two major units — the investment unit and the TA
              unit. The investment unit will be responsible for development of (i) the loan agreements with
              municipalities and public entities with revenue streams independent of the state budget (for
              example, municipalities that have completed fiscal decentralization, universities, hospitals, and
              so on) and with financial discipline and adequate administrative and institutional capacity for
              project implementation; and (ii) the ESAs with public sector entities (without their own budgets
              or capacity to implement projects). The TA unit will provide a range of technical services to the
              municipalities and public entities as well as to service providers, M&V agents, and so on.

     Source: Authors.




              Scope of Services and Pricing

              The fund shall offer two investment models each with a different financial product:

                 Investment Model 1 — Loan Agreements
              a)	
                 
                 The fund shall enter into loan agreements with municipalities and other public entities
                 (borrowers) to finance EE projects. The terms and conditions of the loan agreements
                 will be structured consistent with the requirements and conditions specified by the
                 funding sources. In general the terms of the loan would be consistent with the items
                 identified above. The loans will be treated as municipal debt, with fixed repayment
                 obligations to be made within their budget provisions in future years. The fund will
                 also offer optional additional services to the borrowers that may include the develop-
                 ment of bidding documents for services related to project implementation, carrying
                 out the procurement of design and works on behalf of borrowers, overseeing con-
                 struction and commissioning, paying the contractors for services provided (from the
                 proceeds of the loan), and monitoring the projects.

              	The interest rate, repayment period, and other loan terms will be based on the re-




75   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   CHAPTER 6
                 quirements and conditions specified by the funding sources. The additional services,
                 should the borrower elect to accept them, will be either priced into the loan terms or
                 charged as a separate fee to the borrower. If grant funds were available, these could
                 be channeled by the fund to its public clients, according to criteria developed for
                 awarding those grant funds.

                  Investment Model 2 — Energy Service Agreements
              b) 	
                  The second product offered by the fund manager shall be comprehensive services to
                  undertake all of the actions needed to identify and implement the EE project. Such
                  services will be offered under an ESA to municipalities and public entities (clients)
                  without their own budgets or with limited capacity to undertake project implementa-
                  tion. Under the terms of such an ESA, the client would be obligated to pay the fund
                  a fixed annual payment equal to 95–100 percent of the baseline energy costs over
                  the life of the ESA; the fund manager would establish the baseline and provide the
                  full range of implementation services. The fixed annual payment will be subject to
                  adjustments, should the facility’s baseline conditions change (for example, due to
                  changes in the heated area or comfort levels, increases in tariffs, colder than usual
                  climate, and so on). With these payments, the fund will pay the energy bills (gas, oil,
                  power) on the facility’s behalf and reimburse itself for its investment cost and service
                  fee. The agreement shall not be longer than 10 years, and will be designed in such a
                  way that the duration can be adjusted if the fund recovers its full investment earlier or
                  later. An ESA should not be considered as a liability on the balance sheet of the pub-
                  lic entity, and therefore would not be part of the entity’s debt ceiling. An ESA would,
                  however, be more expensive than a pure loan since other services are included that
                  need to be paid for.

              In addition to the two main products described above, the fund would be able to offer
              other services if the market requires them, such as guarantees for municipal loans from
              commercial banks, or channeling of subsidy funds or outright grants to eligible clients.
              Eventually the fund could also serve private sector clients (as per the Energy Law).



              Equity Needs for the EE Fund

              A certain amount of equity is needed to kick-start the fund to cover the risk of payment
              defaults, both in the case of a loan agreement that would be secured with collateral and
              in the case of the ESA for which a method of securitization of the pledged energy bill
              payments will have to be devised. Such equity, estimated at $2–$10 million for a fund
              capital of $25–$30 million, could be provided through donor or GOM contributions. For
              example, in the case of the Armenia Public Sector EE project, implemented by the R2E2

              Fund, equity is indirectly brought into the fund by $0.7 million of the Global Environment
              Facility (GEF) grant component. This will finance the first 7–10 projects to be funded un-
              der ESAs (World Bank 2012a). If repayment takes place without problems, this amount will
              stay with the fund and can provide some amount of risk provision. For the new Moldova
              EE Fund that is expected to start operation in late 2012, the Government of Moldova has
              pledged €15 million from its budget as an equity contribution (Moldova’s News 2012).
              Bulgaria also has about a €15 million equity base from which to cover its operating costs,
              finance investments, and cover any losses (World Bank 2010a).



              Operational Costs for the EE Fund

              One of the issues with the EE fund is the higher operational cost of engaging the fund
              manager. The detailed estimation of operational costs will be developed during the proj-
              ect design phase if this option is selected by the GOM. To illustrate the potential costs
              of this option, table 6.1 shows the operational costs of EE funds in Romania (World Bank
              2009a), Bulgaria (World Bank 2010a), and Armenia (World Bank 2012a). It should be noted
              that the operational costs in Bulgaria are higher than Romania because the organization
              of the fund included two parallel structures (a fund manager and an executive director).

               UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY CREDIT LINE


               Organizational Structure

               The EE credit line will be managed by an existing public or private FI in FYR Macedonia.
               Under this option the FI would receive the funds provided by an international financial in-
               stitution (IFI) or other donor(s) and would on-lend the funds for EE projects undertaken by
               municipalities and other public entities. An advisory board would be established under
               the chairmanship of the MOF, with representation from appropriate public and private
               sector entities to provide guidance to the FI.

               Eligible clients would be municipalities and public entities that are eligible to incur debt
               and can demonstrate creditworthiness. The FI managing the credit line would sign a
               loan agreement with the borrower specifying the terms and conditions of the loan, which
               would be based on the requirements and conditions of the financing sources. Implemen-
               tation of the EE project would be done by the borrowers themselves, but perhaps with
               the help of technical assistance provided by the FI or by the energy agency.

               The FI would set up a separate PMU with a managing director and several staff. The PMU
               would report to the executive management of the FI and be in charge of identifying, ap-
               praising, and selecting projects and developing the loan agreements with the municipali-
               ties and public facilities. The final approval of the projects shall be the responsibility of
               the FI’s executive management.
               The organization structure of the credit line is shown in figure 6.4.

              Scope of Services and Pricing

              The services offered to the municipalities and public entities by the FI managing the
              credit line are primarily financial services related to the development of the loan agree-
              ment with the borrower. The pricing (terms and conditions) of the loan will be in ac-
              cordance with the requirements and conditions of the financing sources. If grant funds
              were available, these could be channeled by the FI to its public clients, according to the
              criteria developed for awarding these grant funds.



              Technical Assistance

              TA may be organized and coordinated by the energy agency (and outsourced to the pri-
              vate sector) with respect to energy audits, project implementation support, M&V proto-
              cols, and so on (see table 8.1).

              UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MUNICIPAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY
              IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM


              Organizational Structure

              The MEEIP will be implemented by the MOF, which will establish a PMU that can either
              be (i) a part of the existing PMU established for the MSIP, or (ii) a new PMU established
              specifically for the MEEIP. The PMU will include a director who will have overall manage-
              ment responsibility for project implementation — ensuring compliance with requirements
              of the funding source(s) and environmental and social requirements — and will liaison
              with government entities and the funding sources. The director will ensure appropriate
              and timely reporting, monitoring, and evaluation.

              The PMU will be adequately staffed; key staff will be selected based on their knowledge
              and understanding of EE project implementation, experience with working in FYR Mace-
              donia, and understanding of the financial and technical issues faced by FYR Macedonian
              municipalities and other public sector entities.

              A project-coordinating committee will be established to obtain the advice and assistance
              of government agencies that have oversight of the municipal sector (such as ministries
              of economy, local self-government, education, and health, in addition to the MOF). The
              committee will provide a forum for information sharing and advise the PMU on project
              selection and management. The committee’s main responsibilities will be to ensure good
              interagency communications on project objectives, rules, and implementation progress;
              to advise the PMU on sectoral or interministerial issues that may affect project-funded
              activities, such as those pertaining to EE policies and action plans; and to assure transpar-
              ency in the selection of beneficiaries and projects. The MOF will chair the committee.

              The organizational structure of the MEEIP is shown in figure 6.6.



              Scope of Services and Pricing

              The funds will be lent by the MOF to public sector entities by entering into loan agree-
              ments. The loans will be provided to municipalities and legally independent public enti-
              ties (the borrowers) with borrowing capacity, the capability to manage implementation
              of EE projects, and demonstrated willingness to commit to repay the loans from energy
              savings.

              The MOF will provide loans for projects undertaken by these borrowers; such loans will
              be treated as debt, with fixed repayment obligations to be made within their budget pro-
              visions in future years. The PMU will negotiate loan agreements with the borrowers that
              will define the terms of the loans, determined by the MOF or in negotiations between the
              MOF and donors.

              For public entities that are depending entirely on the central budget, financing condi-
              tions and mechanisms that would enable them to participate will have to be explored
              during the detailed design of the financing mechanism. For example, some funds might
              be provided as grant funding to central government agencies.



              Technical Assistance

              Certain additional services may be provided to the borrowers by the PMU as TA. Such ser-
              vices may include: conducting a preliminary screening to identify the general scope of the
              EE projects, providing standard bidding documents for services related to project imple-
              mentation, and providing M&V protocols. The borrowers will be responsible for engaging
              energy service providers (as needed), implementing the project, properly maintaining the
              systems, and repaying the loan in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. The
              repayment installments will be designed to allow borrowers to repay the investment costs
              and, if applicable, service fees from the accrued energy cost savings.

              Additional TA may be provided by the energy agency (outsourced to the private sector)
              with respect to energy audits, project implementation support, M&V protocols, and so on
              (see table 8.1).



              Implementation Process

              The step-by step implementation process for this option is summarized below:

              •	 S
                 for EE projects and invites EOIs from municipalities and public facilities to borrow
                 funds for projects.

              •	Step 2. The PMU receives applications from municipalities and public facilities.

              •	Step 3. The PMU and MOF conduct preliminary screening of EOIs and borrowing
                 capacity of the municipalities, and identify promising candidate municipalities and
                 public facilities (borrowers).

                  tep 4. The PMU invites detailed proposals from potential borrowers and makes rec-

              •	 S
                 nomic financial analysis to prepare the project-financing proposal. The proposal specifies
                 the EE measures to be implemented, the total project costs, anticipated energy savings,
                 the borrower’s equity contribution, and the amount to be borrowed from the MEEIP.

              •	Step 6. The PMU reviews the proposal, and if acceptable, negotiates the terms of
                 the terms and conditions of the loan including the period of the loan agreement,
                 interest rate, and other key elements. The borrower obtains approval from the MOF
                 to borrow funds.

                 Step 7. The loan agreement is signed between the fund and the borrower.
              •	 

              •	Step 8. The borrower prepares performance-based bidding documents for project
                 implementation services (with TA from the energy agency) and procures the service
                 providers. The procurement may have to follow procedures of the IFI/donor, for
                 example, in the case of World Bank or GEF funding. The contracts for the project
                 implementation services are partly performance based as specified in the bidding
                 documents.

              CONCLUDING REMARKS


              The above discussion indicates that the three financing options appear to be the most
              viable based on the local situation and the feedback received during the stakeholder
              consultation workshop, while the EE fund was identified as a promising model that could
              address many of the barriers identified in the report. But the selection of the financing
              option will be made by the GOM with due consideration to a number of factors such as:

              •	Issues related to creating a new organization.

              •	Prospects of obtaining a qualified and experienced professional fund manager.

              •	Need to serve all public sector entities.

              •	Capacity of the energy agency.

              •	Suitability of existing FIs to manage the EE credit line.

              •	Interest and willingness of the MOF to establish another PMU.

              •	Availability of funding for a particular option

Proposed Investment Plan
              This chapter presents the proposed investment plan for the years 2013–18. The invest-
              ment plan has categorized public buildings into the following types based on their build-
              ing characteristics, energy consumption characteristics, and energy-saving opportunities:

              •	Municipal administration buildings
              •	Primary schools
              •	Secondary schools
              •	Kindergartens
              •	Health-care buildings
              •	Universities
              •	Other buildings (such as state administration buildings, social service facilities, and so on)



              Key Assumptions

              The Ministry of Economy (MOE) in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
              will select the financing option (energy efficiency [EE] fund, EE credit line, or Municipal
              Energy Efficiency Improvement Program [MEEIP]) by the end of 2012. Initial funding will
              be obtained in 2013. The available funding is then expanded in 2014 or 2015 to scale up
              the financing and implementation of the EE projects. The number of potential buildings
              identified in the Energy Saving International, AS (ENSI) study as the market for the first
              phase of the National Program for Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings (NPEEPB) and the
              average size of the investment in the EE projects for each building type are summarized
              in table 7.1.

              It should be noted that in the above estimates, primary school projects involving the re-
              placement of heating systems that are currently using firewood have been excluded, be-
              cause these projects are estimated to have an average cost of only €3,750 and it is unlikely
              that these would be financed under any of the financing schemes discussed in this report.

              It is assumed that it would be very difficult to obtain sufficient financing and to implement
              all of the identified projects during the time period 2013–18. Therefore, we assume that the
              financing mechanisms identified in this report will be able to implement about 52 percent
              of these projects over this period.




              PROPOSED INVESTMENT PLAN


              Using the assumptions outlined above, the proposed investment plan is summarized in
              table 7.2. This plan shows the number of projects and investment by year for each of the
              seven building types.

              The total investment amount over the period 2013–18 is about €50 million. The first year’s
              (2013) investment is small (€3 million) because it will take some time to establish the fi-
              nancing mechanism, implement the project management unit (PMU), fund the start-up of
              the PMU, and provide the initial training and capacity building. The second year’s (2014)
              investment is about double that of the first year (€6 million), and the investment level then
              ramps up to €9–12 million during the period 2015–18.

              It is possible that the investment plan shown above may have to be modified in the case
              of the EE credit line if the financial institution selected to implement such a credit line will
              only work with creditworthy municipalities and public entities that have sufficient collat-
              eral to be able to borrow funds from the credit line — thus excluding the municipalities
              and public entities that have limited or no collateral and also limited capacity for project
              implementation. In this case, additional analysis may have to be conducted to develop a
              revised investment plan.

Technical Assistance Plan
              For effective implementation of the financing options discussed in this report, there is a
              need for supporting activities, including:

              •	Removal of administrative barriers to public sector energy efficiency (EE) projects, in-
                 cluding activities to support changes in public accounting, procurement, and budget-
                 ing rules and procedures.

              •	Capacity building of various program participants, including the project management
                 unit (PMU), the municipalities and public entities, and private sector organizations
                 involved in supporting implementation activities (energy auditors, contractors, install-
                 ers, and so on).

              •	Capacity building of private sector banks and financial institutions.

              •	Development of the methodology and procedures for measurement and verification
                 (M&V) of project results and capacity building of M&V agents.

              These supporting activities will be funded through a technical assistance (TA) program.
              This chapter defines the characteristics of the TA program.




              FUNDING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM


              Each of the three financing options discussed herein will have a TA component. It may
              be financed by the same financing sources that will also provide the funding for invest-
              ment in the public sector EE projects, but some other donors may also be able to provide
              funding, and some cofinancing from the Government of FYR Macedonia (GOM) may also
              be made available. As indicated in chapter 6, the details of TA provided may vary across
              the three financing options, but in all cases the TA will focus on the areas listed above. It
              is anticipated that the total amount of TA will be about €2.0 million or about 4 percent of
              the investment funds. The allocation of this amount to the various TA activities is dis-
              cussed later in this chapter. Table 8.2 provides the details.




94   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   CHAPTER 8
              REMOVAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS


              As indicated in chapter 3 of this report, there are some important administrative barriers
              to implementation of EE projects in the public sector in Former Yugoslav Republic (FYR)
              Macedonia. These include:

              •	Availability of public funds for investments in EE projects.

              •	Public accounting, budgeting, and procurement rules.

              •	Limited borrowing capacity of municipalities.

              The GOM needs to make changes in policies and procedures to address these barriers.
              TA to support the development of the necessary regulations should preferably start right
              away, since it will be crucial for the successful implementation of the National Program for
              Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings (NPEEPB).

              With respect to the financing of the EE projects, each of the financing options (except
              the EE Fund Investment Model 2, which involves energy service agreements [ESAs]) will
              require cofinancing of project investments through a project equity contribution of at
              least 20 percent by the borrower. Therefore, the municipalities or public entities need to
              provide such funds to be eligible to borrow from the EE fund, EE credit line, or MEEIP.
              The GOM needs to facilitate public sector borrowers to contribute this share of the proj-
              ect funds.

              The GOM may also need to make changes in public accounting, budgeting, and procure-
              ment rules to allow public institutions to retain some of the energy cost savings result-
              ing from EE investments. Also, changes may need to be made in rules and procedures
              limiting municipalities to only borrow in general obligations to be repaid from general
              revenues, in order to provide additional incentives to public institutions to pursue such
              investments. Finally, public tender procedures may have to be modified in order to be
              more simple and transparent and to allow for performance-based contracts to be entered
              into for the provision of various services related to project implementation.

              The borrowing capacity of municipalities and public entities is currently limited. The
              GOM needs to explore options to increase borrowing capacity to allow public institutions
              to borrow funds for EE projects. Also, the GOM needs to facilitate innovative financing
              options such as equipment leasing and public-private partnerships under which public
              institutions can make payments to private sector organizations over multiple years, with




95   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   CHAPTER 8
              such payments not counting against the borrowing capacity of the public institutions. It
              is proposed that public entities without their own budgets or with limited capacity to un-
              dertake project implementation under the EE fund option enter into ESAs and would be
              obligated to pay the fund a fixed annual payment equal to 95–100 percent of the base-
              line energy costs over the life of the ESA, while the fund undertakes all project prepara-
              tion and implementation services (see chapter 6). An ESA should not be considered as
              a liability on the balance sheet of the public entity and therefore not be part of its debt
              ceiling. TA activities would support such changes.

              TA provided under the financing options will help identify the effects of the institutional
              barriers, identify options and solutions to overcome such barriers, and recommend
              specific actions that the GOM can take to implement these solutions. Changes in the
              accounting, budgeting, and procurement rules are essential in making the NPEEPB work.
              The TA component will support the reform of those rules.




              CAPACITY BUILDING OF PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS


              A key element of TA will be the capacity building of the PMU. As discussed in chapter 6,
              TA would the address training of the PMU staff to manage the financing and implemen-
              tation of EE projects. TA would include training related to EE technologies and relevant
              implementation strategies, basic concepts and tools for performance-based contracts,
              guidelines and procedures for M&V of energy savings, and monitoring and reporting of
              the overall program results to the financing sources. In addition, in the case of the EE
              fund and MEEIP, the capacity-building TA may also include funding for the initial set-up,
              administration, and operation of the PMU; and the purchase of equipment for auditing,
              data collection, and M&V.

              Also, as described in chapter 6, TA will be provided in the following areas:

              •	Program marketing to and capacity building of the target public sector entities to ad-
                 dress the information and knowledge gaps related to EE, build demand for financing,
                 and improve the sustainability of energy savings.

              •	Assistance to the municipalities and public entities in conducting energy audits and
                 developing EE action plans.




96   THE GREENING OF MACEDONIA’S BUILDINGS: FINANCING OPTIONS FOR THE NPEEPB   |   CHAPTER 8
              •	Development of procedures for assisting municipalities and public entities to engage
                 energy service providers under performance-based contracts, prepare performance-
                 based bidding documents for procurement of various elements of project implemen-
                 tation services, and refine these bidding documents based on the implementation
                 experience to provide standard documents for future use in FYR Macedonia.

              •	Capacity building for energy service providers and other market actors to conduct
                 energy audits, and to screen, design, evaluate, appraise/finance, implement, and
                 measure EE investments in the public sector.




              CAPACITY BUILDING OF COMMERCIAL BANKS AND
              FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS


              Currently most banks and financial institutions (FIs) in FYR Macedonia are reluctant to
              provide loans to municipalities. For the financing program to be sustainable, it will be
              important to develop the market for commercial financing of public sector EE projects
              in the long term. One of the TA components will therefore address capacity building of
              banks/FIs to encourage and facilitate their lending for public sector EE projects. This
              will include training in technical and economic characteristics, appraisal procedures, risk
              profiles, and implementation business models (including performance-based contracts)
              for EE projects.




              MEASUREMENT AND VERIFICATION


              A key element of any EE project is the M&V of results. It is anticipated that the financing
              sources providing the resources for the EE fund, credit line, or MEEIP will require formal
              M&V of the projects financed. Currently there is very limited capacity in FYR Macedonia
              to conduct M&V. Therefore a key component of the M&V will focus on development/ad-
              aptation of methodologies for M&V and on providing M&V training to PMU staff, public
              sector facility managers and engineers, and private sector service providers.
