The Business Case
Leadership support and endorsement are critical to fos-
tering gender diversity and equality in an organization,
which impacts the bottom line. Leaders have the power to
influence key decisions, ensure that gender smart policies
are implemented throughout the organization, hold staff
accountable, and pave the way for addressing corporate
gender gaps in attracting and retaining the best talent.
Leaders can also lead by example internally and externally
and build partnerships. The UN WEPs, for example, seek
to build on leaders as change agents and encourage CEOs       Photo 1 - Zulekha Hospital’s senior management celebrated their SheWorks membership
