Strategic Actions at the National Level for Reducing Poverty and Promoting
Social Inclusion
This document aims to continue the series of strategic actions undertaken in the area of poverty reduction and promotion of social
inclusion for the past 20 years. A short historic of the most important phases achieved so far is presented below.


      1998         Setting up in 1998 of a Commission for Prevention and Fight Against Poverty under the patronage of the Romanian
                   Presidency. The Commission drafted and passed a ”Strategy for the Prevention of and Fight against Poverty,” which,
                   although it was not adopted by the government, represented the first strategic document to lay down the principles of
                   social policies.

      2001         Setting up of an Anti-Poverty and Promotion of Social Inclusion Commission (CASPIS), which operated between
                   2001 and 2006. This institution together with the County Commissions under its coordination (which were
                   responsible for developing and implementing social policies at the county level) anticipated Romania’s participation
                   to the EU’s Open Method of Coordination. In the period of CASPIS operation, several actions were taken to strengthen
                   the fight against poverty: (i) the setting up of a methodology for computing absolute poverty; (ii) the building of a set
                   of national and county indicators to be monitored; and (iii) the development of the first poverty map at the local level.
                   In addition, the Commission drafted the National Anti-Poverty and Social Inclusion Promotion Program and county
                   plans that explained and adapted the national objectives to the local needs.

     2005          Signing in 2005 of a Joint Social Inclusion Memorandum by the Government of Romania and the European
                   Commission as a first phase of a European social policy to be implemented jointly. The document, coordinated by the
                   Ministry of Labor and drafted jointly by a significant number of relevant actors, aimed to identify the key challenges
                   faced by Romania in promoting social inclusion as well as the needed policy responses.

     2006          Passing of the Government Decision no. 1217/2006 that contained a national mechanism for promoting social
                   inclusion. The same piece of legislation also set up a National Social Inclusion Committee within the Inter-ministerial
                   Council for Social Affairs, Health, and Consumer Protection. The National Commission includes a representative at the
                   level of secretary of state or president from the ministries, authorities, agencies, and other governmental institutions
                   with responsibilities in the field of social inclusion. It has a consultation role and is managed by the Ministry of Labor,
                   Family, Social Protection, and Elderly.

      2010         Approval in July 2010 of the Memorandum that contains the final values of the national targets for the Europe 2020
                   Strategy, including the poverty target according which Romania has committed to lift out of poverty 580,000 people
                   by 2020.1

      2011         Approval of the Social Assistance Reform Strategy in 2011, which contained a series of key objectives that have acted
                   as guiding principles for the government in the past few years, namely: (i) targeting social benefits to low-income
                   people; (ii) reducing the costs of access for the recipients of social benefits; (iii) reducing system error and fraud;
                   (iv) reducing the number of working age people who are dependent on social assistance; (v) consolidating social
                   assistance benefits; and (vi) increasing capacity for forecasting, strategic planning, and monitoring and evaluation.

      2015         Approval of the National Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020 and the corresponding
                   Action Plan by the Government of Romania through the Government Decision no. 383 from May 27, 2015. This
                   National Strategy and its Action Plan were drafted based on the background study presented this volume.




1	   The poverty reduction target at the EU-28 level is to reduce the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion by 20 million between 2008 and 2020. The Government of Romania
     has committed itself to contributing to this target by reducing the population at risk of relative poverty after social transfers from 4.99 million in 2008 to 4.41 million by 2020.

Employment

               (Flagship Initiative #1)
               Increase funding for cost-effective active labor market policies, expand access to these services for the inactive
               poor and vulnerable, and link them with tailored remedial or employment services, through a statistical profiling of
               the out-of-work but work-capable population from the target group.
               Target vulnerable youths, including through EU-wide programs such as the Youth Guarantee.
               Use EU funds to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation of these active labor-market policies, to learn what
               works and how to increase the supply of existing programs.
               (Flagship Initiative #2)
               Introduce a pro-work benefit formula in the new consolidated means-tested benefit (see the Social Transfers line),
               that exempts part of the earnings of the households from the definition of the family means.
               Improve training for small- and medium-sized farm holdings by: (i) strengthening, professionalizing, and upgrading
               existing advisory and support institutions for smallholder farmers and family-based subsistence agriculture and (ii)
               broadening coverage of agricultural vocational schools and technical colleges to improve the skills base of (future) farmers.
Social Transfers
               (Flagship Initiative #2)
               Consolidate the means-tested programs into a flagship anti-poverty program (the Minimum Social Insertion
               Income - MSII program). The three small social assistance programs should be replaced with a single and larger
               program, which would be better targeted towards the poorest 5 million Romanians and would provide incentives
               for the in-work poor to receive social assistance even while they are earning a wage. The MSII program will be
               better linked with employment services, education, children’s health services, and housing services.
               Address demand-side bottlenecks related to access to social assistance benefits and social services, such as those
               related to user awareness, financial means, opportunity costs, social norms, and risks (safety, dignity, and stigma).
               Simplify the access of people with disabilities to the social protection system by harmonizing medical criteria for
               invalidity pensions and disability allowances and by unifying the institutional framework for assessing disability
               allowances and invalidity pensions.
               Develop reform to provide affordable old age income provisions for the rural population currently without
               insurance-based pension coverage.
Social Services
               Ensure that public funds are available for the development of the social services sector in parallel with funding from
               the European Union.
               (Flagship Initiative #3)
               Strengthen and enhance social assistance at the community level by: (i) developing a minimum intervention
               package as a mandatory responsibility for each local authority; (ii) financing from the state budget a national
               program - Social Program Opportunity and Responsibility (SPOR) - to ensure that in each locality at least one full-
               time employee does

            social work, has consistent outreach tasks in their job description, and works one-to-one with people in vulnerable
            situations and their families; (iii) financing from the state budget a national program to train employees with social
            assistance duties and to draft methodologies, guidelines, and tools to strengthen the implementation of case
            management at the level of the SPAS, especially in rural and small urban areas; and (iv) developing a strong
            monitoring and evaluation system of the social assistance services at the community level.
            Develop integrated intervention community teams, within the same intervention SPOR, to provide social services
            (in education, employment, healthcare, social protection, and other public services) and social intermediation
            and facilitation programs at the local level, especially in poor and marginalized areas, rural and urban areas, and
            Roma and non-Roma communities by: (i) developing clear methodologies, protocols, and work procedures for
            community-based workers and (ii) developing, in the larger marginalized areas, multi-functional community
            centers to provide integrated services primarily though not exclusively to families in extreme poverty.
            (Flagship Initiative #5)
            Strengthen social services for child protection by: (i) developing and strengthening the capacity of community-
            based prevention and support services; (ii) reconsidering the ways and means (including cash benefits) of
            providing family support in order to prevent child-family separations; and (iii) revising the existing child protection
            services to enhance the quality of care provided while reducing the duration of stays in the child protection system
            to the minimum necessary.
            Develop social services for vulnerable groups by: (i) increasing the financing of social services and improving the
            procedures for contracting out social services to non-government and private providers and (ii) strengthening the
            role played by the DGASPCs in strategic planning and methodological coordination and in supporting SPAS at the
            community level, as well as in monitoring and evaluating service providers within the county.
Education
            Extend the network of kindergartens and crèches in order to provide access to all Romanian children.
            Design and implement a national program focused on children at risk of dropping out or who have already dropped
            of primary and secondary education by: (i) designing a coherent referral system to education, with entry points
            from all systems dealing with children from vulnerable families; (ii) implementing a monitoring system for those
            children at highest risk of dropping out of school or skipping enrollment; (iii) tightening the monitoring of schools in
            order to ensure that these cases are followed-up; and (iv) designing a program that monitors the households of out-
            of-school children of compulsory school age and provides them with assistance, support, and parental education.
            Increase the availability of second-chance programs in rural areas and beyond the lower secondary school
            level, and provide funding to support disadvantaged groups attending second-chance education to cover their
            educational costs and other indirect costs.
            Increase the access of children with special education needs (SEN) and/or disabilities to quality education by: (i)
            revising the institutional, financing, and legal arrangements for the education of children with SEN/disabilities, (ii)
            creating further programs to train parents, tutors, and teaching staff in interacting with and helping children with
            SEN and/or disabilities, possibly using funds from the Human Capital Operational Program (POCU); (iii) including
            the topics of tolerance for disabled people and diversity in the educational curriculum in order to reduce the
            stigma and rejection associated with disability and SEN; (iv) investing in the County Resources and Educational
            Assistance Centers (CJRAEs) to enable them to become real resource centers for inclusive education; and (v)
            improving the knowledge base on children with disabilities and SEN and on their access to education.
            (Flagship Initiative #4)
            Ensure that all children have access to equal opportunities by (i) reviewing the school financing methodology to
            improve the allocation of resources to children in need, and (ii) ensuring that the money is used to deliver effective
            interventions that will increase access to and improve the quality of education for vulnerable groups.
            Redesign the welfare programs in education in order to increase participation of and the quality of education for
            poor and vulnerable pupils.

Health
            Increase the coverage of basic healthcare service providers (family doctors, community nurses, and Roma
            mediators) at the local level countrywide.
            Design evidence-based health promotion interventions, and implement, monitor, and evaluate these programs. In
            particular, these would include reducing harmful alcohol consumption, especially in rural areas, with a focus on
            those who are less well-educated, and focusing more on outreach interventions in specific communities identified
            as the most vulnerable.
            Redesign the National TB Control Program (NTP) against multi-drug and extensive drug-resistant tuberculosis (M/
            XDR-TB) to include social support and targeted interventions, with a dedicated budget, to meet the needs of poor and
            extremely vulnerable populations such as injection drug users (IDUs), street children, homeless, prisoners, and Roma.
Housing
            Design and finance a social housing program for vulnerable groups who cannot afford to pay rent or utilities, such
            as the homeless, post-institutionalized youths, ex-prisoners, victims of domestic violence, people evicted from
            restituted houses, and people with drug dependencies.
            Introduce a housing component into the new the Minimum Social Insertion Income (see the Social Transfers line)
            for families living in social housing in addition to the heating subsidy targeted to low-income families living in their
            own dwellings. This housing benefit will cover the cost of their rent and a part of their heating-related costs in order
            to prevent homelessness by reducing evictions.
            Shift the emphasis of efforts to reduce homelessness from emergency services to long-term integration programs.
Social Participation
            Ensure that open and responsive grievance and complaints mechanisms are built into the institutional organization
            of social services.
            Promote evidence-based awareness and advocacy campaigns about diversity (including various categories of
            marginalized or discriminated groups) to complement other actions in addressing stigma and discrimination.
            Foster civic engagement and volunteering by further improving the law on volunteering and by mobilizing mass
            media and civil society to raise awareness of best practices and the value of participation.
Area-based Policies
            Boost the territorial development of rural, sub-urban, and peri-urban areas around urban growth engines,
            especially large dynamic cities and growth poles by: (i) defining cities, especially the most dynamic ones, as
            functional urban areas; (ii) implementing adequate institutional arrangements for the management of functional
            urban areas to enable them to grow; (iii) expanding metropolitan public transport systems to areas with
            high population densities and with strong commuter flows; and (iv) investing in the infrastructure of villages
            incorporated within cities.
            Continue to invest in the expansion and modernization of the physical infrastructure in rural areas such as roads
            and basic utilities (mainly water, sewerage systems, and natural gas).
            Provide training and facilitation to the local authorities and other stakeholders of the LEADER program and use the
            LAG (local action group) framework to make the best use of ESI funds in alleviating poverty and social exclusion in
            rural areas.
            (Flagship Initiative #6)
            Develop a tool for geographic targeting, monitoring and evaluating interventions for reducing poverty and
            promoting social inclusion, with a focus on poor localities and marginalized communities, both rural and urban, and
            both Roma and non-Roma.
            Integrate marginalized communities by implementing packages of integrated social services consisting of
            integrated intervention community teams and multi-functional community centers providing coordinated access to
            education, health, employment, and housing services (see the Social Services line).

Strengthening Capacity to Promote Poverty Reduction and Social Inclusion

               Establish functional inter-sectoral coordination policies (the MLFSPE, MRDPA, MoE, and MoH) and enhance
               cooperation between the central and local authorities to foster the integrated approach to reducing poverty and
               promoting social inclusion policies.
               (Flagship Initiative #7)
               Expand the coverage and functionality of the social assistance Management Information System (MIS) by:
               (i) developing local customer relationship management solutions to enable the local authorities to maximize
               the automation of all local social assistance processes so that they can link all local databases with the social
               assistance MIS, and (ii) developing a new social assistance MIS to automate processing and to carry out validations
               (both ex-ante and ex-post).
               (Flagship Initiative #8)
               Develop a modern payment system that will use modern technologies and service delivery methods to: (i)
               centralize the payment processing function; (ii) compute automatically the necessary funds; (iii) rationalize
               budgetary requests from the Treasury; (iv) use modern payment transfer technologies; (v) provide clients with a
               range of secure and convenient payments channels; (vi) cease making direct payments to third parties; and (vii)
               incorporate best practice audit and reconciliation functions.
               (Flagship Initiative #9)
               Strengthen the national capacity to monitor and evaluate the measures under the National Strategy on Social
               Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020 by: (i) improving mechanisms for collecting both administrative
               and survey data on a regular basis; (ii) building the capacity of staff at different levels to analyze quantitative
               and qualitative data in the areas of poverty and social exclusion; and (iii) developing a national social inclusion
               monitoring and evaluation system.

Education has a strong relation both to the AROP and to
the anchored poverty indicators. More than one-third of the
                                                                               35.3

education are at risk of poverty. The percentage drops
significantly to only 15 percent among those who managed
to complete high school and/or some post-secondary                   30.0
school and drops even further to only 6 percent among
those who have obtained a college degree (see Figure 3).
Interestingly, between 2008 and 2012, the incidence of               25.0
relative poverty among those with a primary education
declined but still remained quite high compared with the
national average (Annex Table 2.9).                                  20.0

and 64, only 5.6 percent are considered to be at risk of
poverty, a percentage close to that of employers (see Figure
4). At the lower end, only 8.4 percent of retired people aged        10.0
between 15 and 64 are at risk of poverty. The self-employed
in agriculture are in the worst situation, as more than half of                                                  5.6

the disabled) are also at high risk of being in poverty.
Our analysis indicates that people with the same
occupational status can have different poverty rates

      afford to keep their home adequately warm; (3) they face unexpected expenses; (4) they cannot afford to eat meat or other protein regularly; (5) they cannot afford to go on holiday;

      higher proportion than might be expected. In fact, the percentage of people not owning a car among this group (34 percent) is smaller even than among high school graduates (40
      percent). The explanation might be data-driven but is most likely to be a result of people with only a primary education attaching greater importance to owning a car than high school
      graduates.

      Whelan, 2011:83-86). For this reason, these three items are being dropped, and the inability to afford seven new items will be included within the core definition. These are (for adult
      individuals): (1) new clothes; (2) two pairs of shoes; (3) some pocket money for oneself; (4) leisure activities; and (5) a drink or meal out monthly; and (for households): (6) the ability
      to replace worn-out furniture and (7) ownership of a computer and access to the Internet. In addition, the list of items retained in the multiple deprivation indicator related to the
      childpopulation (aged 1 to 15) will include 13 new items (besides the two new household items already mentioned), namely the inability to afford: (1) new clothes; (2) two pairs of shoes
      per child; (3) fresh fruit and vegetables daily; (4) meat, chicken, or fish daily; (5) suitable books; (6) outdoor leisure equipment; (7) indoor games; (8) a place for doing homework; (9)
      leisure activities; (10) celebrations; (11) inviting friends over; (12) school trips; or (13) a holiday (Eurostat, 2012a: 81-82).

20	   In addition to the groups listed in Table 10, another vulnerable group consists of injured and disabled troops and survivors of deceased soldiers. This vulnerable group comprises fewer
      than 200 people. Besides the existing social protection measures, the injured and disabled are young and need medical care, such as orthoses, prostheses, and other medical devices,
      while survivors of the deceased require psychological and material support. However, regarding this group, we consider that allocating a discretionary budget to the Ministry of National
      Defense would be more efficient for developing a dedicated system of home-based medical care and social services for those who are immobile and without a family.
21	   Given the likelihood that many Roma respondents do not report their ethnicity on the national census, an alternative set of expert estimates is commonly used. According to the
      Strategy of the Government of Romania for the Inclusion of Romanian Citizens Belonging to Roma Minority 2012–2020, estimates range from 535,140 (2002 Census), to 730,000–
      970,000 (Sandu,, 2005), to 619,000 (the 2011 Census), and to 1.85 million (European Commission, 2011a).

                            To tackle poverty and social exclusion in the labor
                            market, we recommend that the government create
                            employment opportunities and promote equality of
                            opportunity by: (i) increasing the skills, education,
                            and labor market experience of people who are
                            income-poor and of those from other vulnerable
                            groups; (ii) increasing the employment rate of this
                            segment of population; and (iii) putting in place
                            measures that could increase the wage rate of the
                            target group (such as measures aimed at reducing
                            discrimination). However, these measures will only
                            be partially effective if they are not accompanied
                            by economic policies on the demand side that
                            create well-paid and sustainable jobs.
                            The main priority in this area should be increasing
                            the employment of the poor and vulnerable by
                            expanding active labor market programs.

the conditionalities associated with the receipt of cash

 coverage is the proportion of population in each group that receives the transfer. Generosity is the ratio of the transfer amount received by all

      households (formal income, imputed informal agricultural income, and asset filters). However, other differences in eligibility criteria remain in terms of the assistance unit (the household
      or the family), whether or not an equivalence scale is used, the length of the recertification period (three months for the GMI and the FSA and the cold season for the HB), and the
      payment method (directly to the beneficiary or transferred to the service provider in the case of HB recipients using district heating).

 Link with:        Mechanisms for the Provision of Services
 Employment        The MSII program will have a strong activation component with the following elements: (i) increasing the coverage of the
 services          in-work poor by exempting a share of the current labor incomes of members of the beneficiary families, both from agricultural
                   and non-agricultural activities; (ii) allowing local authorities to replace community work with training and lifelong learning
                   courses to increase the employability of the beneficiaries; and (iii) capping the total benefit per family to a ceiling linked to the
                   minimum wage (for example, 75 percent or 80 percent) to maintain work incentives and reduce the stigma associated with
                   the current GMI.
 Education         The MSII program will include a benefit for children from beneficiary families to stimulate the positive behaviors and parental
 and health for    care: (i) participation in the national program of compulsory vaccination for children aged 0 to 1 years old; (ii) 100 percent
 children          attendance in kindergarten by children aged 3 to 5 years old with only an official certificate from the family physician
                   being accepted for absences; and (iii) 95 percent attendance rate in school by children aged 6 to 16 years old with only an
                   official certificate from the family physician being accepted for absences. During any months when a conditionality is not
                   met, the benefit will be suspended. However, it will not be suspended for a child in cases where that child’s siblings are not
                   in compliance, which differs from the design of the current Family Support Allowance (FSA). The logic of the current FSA
                   program links the school conditionality to parents' obligation to send children to school as stipulated in the Law of Education.
                   In contrast, the logic behind the MSII program is to award positive behavior that is likely to break the intergenerational cycle of
                   poverty and exclusion. This cycle is perpetuated when low educational achievement and poor health severely limit the labor
                   market opportunities that are accessible to the next generation of children. Thus, the MSII program will have a greater chance
                   of breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty and exclusion through targeted cash transfers that address the multiple
                   drivers of inequality.
 Housing           The MSII program will include a housing benefit for families living in social housing in addition to the heating subsidy targeted
 services          to low-income families living in their own dwellings. This housing benefit for beneficiaries living in social housing will cover
                   the cost of their rent and a part of their heating-related costs. In this way, the MSII program will address the excessively high
                   housing cost overburden rate and will prevent homelessness by reducing evictions.
 Social services   The MSII program will cover a larger proportion of the poor population than its predecessors but will also do a better job of
 for vulnerable    addressing the problems of vulnerable groups. The MSII will exempt some social benefits from its definition of household
 groups            means such as the allowance for people with disabilities or the allowance for children in foster care.

Fund for European Aid to the Most
Deprived (FEAD)
The Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) is part of the 2014-2020 EU programming period and
supports actions to provide material assistance (food, clothing, and other essential items for personal use) to the “most
deprived.” This term means “natural persons, whether individuals, families, households, or groups composed of such persons,
whose need for assistance has been established according to the objective criteria set by the national competent authorities in
consultation with relevant stakeholders, while avoiding conflicts of interest, or defined by the partner organizations and which
are approved by those national competent authorities and which may include elements that allow the targeting of the most
deprived persons in certain geographical areas” as defined by EU Regulation No 223/2014 of the European Parliament and of
the Council, Article 2.
The funding complements the financing provided by the European Social Fund (ESF) in the sense that FEAD addresses the
basic needs of the most deprived in order to enable them to access training or employment as is also the case with the programs
supported by the ESF. The total available resources for FEAD at the EU level come to €3,395,684,880 (at 2011 prices).
The minimum allocation per member state is €3,500,000 (for the period 2014 to 2020), and this amount has already been
allocated to Cyprus, Denmark, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Romania has a total allocation of
€391,300,000, which is the third largest allocation at the EU level (in 2011 per capita prices).

In Romania, FEAD is funding the Operational Program for Aid to the Most Deprived, which supports the distribution of food and
basic material such as school bags and equipment in order to increase school attendance of children of all ages. The school
materials are targeted to children from families in which the net monthly per capita income is less than or equal to 50 percent
of the gross national minimum wage. The program targets beneficiaries of the GMI or people whose total income is less than
45 percent of the gross national minimum wage. The detailed categories of beneficiaries of the program’s food aid are specified
in GD 779/2014 and include beneficiaries of the Family Support Allowance, the unemployed, pensioners with incomes of less
than 400 lei a month or beneficiaries of the Social Pension, people with medium or severe disabilities (adults and children), and
war veterans.
Implementing the program requires strong inter-ministerial coordination between the Ministry of European Funds, the
MLFSPE, and the Ministry of Education (through its school inspectorates). The program shares a management authority with
the Human Capital Operational Program. It was approved by the European Commission in November 2014 and began to be
implemented in December 2014 (food aid component).

      292/2011, Art. 27/2). These services are provided in a variety of locations and settings, such as individuals’ homes, day centers, and residential establishments, and they are staffed by
      personnel that include social assistants, social workers, care managers, home-helpers, therapists, and crèche staff.

61	   According to the new NUTS classification (common classification of territorial units for statistics), Romania has two counties that are predominantly urban (with rural populations of less
      than 20 percent), 18 intermediary counties (with rural populations of between 20 percent and 50 percent), and 27 counties that are predominantly rural (with rural populations of more
      than 50 percent).
62	   Social services are set up in a decentralized system (2003) and, therefore are not subject to decentralization process (2006). Thus an amendment to the Law no. 195/2006 on
      decentralization is needed. Strengthening government capacity to ensure access to quality public services is a general objective of the government’s Strategy for Public Administration
      2014-2020 (General objective IV, Annex 1: 83-85,www.mdrap.ro/userfiles/consultari_publice/30_06_14/anexa1.doc). The Strategy recommends the development of quality and
      cost standards for all public services to make them more efficient and to improve their quality. It also proposes the creation of a minimum package of basic public services that each
      territorial-administrative unit will be mandated to provide as well as an optional package of services to be delivered by the more developed localities. The government is currently
      considering the budget allocations that will be necessary to achieve this objective.

65	   Data extracted on August 29, 2014. ESSPROS contains national administrative national data on social protection spending, both on cash transfers and in-kind benefits (goods and
      services) that are collected using a methodology that makes it possible to make coherent comparisons between European countries.
66	   Social protection encompasses all interventions by public or private bodies intended to relieve households and individuals of the burden of a defined set of eight risks or needs, provided
      that there is neither a simultaneous reciprocal nor individual arrangement involved. The set of eight risks (or needs) include: (1) sickness, medical care; (2) disability; (3) old age; (4) loss
      of a family member; (5) children and families; (6) unemployment; (7) housing; and (8) social exclusion not classified in other categories, such as the rehabilitation of substance addicts.
      Cash benefits include cash payments to protected people and reimbursements of expenditure made by protected people. In-kind benefits refer to goods and services directly provided
      to protected people. (Eurostat, ESSPROS Manual, 2011: 9).
67	   In-kind services are increasingly a favored tool of governments across the OECD. Over the past 20 years, total spending on social services has been steadily increasing, whereas
      spending on cash transfers has been stable. In the OECD countries, spending on social services is likely to continue to grow in the context of the ongoing global recession as the uptake
      of front-line social services increases. (Richardson and Patana, 2012: 3).
68	   Purchasing power standard.
69	   For comparison, the percentage of the sickness/healthcare function in total expenditure on in-kind benefits was 73 percent among EU-28 countries in 2011. Furthermore, between 2005
      and 2011, this proportion increased in Romania from 77.3 percent to 86.7 percent, whereas in developed European countries (the EU-15) it has stayed constant at 73 to 74 percent.

       were accredited as social service providers, with 70 percent falling short of the standards needed for accreditation (MLFSPE and SERA Romania, 2012).

       800 and 1,700 being the highest). Most of them live in the capital city (about 1,150). In the seaside city of Constanta, their number depends strongly on the season. More than half are
       children (aged between 0 and 17), the others being young people aged between 18 and 35 years old. Children living in the streets typically have a low level of education (most have
       no more than a completed primary school education), and their main source of income is begging, followed by daily occasional work and washing cars/ windscreens. They generally
       have little if any access to services. While in Bucharest the situation is slightly better, with more than half of the subjects (55.9 percent) receiving services at some point, in Brasov and
       Constanta very few have benefited from such services (Grigoraș, 2009).

Note: This map should be used cautiously. Many figures presented in this map are partial, and cannot be compared among
countries. Several countries did not provide the general data for the whole prison populations. Therefore, sometimes we used the
available data (for example, only on sentenced prisoners). Moreover, some of the countries included in the map (for example, Italy)
do not count young people held in institutions as juvenile offenders in their prison population. As a consequence, their percentage
of inmates aged under 18 years old is close to zero.

       and 1 percent of those under 14 years are sexually active (CURS, ISE, and UNICEF, 2013). On average, teenagers begin their sexual activity at the age of 15½ years old. At the time of the
       research, sexually active adolescents had an average of 2.3 partners, and 68 percent had a stable partner. Fewer than half (47 percent) of sexually active adolescents consistently used
       means of protection, mainly for preventing pregnancy and not for protecting themselves against sexually transmitted diseases. The survey from which these data came had a sample of
       607 adolescents (aged 10 to 17 years old), with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percent and a confidence level of 95 percent.

138	 The key priorities for improving the access of persons with disabilities to healthcare, which are presented in the next sections, are aligned to those recommended by UNICEF (e.g.

     Stanciu, 2013; UNICEF, 2013) and Handicap International (Chiriacescu, 2008).
139	 In the context of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, habilitation and rehabilitation services include a wide range of activities aimed at enabling people with

     disabilities to achieve their maximum level of independence and participation in socioeconomic life. While habilitation refers mainly to those measures that enable people to achieve
     a functional level that they have never reached before (due usually to impairment from birth or from very early age), rehabilitation services focus on restoring (or compensating for)
     those abilities that have been lost due to an impairment or injury. The differentiation in terminology is due to the fact that these two situations often require different types of service and
     intervention. Here, the term “(re)habilitation services” is used when referring to both measures.

     these points would bring inmates additional benefits, such as more family visits, parole etc. In certain circumstances, completing general education programmes or qualification

181	 Other than the initiatives of the Ministry of Health, several other public institutions (such as the Drug Prevention, Assessment, and Counseling Centers of the National Anti-Drug Agency)

     and NGOs implement annual prevention actions aimed at students (such as information sessions in school, competitions, camps, sport events, and cultural events).
182	 General physicians usually are not able to make early diagnoses of disorders related to alcohol consumption but only when the disease is quite advanced. Thus, 55 percent of the

     patients with alcohol-related problems received information on alcohol abuse from their general physician and 44 percent were referred to a specialized service compared with only 2
     percent and 3 percent of non-patients (ALIAT, 2011).

sectors, are vital for reducing the use of drugs as well as
the harmful consumption of tobacco and alcohol among

adequate educational policies aimed at preventing risky
behavior among teenagers and (ii) increasing the provision of
health counseling and family planning services to teenagers.

217	 Law 25/2012 requires a forensic medical certificate to be issued before a victim of domestic abuse can file for a restraining order against her or his attacker.
218	 For example, based on a cooperation protocol between an NGO and the Institute for Forensic Medicine in Bucharest, about 100 women victims received free forensic medical
     examinations during 2012 and 2013. Also, certain public services cover the costs incurred by victims of obtaining these certificates from their own budgets.
219	 Transcena (2013a).
220	 The fewest numbers of volunteers are social workers, counselors, and doctors. These services are also staffed by nurses, teachers, and legal advisors (Transcena, 2013a).
221	 Most residential centers have between four and eight employees (Transcena, 2013a).
222	 Participation in continuous training is most frequent among counselors (64 percent of them attended training in 2011 to 2013) and psychologists (about a half of them attended training

     in 2012) both in residential and non-residential services. Furthermore, only 11 percent of the employees of residential centers attended training between 2011 and 2013 (Transcena,
     2013a).
223	 A recent study shows that about a half of the requests submitted by victims are accepted by judges, the rest being either rejected (predominantly) or withdrawn. The main reason that

     judges give for rejecting a restraining order is that the request has been inaccurately or only partially filled in (Transcena, 2013b).
224	 The victim must first be medically examined by an emergency unit, then she must get a forensic medical certificate attesting that the physical aggression occurred, and then she must

     file the request in court. Apart from the forensic medical certificate, the victim must also gather other types of evidence, such as evidence of a complaint filed previously. For non-urgent
     cases, restraining orders can even take more than 60 days to be issued (Transcena, 2013b).
225	 For example, the same Transcena studies (2013a and 2013b) showed that victims may withdraw their request for protection or may refuse to access specialized services because they

     fear their attacker or do not want to be stigmatized as a victim. The staff in services that assist victims of domestic violence feel at risk of being themselves subject to the violence of the
     attackers against whom they have no protection. In addition, the police often find it difficult and sometimes impossible to enforce a restraining order with contradictory provisions.

232	 Education in Romania is compulsory for 11 years, starting at primary education, and covering lower secondary education and the first two years of upper secondary education (grades
     9-10). The Romanian pre-university education system covers: (i) early childhood education (0-6 years); (ii) primary education (grades 0-4); (iii) lower secondary education/gymnasium
     (grades 5-8); and (iv) upper secondary education (grades 9-12 or 9-14, depending on the stream:theoretical, vocational, and technological). The entire upper secondary education cycle
     (provided in high schools) is expected to become compulsory by 2020. Tertiary education includes university and non-university education. The student assessment and evaluation
     system includes two milestones that determine transitions into upper levels: a national grade 8 exit exam, and the Baccalaureate at the completion of upper secondary education/
     gymnasium, which is mandatory for entrance into universities, but not mandatory for graduation from upper secondary education or entrance into non-university tertiary education.

     and Housing Census data, out-of-school children aged 7 to 14 years old are spread across all counties, with rates varying from a minimum of 1 percent in Giurgiu and a maximum of
     7.1 percent in Mures (and a national average of 4 percent). In seven counties, the rates of out-of-school children aged 7-14 years exceed 5 percent, namely Arad, Bihor, Brasov, Cluj,
     Ialomita, Mures and Timis. However, these seven counties account for only 27 percent of all out-of-school children aged 7 to 14 years old overall, which means that the concentration

                            The Professional Scholarship program provides an even larger cash grant (200 lei or US$57) every month to students in the
                            professional stream, regardless of income, in both public and private schools.
                            The Transport Reimbursement program reimburses the actual cash value of transportation (up to 50 kilometers) for pupils
                            who travel beyond their locality to attend school. A Government Decision enforced a 26 RON threshold for the 3 km distance,
                            with 2 RON added for every additional km.

                            The Euro200 program provides a one-time voucher to families in the poorest decile to purchase a computer.
                            School buses have been purchased to ease transportation barriers, especially in rural areas.
                            The milk, breadstick, and apple program provides basic food to all pupils in grades 0 to 8 and kindergartens.314
Local Level                 A range of local bursaries exist, notably for excellence and performance (high grades), study (good grades by students whose
                            families earn less than the national minimum wage per capita), and social bursaries (for students whose families earn less than

328	 The fiscal context refers to a government’s current and expected spending capacity. More affluent countries tend to be more effective at mobilizing tax revenues and thus have higher
     levels of public spending as a share of GDP, whereas when a country has more limited fiscal space, this usually results in low government spending, including on education and health
     care.
329	 However, the priority given by both the Romanian government and the EU to the health sector has been consistently higher than that accorded to the education sector.
330	 Nevertheless, with respect to total health expenditure in PPP$ per capita, the gap between Romania and EU-27 has continuously narrowed, from more than eightfold in the late 1990s

     to less than fourfold in 2012.

     aged 10 and over). Health capital is measured as life expectancy at birth at local level. Vital capital is measured using the indicator of mean age of the adult population (those aged 18 or
     over). Finally, material capital is assessed as a factor score of three specific indicators that focus on living standards: dwelling space, private cars to 1,000 residents, and distribution of
     gas for household consumption in the particular territorial unit. The aggregation of the four measures of the dimensions of community capital is achieved by another factor score.

402	 During the 1990 to 1999 period, there was only limited housing construction, mainly in certain (more wealthy) rural areas. In the same period, the de-industrialization of the economy
     led, in the housing area, to the decay or abandon of “bachelor hostels/blocks of one-room flats” (camine de nefamilisti / blocuri de garsoniere). Also, the increasing rates of migration for
     work abroad seriously affected the construction sector as many professionals and skilled workers left Romania. The period of economic growth (2000 to 2008) was the golden period
     of larger housing schemes, particularly in large cities, as well as expansions and sprawl generated by green field housing developments in nearly all cities. This was also the pre-EU-
     accession period of SAPARD programs for increasing water and sewage access in small towns and rural areas, including the rehabilitation of distribution networks. The post-accession
     period, after 2007 and up to 2009 (the beginning of the global crisis), was marked by an increase in housing construction and improvements, fueled particularly by the remittances sent
     home by the migrants working abroad. After 2009, many construction projects were put on hold with some real estate investors disappearing before the completion of the work, a slow-
     down in construction, and decreases in housing high prices.

Notes: The graph presents the average values determined on 15 scores varying from -10 (“not at all satisﬁed”/”very bad”) to +10 (“very satisﬁed”/”very good”).
Satisfaction with one’s personal situation is the average value of four scores that rate the respondent’s satisfaction with his or her life: (i) life in general; (ii) area of
residence; (iii) personal job situation; and (iv) household ﬁnancial situation. Perception of the national economy consists of an average of six scores in the following
areas: (i) the cost of living; (ii) the affordability of energy; (iii) the affordability of housing; (iv) the efﬁciency of public administration; (v) the overall situation of the
economy; and (vi) the employment situation nationally. Satisfaction with aspects of social protection and inclusion is the average score in ﬁve areas: (i) healthcare
provision; (ii) the provision of pensions; (iii) unemployment beneﬁts; (iv) relations between people from different cultural or religious backgrounds or nationalities; and (v)
the way in which inequality and poverty are addressed by the government. The overall social climate index is the average of all these 15 scores.

                          The government should aim to reduce
                          geographical inequalities by improving the

472	 The LHDI measures the total capital of rural and urban administrative units in Romania on four dimensions: (i) human capital; (ii) health capital; (iii) vital capital; and (iv) material capital.
     Human capital is measured by education stock at the local level (for the population aged 10 years old and over). Health capital is measured as life expectancy at birth at the local level.
     Vital capital is measured by the mean age of the adult population (those aged 18 years old and over). Finally, material capital is assessed as a factor score of three specific indicators that
     focus on living standards: (i) the size of the dwelling space; (ii) the number of private cars for every 1,000 residents; and (iii) the distribution of the use of gas for household consumption
     in the particular geographical unit. The four measures of the dimensions of community capital are aggregated by calculating another factor score. (Ionescu-Heroiu et al, 2013a).

     (communes and cities). However, 129 villages have been ‘fictive’ (have zero inhabitants) and have no corresponding data in the 2011 Population and Housing Census (114 from rural and
     15 from urban). As most of the analysis presented in the following sections is based on the 2011 census data, we will refer only to those villages that are ‘valid’, 13,626 SIRUTA units, of

     percent.
487	 The villages with a high proportion of elderly inhabitants appear to have lower percentages of dwellings connected to utilities such as cooking gas, piped water, or the sewerage

     network, but usually the demand for these services is also lower (some elderly are too poor to afford gas and water tariffs, while others have no desire to invest in such facilities as they
     are used to getting their drinking water from wells or fountains).
488	 Brebu Nou (Weidenthal) is the smallest commune in the country (with 119 inhabitants according to the 2011 Population and Housing Census). It is a former Saxon commune that

     includes two villages and is located in the Semenic Mountains in Caraş-Severin County in western Romania. The largest commune is Floresti, which is a peri-urban suburb of Cluj-

498	 The dominant economic profile of small towns is post-industrial. A knowledge typology developed within a previous World Bank study (Stănculescu, 2005) showed that about 180
     small towns (out of 225 in total) used to have an industrial element. The number, size, and economic sector of local enterprises varied, but in most small towns the former enterprises
     were closed down after 1990 and only small businesses were developed, mainly in the commerce and service sectors.
499	 The historical dimension refers to the existence within the city of a historical center or area, which before the communist era was inhabited by Jews (in the Eastern regions) or by

     Germans (in the Central and Western regions of the country). Later, the houses in these areas were nationalized. After 1990, some were returned to their former owners, while others
     remained under the jurisdiction of the municipality that had used them as social housing. At present, in many cases, these areas accommodate poor, marginalized groups of population.
     However, as a rule, these areas are in prominent locations within cities and have a high value on the real estate market. Tourism is not necessarily associated with the historical
     dimension. Most often, tourism is associated with the existence of cultural, sports, or leisure facilities within the city. In small towns dominated by tourism, houses predominate,
     and because of their tourism-related uses, (for example, as hotels, restaurants, or tourist-oriented shops) they tend to be larger, more modernized, better maintained, and thus more
     expensive than in other small towns.

501	 Self-generated revenues reflect the municipality’s fiscal autonomy and local economic potential. In our analysis, they did not include the portions deducted from PIT (personal income

     tax) for equalization purposes, so that we could focus on those revenues over which the municipality holds a greater degree of control. The per capita formula makes it possible to make
     vertical comparisons (between localities of different sizes or between urban and rural areas) and horizontal comparisons (between localities of the same status but in different counties).
     They were computed as an annual average for the period 2009-2012 using local budget execution data. Revenues were computed in 2009 constant value using the index of inflation
     from the National Institute of Statistics.
502	 Expenditures on projects financed from external sources include European-funded programs (structural funds, the National Rural Development Plan, and the Fisheries Operational

     Program) as well as other programs such as those financed by foreign embassies. However, it can be assumed that at a national level they mostly consist of the European-funded
     programs and, in the case of communes, expenditures financed by the National Rural Development Plan. We computed them as a proxy variable for the total volume of absorbed
     European funds in the period of 2009-2012, as the sum of all expenditures incurred in European-funded projects (in Euros per inhabitant), with the data transformed into Euro based on
     the annual exchange rate from the National Bank of Romania and using population data from the 2011 Population and Housing Census (National Institute of Statistics). Data on this type
     of expenditure was not available for the period of 2007-2008 in the administrative data from the Ministry of Administration and Interior.

528	 The methodology for identifying urban marginalized areas was developed in a World Bank study (Swinkels et al, 2014a) using 2011 Population and Housing Census data. It identifies
     three broad criteria: (i) human capital; (ii) formal employment; and (iii) housing conditions. The analysis was done at the level of the census sectors. Marginalized areas (or census
     sectors) were defined as those that were disadvantaged in all three respects. In addition, the study identified three other types of urban areas that were disadvantaged on terms of one
     or two of the three criteria. The majority of the total urban population (67.8 percent) lives in non-disadvantaged areas, while 11.7 percent live in areas disadvantaged in terms of human
     capital, 9.9 percent live in areas affected by unemployment, 5.2 percent live in areas disadvantaged in terms of housing, and 2.3 percent live in other urban areas.

the lack of identity papers and property documents, even in
places where the local authorities have declared this issue

Current legislation does not allow municipalities to make
them legal owners of this land or give them legal rights
of possession. This problem can only be solved through
national legislation.

     Intermediate Bodies of the Regional Operational Programs and Facilitation of Proactive and Direct Support for Beneficiaries. It indicated that, while many local communities are capable
     of submitting funding proposals, they often lack the capacity to design and implement projects. The report identified several capacity gaps including the inability to define or verify the
     technical specifications of investment projects and to undertake procurement procedures in line with the regulations on EU funds.

                                             develop and implement policies to combat
                                             poverty and social exclusion.
                                             The main priorities should be: (i) upgrading the
                                             current IT system to implement a strong e-social
                                             assistance system; (ii) strengthening coordination
                                             mechanisms and developing an integrated
                                             monitoring and evaluation system; and (iii)
                                             developing a modern payment system.
                                             Each chapter dedicated to people-based (sectoral)
                                             policies presented in detail the priority measures
                                             recommended to increase and strengthen
                                             Romania’s institutional capacity to reduce poverty
                                             and promote social inclusion. Specifically,
                                             each chapter included a sectoral analysis of
                                             development needs in the areas of human, legal,
                                             financial resources and monitoring and evaluation
                                             mechanisms and went on to describe the best
                                             practice solutions to meet these needs. This
                                             chapter presents the main recommendations in
                                             each of these areas.

          Changes in the Current Legal Provisions by Sector
TABLE 44: 
 Employment           Create labor market regulations and promote social dialogue to support the ability of workers to negotiate for wages
                      commensurate with their productivity.
 Social Protection    Enact a new legislative and regulatory framework to consolidate the three current means-tested programs (the GMI, the
                      FSA, and the HB) into a single program - the Minimum Social Insertion Income (MSII) program, soon to become the key
                      anti-poverty program in Romania.
                      Ensure longer contribution periods and higher contribution levels in order to achieve adequate pensions in the future.
                      Review social pension policy to address the low coverage of the pension system of the working age population,
                      especially in rural areas.
                      Review legislation regarding anticipated pensions and the future pension age to address the problems involved in
                      reducing the number of anticipated retirees and raising the pension age.
                      Develop secondary legislation to enforce the government’s comprehensive law on social assistance (292/2011).
                      Unify the medical criteria for assessing the degree of disability for people with disabilities and create a single delivery
                      channel to serve all people with disabilities (currently two separate systems exist to certify an applicant’s disability, one
                      for pensions and one for allowances).
                      Develop comprehensive regulations for occupational therapy covering funding and evaluation methodologies and the
                      inclusion of newly trained professionals in all public and private services that deal with people with disabilities.
 Education            Ensure effective law enforcement mechanisms for ensuring free compulsory education for all children.
                      Draft and pass a specific all-inclusive education law in accordance with the recommendations of the Office of the High
                      Commissioner for Human Rights of the United Nations.
                      Ensure enforcement mechanisms in accordance with the national legislation to ensure that children and young people
                      with disabilities can receive their education in mainstream schools, in special schools, or in special classes integrated
                      into mainstream schools. Develop a coherent framework for a real and constructive partnership between teachers and
                      the parents of their students with special educational needs.
                      Redesign current IVET programs by setting up apprenticeships, redesigning the curricula, developing national
                      sponsorship programs with large companies, and focusing on students most at risk of dropping out.

 Health                 Change the paradigm of public health policy by increased budget allocations to evidence-based preventive and health
                        promotion services, while building programmatic capacity at all levels.
                        Review all national health programs as of 2014 including the national mother-and-child healthcare program. Develop a
                        national plan for healthcare services, followed by prudent investments in infrastructure and human resources.
                        Consider developing local, regional, and national plans for reducing the incidence of unhealthy kinds of behavior and for
                        preventing chronic diseases.
                        Consider changing legislative provisions in order to allow local authorities to hire GPs with funds from the National
                        Health Insurance Fund.
                        Revise, update, and endorse the tasks and job descriptions of community health workers.
                        Review and diversify the interventions included in the minimum and basic benefits packages delivered by family doctors
                        and increase the share of services that proved to be effective (evidence-based services) in reaching the poor.
                        Redesign the National Plan to Prevent and Control M/XDR-TB 2012-2015. Reinforce, through regulatory measures and
                        county-based mapping of resources, the Direct Observed Treatment Strategy and develop procedures and guidelines for
                        HIV/TB detection and care based on international recommendations and protocols.
                        Issue legislation on private health insurance for those who can afford this option.
 Housing                Elaborate a housing policy and a housing strategy to address the excessively high housing cost rate on the poor and to
                        prevent homelessness, especially due to evictions.
                        Ensure the pro-poor focus of the large infrastructure programs aimed at rehabilitating and modernizing the housing and
                        utility stock.
                        Ensure that improvements to local infrastructure and housing will not lead to increased concentration or to the further
                        physical isolation and segregation of marginalized groups.
                        Increase the capacity of shelters, strengthen the capacity for carrying out emergency interventions in the street, adopt
                        regeneration programs to tackle the problem of illegal settlements, cease illegal evictions, and adopt prevention policies
                        for people at risk of ending up in the streets.
 Social Participation   Change the current legislative framework governing volunteering in order to encourage social participation.

     only individuals in the 20 to 34 age group. Employment was also adjusted to take account of the employment rates of the 20 to 64 age group in each year. The unemployed/inactive
     individuals with the highest probability of being employment were “switched” to employed status until the total number of the employed reached the assumed employment level of that
     year. These individuals who are predicted to move from inactivity to employment were imputed earnings based on their level of education, sector of activity, work experience, and other
     variables known from the survey. All individuals who were employed (or were predicted to move from inactivity to employment) received a flat increase in their earnings equal with the
     assumed increase in labor productivity. The social protection transfers to households were assumed to remain at the same level in real terms (in other words, they increased only with
     the expected inflation rate). The incomes of the households were changed according to these assumptions, and the model generated a new, simulated income distribution for each year
     of the forecast period.
551	 The demographic forecast was taken from the National Institute for Statistics.Other demographic changes, such as changes in formal employment, informal employment, the number of

     pensioners, and the real value of their pension, were simulated using the World Bank’s PROST model.

Notes: The size of the locality and the county to which the locality belongs were held constant. In order to compare similar rural and urban localities,
the propensity score method was used. * Only one city and one commune of 15,000 inhabitants or over. ** For comparison, the average shares of
dwellings connected to utilities in larger cities (20,000 or more inhabitants) are the following: 92 percent piped water from the public network, 85
percent sewage disposal system connected to a public sewage disposal plant, and 75.5 percent gas from public network for cooking.

Notes: For recent small towns and communes, the category of 15,000 to 19,999 inhabitants was not included because of the small number of
localities in this category (only one city and one commune). Primary education in Romania refers to grades 1-4, while lower secondary education
is gymnasium (1-8 grades).

Notes: * In urban areas, thresholds are calculated using only census sectors of households with between 50 and 500 inhabitants. ** In rural
areas, thresholds are calculated using only census sectors of households with 50 or more inhabitants. *** Fewer than 1 percent of the urban
dwellings are not connected to electricity and the 80th percentile is therefore 0 percent. Any urban census sector for which at least one
dwelling is not connected to electricity (and thus the value is greater than 0 percent) passes this threshold. **** For the housing criterion, the
rural national threshold was set at 90th percentile and the criterion is passed if any of the three indicators is higher than its corresponding
threshold. ***** Eurostat indicator for overcrowding without the condition referring to a room for the household.
