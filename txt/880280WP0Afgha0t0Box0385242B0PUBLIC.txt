I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
        Afghanistan perceive the Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Afghanistan regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Afghanistan;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Afghanistan;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank ’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in Afghanistan; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Afghanistan.

       Use data to help inform the Afghanistan country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
In June and July 2012, 500 stakeholders of the World Bank in Afghanistan were invited to
provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country
survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President; the office
of a Minister; the National Assembly; employees of a ministry, ministerial departments, or
implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World Bank-supported
projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project;
local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral agencies; private sector
organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community
development councils (CDCs); the media; independent government institutions; trade unions;
academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the judiciary branch. A total of 397 stakeholders
participated in the country survey (79%).

The consulting firm delivered the questionnaires to the field (provinces) and then their field
office contacted respondents by phone. The field staff then delivered the questionnaire to the
respondent with two options: either 1) a rep from the firm would work with the respondent to fill
out or 2) leave the questionnaire and come back collect the filled out questionnaire in a certain
date and time that was agreed mutually. In Kabul most of questionnaires were emailed to
respondents and received back by email.

Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Afghanistan, their overall attitudes toward
the Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust
Fund (ARTF), the Bank’s knowledge; working with the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in
Afghanistan, and the Bank’s communication and information sharing in Afghanistan.

Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are identified
throughout the survey report.

II. Methodology (continued)
A. General Issues facing Afghanistan: Respondents were asked to indicate their perspectives on
   the transition process, the top three development priorities, and which areas would contribute
   most to reducing poverty and generating economic growth in Afghanistan.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Afghanistan, Bank staff preparedness, the
   extent to which the Bank meets Afghanistan’s need for knowledge services and financial
   instruments, the extent to which the Bank should and does seek to influence the global
   development agenda, agreement with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the
   extent to which the Bank is an effective development partner. Respondents were also asked
   to indicate the sectoral areas on which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its
   resources, the Bank’s greatest values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most and least
   effective instruments in helping to reduce poverty in Afghanistan, with which groups the
   Bank should work more in Afghanistan, and how they attribute slow or failed reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve sustainable development results in Afghanistan, and the
   Bank’s level of effectiveness across thirty-six development areas, such as economic growth
   and basic infrastructure.
D. The Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF): Respondents were asked to indicate
   their familiarity with the ARTF and their level of agreement with a variety of statements
   regarding the ARTF.
E. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge/research, the areas on which the Bank should focus its research
   efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge/research, including
   how significant a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
F. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank ’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank disbursing funds promptly, and
   the extent to which the World Bank is adequately staffed in Afghanistan.
G. The Future Role of the World Bank in Afghanistan: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Afghanistan throughout the transition period and to
   indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Afghanistan.

II. Methodology (continued)

H. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate where they
   get information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, their access to the Internet, and their usage and evaluation of the
   Bank’s website and PICs. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s
   Access to Information policy, past information requests from the Bank, and their level of
   agreement that they use more data from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data
   policy. Respondents were also asked to indicate their level of agreement that they know how
   to find information from the Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
I. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Afghanistan, and their geographic location.

In addition, when possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey
were compared to responses from the 386 respondents (77% response rate) who completed the
survey in FY 2008. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, the small number of respondents from private foundations, trade
        unions, and CDCs were combined with those from NGOs to create a “Civil Society”
        category, respondents from multilateral agencies were combined with those from bilateral
        agencies, respondents from the financial sector/private banks were combined with those
        from the private sector, and the few respondents from PMUs, independent government
        institutions, and the judiciary branch were included in the “Other” category.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)

Familiarity with the World Bank

       Across all respondents, familiarity with the Bank received a mean rating of 5.9; this was
        significantly higher than the mean rating received in the FY ’08 country survey (5.0).
             Respondents from Kabul indicated significantly higher levels of familiarity with
              the World Bank in Afghanistan compared to respondents from outside of Kabul.
             Respondents across all stakeholder groups had statistically similar levels of
              familiarity with the Bank.
             It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were
              significantly moderately correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall
              effectiveness in Afghanistan, and had small, but significant correlations with the
              Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results and the Bank’s
              relevance to Afghanistan’s development.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)

       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings of the Bank’s
        effectiveness in eleven of these thirty-six development areas. For the most part,
        employees of ministries and respondents from the office of the President and the private
        sector/financial sector/private banks had the highest rat ings for the Bank’s effectiveness
        across these areas whereas respondents from the National Assembly, civil society, the
        media, and academia/research institutes tended to have significantly lower ratings for the
        Bank’s effectiveness in these areas. Those areas for which there were significant
        stakeholder group differences were:
                 Anti-corruption;
                 Urban development;
                 Environmental sustainability;
                 Regulatory framework;
                 Energy;
                 Monitoring and evaluation;
                 Security/stabilization/reconstruction;
                 Social protection;
                 Public sector reform;

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable development results in Afghanistan, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-six specific areas
of effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of
effectiveness in one specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s
overall effectiveness or perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results.
       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Afghanistan. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at rural development; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at transport.
             Of note, the areas determined to be key drivers of the Bank’s overall effectiveness
              in the FY ’08 country survey were:
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in e nsuring that attention is paid to the
                    environmental impact of Bank supported programs and strategies;
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in helping to strengthen the financial system;
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in safeguarding against corruption in
                    projects/programs that it funds with its procurement rules; and
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in helping to lay the foundation to integrate
                    Afghanistan into the regional economy.

       Achieving Sustainable Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest
        Pearson Product-Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results in
        Afghanistan, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results. The
        areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at rural development;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at global information and communications technology;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at agricultural development; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at urban development.

its critical stakeholders. With this understanding, the World Bank hopes to develop more effective
strategies, outreach and programs that support development in Afghanistan during the transition period
and beyond. The World Bank commissioned an independent firm to oversee the logistics of this effort in
Afghanistan. This ensures anonymity and confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the
