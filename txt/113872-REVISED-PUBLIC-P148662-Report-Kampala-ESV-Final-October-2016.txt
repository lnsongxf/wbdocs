PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This study forms one of the case studies of a larger study on Green Urban Development commissioned by the
World Bank and led by AECOM. Anchor Environmental Consultants (Anchor) was subcontracted by AECOM to
undertake case studies in three cities: Kampala (Uganda), Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) and Durban (South Africa).
Each city was consulted as to the focus of the case study. In the case of Kampala, the city requested a study to
evaluate the potential costs and benefits of rehabilitating the Nakivubo wetland to enable the development of
a recreational park.

The study was led by Dr Jane Turpie of Anchor Environmental Consultants (Anchor). Dr Liz Day of Freshwater
Consulting Group undertook the ecological and restoration aspects of the study, assisted by Kat Forsythe of
Anchor and by Chris Roed of West Coast Engineering on the engineering and costing aspects. Gwyn Letley of
Anchor and Dr. Dambala Gelo Kutela of the University of Cape Town handled the econometric analyses of the
water treatment costs and recreational valuation studies, respectively, while Gwyn Letley also undertook the
cost-benefit analysis. Dr. David Kyamboto of Makere University and his graduate students assisted with the
household survey.

We are grateful to Roland White and Chyi-Yun Huang of the World Bank, Diane Dale, Brian Goldberg and John
Bachmann of AECOM, and Timm Kroeger of The Nature Conservancy for inputs and discussions during the
project planning phase, as well as to the inputs received from reviewers Jeff Wielgus, Mike Toman, Urvashi
Narain and Glen-Marie Lange of the World Bank.

We are also grateful to the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) for their interest and support of this project
- in particular to Najib Lukooya Bateganya for assistance with meetings and data collation. We are also grateful
to Susan Namaalwa and Stephen Tumwebaze of the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) for
provision of water treatment works data and for a tour of the Ggaba water treatment works. Thanks also to the
citizens of Kampala who willingly participated in the household survey.

Thus the following recommendations should be
considered:

1.	 Sanitation measures need to keep ahead of the
    growing urban population, and until this is the case,
    runoff from areas that are not well serviced needs to
    be diverted to a WWTW;

2.	 Water quality standards for waste water treatment
    need to be increased and enforced, and investments
    need to be made in the technological innovation
    required to deal with this;

3.	 There needs to be stricter regulation and control
    of industrial discharges. This should form part of a
    review into industrial effluent guidelines and current
    practices;

4.	 Legal protection of wetlands needs to be
    strengthened, and tough and/or innovative measures
    need to be taken to prevent the reclamation, farming
    and settlement of wetland areas;

5.	 Construction of roads and railways through wetlands
    should be avoided, or at least be done in such a way
    as to minimise impacts on hydro- and sediment
    dynamics and aesthetics;

6.	 Monitoring programmes need to be established,
    including continuous monitoring of flows into the
    wetland, and monthly measures of water quality of
    inflows and within all wetland areas in and around
    Kampala. Water quality monitoring data should be
    made readily available on an online platform for
    potential use by academic institutions, consultants,
    civil society etc. in order to encourage transparency
    and accountability as well as facilitate ongoing
    analysis and adaptive management.

One of the main challenges in achieving the above
would be institutional. Greater Kampala extends well
beyond the boundaries of the KCCA, which originally
encompassed the entire city, and unless the KCCA area
is adjusted accordingly (as has been done in other
countries), the problems that will arise in a growing
city will be in areas under multiple other jurisdictions.
Meanwhile, it may be more pragmatic for these issues to
to be managed by the relevant national institutions such
as NWSC.

plans and the capacity of city managers to provide                        high risk of flooding. However, these wetland areas have
the necessary services. As a result, existing natural                     become increasingly degraded as a result of pollution,

II.	       PAPYRUS WETLANDS AND THEIR FUNCTIONING
Papyrus wetlands are associated with shallow,                               Papyrus grows in dense stands, either rooted to the
permanent and slow moving freshwater systems and                            substrate, or in the form of floating mats. The floating

& Kemp (2016) which is based on more detailed satellite

was lost between 2002 and 2014, mostly attributable
to crop cultivation. In recent years, the lower wetland
has begun to break up, likely as a result of the intensive
use of this area for agriculture. By mid-2015, a large
section of Miscanthidium had broken away as a result of
agricultural activities.

  only small areas of papyrus swamp were recorded in the upper
  wetland and the remaining lower wetland was dominated by papyrus
  (floating as well as rooted) and Miscanthidium grass.

IV.	 CURRENT CAPACITY FOR WATER TREATMENT
Emerton et al. (1998) suggested that the Nakivubo
wetland treated almost all effluents entering the system
and significantly improved the quality of water entering
Inner Murchison Bay. However, the overall assimilative
capacity of the wetland is assumed to have decreased
substantially since then.

Kansiime & Nalubega (1999) showed that uptake rates
of total nitrogen by the functional papyrus areas of the
wetland were in the order of 475 kg N/ha/year, and
total phosphorus reduction (through sedimentation
and uptake) was in the order of 77 kg P/ha/year.

About 70 ha of papyrus and 20 ha of Miscanthidium
currently remains in the Nakivubo wetland, compared
with about 91 ha and 23 ha respectively in 1996. Kansiime
& Nalubega (1999) noted that more of the polluted
inflows came into contact with the Miscanthidium than
with papyrus, but papyrus is more efficient at nutrient
removal and had higher overall removal rates. Based on
their findings, it was estimated that the wetland removed
about 15% of nitrogen and 20% of phosphorus inputs in
1996, but that this has now decreased to 8% and 10%,
respectively, as a result of both increases in nutrient inputs
and absolute decrease in the assimilative capacity of the
wetland. Based on these findings, if the full extent of
the wetland habitat was restored, it could hypothetically
remove about 15% and 19% of current N and P inputs. If
the restored areas were managed as treatment wetlands,
this amount would be further increased (see Chapter 5
and Appendix 6).

B.	      Proposed interventions
A sequential series of interventions, also known as
a treatment train, is required to achieve the broad
and ambitious objectives outlined in Figure 5. The
interventions include both infrastructure upgrades and
wetland rehabilitation and conservation measures. The
six interventions are described briefly below, after which
the high-level cost estimates are summarised and the
cumulative impact of the interventions on water quality
is discussed. A fuller description of the background,
design and assumptions around each set of interventions
is provided in Appendix 6.

Step 1. Prevent pollution at source
Fewer than 10% of households in Kampala have piped
sewage (NWSC Corporate Plan 2012), with the remaining
population depending on various forms of on-site
sanitation such as pit latrines, septic tanks, public toilets
and open defecation. The collection and disposal of
faecal sludge generated in the pit latrines is inadequate
and sanitation in informal settlements is very poor.

In order to prevent raw sewage from entering the wetland
and Inner Murchison Bay, both sanitation coverage and
waste water treatment works (WWTW) capacity will
need to be further increased by improving sanitation in
areas not covered by water-borne sewage, expanding              Figure 5	 Treatment train required to achieve water quality objectives in
                                                                          the lower Nakivubo wetland and Inner Murchison Bay, with brief
sewage systems, along with the provision of public                        summary of actions required at each step. (Note: the sixth step, the

place as minimum standards in any high-density urban
environment. These efforts should be complemented by
improving sweeping and litter collection to reduce the
amount of sediment and solid waste entering the wetland.

Some of these required improvements are already
underway. New WWTW are under construction at
Lubigi and Nakivubo, plus new sewers in Nakivubo and
Kinawataka areas, which will increase the sanitation
coverage to 30% of households in Kampala (NWSC
2014). The new 45 ML Nakivubo WWTW will replace the
Bugolobi WWTW with its current design capacity of 12
ML and effective capacity of 6 ML. This will now deal with
waste water from the Kinawataka catchment as well as
the Nakivubo catchment, so there is some uncertainty as
to how much of the Nakivubo and Kinawataka catchments
respectively will be serviced. The total wastewater load
from the Nakivubo catchment, if fully serviced, would
be about 65 ML. Full coverage of waterborne sewage
may not be feasible or desirable, however. It is probably
more reasonable to aim for coverage of 60-70%, while
implementing other measures such as VIP latrines in the
remaining areas and having waste water treatment works
that can handle waste water flows channelled from those
areas as well as efficient sludge collection services and
treatment facilities.

Not only is it expected that treatment costs will
decrease, but associated costs such as sludge removal
and backwashing are also expected to decrease with
improved water quality. One assumes that the significant
reduction in phosphorus and other nutrients as a result
of restoration will decrease the frequency and intensity
of algal blooms in Inner Murchison Bay and will decrease
the need for continuous backwashing of filters at the
Ggaba WTW. Sludge dewatering and sludge removal can
be very expensive and it is assumed that the improved
water quality will decrease the amount of sludge
produced during the water treatment process and will
therefore reduce the time and costs involved in having
it removed. In the Rio Camboriu watershed in Brazil,
preliminary results have shown that a significant part of
the cost saving associated with improved water quality
was in the savings associated with sludge disposal (Timm

and how much they would be willing to pay to use a

econometric models (for the full study, see Appendix 8).

Based on different models, the revealed preference

suggesting a substantial welfare gain of designing a new
site that involves such changes. The stated preference

between $5.64 and $6.11 per adult, and anticipated
visiting the park on average 2.3 times per year.

do occur, it is likely to be this factor, rather than the state
of the wetland, that drives property prices. However,
away from slums, the health of wetlands is more likely
to have an impact. In the Nakivubo wetland area, while
some of the wetland is fringed with slums, there are
areas where property values may potentially benefit from
wetland restoration. If residents do value open space and
associated amenities then it would be expected that the
willingness to pay for these amenities should be revealed

  Tax increment financing, for example, uses property tax increases
  to repay public infrastructure investment required by a project.
  It encourages investment in deteriorating areas by allowing local
  governments to use future property tax revenues to finance the
  current infrastructure costs needed to attract development. Local
  government could also levy a betterment tax against real estate in
  the area, which is a tax that is dedicated to a specific project that
  helps to improve an area.

  80% TSS reduction assumed, and 40% TP and TN reduction allowed for, on the 80% removed through TSS. These proportions calculated from proportion of TP and

  left in the system – hence 60% of 20% remaining TSS, if 80% TSS removed and 40% Nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients removed.

Box 1.	   The sediment trapping process



     Deposition of transported sediments happens when a river loses energy, e.g. when a river enters a wetland
     or lake. To control and limit the amount of sediment flowing into the Nakivubo wetland, the flow of any rivers
     and channels should be controlled so that they are deposited before entering the wetland. Normal practice
     would be to prevent particles of say 0.5mm or 1mm from being transported.

     Using the Manning equation, Q = [A.R2/3.i1/2] / n, for channels and assuming a channel width of 4m,
     a Manning coefficient of 0.048, and a depth of between 25mm to 100mm, the flow velocities can be
     controlled as follows:

     By controlling the gradient of the Nakivubo channel, the particle sizes being transported would be greatly
     reduced, reducing the sediments and nutrients entering the Nakivubo wetland. To control the gradient it
     is normal practice to install hydraulic drops along the river or channel as shown below. The installation is
     considered relatively inexpensive and will achieve immediate results.

   Even with source measures in place, there will be transfer of sediment and litter into the drainage system.
   In areas that have combined sewer systems (e.g. Europe, North America) removal can be achieved at the
   sewage works, as well as at overflows in very wet weather.

   Where stormwater drainage is separate from the sewage system, the sediments and litter must be trapped
   and removed along the watercourse. A range of designs exist that are applicable to different circumstances,
   from concrete structures within canalised reaches to in-channel excavated depressions.

   Sediment traps in particular will retard velocities to facilitate settling out of sediments. Litter traps work
   best when they incorporate some form of screen (Armitage et al. 1998). Of the different designs of litter
   traps, two patented designs were highlighted by Armitage et al. (1998) as being the most effective – the
   Stormwater Cleaning Systems (SCS) structure (similar to the Baramy Gross Pollutant Trap in Australia), and
   the Urban Water Environmental Management (UWEM) concept. The advantage of the latter is that it can
   trap silt and sewage as well as litter, and can be deigned to handle very large flows.

   While this was all technology that was developed around the 1990s there has not been much more done to
   advance this. The success of these measures depends on the ongoing maintenance of the traps.

   Below are examples of sediment and grit traps developed by Armitage et al. (1998).

Box 2.	   Current treatment of sewage through the Bugolobi WWTW (Source: NWSC)



     Preliminary Treatment: The inlet filter removes debris, large suspended solids and organic matter using
     metallic bar screens, sand traps and grit removal. The waste water then flows into grit chambers where
     heavy solids sink to the bottom and are removed. These chambers remove solids >0.3mm in diameter.

     Primary Treatment: Organic solids are separated from the liquid in the first sludge sedimentation tank
     (primary clarifier). Offensive solids removed through settling and floating materials (scum, oils, grease) are
     removed through skimming in circular sedimentation basins. Removes on average 45-50% of suspended
     solids and 25-30% of the BOD in the incoming waste water. Settled sludge is collected and transported to a
     sludge thickener.

     Secondary Treatment: This purification stage involves treatment by means of biological trickling filter where
     waste water flowing over the surface of a well aerated stone bed where bacteria remove any organic matter,
     commonly known as bio-filters or aeration tanks. After this any excess sediments, suspended matter
     and break-off bacterial film is removed as sludge through a secondary clarifier. The final treated sewage
     effluent is tested and must comply with the national environmental standards before being discharged into
     the receiving environment (Nakivubo) through an artificial wetland. Sludge is moved to anaerobic sludge
     digester beds and then onto sand drying beds. Dried sludge is sold to farmers to use as fertiliser.

     Additional Treatment: Vegetation in the Nakivubo wetland provides final “tertiary treatment”, i.e. the
     removal of excess inorganic nutrients.

services of the new park are seen as normal goods
as its demand increases with income. Furthermore,
the demand for this service is consistent with the law

WTP (demand for the services). Additional significant
demand shifters, other than income and respondents’
characteristics, were the education and age of the
household head. The results suggested that respondents
from households with older and more educated
household heads were more likely to visit Nakivubo
Wetland Park and be willing to pay entry fees.
