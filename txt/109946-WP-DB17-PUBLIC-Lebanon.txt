This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2016 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2016 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2017 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

      of Engineers). The file should include the following:
      • A construction permit application signed by that same civil
      engineer or architect jointly with the real estate owner,
      • The design plans,
      • An agreement between the property owner and the architect or
      engineer responsible for the project described.

      In order to be submitted as part of the application for a building
      permit, the file must bear the seal and registration number of the
      relevant Order of Engineers. The Order of Engineers meets twice
      a week.

      BuildCo must submit the file described in the previous procedure
      to the Urban Development Department. In Beirut and Tripoli, the
      file is referred to the municipal engineering departments. The
5     process takes up to 6 months. The Urban Development                   1 day        no charge

      takes a while from the date BuildCo requests the inspection until
      the date the inspector arrives.

      Agency: Urban Development Department, Directorat Général
      d'Urbanisme (DGU)



      Pay building permit taxes to the municipality

      The Urban Development Department refers the file to the
      relevant municipality (in the case of the city of Beirut, to the
      Administrator of the City of Beirut). The municipality collects the
      construction permit taxes and issues the construction permit in
      the name of the property owner. Payment is made at the
      municipality.

      According to Decree No. 60 of 1988 on Municipal Taxes, the
      building permit taxes paid to the Municipality are a certain value
      per square meter of the building. However, this value per square
      meter is calculated based on the value of 1 square meter of
      construction as follows:

      - From the value of LBP 1 - 25,000: 1.5% of the construction
      value of 1 square meter
7     - From the value between LBP 25,000 - 100,000: 2% of the               1 day      LBP 9,926,952
      construction value of 1 square meter
      - From the value greater than LBP 100,000: 1% of the
      construction value of 1 square meter

      In the case of Doing Business, the value of 1 square meter of
      construction is the total construction value / 1,300.6 sq. m.

      Therefore, the value per square meter without taxes to be paid is
      calculated as follows: (1.5% * 25,000) + (2% * 75,000) + (1% *
      [total construction value - 100,000]).

      Then a 15% municipal tax is added to the value above + 0.05%
      of the construction value of 1 square meter to obtain the total
      value to be paid per sq. m. as a municipal contribution.

      A second tax of 12% of the value above must be paid per square
      meter as a national tax.

      A contribution of 5% of the value above must be paid per square
      meter to the Order of Engineers and Architects.

      Therefore, the above values would all be added to obtain the
      total cost per square meter paid to the municipality for all
      building permit fees, which is then multiplied by 1,300.6 sq. m.
      for the purposes of the Doing Business case study.



      Agency: Municipality



      Obtain building permit

      By law, construction work can start if no decision about the
      building permit application has been made 15 days after the
      submission date. In practice, however, this is not applied, and
8     people wait 4 months on average.                                   120 days      no charge


      Agency: Municipality



      Obtain starting order permit from Order of Engineers

      To start construction the engineer and/or architect must pay the
      dossier fee according to the number of professionals involved in
      the construction work (civil engineer, mechanic engineer,
9     electrical engineer, geotechnical engineer, among others). The      3 days      LBP 200,000

     meter road (such as by excavation or overhead
     lines) but are all carried out on public land. There
     is no crossing of other owners’ private property

    Does not require work to install the internal
     wiring of the warehouse. This has already been
     completed up to and including the customer’s
     service panel or switchboard and the meter base.

      The application is forwarded to the relevant department at the utility for
      review. A site inspection is usually carried out to determine the details of
      the connection.

      The inspector then prepares a report with the specifics of the connection
      and awaits clearance from the relevant authority at the utility.

      Once clearance is obtained and the inspector has prepared an estimate
      of the connection fees, the client will need to make the necessary
      payment at Electricité du Liban’s offices. The client is then given the
      approved file back along with a “C23” card (with the number of
      connections and the temporary meter, if needed).

      Await and receive external works and meter installation from EDL’s
      service provider

      External works start after the client has paid the connection fees. For a
      connection of 3x200A, if the warehouse is less than 200 meters away
      from the closest distribution substation, the works will consist of laying
      out an underground cable from the building to that substation.

      Otherwise, a substation would be needed.

      Any permits needed for the works are obtained by the utility directly.

      The utility picks a contractor to do the external works, and possibly
      install the meter and turn the electricity on too. The utility however,
      always supervises the works.
      The contractor is in charge of applying for any required excavation
      permit with the municipality.

      No inspection of the entire internal wiring is done during the process.

        agreement between the contractor and the utility. The contractor might
        have the right to also turn on the electricity.

        At times when the utility is overloaded, it normally delegates the works
        entirely to its contractor that does the works, installs the meter, and
        turns on the electricity. In this case, the utility only checks the final

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

      be presented once again for review and acceptance.
      It is only when the Land Registrar approves the signed contract and
      accepts to record it that the title to property is transferred to the Buyer.
      Then, once the transaction is completed, the new title deed in the name
      of the Buyer is delivered in about 5-7 business days. As per the express
      and clear provisions of the law, the buyer acquires full ownership only
      when the sale contract is recorded (i.e. after its acceptance) in the Land
      Registry, regardless of when the new deed is delivered to him.

years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                                    BizBank will initiate foreclosure proceedings (saisie exécutoire), because it is
                                      faster and less costly than liquidation proceedings and allows BizBank to

market regulation indicators in an annex. The report
does not present rankings of economies on these
indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance
to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market
regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org). The data on labor
market regulation are based on a detailed questionnaire
on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
