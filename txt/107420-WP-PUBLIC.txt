                            EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report is commissioned to provide a comprehensive benchmarking analysis as part of
the Partnership for Skills in Applied Sciences, Engineering and Technology (PASET)
Regional Benchmarking Initiative. For this phase of the benchmarking exercise, although
48 Sub-Saharan African universities signed up to provide data, only 28 were able to do so.
The results and main findings are:

Inclusion & Equity

   While gender inequality is evident for most universities (the middle 50% have between
    18% and 43% female graduates), the degree to which universities include students
    from low-income families varies greatly (ranging from 2% to 89%).

   Universities have attempted to include more wheelchair students over the past five
    years, but, in majority of the cases (approximately 80% of the cases), this has not been
    accompanied by buildings fully accessible for students with mobility limitations.

   A significantly proportion of universities have demonstrated a substantial amount of
    effort in supporting students with limited financial means in higher education (on
    average, 1 in every 2 first-year undergraduate is a recipient of need-based aid) as well
    as students with exceptional academic accomplishments (on average, 1 in every 3 first-
    year undergraduate is a recipient of merit-based aid).

Learning Achievement / Quality of Teaching & Learning

   The proportion of graduates passing professional examinations varies greatly (ranging
    from 25% to 100%), but a trend of improvement in passing rate is observed (mean and
    median passing rates have increased by 10% and 31% respectively).

   Students are most satisfied with the quality of their academic interactions with other
    students (mean score = 4.07, median score = 4.00) than their interaction with academic
    staff (mean score = 3.59, median score = 3.52). This is consistent with the observed
    reduction in the expected intensity of mentoring and contact between students and
    teachers proxied by the student/academic staff ratio (median increased from 14 to 20).


                                             i
   On average, 7 out of every 10 university entrants successfully completed their bachelor
    program and most of them graduate on time (mean = 87%). In comparison the
    proportions of master’s students (mean = 86%) and PhD students (mean = 76%) who
    graduate on time are lower.

   Students on average are most satisfied with the quality of libraries (mean score = 3.32,
    median score = 3.18) and least satisfied with the quality of IT infrastructure (mean
    score = 2.69, median score = 2.79).

   The quality of teaching shows a favourable trend as the average proportion of
    academic staff with pedagogical training (median increased from 14% to 24%) and the
    average proportion of accredited programs (median increased from 83% to 91%)
    increased significantly in the past five years.

Labour Market Outcomes / Relevance

   For the participating universities, 3 out of every 5 graduates on average were employed
    within 6 months after graduations. The distribution is spread out (ranging from 18%
    to 100%), suggesting that some universities are much more capable than others in
    developing students’ knowledge and ability to meet the demands of the employers.

   The low employment rate is likely to be associated with low relevance of the courses
    and curriculum design to the job market. Despite universities’ increasing efforts in
    encouraging employers and practitioners’ participation in the past five years, only 1 in
    every 3 students did an internship (mean = 36%) and only a small proportion of full-
    time lecturers are practitioners (median = 3%).

Internationalisation

   While the proportion of foreign and foreign-trained academic staff did not change
    much over the five-year period, the proportion of international joint publications has
    improved for those used to have little international research collaboration (minimum
    value = 16%).

   The participating universities are not very active in sending students abroad (mean =
    1.36%) and absorbing foreign students (mean = 9%).



                                              ii
Research Results / Research

   None of the participating universities are considered by Shanghai Ranking’s Academic
    Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) due to the lack of research influence.

   Of the universities which have scientific papers indexed by Elsevier’s Scopus, the
    majority have less than 200 papers.

   The proportion of academics with a doctoral degree spans a wide range from 5% to
    89%, revealing a huge performance gap to be closed by those with extremely low
    percentage of academics with a doctoral degree.

   The median amount of internal and external research funding per academic staff has
    been more than tripled in five years’ time. This is accompanied by an increased
    proportion of the universities’ overall income spent on research (median increased
    from 1% to 3%).

Technology Transfer Results / Service to the Community & Technology Transfer

   Participating universities in general did not demonstrate visible technology transfer
    results in terms of the number of new patents (mean = 0.92), the number of spin-offs
    (mean = 1.31), and the number of jobs created (mean = 5.31) over the past three years.

   The unsatisfactory technology transfer results correspond with a relatively low
    participation rate of academic staff in technology transfer activities (median = 12%)
    and the very small proportion of institutional budget spent on technology transfer
    activities (median = 0%).

Governance & Management

   Participating universities on average have a relatively high level of organisational
    autonomy (mean score = 3.29 out of 4) and academic freedom (mean score = 2.43 out
    of 3). There has been a lack of autonomy for financial management (mean score = 1.42
    out of 3).

   Participating universities are moving towards a more objective and transparent
    selection process of leaders (mean score increased from 2.08 to 2.20) as well as well-



                                            iii
    established management information systems (mean score increased from 2.04 to
    2.24).

   While the turnover of academic staff should not raise managerial concerns, some
    should pay attention to the number of academic days disrupted by strikes (maximum
    for the academic period 2014-2015 = 30 days).

Finance

   25% of the participating universities have more than half of their overall institutional
    income attributable to self-generated income (third quartile = 51%).

Data Collection & Quality

   The majority of the participants have found it difficult to meet the initial submission
    deadline, and there was a lack of adequate communication to reduce confusion and
    ambiguities with regard to what was expected to be submitted. Participants were also
    slow in responding to changes and additional requests made by the benchmarking team
    once the data collection process has started.

   Data inconsistencies were common for the participating universities, and the most
    commonly cited reasons are mistakes made in data entries and lack of understanding
    of the indicator descriptions. The issue of comparability has also emerged as the results
    do not distinguish between different types of universities and student survey results of
    different quality.

   For the benchmarking team and also for the participating universities, more careful
    thought should be given to balance the usefulness of information and the feasibility of
    collecting such information within the time allowed. More efforts should be devoted
    during the launching stage of the benchmarking exercise to ensure that participants
    understand what is expected from them.

   To enhance the quality of data, it would be desirable if the data submitted by
    participants are supported with solid evidence. An online data submission platform
    with pre-imposed data validation rules and formats would help those less experienced
    in reporting data of better quality.

                                  I. OVERALL APPROACH

In this benchmarking report, a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of the participating
Sub-Saharan African universities is conducted in terms of the key indicators identified and
constructed for the purpose of assessing institutional performance and health. While
university benchmarking is a relatively new approach for most Sub-Saharan African
universities that are participating for the first time in this process, it has been used as a
diagnosis and planning tool by many universities to understand and track their own
performance over time and against their local and global peers.

For Sub-Saharan African universities, there is a need to take stock of outstanding
achievements in the past, catch up with local peers in the near future, and set long-term
targets on the road to becoming a top-performing university in the world. It is expected that
this benchmarking analysis will serve as the basis for understanding the relative
performance of Sub-Saharan African universities as well as a catalyst for these universities
to take appropriate quality improvement measures and carry out effective strategic
planning.

For this phase of the Partnership for Skills in Applied Sciences, Engineering and
Technology (PASET) Regional Benchmarking Initiative, 28 out of the 48 Sub-Saharan
African universities that signed up have participated and attempted the benchmarking
exercise to different extents.1 The data that these participating universities have provided
serve as the basis for benchmarking analysis. In particular, the benchmarking results are
analysed in two ways. First, for each of the performance and institutional health indicator,
a five-number summary is reported, which consists of the five most important sample
percentiles: the minimum, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the
maximum. This allows participating universities to see where their institution fits into one
of three broad bands: the top 25% (i.e. greater than the third quartile), the middle 50% (i.e.
between the first quartile and the third quartile), and the bottom 25% (i.e. less than the first
quartile). The analysis also includes the mean values (average) and the number of

institutions reporting valid data at the time when the analysis was conducted.2 Second, the
time evolution perspective is incorporated into the analysis whenever possible by
comparing the central tendency and dispersion of the indicators for the most recent data
period as well as the period five years earlier.3 This allows the participants to understand
the evolution of performance and its determinants over time and to identify those indicators
that are improving or deteriorating at different paces.




2
 Specifically, the analysis includes universities which have submitted data by 15 th May 2016. For universities
which have not responded to the request for data validation by 25th May 2016, some of the data may have
been selectively excluded from the analysis for the purpose of maintaining data consistency and validity.

  Except for a few occasions, the most recent period refers to the academic/calendar year 2014-2015, whereas
the period five years earlier refers to the academic/calendar year 2009-2010.

                   II. DETAILED ANALYSIS BY INDICATOR

The benchmarking analysis makes a fundamental distinction between the results of tertiary
education (i.e. performance indicators) and the drivers of performance that account for
these results (institutional health indicators). From the performance perspective, the
analysis would help Sub-Saharan African universities to assess how well they have
performed in attaining expected performance levels. From the institutional health
perspective, the analysis would help Sub-Saharan African universities to understand how
well the key inputs they have invested, together with the main processes and enabling
factors in their environment, reflect conditions that are known to bring about favourable
outcomes.4

2.1 Performance Indicators

2.1.1 Inclusion & Equity

              P1. Proportion of graduates from the lowest two income quintiles

P1 measures the proportion of graduates whose parents belong to the lowest two income
quintiles of the country where the university resides. For the academic year 2014-2015, the
average proportion of graduates from the lowest two income quintiles is 40%, which means
2 out of every 5 graduates are from families considered as having low income levels (Figure
P1 and Table P1). P1 is slightly negatively skewed where the median is 44%, which means
50% of the participants who answered this question have more than 44% graduates from
the lowest two income quintiles. The distribution of P1 is spread out with a range of 87%,
and the middle 50% of the universities have the values of P1 between 10% and 72%,
suggesting that the mean is not typical for all participants.

Compared with the summary statistics of P1 for the academic year 2009-2010, the
proportion of graduates from the lowest two income quintiles has not changed much. The

median of P1 increased from 37% to 44% while the mean of P1 dropped from 42% to 40%,
reflecting only slight changes in the degree and direction of data asymmetry.

                           P2. Proportion of female graduates

P2 measures the proportion of females among the graduates. For the academic year 2014-
2015, the average proportion of female graduates is 29%, which means approximately 3
out of every 10 graduates are female (Figure P2 and Table P2). The median is 27%, which
means 50% of the participants who answered this question have less than 27% female
graduates, and this proportion goes to as low as 11%. If one considers complete gender
equality as having 50% male graduates and 50% female graduates, the distribution of P2
shows obvious gender inequality as data are concentrated in the below-50% zone with a
range of 47% and an interquartile range of 25%. The middle 50% of the universities have
the values of P2 between 18% and 43%, and only 2 out of the 21 participants who have


                                             4
answered this question have the proportion of female graduates more than their proportion
of male graduates.5

Compared with the summary statistics of P2 for the academic year 2009-2010, the average
proportion of female graduates has increased by 1%. The middle 50% of the universities
have shifted towards a higher percentage of female graduates in the academic year 2014-
2015 (interquartile range from 18% to 43%) than that five years earlier (14% to 40%).

2.1.2 Learning Achievement

          P3. Proportion of graduates passing professional examinations successfully

means 7 out of every 10 graduates have successfully passed professional qualification
examinations (Figure P3 and Table P3). P3 is negatively skewed where the median is 84%,
which means 50% of the participants who answered this question have an examination
passing rate of more than 84%. The distribution of P3 varies widely with a range of 75%,
and the middle 50% of the participants have the values of P3 between 34% and 93%,
suggesting that the mean is not typical of the highest (100%) and the lowest (25%) passing
rate.

Compared with the summary statistics of P3 for the academic year 2009-2010, the average
proportion of graduates who successfully passed professional examinations has improved
significantly. The mean and median passing rates have increased by 10% and 31%
respectively, suggesting that the academic programs offered by the universities are better
at preparing students for providing professional services now than they were five years
earlier.6

                               P4. Student satisfaction survey results

P4 uses student satisfaction survey as the instrument to assess the overall learning
experience of undergraduate students. With regard to this performance indicator, students
were asked five questions about their opinions towards their courses and their interactions
with academic faculty staff and students.7 A 5-point Likert scale is used to capture the
opinions of students, where 5 means very positive experience and attitudes towards the
learning experience and 1 means very negative experience and attitudes. Of the 28
participating universities, more than 20 have reported valid survey results from samples of
undergraduate students.8 However, the sample size varies greatly, ranging from less than
50 to more than 10,000.9

Out of the five aspects of students’ learning experience covered by the student survey,
students on average are most satisfied with the quality of their academic interactions with
other students (mean score = 4.07, median score = 4.00 ) and least satisfied with student
support services (mean score = 3.05, median score = 3.07). Their average level of
satisfaction with course designs and their interaction with academic faculty staff is
somewhere between 3.4 and 3.7.

The distribution of the survey results also show some interesting patterns. Specifically, the
interquartile range for P4-4 (i.e. the quality of student’s academic interaction with other
students) is the lowest among the five survey questions and the interquartile range for P4-
5 (i.e. the quality of interaction with student support services) is the highest among the five
survey questions. This suggests that students’ positive feelings towards their interaction
with other students are similar while their opinions towards the interaction with student
support services vary greatly.

  See Annex C, Student Satisfaction Survey Questions.

  While some participating universities also conducted surveys of postgraduate students, they are excluded
for the analysis of P4 to enhance comparability of the results.
9
  Based on the data provided by a very limited number of participating universities, the survey response rate
ranges from less than 1% to 20%, which raises some concerns about the representativeness of the student
survey results. This issue is discussed further in Section 3.


                                                     7
For each university, an overall score is computed by taking the average value of the fives
scores from P4-1 through to P4-5. As indicated by the first quartile value of 3.20, 75% of
the participating universities have their students generally satisfied with their learning
experience. For those whose overall score is below 3.00, investigations need to be
conducted in order to understand why students’ expectations are not met and to identify
areas of improvement that can be made to enhance students’ learning experience.

   P5. Proportion of graduates who are employed as professionals within 6 months of
                                         finishing

P5 measures the proportion of graduates who are employed as professionals within 6
months after graduation or after finishing the compulsory national service. For the
academic year 2013-2014, the average employment rate is 59%, which means
approximately 3 out of every 5 graduates were employed within 6 months after graduations
(Figure P5 and Table P5). P5 is slightly positively skewed where the median is only slightly
more than 50%. This is not a satisfactory level of performance in terms of labour market
outcome considering that almost half of the graduates were still in the process of seeking
employment opportunities 6 months after graduation. The distribution of P5 is spread out,
ranging from 18% to 100%, and the middle 50% of the participants have the values of P5
between 39% and 83%, suggesting that some universities are much more capable than
others in developing students’ knowledge and ability to meet the demands of the employers
and the society at large.

Compared with the summary statistics of P5 for the academic year 2008-2009, the average
proportion of graduates who are employed as professionals within 6 months of finishing
has not changed much. The median of P5 increased from 53% to 56% while the mean of
P5 dropped by 1% from 60% to 59%, reflecting only slight changes in the degree and
direction of data asymmetry.

2.1.4 Research Results

                 P6. Number of high impact scientific papers (absolute numbers)

P6 measures the number of scientific papers with high impact, which is expected to reflect
a university’s research activities and its capability in producing research publications at the
international level. Data are drawn from the 23,000 academic journals indexed by
Elsevier’s Scopus database and include all papers where at least one author is affiliated to
the participating university.10

Out of the 28 participating universities, 17 have scientific papers indexed by Scopus
(Figure P6 and Table P6). In particular, for the calendar year 2015, an average of 177
papers were indexed. The median of P6 is 150, which means 8 out of the 17 universities
have more than 150 papers indexed by Scopus. The distribution of P6, however, varies
widely with a range of 661, suggesting that the mean is not typical of the highest (678
papers) and the lowest (17 papers).

Compared with the summary statistics of P6 for the calendar year 2010, the number of
papers indexed by Scopus has expanded noticeably. The mean of P6 increased by 53 from
124 to 177 while the median of P6 increased by 65 from 85 to 150. A closer examination
of the changes in P6 over the past five-year period reveals that only 4 out of the 17
universities indexed by Scopus have experienced shrinks in the number of papers while all
others have experience significant growths.11

     Only articles and reviews are considered for the purpose of P6.

graduates are those awarded with doctoral degrees. P8 is positively skewed where the
median is only 1%, suggesting that 50% of the participants have equal to or less than 1%
of their graduates who were awarded doctoral degrees. The distribution of P5 is

representative of the universities who have answered this question.12

Compared with the summary statistics of P8 for the academic year 2009-2010, the average
number of doctorates relative to the total number of graduates has declined markedly. The
median and mean of P8 dropped by 1% over the five-year period. The top 25% of
universities have 7 doctorates out of every 100 graduates five years earlier as compared to
3 doctorates out of every 100 graduates.

           P9. Number of research masters produced as proportion of total graduates

P9 measures the number of research masters produced relative to the total number of
graduates. For the academic year 2014-2015, the average proportion is 24%, which means
approximately 1 in every 4 graduates are awarded with research masters (Figure P9 and

12
  In an extreme case of University B, the value of P8 is as high as 18% because it is strictly a postgraduate
school which only offers Master’s and doctoral programs. Please refer to Annex D for more details.

Table P9). P9 is positively skewed where the median is 11%, which means 50% of the
participants who answered this question have more than 11% of their graduates awarded
with research masters.

Compared with the summary statistics of P9 for the academic year 2009-2010, the
proportion of graduates awarded with research masters is lower for the academic year
2014-2015. The median of P9 decreased from 13% to 11% while the mean of P9 decreased
from 27% to 24%, indicating that more efforts and resources are required to enhance the
universities’ capacity to engage students in degrees that involve a significant component
of research work.

P10. Position in ShanghaiRanking’s Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU)

P10 indicates the position of participating universities in ARWU. More than 1200
universities are ranked by ARWU every year, and the universities included in ARWU are
often regarded as global research universities. In the five-year period leading up to 2015,


                                              13
none of the participating universities are considered by ARWU due to the lack of global
research influence (Table P10).13

2.1.5 Technology Transfer Results

                        P11. Number of new patents over previous 3 years

P11 measures the number of new patents over a three-year period from 1 January 2013 to
31 December 2015. 14 Based on the data reported by 13 participating universities,
technology transfer in terms of patents is not yet a common phenomenon. The median of
P11 is 0, which means that 50% of the participating universities do not have any new
patents assigned to inventors working in the university over the past 3 years (Table P11).
The mean of 0.92 is not typical for all participants, because it is mainly influenced by one
university which reported 9 new patents for the period between 2013 and 2015.

   ARWU considers every university that has any Nobel Laureates, Fields Medalists, Highly Cited
Researchers, or papers published in Nature or Science. Universities with a significant amount of papers
indexed by by Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCIE) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) are also
included.
14
   Due to the very small numbers of new patents reported by participating universities, its ratio to full-time
equivalent academic staff is close to zero in most cases. As a result, P11 is summarised and reported in terms
of absolute numbers.

                         P12. Number of spin-offs over previous 3 years

P12 measures the number of spin-offs over a three-year period from 1 January 2013 to 31
December 2015.15 Based on the data reported by 13 participating universities, the majority
of the universities did not track their formal knowledge transfer arrangements. 16 The
median of P12 is 0, which means that 50% of the participating universities do not have any
spin-offs created in the previous 3 years (Table P12). The mean of 1.31 is not typical for
all participants, because it is mainly influenced by one university which reported 10 spin-
offs for the period between 2013 and 2015.

P13 Number of jobs created through technology commercialisation over previous 3 years

P13 measures the number of jobs created by a university’s spin-offs over a three-year
period.17 Based on the data reported by 13 participating universities, the majority of the
universities did not create jobs (median = 0) as they do not have any spin-offs created in
the previous 3 years (Table P13). The mean of 5.31 is not typical for all participants,
because it is mainly influenced by two universities which reported more than 20 jobs
created by the spin-offs.

2.2 Institutional Health Indicators

2.2.1 Inclusion & Equity

        H1. Proportion of first-year students from the lowest two income quintiles

H1 measures the proportion of first-year students whose parents belong to the lowest two
income quintiles. For the academic year 2014-2015, the average proportion of first-year
students from the lowest two income quintiles is 42%, which means approximately 2 out
of every 5 first-year students are from families considered as having low income levels
(Figure H1 and Table H1). H1 is positively skewed where the median is 29%, which means
50% of the participants who answered this question have less than one third of the first-
year students from the lowest income quintiles. The middle 50% of the participants have
the value of H1 between 20% and 70%, suggesting a spread-out data distribution and that
the mean is not typical for all participants.

Compared with the summary statistics of H1 for the academic year 2009-2010, the average
proportion of first-year students from the lowest two income quintiles has declined. The
mean of H1 decreased from 44% to 22% while the median of H1 decreased more
significantly from 34% to 29%, suggesting that more attention needs to be paid to talented
youth from low families in terms of training opportunities offered to them.

                      H2. Proportion of first-year undergraduate female students

H2 measures the proportion of females among first-year undergraduate students. For the
academic year 2014-2015, this average proportion is 31%, which means approximately 1
out of every 3 first-year undergraduate students are female (Figure H2 and Table H2). The
middle 50% of the universities have the values of H2 between 20% and 44%. If one
considers complete gender equality as having 50% first-year undergraduate male students
and 50% first-year undergraduate female students, the distribution of H2 shows obvious
gender inequality as data are concentrated in the below-50% zone, and only 3 out of the 24
participants who have reported valid data have the proportion of first-year undergraduate
female students more than their proportion of first-year undergraduate male students.18

mean of H2 increased by 1% from 30% to 31% while the median of H2 increased by 2%
from 28% to 30%. It is also worth noting that the minimum value of H2 has increased
markedly from 2% to 8%, suggesting the university which used to have the greatest issue
of gender equality has been catching up at a fast pace.

                        H3. Accessibility for wheel-chair students

H3 measures the number of students who use wheelchairs or have other mobility limitation
(i.e. H3-1) as well the extent to which university buildings provide convenience to these
students (i.e. H3-3). For the academic year 2014-2015, the average proportion of H3-1 is
0.07%, which means approximately 7 in every 10,000 students use wheelchairs or have
other mobility limitations (Figure H3.1 and Table H3.1). The median of H3-1 is 0.02%,
suggesting that at least 50% of the participants who answered this question have students
who use wheelchair or have other limitations. However, only about one quarter of the
universities have made all buildings fully accessible for wheelchair students (Figure H3.2).

Compared with the summary statistics of H3 for the academic year 2009-2010, the average
proportion of students who use wheelchairs has increased. The mean of H3-1 as a
proportion of all students increased by 0.01% while the median increased by 0.02%.
Together with the upward shift in the median-to-third-quartile values over the past five
years, the change reflects a better inclusion of wheel-chair students and students with other
mobility limitations. For the same period concerned, the percentage of universities with all
buildings fully accessible for wheelchair students has increased by more than 10% from
15% in the academic year 2009-2010 to 26% in the academic year 2014-2015, reflecting
the efforts and resources that universities have devoted to improve the infrastructure for
students with special needs.

         H4. Proportion of first-year undergraduate students receiving financial aid

H4 measures the proportion of first-year undergraduate students who receive financial aid
in the form of need-based aid (H4-1) and/or merit-based financial aid (H4-2). For the
academic year 2014-2015, the average proportion of first-year undergraduate students who


                                              19
receive need-based aid is 50%, which means 1 in every 2 first-year undergraduate is
recipient of such support (Figure H4.1 and Table H4.1). The distribution of H4-1 is spread
out with a range of 98% and an interquartile range of 54%, suggesting that the mean is not
typical for all participants.

Compared with the summary statistics of H4-1 for the academic year 2009-2010, the
average proportion of students who receive need-based aid has increased. The mean of H4-
1 as a proportion of all undergraduate students increased by 9% while the median increased
by 10%. The interquartile range has shifted upwards, which reveals an improvement in the
inclusion of students with limited financial means in higher education.

For the academic year 2014-2015, the average proportion of first-year undergraduate
students who receive merit-based aid is 33%, which means 1 in every 3 first-year
undergraduate is a recipient of such support (Figure H4.2 and Table H4.2). The distribution
of H4-2 is spread out with a range of 96% and an interquartile range of 69%, suggesting



                                                20
that the proportion of students who receive merit-based financial aid varies greatly amongst
the participating universities.

Compared with the summary statistics of H4-2 for the academic year 2009-2010, the
average proportion of students who receive merit-based aid has increased. The mean of
H4-2 as a proportion of all undergraduate students increased by 5% while the median
increased by 7%. This reflects an improvement in the efforts made by universities to attract
students of exceptional academic accomplishments.

2.2.2 Quality of Teaching & Learning

                                H5. Student/academic staff ratio

H5 measures the number of students per member of the full-time equivalent (FTE)
academic staff. For the academic year 2014-2015, both the median and mean student/staff
ratio is around 20, which means an average level of 20 students for every one academic



                                                 21
staff for participating universities who have answered this question (Figure H5 and Table
H5). The distribution of H5 varies widely with a range of 40, suggesting that the mean is
not typical of the highest (44.72) and the lowest (5.21) student/staff ratio.

Compared with the summary statistics of H5 for the academic year 2009-2010, the
student/staff ratio has increased in terms of the median (increased by 6.4) and inter-
quartiles (first quartile increased by 2.8 and third quartile increased by 5.8).19 This suggest
an increase in the class size or reduction in the expected intensity of mentoring and contact
between students and teachers as compared to that five years earlier.

  The mean value of H5 for the academic year 2009-2010 is rightly skewed and influenced greatly by an
extreme value of 141.18, and is hence excluded from the main discussion. Please see Annex D for more
details.

                      H6. Intensity of use of innovative pedagogical practices

H6 measures the proportion of teaching and learning programs that use innovative
pedagogical practices as the main mode of delivery.20 For the academic year 2014-2015,
the average proportion is 66%, which means 2 out of every 3 teaching and learning
programs offered by participating universities use innovative pedagogical practices as the
main mode of delivery (Figure H6 and Table H6). The median is 97%, which means 50%
of the participants who answered this question used innovative pedagogical practices for
almost all of their academic programs. The distribution of H6 is spread out widely with the
highest proportion of 100% and the lowest proportion of 0%. This suggests that the mean
is not typical for all participants, and a number of participating universities still rely on
traditional lectures as the main form of delivery.

Compared with the summary statistics of H6 for the academic year 2009-2010, the
proportion of teaching and learning programs that use innovative pedagogical practices as
the main mode of delivery has not changed much. This reflect a rather stable program
designs and structures adopted by the participating universities.

  Innovative pedagogical practices include, but are not limited to, peer instruction, problem-based learning,
design-based learning, use of simulations or games for learning purposes, service learning, self-learning,
integration of industry-enterprise based practical training into the formal curriculum.

         H7. Proportion of academic staff having received pedagogical training

H7 measures the proportion of academic staff who hold certification from accredited
pedagogical training programs. For the academic year 2014-2015, the average proportion
is 42%, which means approximately 2 out of every 5 academic staff have received
pedagogical training certification (Table H7 and Figure H7). H7 is positively skewed where
the median is 24%, which means approximately 50% of the participating universities have
less than one quarter of their academic staff who hold certification from accredited
pedagogical training programs. The distribution of H7 is spread out, ranging from 0% to
100%, and the middle 50% of the participants have the values of H7 between 0% and 97%,
suggesting that some participating universities are capable of delivering better-quality
teaching than others.

programs, compared with only 28% for the top 25% participating universities five years
earlier.

              H8. Proportion of an undergraduate cohort that actually graduates

H8 measures the proportion of new entrants that successfully completed their bachelor
program.21 Based on the data reported by 17 participating universities, the mean graduation
rate is 70%, which means approximately 7 out of every 10 university entrants successfully
completed their bachelor program (Table H8).22 The median of H8 is 83%, which means
that 50% of the participating universities have graduation rates greater than 83%. The
distribution of graduation rate is spread out with the highest rate of 100% and the lowest
rate of 3%, revealing a huge performance gap to be closed by those with extremely low
graduation rates.

   A time span of four years is used where the number of bachelor degrees awarded cover the academic
periods 2012/13, 2013/14, and 2014/15; the number of new entrants cover the academic periods 2008/09,
2009/10, and 2010/11.

   In the data collection phase, H8 was among one of the most “noisy” indicators that have caused confusion
of participants. In particular, the design of the H8 indicator did not take into account the variation in the
length of bachelor programs and the fact that some students did not graduate on time. This means H8 needs
to be refined in future phases of benchmarking initiatives.

                    H9. Proportion of students who graduate on time

H9 measures the proportion of graduates that graduated within the time expected for their
bachelor (i.e. H9-1/2), master’s (i.e. H9-3/4) and PhD program (i.e. H9-5/6). For the
academic year 2014-2015, about 75% of the participating universities who answered this
question have the proportion of bachelor students who graduate on time greater than 83%,
suggesting sound organisation of the universities’ programs and teaching effectiveness on
average (Figure H9.1 and Table H9.1). The distribution of H9-1/2 is relatively concentrated
with only one participant who reported a value less than 80%.

Compared with the summary statistics of H9-1/2 for the academic year 2009-2010, there
had been a shrink in the proportion of bachelor students who graduate on time. The mean
of H9-1/2 for the academic year 2009-2010 was 7% higher than that for the academic year
2014-2015. Moreover, the median was 100%, as more than half of the universities have
100% of their bachelor students graduating on time five years earlier.

For the academic year 2014-2015, about 50% of the participating universities who
answered this question have the proportion of master’s students who graduate on time
greater than 98% (i.e. median = 98%) (Figure H9.2 and Table H9.2). The proportion of
master’s students who graduate on time for the bottom 25% of the universities is less than
62%, which is relatively low compared to the performance of the bottom 25% universities
on the proportion of bachelor students who graduate on time.

Compared with the summary statistics of H9-3/4 for the academic year 2009-2010, there
has been an improvement in the average proportion of master’s students who graduate on
time. The mean (from 78% to 86%) and median (from 90% to 98%) of H9-3/4 both
increased by 8% in five years’ time.

                           H10. Quality of educational facilities

H10 uses student satisfaction survey as the instrument to assess the quality of educational
facilities. With regard to this institutional health indicator, students were asked five
questions about their opinions towards the richness and quality of educational facilities that
they can utilise and tendency to recommend their universities to graduating high school




                                               28
students.23 A 5-point Likert scale is used to capture the opinions of students, where 5 means
very positive experience and attitudes towards the learning experience and 1 means very
negative experience and attitudes. Of the 28 participating universities, more than 20 have
reported valid survey results from samples of undergraduate students. 24 However, the
sample size varies greatly, ranging from less than 50 to more than 10,000.25

Out of the four aspects of educational facilities covered by the student survey, students on
average are most satisfied with the quality of libraries (mean score = 3.32, median score =
3.18) and least satisfied with the quality of IT infrastructure (mean score = 2.69, median
score = 2.79) (Figure H10 and Table H10). Their average level of satisfaction with the
quality of classrooms and quality of laboratories is somewhere between 2.9 and 3.1. On
average, students are inclined to recommend their universities to graduating high school
students (mean score = 3.69, median score = 3.70).26

For each university, an overall score is computed by taking the average value of the fives
scores from H10-1 through to H10-5. While the majority of the participating universities
have their students generally satisfied with the educational facilities provided by their
universities, there exists a significant performance gap for those belonging to the bottom
25%, where the overall score is less than 3. Investigations need to be conducted in order to
understand why students’ expectations are not met and to identify areas of improvement
that can be made to enhance the quality of educational facilities that students can utilise.

Similar to the patterns discovered for performance indicator P4, the distribution of the
survey results is more (less) spread out when the average opinion score is relatively low
(high). This suggests that students’ positive feelings towards some of the educational
facilities (i.e. libraries and classrooms) are similar while their opinions towards the others
(i.e. IT infrastructure and laboratories) vary greatly.

   See Annex C, Student Satisfaction Survey Questions.
24
   While some participating universities also conducted surveys of postgraduate students, they are excluded
for the analysis of H10 to enhance comparability of the results.
25
   Based on the data provided by a very limited number of participating universities, the survey response rate
ranges from less than 1% to 20%, which raises some concerns about the representativeness of the student
survey results. This issue is discussed further in Section 3.
26
   Out of the 25 universities which answered H10-5, only three have reported a score below 3.

                          H11. Proportion of accredited programs

H11 measures the proportion of programs accredited by national accreditation council,
which proxies for the quality of programs offered in the universities. For the academic year
2014-2015, the average proportion of accredited programs is 76%, which means more than
two thirds of the programs offered in participating universities are accredited by national
accreditation council (Figure H11 and Table H11). The median is 91%, which means for
the top 50% of the participants who answered this question, the proportion of accredited
programs is as high as 91%. The distribution of H11 spans a wide range where, in worse


                                                30
cases, none of the programs offered in the university are accredited. This suggests that the
mean is not typical for all participating universities.

Compared with the summary statistics of H11 for the academic year 2009-2010, the
average proportion of accredited programs has improved significantly for universities
belonging to the bottom 25% (first quartile increased from 46% to 64%). These universities
have been catching at a fast pace and the performance gap is closing.

                  H12. Existence of a solid internal quality assurance system

H12 measures the effectiveness and efficiency of teaching and learning in universities by
asking whether there exists a solid internal quality assurance system. For the academic year
2014-2015, more than half of the universities claim that they have strong internal quality
assurance system with dedicated personnel and procedures (Figure H12 and Table H12).
This represents a significant improvement from the academic year 2009-2010, where only
20% of the universities claim that they have strong internal quality assurance system with



                                                31
dedicated personnel and procedures. Meanwhile, the number of universities which report
no formal internal quality assurance system for the academic year 2014-2015 is only 1/4
of that five years earlier.

      H13. Proportion of students who do an internship during the course of their studies

H13 measures the proportion of students who do an internship during the course of their
studies. For the academic year 2014-2015, the average proportion is 36%, which means
approximately 1 in every 3 students did an internship during the course of their studies
(Figure H13 and Table H13). The median is 20%, which means 50% of the participants
who answered this question have less than 20% of students who did an internship, and this
proportion goes to as low as 0%. Considering the importance of internships for students’


                                              32
employability after graduation, concerns should be raised regarding the career orientation
of the courses offered by participating universities.

Compared with the summary statistics of H13 for the academic year 2009-2010, the
proportion of students who do an internship during the course of their studies has slightly
improved. The middle 50% of the universities have shifted towards a higher proportion of
students who did an internship in the academic year 2014-2015 (interquartile range from
5% to 67%) than that five years earlier (3% to 63%).

                   H14. Participation of employers in curriculum design

H14 measures the extent to which practitioners are included in curriculum design or course
teaching. For the academic year 2014-2015, more than one quarter of the universities have
employers participated in more than 50% of course design and/or practitioners participated
in teaching more than 50% of the courses (Figure H14 and Table H14). This represents a
significant improvement from the academic year 2009-2010, where only one fifth of the



                                               33
universities have employers and practitioners participating in more than 50% of the
curriculum design or course teaching. Also, the number of universities which have less
than 10% employers and practitioners ‘participation has reduced by 40% from 12 to 7 in
five years’ time. This trend is likely to be explained by the endeavours of universities to
include practitioners and promote employability of their students.

                  H15. Proportion of full-time lecturers who are practitioners

H15 measures the proportion of full-time lecturers who are from industries. For the
academic year 2014-2015, 50% of the universities have less than 3% of their full-time
lecturers from industries (median = 3%) (Figure H15 and Table H15). This is not a
satisfactory level of performance in terms of relevance to the labour market because the
lack of practitioners is associated with the lack of integration of theory and practice at these
universities. The distribution of H15 is rightly skewed as one university has reported 100%
of its full-time lecturers as practitioners.

Compared with the summary statistics of H15 for the academic year 2008-2009, the
proportion of full-time lecturers who are from industries has not changed much. The
median of H15 remains at the 3% level while the mean of H15 increased by 1% only.

2.2.4 Internationalisation

                  H16. Proportion of foreigners among academics with a PhD

H16 measures the proportion of academic staff who hold both foreign citizenship and
doctoral degree(s). For the academic year 2014-2015, 50% of the universities have less
than 9% of their academic staff who hold both foreign citizenship and doctoral degree
(median = 9%) (Figure H16 and Table H16). The distribution of H15 is rightly skewed as
the top 25% of the participating universities are much more internationalised with more
than one third of their academic staff who hold both foreign citizenship and doctoral
degree(s).

Compared with the summary statistics of H16 for the academic year 2008-2009, the
distribution of the proportion of academic staff who hold both foreign citizenship and
doctoral degree(s) has narrowed down, as the interquartile range has reduced from 41% to
35% in five years’ time.

      H17. Proportion of foreign-trained academics with a master’s or PhD degree

H17 measures the proportion of academic staff with a master’s or PhD degree from foreign
universities. For the academic year 2014-2015, the average proportion is 46%, which
means approximately 1 in every 2 academic staff has a master’s or PhD degree from foreign
universities (Figure H17 and Table H17). The distribution of H17 varies widely with a
range of 95%, suggesting that the mean is not typical of the highest (100%) and the lowest
(5%) proportion of academic staff with a master’s or PhD degree from foreign universities.

Compared with the summary statistics of H17 for the academic year 2008-2009, the
proportion of academic staff with a master’s or PhD degree from foreign universities has
slightly declined. The mean of H17 decreased by 2% from 46% to 48% while the median
of H17 decreased by 4% from 39% to 35%. This does not reflect significant change in the
international orientation of the universities or its attractiveness as employers for foreign-
trained academics.

                     H18. Proportion of students who do a semester abroad

H18 measures the proportion of international exchange students who spend at least a
semester abroad. For the academic year 2014-2015, 18 out of the 20 universities who
answered this question reported a proportion of equal to or lower than 1%. 30 This is not a
satisfactory level of performance as most of the participating universities are not offering
students with great opportunities of international exchange.

Compared with the summary statistics of H18 for the academic year 2008-2009, many
universities now began to at least have some students who did part of their degree abroad,
which is a signal of their attempts to set up such exchange programs.31

  The distributions of H18 for both academic periods are heavily rightly skewed and the mean values are
influenced greatly by the extreme values of one university (28% for the academic period 2014-2015 and 30%
for the academic period 2009-2010), and is hence excluded from the main discussion. Please see Annex D
for more details.

                            H19. Proportion of foreign students

H19 measures the proportion of students with foreign citizenship. For the academic year
2014-2015, 50% of the universities have less than 1% of their students who hold foreign
citizenship (median = 1%) (Figure H19 and Table H19). The distribution of H19 is
significantly rightly skewed as the top 25% of the participating universities are much more
internationalised with more foreign students.

Compared with the summary statistics of H19 for the academic year 2008-2009, the
proportion of foreign students at the participating universities has increased for the top 25%
of participating universities. In particular, the top 25% universities now have at least 12%
of foreign students as compared to 9% five years earlier. This is likely to have been
explained by the enhanced attractiveness of internationally oriented universities over the
past five years.

internatonal collaborations. Data are drawn from the 23,000 academic journals indexed by
Elsevier’s Scopus database and include all papers where at least one author is affiliated to
the participating university and at least one affiliate author’s address is in another country.32

Out of the 28 participating universities, 17 have international joint publications indexed by
Scopus (Figure H20 and Table H20). For both the calendar year 2010 and 2015, more than
50% of the scientific papers published by the participating universities are classified as
international joint publications, and the proportion of international joint publications goes
to as high as 100%.

Compared with the summary statistics of H20 for the calendar year 2010, the proportion
of international joint publications has increased especially for the bottom 25% of the
universities. In 2010, there are universities which have completely no international joint
publications. By 2015, all 17 universities indexed by Scopus have at least 16% of their
papers published as a result of international collaboration.

                    H21. Proportion of graduate/postgraduate students

H21 measures the proportion of students enrolled in a graduate studies program in relation
to the overall student population. For the academic year 2014-2015, 50% of the universities
have less than 6% of their students enrolled in a graduate studies program (median = 6%)
(Figure H21 and Table H21). This is a rather low proportion of graduate students,
consistent with the observation that the majority of the participating universities are not
research oriented. The distribution of H21 is rightly skewed as the sample includes
postgraduate-only institutions.

Compared with the summary statistics of H21 for the academic year 2008-2009, the
proportion of graduate/postgraduate students has slightly increased in terms of the mean
(from 13% to 17%) and the median (from 5% to 6%), suggesting better inclusion of
graduate students now than that five years earlier.

                    H22. Proportion of academics with a doctoral degree

H22 measures the proportion of academic staff with a doctoral degree. For the academic
year 2014-2015, the average proportion is 45%, which means that almost 1 in every 2
academics in the participating universities has a doctoral degree (Figure H22 and Table
H22). This distribution of H22 spans a wide range from 5% to 89%, revealing a huge
performance gap to be closed by those with extremely low proportion of academics with a
doctoral degree.

Compared with the summary statistics of H22 for the academic year 2008-2009, the
proportion of academic staff with a doctoral degree has improved remarkably as illustrated
by the upward shift of the interquartile range. The mean of H22 has increased by 14%
(from 31% to 45%) while the median of H22 has increased by 19% (from 28% to 47%) in
five years’ time.

                    H25. Number and proportion of postdoc positions

H25 measures the proportion of postdoc positions in the university relative to the total
number of academic staff positions. For the academic year 2014-2015, 50% of the
universities did not offer any postdoc positions (median = 0%) (Figure H25 and Table
H25). The distribution of H25 is rightly skewed as there are a few universities which offer
a relatively high proportion of postdoc positions.

Compared with the summary statistics of H25 for the academic year 2008-2009, the
proportion of postdoc positions in the universities has increased significantly. In the most
recent academic year, the top 25% universities have at least 7.4% of their positions as
postdoc positions whereas this figure was 0% five years earlier.

                     H26. Internal research funding amount per academic staff

H26 measures the amount of research grants administered and distributed by the research
office in a university through competitive research funding schemes.33 For the academic
year 2014-2015, the average research funds per academic staff is $US 6783, which is three
times more than that for the academic year 2009-2010 ($US 2090.5) (Figure H26 and Table
H26). The median amount of research funding has also been more than tripled in five years’
time, from $US 68 per academic staff to $US 212.4 per academic staff. Another significant
improvement from five years earlier is that, although universities promote and support
research to different extents, no participating universities now have zero research grants.

The distribution of H26 varies widely, as the maximum value for the academic year 2014-
2015 goes to as high as $US 96498.8 per academic staff.


33
  The research grants are usually administered and distributed by the Office of the Vice President for
Research.

                   H27. Proportion of institutional income spent on research

H27 measures the proportion of a university’s overall income from all funding sources that
is spent on research. For the academic year 2014-2015, the mean proportion is 11%, which
means that 11 dollars on average are allocated to and spent on research out of every 100
dollars (Figure H27 and Table H27). For the top 25% participating universities, this
proportion doubles the mean value, where 22 dollars on average are allocated to and spent
on research out of every 100 dollars.

Compared with the summary statistics of H27 for the academic year 2008-2009, the
proportion of a university’s overall income spent on research has improved significantly
for the middle 50% participating universities, where the interquartile range has shifted
upwards from 0%-5% five years earlier to 1%-22% for the academic year 2014-2015.

H28 measures the amount of research grants from external sources.34 For the academic
year 2014-2015, the average external research funding per academic staff is approximately
$US 130,000, which is less than that for the academic year 2009-2010 (mean = $US
144,640) (Figure H28 and Table H28). For the middle 50% participating universities,
however, the availability of external research funding per academic staff is much better
now than that was five years earlier. The interquartile range has shifted upwards from $US
188 - $US 8,730 five years earlier to $US 1,197 - $US 26,638 for the academic year 2014-
2015.

  These may include, not are not limited to, research grants from national and international funding agencies,
research councils, research foundations, charities and other non-profit organisations.

              H29. Proportion of successful external research grant applications

H29 measures the proportion of successful external research grant applications. For the
academic year 2014-2015, the mean proportion is 58%, which means that the probability
of success in getting external research grant is more than 50% on average (Figure H29 and
Table H29). For the middle 50% participating universities, the proportion of successful
applications is between 45% and 71%, which represents a narrowed interquartile range as
compared to five years earlier. This is largely attributable to the improved rate of success
for the bottom 25% universities. Another significant improvement from five years earlier
is that no participating universities now have zero success rate (minimum value = 38% for
the academic year 2014-2015), reflecting a significant improvement in participating
universities’ competitiveness and quality of research and researchers.

2.2.6 Community Service and Technology Transfer

          H30 Proportion of academics involved in technology transfer activities

H30 measures the proportion of academics engaged in commercialisation of the results of
research by licensing or setting up businesses. For the academic year 2014-2015, the mean
proportion is 20%, which means that 1 in every 5 academics is engaged in technology
transfer activities (Figure H30 and Table H30). The bottom 25% universities have no
academics involved in technology transfer activities, whereas for the top 25% universities
nearly 40% of the academics are involved in such activities.

Compared with the summary statistics of H30 for the academic year 2008-2009, the
proportion of academics engaged in technology transfer activities has increased
significantly, especially for the middle 50% participating universities, where the
interquartile range has shifted upwards from 0%-23% five years earlier to 0%-39% for the
academic year 2014-2015.

on the data reported by 20 participating universities, 70% (14 out of 20) of them do not
manage any business incubators (Figure H31 and Table H31).

      H32. Proportion of institutional budget spent on technology transfer activities

H32 measures the proportion of an institution’s budget that is spent on technology transfer
activities. For both periods concerned, 50% of the universities did not allocate a portion of
their budget to technology transfer activities (Figure H32 and Table H32). This should raise
some concerns because for universities, especially universities with a heavy component in
applied sciences, engineering and technology, technology transfer is a very important
mission that signals the usefulness of research results.

     H33. Technology transfer income as a proportion of overall institutional income

H33 measures the proportion of a university’s overall income that is attributable to income
acquired through technology transfer of R&D results. For the academic year 2014-2015,
the technology transfer income generated by 50% of the universities is negligible in relation
to the total amount of institutional income (Figure H33 and Table H33). In one case only,
technology transfer income accounts for 25% of overall institutional income.

Compared with the summary statistics of H33 for the academic year 2008-2009,
technology transfer income has become increasingly important for the top 25% universities,
which now have at least 4.5% of their institutional income derived from technology transfer
income.

                                                  curriculum

H34 measures the proportion of students who actively participate in community service as
part of their curriculum.36 For the academic year 2014-2015, the mean participation rate is
57%, which means, on average, more than half of the students have been actively
participating in community services as part of their curriculum (Figure H34 and Table H34).
The distribution of H34 varies widely with a range of 94%, suggesting that the mean is not
typical of the highest (100%) and the lowest (6%) participation rate.

Compared with the summary statistics of H34 for the academic year 2009-2010, the
average participation rate has improved noticeably. The mean and median passing rates
have increased by 9% and 10% respectively, suggesting that universities now have become
more active and committed in encouraging students to get involved in community service
than they were five years earlier.

 H35. Income from continuing education as a proportion of overall institutional income

H35 measures the proportion of a university’s total income that is generated from
continuing education. For the academic year 2014-2015, 50% of the universities have less
than 1% of their income generated from continuing education (Figure H35 and Table H35).
It appears that the majority of the participating universities are not very active in generating
income from continuing education.

Compared with the summary statistics of H35 for the academic year 2008-2009, the mean
proportion of income generated from continuing education did not change (mean = 2% for
both academic periods) while the median slightly increased by 1%.

2.2.7 Governance and Management

                           H36. Degree of institutional autonomy

H36 measures the extent to which a university is able to decide its strategy and operate in
an autonomous manner in terms of organisational autonomy (H36-1), financial autonomy
(H36-2), human resources autonomy (H36-3), and academic freedom (H36-4).

For the academic year 2014-2015, more than 75% of the participating universities report
that their university board consists of university academic staff, administarteive staff,
students, and government officials (Figure H36.1 and Table H36.1). In addition to these
types of board members, the top 25% universities also have significant presence of
members from private sector and not-profit arena. This implies a very high level of
organisational autonomy.

Compared with the summary statistics of H36-1 for the academic year 2008-2009, the

For the academic year 2014-2015, the top 25% universities indicate that government
resources are allocated as block grant that the universities themselves can manage flexibly
(Figure H36.2 and Table H36.2). For the majority of universities in the middle, this is at
least partially true. Together, the responses correspond to a moderate level of financial
autonomy.

Compared with the summary statistics of H36-2 for the academic year 2008-2009, the
mean score of financial autonomy has increased by 0.05 towards the more autonomous end
of finance.

For the academic year 2014-2015, over 50% of the universities indicate that salaries were
set by civil service conditions (Figure H36.3 and Table H36.3). Only a very few
universities claim that they have total freedom in setting salaries.37 The mean score is 1.42,

implying limited margin of salary adjustment and thus a relatively low level of human
resources autonomy.

Compared with the summary statistics of H36-3 for the academic year 2008-2009, the
mean score of financial autonomy has increased by 0.04 towards the more autonomous end

For the academic year 2014-2015, over 50% of the universities state that they have a high
degree of freedom to define academic structure, programs, and course content (Figure
H36.4 and Table 36.4). Only a very few universities claim that they have no academic
freedom. This implies a relatively high level of academic freedom.

Compared with the summary statistics of H36-4 for the academic year 2008-2009, the
mean score of academic freedom has decreased by 0.07 towards the less autonomous end
of academic rights.

                        H37. Mode of selection of university leader

H37 classifies the mode of selection of university leaders into three categories: (1) selection
of university leader based on political appointment, (2) selection of leader based on internal
election, and (3) selection of leader based on competitive professional search managed by
an independent board.

For the academic year 2014-2015, over 50% of the universities select leaders based on
internal election or competitive professional search managed by independent boards
(Figure H37 and Table H37). Compared with the summary statistics of H37 for the
academic year 2008-2009, the proportion of universities which based their selection of
university leaders on political appointment has decreased. This indicates that participating
universities are moving towards a more objective and transparent selection process.

         H38. Availability of an effective Management Information System (MIS)

H38 examines whether there exists an effective management information system that helps
a university to access, collect, share, analyse, synthesise, and critically evaluates
knowledge and information. For the academic year 2014-2015, over 75% of the
universities have at least some elements of a management information system for decision-
making process (Figure 38 and Table 38). Only one university reports no institution-wide
management information system.

Compared with the summary statistics of H38 for the academic year 2008-2009, a larger
proportion of universities now have a comprehensive management information system
used regularly for performance monitoring and decision making. This signals that an
increasing number of universities have realised the importance of management information
system and used it to facilitate effective managerial decision making.

   H39. Number and proportion of academics leaving to seek employment elsewhere

H39 measures the proportion of academic staff who voluntarily left a university to seek
employment opportunities elsewhere. For the academic year 2014-2015, 50% of the
universities have staff turnover rate less than 1%, which means only 1 out of every 100
academic staff left to seek employment elsewhere (Figure H39 and Table H39).

Compared with the summary statistics of H39 for the academic year 2008-2009, staff
turnover rate has increased from 4% to 7% for the top 25% universities with the highest
turnover. This should raise some concern for those that hope to recruit and retain academic
staff of the highest quality by offering jobs that meet their expectations and needs.
Investigations may be required to identify competitive levels of salaries and comparable
compensation packages in the job market.

  H40. Proportion of academic year during which courses were not given because of a
                                          strike

H40 measures the proportion of academic year during which courses were not given
because of a strike. For the academic year 2014-2015, 50% of the participating universities
do not have strikes that disrupted course delivery (Figure H40 and Table H40). Universities
in the top 25% bracket have at least 6 days during the academic year for which courses
were disrupted by strike(s), and in the worst case, an entire month of courses were not
given.

Compared with the summary statistics of H40 for the academic year 2008-2009,
universities disrupted most by strikes (i.e. the top 25%) appear to have key disputes
unsolved and face more severe situations. Efforts need to be made by these universities to
improve labour and employment relations.

2.2.8 Financing

                                   H41. Per-student expenditure

H41 measures the expenditure on education-related activities relative to the number of
students. For the academic year 2014-2015, the median per-student expenditure is $US 854,
which represents a 12.5% increase from the academic year 2009-2010 ($US 759) (Figure
H41 and Table H41).38 In comparison, the per-student expenditure for universities in the
top 25% bracket has decreased significantly in five years’ time. This means that the
performance gap is closing, as universities in the lower 50% bracket are gradually catching
up with universities in the upper 50% bracket.




38
  The mean value of H41 for the academic year 2009-2010 is influenced greatly by an extreme value of US$
155,059 and is hence excluded from the main discussion. Please see Annex D for more details.

                                 H42. Proportion of self-generated income

H42 measures the proportion of self-generated income in addition to the government
budget or tuition fees.39 For the academic year 2014-2015, the mean proportion of self-
generated income is 31%, which means approximately one third of the income on average
are self-generated income (Figure H42 and Table H42). For the top 25% universities, more
than half of the overall institutional income is attributable to self-generated income.
However, the mean is not typical for all universities as a number of universities have almost
all of their income derived from the government budget or tuition fees.

Compared with the summary statistics of H42 for the academic year 2008-2009, the
interquartile range has shifted upwards from 1%-48% five years earlier to 7%-51% for the

     Self-generated income may be derived from donation, industrial collaboration or university’s own business.

participating universities.

        III. EXTENDED DISCUSSION ON DATA COLLECTION

3.1 Data Collection Process

3.1.1 Issues

The data collection process began in mid-February where the standard data submission
form in Excel format was sent to 48 Sub-Saharan Universities voluntarily signed up to
participate in this phase. Although the initial deadline was set for 1 April 2016, the
benchmarking team grant extensions several times to those that have encountered various
difficulties in collecting data. The final submission deadline was 15 May 2016, and 28
universities managed to submit data by this date.

Based on the observations of the benchmarking team, there are several issues worth noting.
First, the data submission form consists of a comprehensive set of indicators (13
performance indicators and 42 institutional health indicators), which would require an
enormous amount of work, not to mention that they are required to organise and conduct
the student satisfaction survey at the same time. For a few participants, the initial period
allowed for data collection coincided with semester breaks and school holidays, which
made it even more difficulty to meet the deadline. In fact, only seven out of the 28
universities submitted data on or before 1 April 2016.

Second, there had been issues with the quality of communication between the
benchmarking team and the participating universities. In one case, a participant did their
own analysis of data with well-designed Excel analysis and PowerPoint slides. However,
this does not serve the purpose of benchmarking where comparisons across universities are
more important. In other cases, the description of indicators have caused some confusion,
with problems concentrated on terms such as institutional income, graduate/postgraduate,
government budget, and labour participation. The confusion had led to a prolonged data
collection process as participants were required to make second submissions when data
inconsistencies were detected.




                                            64
Third, although it was not emphasised enough at the beginning of the data collection phase,
quite a number of participating universities modified the standard data submission form to
different extents. Some have added new worksheets to record additional information that
they would like to provide, others have attempted to fill the “red” and “grey” fields when
they are not supposed to. This complicates the coding process because the benchmarking
team mainly relies on the P & H codes to input data, especially since the data submission
form is in two language versions.

Fourth, with regard to the student satisfaction survey, the benchmarking team has adjusted
the measurement scale (i.e. from a seven-point scale to five-point scale) and requested
further information from the participants in order to understand the quality of such survey.
This has again caused problems, as a number of participants appeared to have submitted
survey results based on a seven-point scale, and it would not be feasible to ask them redo
the survey using the 5-point scale. For the request of information on survey response rate,
only a few participants responded, and the information that they provide is fragmented in
forms of emails, separate documents, or even “hidden” in the data sheets that they submit.

3.1.2 Recommendations

For the benchmarking team and also for the participating universities, there are several
lessons learnt from the issues arising in the data collection process. First, there is a clear
trade-off between the number of indicators that the benchmarking exercises use and the
time it takes for participants to collect the required information. More careful thought
should be given to balance the usefulness of information and the feasibility of collecting
such information within the time allowed.

Second, more efforts should be devoted during the launching stage of the benchmarking
exercise to ensure that participants understand what is expected from them. It may be
worthwhile to have the benchmarking team going through each of the indicators with the
participants to mitigate confusion.

Third, explanations should probably be given to the participants as to why it is undesirable
to modify the data submission sheets themselves and why it is important to strictly follow



                                             65
the data format specified for each indicator. In future phases, this may be achieved through
online data submission platforms developed by the benchmarking team. The online
platform would allow the benchmarking team to impose restrictions on the data format as
well as internal consistency requirements which participants have to meet before they can
submit data.

Fourth, it has been proven troublesome to make alterations to data requirements or further
requests for information from the participants once the data collection process has begun.
Due to the existence of time lag and other communication obstacles, participants are often
very slow in responding to such requests. For the benchmarking team, the value of “do it
right the first time” should be recognised. This, of course, requires the benchmarking team
to be more dedicated in polishing and discussing the questionnaire design and phrasing
before it is sent to the universities.



3.2 Quality of Data

3.2.1 Issues

High quality data is essential for capturing the status quo of Sub-Saharan universities and
comparing the performance and system health across the participating universities.
However, in the process of data validation and compilation, a number of data issues came
to the attention of the benchmarking team, and some may present threats to the validity of
findings and trends identified from the benchmarking results.

First, out of the 28 participating universities, more than half have had at least one data issue
and therefore second submission was required. In the process of data validation, the
benchmarking team had asked them to provide explanations as to why the data were
inconsistent for the first time. The majority of them did not provide explanations, a few
claimed that they misunderstood the indicator descriptions, and some simply attributed the
inconsistencies to mistakes and typos they made in making data entries.

Second, although 28 universities participated in the benchmarking exercise, very few of
them answered all questions on the data submission form. The lack of data completeness


                                              66
means, for many of the indicators, the descriptive statistics are not sufficiently
representative of Sub-Saharan universities, and more sophisticated analyses could not be
conducted.

Third, the distributions of some indicators are severely skewed and influenced greatly by
extreme values. Taking H41 as an example, one participant has reported per-student
expenditure of $US 155,059 for the academic period 2009-2010. Even though this did not
violate the validation rules applied by the benchmarking team, it does somehow contradict
what the benchmarking team believes to be the common level of per-student expenditure.

Fourth, there are concerns over the comparability of the results as some participating
universities are postgraduate institutions only. At the beginning of the data collection
process, the benchmarking team did not realise this issue and hence did not ask
postgraduate-only universities to identify themselves. This issue was discovered at a very
late stage of the data collection process through email correspondence with some of the
participants. The issue of comparability also exists for the results of student satisfaction
survey. Based on the data provided by a very limited number of participating universities,
the survey response rate ranges from less than 1% to 20% whereas the number of survey
participants range from less than 50 to more than 10,000. Clearly, the latter would be of
much higher quality.



3.2.2 Recommendations

For the benchmarking team and also for the participating universities, there are several
areas of improvement which can be made in the future to improve the quality of data. First,
an online data submission platform would help those less experienced in reporting data of
better quality. The required data format and data validation rules can be pre-imposed
through the online platform. Unlike data sheets in Excel format, participants are not
allowed to make alterations to the online data platform, which would greatly improve data
validity and accuracy.

Second, it would be desirable if the data submitted are supported with solid evidence. For
example, for institutional income and expenditures, the supporting document could be the


                                            67
financial statements or original document of the budget. This would allow the
benchmarking team to verify data from independent sources rather than to rely solely on
the responses of the university representatives.

Third, for future rounds of benchmarking exercises, the analysis of benchmarking results
can be improved by distinguishing between different types of universities. This would only
be possible if the number of participants is large enough to ensure valid statistical
comparisons for sub-groups.
