Introduction

Background
East Asian countries are among the fastest growing economies in the world over the last
decade. However, as growth continues, the countries in East Asia are faced with a skills
shortage and mismatching that has limited their economic growth. To tackle this issue,
regional governments are currently restructuring their respective Technical and Vocational
Education and Training (TVET) systems to guide schools towards demand-driven education
and training.

In this context, the World Bank’s East Asia Education team has embarked on an in-depth
study of “Excellent Institutions” by selecting particularly outstanding cases in select countries
of East Asia to research (1) which factors contribute to a particular school’s successful
outcomes; (2) how the school developed its demand-driven system; and (3) how the school
utilizes finite resources to enhance school performance.

The purpose of this study is to provide policy makers with empirical evidence that will be
used to develop new policies to direct schools towards more market-responsive and demand-
driven approaches. Specifically, it aims to; (1) offer guidance for individual institutions to
develop innovative methods to improve the internal and external efficiency of their programs
and determine resource priorities; (2) provide the World Bank with empirical evidence to
guide the knowledge services it offers client countries regarding TVET policies and practices;
and (3) engender a productive dialogue on the improvement of TVET relevance within the
East Asia and the Pacific (EAP) region. This report summarizes the successful experience of
a) three Chinese agricultural TVET schools (one secondary vocational school and two tertiary
vocational schools), b) Korea’s Busan Meister Technical High School, and c) Korea’s
Yeungjin School. It then analyses the problems they have encountered in their operation, and
provides lessons learned to improve vocational education. This research comprises “Excellent
TVET Institutions in East Asia and the Pacific (EAP),” a study commissioned by the World
Bank.


Conceptual Framework and Research Method

Definitions

The definition of excellent is measured by the school’s internal and external efficiency.
Internal efficiency refers to the relationship between the inputs and outputs and focuses on
what occurs within the educational and training processes. Then, what happens to the outputs
of the training process in relation to economic and social requirement is defined as external
efficiency, which is also referred to as relevance of the program (Johanson and Adams,
2004). Accordingly, excellent TVET institutions produce the best training outcomes by
retaining high internal efficiency.

                                                       Compendium:	Case	Studies	of	Excellent	TVET	Schools	
                             	
                                                                                                                  	




	
Premised Four Factors Contributing to School Outcomes

Based on a review of the literature, this study premises that a school becomes excellent when
it (1) conserves adequate resources; (2) delivers relevant programs; (3) develops an effective
management system; and (4) establishes linkages with enterprise in the three previously
discussed areas. Additionally, there are external factors impacting the success of schools,
called “ecosystem factors” (Altbach and Salmi, 2011).

Basic Assumption

Case studies were conducted to verify that:

    (1) Graduates of excellent TVET schools have high levels of enterprise recognition,
        employment rates and employment quality.
    (2) Excellent TVET schools have a strong ability to serve the community.
    (3) Excellent TVET schools have high-quality teachers, better teaching conditions,
        courses that meet the needs of enterprises, effective management, and strong school-
        enterprise cooperation.

This study concludes that if the above assumptions are verified, then further improving
teacher quality, teaching conditions, curriculum, school management and school-enterprise
cooperation will lead to enhanced school quality.

Research Questions

By conducting an in-depth analysis, this study seeks to find (1) whether or not the above
premise factors impact school outcomes; and if so, then, (2) which of these factors is the
determining factor that contributes most to the enhancement of school performance and in
what context (various settings and time periods within respective countries); and (3) how this
factor can be strengthened based on suggestions from teachers/instructors and school
administrators.

This study reversely examines the relationship between outcomes and premise factors by
selecting a high-performance school (purposely selecting the sampling procedure) and the
impact of the premise factors on graduate employment rates. The logic is that if this high-
performance school demonstrates a showing of all these factors, then we can conclude that
these premise factors are likely to raise employment rates.

Case Study Selection

Three factors were used to select case studies for this study. First, as we are reversely testing
the factors that are assumed to be contributing to a school’s success, we selected excellent
schools with exemplary outcomes. Second, we selected schools at both the secondary and
post-secondary levels within the same sector. In this way, we can more easily compare how
different levels of skilled graduates are absorbed into the lab or market within the same
sector, thereby investigating whether “different levels of skills” is one of the ecosystem
factors positively impacting school excellence. Also, this analysis may provide some
suggestions on how to attract more students to vocational high schools, especially in
countries where students’ vocational track preferences are low. Third, we selected schools
that provide skills training for sectors that may best represent the select country’s economy.
In this way, it is hoped that lessons learned from the case study can be tailored to meet the
specific needs of a country that may be considering introduction of TVET training for the
same sector.

In order to conduct the study, a questionnaire and interviews were carried out in each of the
case study institutions.

Questionnaire Design

A total of five questionnaires were designed for the study: 1) a school, 2) its departments, 3)
teachers, 4) students, and 5) enterprises. The first set of questionnaires for a school and its


                                                                                                Page	6	of	47

departments cover its basic status, educational output, and other related information including
its funding and expenditures; the questionnaires for the teachers and students survey their
perspectives on the school facility and equipment, teacher quality, curriculum, school
management, school-enterprise cooperation, etc.; and the final questionnaire for enterprises
involves their evaluation on the quality of school graduates and cooperation with schools.

Interview and Field Research

Interviews and field research were conducted to understand the elements that affect school
quality; summarize the successful experience of school operation; discover problems
encountered in the operation process; understand the opinions of teachers, students and
enterprises in regards to the schools; and provide suggestions for the improvement of
education quality and operational efficiency in each case study institution. Interviews with
the school leaders were also conducted to understand the school operation. The team visited
the TVET schools to conduct the interviews and held seminars for teachers, students, and the
enterprises.

Background

China’s Education System

The Chinese education system consists of five parts, namely, preschool, primary, secondary,
higher and continuing education. Secondary education consists of two stages: middle school
and high school. Their education periods are 3 years respectively, of which middle school is
divided into ordinary middle school and vocational middle school. High school is also
divided into ordinary high school and secondary vocational school (including vocational high
school, technical school and specialized secondary school). Higher education includes
technical education, undergraduate education and graduate education. Technical education is
for 2-3 years, while undergraduate education is for 4 years. Continuing education includes
literacy education, adult primary/secondary/higher education, adult vocational education,
community education and so on.

Expansion of Chinese Education and Industrialization

In China, the expansion of education is closely related to its industrialization, economic
growth and labour market demands. Economic policy plays an especially important guiding
role in the formation of education policy.

In the 1990s, China’s economy changed from a planned economy to a market economy. The
state has vigorously popularized compulsory education, while continuing to develop both
vocational education and higher education to meet the needs of economic development.

Since 2010, the promotion of national strategy, such as "Made in China 2025," has provided a
new direction for the Chinese economy to industrialization, urbanization, informatization and
self-dependent innovation. The long-term and rapid development of the Chinese economy has
promoted stable and high-quality education at all stages.

After expanding higher education enrolment since 1999, the gross higher education
enrolment rate increased from 10.5% in 1999 to 37.5% in 2014. With the challenge of new
technology development, China will need not only industrial restructuring, but also to train
the human capital needed for a new round of growth.

Industry Development and Employment

Since its economic reform, China has gradually expanded the proportion of the secondary
(manufacturing) and tertiary (service) industries. Between 1995 and 2014, the share of the
primary industry's contribution to GDP was consistently below 10%. On the other hand, the
contribution rate of the tertiary industry to GDP showed steady growth, and has risen from
28.5% in 1995 to 47.9% in 2014. The change of the economic structure had a great influence
on China's job market. The number of employees in the primary industry (collection of
natural resources, i.e. farming, fishing) has been decreasing every year, while the number in
the secondary and tertiary industries showed an increasing trend. From the long-term trend,
the changing industrial structure has directly influenced labour demand, and is also closely
linked to the employment issues of the agriculture sector.

Agriculture Industry in China

China’s agriculture industry is experiencing a rapid change in structure, as the proportion of
planting has been shrinking, but that of stock farming, fishery and forestry have been
continuously increasing. The emergence of "company + farmer," "cooperative + farmer" and
other organizational forms have diversified the sector’s management model. In addition,
advancements in agricultural science and technology have been continued, mainly reflected
in the development of biotechnology, mechanization, pest control, and livestock breeding.
Although the contribution rate of Chinese scientific and technological development to the
agriculture sector has increased from 27% in the late 1970s to 43% in 2016, compared to the
advanced economies’ average of above 60% there is still a gap in its contribution.

Agricultural Employment in China

Over the last 30 years, the agricultural labour force has decreased by 200 million as they have
left the land to work in cities and towns. The remaining farmers, mostly working in
traditional farming, are unfamiliar with the new agricultural technology and knowledge.
However, development of agricultural technology, agricultural product brands, and rural land
development have promoted training for all kinds of skills to meet the needs of modern
agricultural development. It is estimated that by 2020 China will need 18 million agricultural
talents in the areas of (1) family farm management and chain business management, (2)
agricultural technology research and food safety management, (3) international trade and
marketing, and (4) rural cooperatives management and enterprise management.

Agricultural and Vocational Education in China

As an important component of the education system, agricultural vocational education aims
to train technical personnel, managers and skilled agricultural workers. Agricultural
vocational education in China consists of secondary vocational education, higher vocational
education and various formats of adult vocational education and training.

Higher agricultural vocational education is mainly implemented by agricultural vocational
colleges and some local agricultural universities. In recent years, the scale of agricultural
vocational education at the college level is relatively stable, but its overall size is small.

Secondary agricultural vocational education is mainly implemented by secondary agricultural
vocational schools and county-level vocational education centres. In recent years, the overall
scale of secondary vocational education has been shrinking.

Adult agricultural vocational education includes village-level classes to teach agricultural
knowledge, production techniques and operational skills. The Central Agricultural
Broadcasting School under the Ministry of Agriculture also provides training for farmers.
Overall, the scale of adult agricultural vocational education has been decreasing every year.


Case Study Analysis

Objective

The case study of three outstanding Chinese agricultural TVET schools will (1) clarify the
connotation and standard of excellent TVET schools; (2) analyse the output of outstanding
TVET schools such as the employment rate of their graduates and their ability to serve the
community; (3) examine the current status of the outstanding TVET schools from the aspects
of teacher, teaching facility, curriculum, school management and school-enterprise
cooperation, and summarize their experience as well as the areas that need to be improved;
and (4) based on the research conclusions, offer suggestions to promote development of
agricultural TVET schools.

The research can provide an empirical basis for policy makers to formulate vocational
education policy and guidance for a school to reform and develop their education system.

Case Selection

The basis of case selection is (1) to choose TVET schools in the major agricultural provinces
that contribute to the development of the regional economy; (2) due to the different economic
development and environment of Chinese regions, select schools across the different regions;
and (3) select schools that are recognized as model vocational schools that have the strongest
influence in the industry.

In accordance with the above criteria, we have selected Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational
Technical College from the major agricultural province of Western China, Nan Gong
Vocational and Technical Education Centre from Eastern China, and Heilongjiang Nongken
Vocational College from the Northeastern China. Both Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational
Technical College and Nan Gong Vocational and Technical Education Centre are the model
schools for the “National Vocational Education Reform and Development”, while
Heilongjiang Nongken Vocational College is the leading school of “Heilongjiang Vocational
Education Reform and Development.”

The Surveys

Teachers

In terms of gender, female teachers are in the majority for both Nan Gong Vocational and
Technical Education Centre and Heilongjiang Nongken Vocational College, whereas
Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational Technical College has a similar ratio of both male and
female teachers. All three schools mainly have young and middle-aged teachers, and most of
the teachers have both an undergraduate and master's degree with significant work experience
in a company.

Students

Both Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational Technical College and Nan Gong Vocational and
Technical Education Centre have similar proportions of male to female students, whereas
Heilongjiang Nongken Vocational College has a significantly higher number of female
students (83.27%). In addition, all three schools have a balanced distribution of students in
each grade.

Enterprises

Private enterprise accounts for the majority of enterprises in all three schools. With regards to
scale, medium-sized enterprises account for more than half of enterprises in both Xinjiang
Agricultural Vocational Technical College and Nan Gong Vocational and Technical
Education Centre, followed by the small-sized enterprise. For Heilongjiang Nongken
Vocational College, 61.11% of their cooperating enterprises are medium-sized and 27.78%
are large enterprises.

School Outputs

Social Recognition of Graduates

Social recognition of graduates is an important criterion for an excellent vocational school.
The main indicators of graduates’ recognition are a high employment rate, excellent quality
of employment and recognition by enterprises.

In terms of employment rate, the overall employment rate of agriculture majors in all three
schools from 2012 to 2015 was above 90%. The average starting salary, which is an indicator
of the quality of employment, increased from 2010 to 2015 at Xinjiang Agricultural
Vocational Technical College. For the evaluation of the quality of graduates, enterprises
indicated that they were “relatively satisfied” with the graduates of both Xinjiang
Agricultural Vocational Technical College and Nan Gong Vocational and Technical
Education Centre. 3 ” Especially in the category of graduates’ “responsibility” and
“compliance with industry and enterprise standards,” both schools received the highest
evaluation. For Heilongjiang Nongken Vocational College, the enterprises regarded the
quality of graduates as “very strong4” compared to graduates of other vocational schools,
indicating high recognition of the school by the enterprises.

The Ability of a School to Benefit Enterprises

The ability of a school to benefit enterprises is mainly reflected in the training of high-quality
graduates for enterprises, providing training for employees in enterprises, helping enterprises
to solve technical problems and supporting technical research of enterprises.

As evidenced in both the surveys and interviews, the teachers in Xinjiang Agricultural
Vocational Technical College and Heilongjiang Nongken Vocational College believe that the
schools have strong abilities in “training high-quality graduates for enterprises” and
“providing training for employees in enterprises.” However, they find that the schools have
limited ability in both “helping enterprises to solve technical problems” and “supporting
technical research of enterprises.” On the other hand, the teachers in Nan Gong Vocational
and Technical Education Centre believe that in addition to the training of high-quality
personnel, the school can solve the technical problems encountered by the enterprises.

The Ability of a School to Benefit Community

The ability of a school to benefit community is another indicator to determine an outstanding
vocational school.

Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational Technical College regards serving the local community,
solving problems for local government, and promoting regional economic development as

important school tasks. By dispatching management teams and teachers, the school manages
several county-level vocational schools. In addition, the students and teachers in the
agriculture major help farmers during the harvest season, and those in the veterinary major
often provide guidance in epidemic prevention among farm animals. The Nan Gong
Vocational and Technical Education Centre also supports the process of fertilizer selection,
sales and food processing for local farmers. In addition, Heilongjiang Nongken Vocational
College has participated in designing and training for the “Construction Plan of the Pilot Area
for the Agricultural Vocational Education Reform.”

School Influence

The influence of the school is mainly reflected in its impact on vocational education, industry
and students.

All three schools have been widely recognized by industry since they have been selected as
model schools for national vocational education. In the survey of Xinjiang Agricultural
Vocational Technical College, we found that the school has a strong influence in the local
agricultural industry. The majority of managers from the industry are graduates of the school,
and the school graduates are in high demand from the labour market. In addition, a majority
of the teachers in both Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational Technical College and Nan Gong
Vocational and Technical Education Centre showed their satisfaction with the ability of
schools to attract high-quality students. However, the teachers in Heilongjiang Nongken
Vocational College regarded the influence of the school in recruiting outstanding students as
average.


Factor 1: Adequate Resources

Financial Resources

Regarding income from both Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational Technical College and Nan
Gong Vocational and Technical Education Centre from 2012 to 2015, public finance from the
provincial governments has grown due to their increased investment in vocational education.
However, tuition income has steadily declined resulting from a reduction in the total number
of students and tuition exemption for some students.

For Heilongjiang Nongken Vocational College, the teachers believe that the school provides
sufficient financial support to students, and it plays an important role in attracting high-
quality students who have financial difficulties. However, from the survey we found that the
students were not satisfied with their financial support, and it needs to be more centralized
and increased.

For school expenditures, both Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational Technical College and Nan
Gong Vocational and Technical Education Centre mainly disburse on staff wages and
benefits. On the other hand, we found that the expense to improve school equipment and
teacher training is insufficient. The interview from Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational
Technical College showed that the school's overall operation needs more funding, and the
current funding level can only maintain its basic operation.

Facilities and Equipment

From the survey, the Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational Technical College teachers’
evaluation on the school facility and equipment was not high. Besides the evaluation of the
school meals averaging "relatively satisfied," the evaluation of other items was in between
"average" and "relatively satisfied" and more towards “average.” The teachers believe that
the condition of student life and learning needs more improvement. The students also agree
that the school should improve their housing, classroom and entertainment facility.
On the other hand, for both Nan Gong Vocational and Technical Education Centre and
Heilongjiang Nongken Vocational College, the teachers provided the highest evaluation on
"the training facility of the school." The students also agree with the teachers’ opinion, but
they think school housing still needs more improvement.

Teacher Quality

From the survey of students on the "evaluation of teacher quality,” students in all three
schools had a high evaluation of their teachers' quality. There was little difference in scores
between the criteria of quality, and most of them are close to the "satisfied" level. The
criteria for ateacher’s quality include: "teacher’s professional knowledge," "the relationship
between teachers and students," "teaching ability," and "cooperation between teachers and
other teachers."

Teacher Training

According to the survey on teachers’ on-the-job training, most of the teachers responded that
they had received training, and they are attending training for more than 20 hours every year.
However, more than half of the teachers did not have training from the company that has
signed the cooperation agreement with the school, and this makes it difficult for teachers to
introduce the company culture to the students and provide targeted guidance for employment.

Criteria for Recruiting Teachers

Most teachers believe that teachers in vocational schools should have specific industry
experience in addition to teaching experience, emphasizing the difference between vocational
education and general education. With specific industry experience, teachers can better guide
students toward employment and help them adapt to the work environment.
	

Factor 2: Relevant Program
Curriculum

Most teachers in all three schools regard the school curriculum as competitive, and students
are also satisfied with their programs. However, despite their high evaluation, we found that
students still need to receive additional training outside the school, and there is a gap between
curricula and enterprises’ needs.

Practical Course and Skill Development

A majority of the students believe that the schools provide sufficient training to prepare for a
job. More than half of the students receive less than 10 hours of practical training every week,
and one-third of students receive 11-15 hours of training. We also found that there is a
significant difference in training hours among the grades.

Internship

A majority of students in both Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational Technical College and Nan
Gong Vocational and Technical Education Centre responded as having participated in an
internship program before, while only 39.44% of Heilongjiang Nongken Vocational College
students participated in the program. Their main reasons of not attending the internship were
because it is difficult to find an enterprise and time. From the interviews with students, we
found that the schools do not offer an internship opportunity for first-year students.

In regard to the size of enterprises for student internship, more than one-third of the students
in both Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational Technical College and Heilongjiang Nongken
Vocational College have worked in enterprises with 50-100 employees. On the other hand,
77.94% of students in Nan Gong Vocational and Technical Education Centre have worked in
enterprises with less than 50 employees. Among the students, more than 75% of students in
both Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational Technical College and Heilongjiang Nongken
Vocational College received a salary for the internship, at the corresponding wage level of
the labour market. However, 67.65% of students in Nan Gong Vocational and Technical
Education Centre were not able to receive a salary, reflecting the lack of a student internship
remuneration system in the school.

Despite more than half of the students expressing their satisfaction with the correlation
between internships and school learning, there is still a gap that needs to be resolved. This
gap arises from the school curriculum failing to reflect the actual needs of enterprises, while
enterprises therefore do not provide positions that adequately reflect student majors.
Regarding student satisfaction with the overall internship, students had high satisfaction on
“training directors of an enterprise, ” “level of responsibility and work,” and “the working
environment.” Students were mostly satisfied with all aspects of the internship program,
believed that the schools were looking for internships that were well-suited to individual
students, and that they are partnering closely with the enterprises. However, since the
students’ evaluation on “remuneration and benefit” was relatively low, the schools need to
further discuss with the enterprises to improve student remuneration and benefits during the
internship.


Factor 3: Effective Management System

Teachers in both Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational Technical College and Nan Gong
Vocational and Technical Education Centre provided a high evaluation of school
management. The criteria that received the highest scores are "school leaders can prepare for
the future and continue to innovate” and “school leaders have clear principles of
management.” On the other hand, the teachers of Heilongjiang Nongken Vocational College


                                                                                               Page	16	of	47

believe that school leaders need to encourage more cooperation among teachers and
appreciate teachers’ contribution to the school.



Factor 4: School Industry Linkages

Partnership with Enterprises

Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational Technical College partners with various types of enterprises,
and its main partners are small and medium-sized private companies. In regard to the job
profile of graduates accepted by these companies, the graduates who are working in the
technical guidance position of a production line account for the most (43.68%). The survey
showed that most of the school graduates are favoured by the enterprises in employment
decisions.

The teachers in all three schools believe that factors that hinder the partnership between
school and enterprise are “a school wants to cooperate with an enterprise, but it lacks the
ability" and "an enterprise is not interested in the cooperation.” They believe that a school
loses its appeal in cooperation when it cannot provide a benefit to an enterprise.

Enterprise Participation in Student Training

The main way in which an enterprise participates in student training is to provide an
internship program. Information from both Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational Technical
College and Nan Gong Vocational and Technical Education Centre demonstrated that the
participation of an enterprise in curriculum development is lacking. However, if an enterprise
does not directly participate in curriculum development, the school curriculum cannot reflect
the actual needs of enterprises. The interview also revealed that most enterprises have neither
the resources nor ability to undertake curriculum development, and they lack enthusiasm for
participation, which may have resulted from the compensation provided by the school.
According to the survey of enterprises, 89.36% of enterprises regarded the internship students
as their apprentices, and helped them to participate in production under the guidance of
directors. However, we also found that there are many situations where students are only used
as simple manual workers after undemanding training.

Enterprise Evaluation of School-Enterprise Cooperation

According to the survey, the enterprises’ evaluation on all aspects of school-enterprise
cooperation was very high. The criteria of the evaluation included "communication and
coordination between the school and enterprise," "cooperative education conducted by both
school and enterprise" and “the school provides staff training for the enterprise.” Overall, the
enterprises were satisfied with their cooperation with all three schools.

School’s Career Development System

From the survey, the teachers in both Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational Technical College
and Heilongjiang Nongken Vocational College evaluated the school’s career support system


                                                                                               Page	17	of	47

as average, whereas the teachers in Nan Gong Vocational and Technical Education Centre
evaluated the system as an important tool for a student’s career planning. For the students,
more than half of them were satisfied with the career counselling service offered by the
school, and more than 90% of students think career counselling contributes to their life
planning.

With respect to continuing education, more than 60% of students want to pursue a higher
degree. The majority of teachers in all three schools believe that the academic courses of
schools can support their students to further their studies.

The Impact of Government Policy

From the survey question on "how much does the government's vocational education policy
affect the school governance and policy?" the teachers believe that the government's policy
affects the school governance to a certain extent. Most of them think that the national leaders
have consistent vocational education policy and they think the government has an effective
school-enterprise cooperation policy, quality assurance framework and financial mechanism,
which promote improvement of school quality.


Conclusion

Lessons Learned

From the case study of the three vocational schools, we have learned that the excellent
agricultural vocational schools persist in serving the rural community, strengthening school-
enterprise cooperation, and innovating the talent training model.

Serving the Rural Community

One of the common traits of the three schools is service to the rural community and farmers.
Nan Gong Vocational and Technical Education Centre has been making full use of school
resources to support the 12 agricultural model villages including Wangtun, Xiezhai and
Xiaochang. Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational Technical College also worked with Ulan Wusu
town to promote the development of local economy. The school has dispatched teachers to
train farmers in cultivation, pest control and preservation. The training has promoted the
popularization of new agricultural technology and production methods, and optimized
planting approaches throughout the entire town where the school is located. In addition,
Heilongjiang Nongken Vocational College has actively participated in construction of the
pilot areas for the Agricultural Vocational Education Reform. Since 2012, it has supported
the construction and management of pilot areas including Nehe City, Wudalianchi City and
Fuyu County.

Strengthening School-Enterprise Cooperation

School-enterprise cooperation is one of the key factors that affect the quality of talent
training. Nan Gong Vocational and Technical Education Centre and partner enterprises have
jointly built 9 farms, 2 training centres, 3 research laboratories on campus and 10 training

                                                                                              Page	18	of	47

centres outside the school. Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational Technical College and partner
enterprises have been cooperated on various fronts. For example, they have built a training
centre for both seed production and management majors, and developed eight training
courses reflecting seed production companies’ work. In addition, Heilongjiang Nongken
Vocational College established a province level school-enterprise cooperation group for food
majors. The group provided consultation and research and development (R&D) to the
companies. For example, it offered food safety and quality system training to the companies
including Mengniu, Yili, Wandashan. It has also conducted the R&D on the preservation of
mashed potato for a company in Qiqihar.

Innovating the Talent Training Model

Innovating the talent training model to improve the quality of training is another common
trait of excellent agricultural vocational schools. Nan Gong Vocational and Technical
Education Centre used the rotation training model to help students to find employment and
positions suited for them. For the training of the animal husbandry major for example, the
school has divided three teaching districts in Nan Gong according to their specialized areas of
farming, and helped students to select one of them for their career development. The students
can experience training from all three districts, with different positions offered by an
enterprise in each district. The training model has provided the students an opportunity to
experience the different areas of farming based on the characteristics of regional agricultural
economies.

Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational Technical College has also implemented the various forms
of work-integrated learning to meet the needs of high-quality personnel training. For
Heilongjiang Nongken Vocational College, its training focuses on the student’s sense of
cooperation, sharing, and quality assurance. In addition, the teachers designed the education
content and methods to stimulate the student’s interest in self-learning.


Continuing Challenges

Although all three schools have accumulated successful experience in their operations, there
are still areas that need to be improved, mainly reflected in:

Decline in Agriculture Related Majors

Nowadays, the students studying in agriculture related majors are decreasing every year,
causing shrinkage of the size of the majors. So the schools began to expand the majors related
to the secondary and tertiary industries. This phenomenon is more evident in the secondary
vocational schools. One of the main reasons is that due to the low social recognition of the
agricultural profession, most parents are not willing to let their children study in the
agriculture related majors. In addition, the level of economic development in rural areas is
comparatively low, so there is no attraction for graduates to work at the rural area. From the
field research of Nan Gong Vocational and Technical Education Centre, we found that most
graduates want to work in a big city in Hebei, and are reluctant to stay in Nan Gong for local
employment.

Limitation in School-Enterprise Cooperation

The surveys showed that most enterprises working with the schools are small enterprises, and
their main reason for cooperation is to solve their labour shortage problems. At Nan Gong
Vocational and Technical Education it was found that because of the enterprises’ size and
low level of technical capacity, it is difficult for the students to learn new technology from
them, and the enterprises can only offer lower quality jobs. The students in Xinjiang
Agricultural Vocational Technical College also expressed that since their internship program
was not administered with a clear plan and content, they were mainly used as a simple
manual workforce. For Heilongjiang Nongken Vocational College, school-enterprise
cooperation has been heavily reliant upon personal relationships, preventing the
establishment of a formal system of cooperation.

Shortage in School Resources

Although the three schools are the national model vocational schools, their resources still can
not fully meet the teaching requirements. First of all, their training facilities need to be
improved and the schools must invest in the equipment of the newly opened majors. For
example, if there was no assistance from enterprises, “the horse industry major” of Xinjiang
Agricultural Vocational Technical College would have never met the needs of high-quality
training. Secondly, the schools need more IT resources to provide on-line courses for
students. Thirdly, student living conditions require improvement. We have found that
Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational Technical College students have poor accommodations, and
the school should meet the students’ demand for better living conditions. Lastly, the teaching
capability of teachers needs to be enhanced. A large number of teachers do not have work
experience in an enterprise, and due to their heavy workload, they do not have time to
participate in training to improve their practical teaching. So the schools need to provide the
incentive and support for teachers to participate in practical training.

The Frequent Reform of Curriculum in Vocational Education

With the frequent reform of curricula, many educational plans have to be changed before
their full implementation. Frequent reform also makes it difficult for teachers to understand
and apply them in a short period of time.


Suggestions on Promoting Development of Agricultural Vocational Education

Vocational education is closely linked to the development of regional economies in China. To
support the country’s economic development goals, the government must continue to pursue
agricultural modernization, which in turn will promote further development of agricultural
vocational education. In order to do so, the structure of agricultural industry must be adjusted
to promote green and creative agricultural production. Second, the processing industry of
local agricultural products should be further developed to increase its added value. Third, the
agricultural cooperative model to support the farmers throughout the production process
could be better developed. Lastly, the online market of agricultural products must be further
developed to promote their production, sales, branding and other related activities.

Enhance the Attraction of Agriculture Related Majors

China needs to raise awareness of the developing agriculture sector. Currently, the
development of the agriculture industry is far beyond the traditional planting, and this new
development requires a large number of excellent skilled workers. Therefore, efforts are
needed to publicize its development and technology through media to raise awareness and
attract highly skilled professionals. The agricultural vocational schools also need to
strengthen their publicity activities to attract more students and attention. Through the media
and regular visits to high schools, they can provide potential students with more information
about the school and encourage them to apply.

Improve the Ability of a Vocational School to Serve the Regional Economy

In order to train high-quality professionals for the development of modern agriculture and the
regional economy, a school needs to adjust its majors to incorporate content related to new
agricultural trends and technology. In addition, it needs to further strengthen its
infrastructure, teaching staff and school-enterprise cooperation to improve the quality of
education and training. In this way, a school can make full use of its resources to contribute
to regional economic development.

Leverage Government Policy

The government can reduce or exempt the tuition of students from agriculture related majors
to attract more high-quality students. It also needs to increase public finance to improve
learning conditions within agricultural vocational schools and between the schools and
enterprises. The increase in teacher welfare and training will also do much to further
development of agricultural vocational education.

                             Case Study 2
              Korea’s Busan Meister Technical High School

Background

Korea’s Busan Meister Technical High School (BMT) was selected because it meets all three
study criteria. The study collected data from multiple sources (archived information,
quantitative measures, a survey, and interviews) to increase validity.

The Survey

The survey was conducted with students, teachers, vice principals, and the principal. 555 2nd
and 3rd grade students out of a total of 600 responded to the survey. 1st grade students were
excluded, as they are assumed to have a lack of learning experiences with BMT. 107
teachers (including the principal, two vice principals and 104 teachers) responded to the
survey out of the total number of 113 teachers. The survey is designed to address whether or
not schools retain each factor (resources, teaching, management, and linkage with industry)
and these factors’ impact on school outcomes.

The Interview

In order to conduct an in-depth analysis, interviews were conducted with 10 students, 10
specialty teachers, the principal, and one vice principal. Interview questions were structured
to investigate the association between the premise factors and the factor most effective in
enhancing school outcomes and how this identified factor can be improved.


About BMT

History

BMT was founded in 1967 by the government to supply skilled workers to Korea’s newly
established industry, and as of 2015 the school has produced 28,415 graduates in the field of
mechanical engineering. The school became a Meister High School (MHS) in 2009. This
same year, it reorganized the program to cover Precision Machine, Mold Design,
Shipbuilding and Machine, and Robot Tech classes. The program changes and a series of
reforms within the school system were undertaken to meet new industry demands for the 21st
century global economy.

Educational Goals

BMT aims to help students become future industry leaders through self-development. The
educational goal is to produce Young Meisters who are self-motivated and have problem-

occupational competencies and problem-solving skills; combining academic knowledge with
industry-specific technical skills; providing students with an excellent learning environment;
and ensuring teacher competency.


Case Study Analysis

Outcomes

BMT has showed very high graduate employment rates particularly after being transformed
into a Meister High School. Prior to becoming a MHS in 2009, its graduate employment rate
was between 45% and 55%. Upon reforming its program and transforming into a MHS,
BMT’s employment rate increased to 83% in 2010. Since 2013, when the school first began
producing MHS graduates, the graduate employment rate has consistently been above 90%.

In 2014, public enterprises and large companies hired approximately 40% of BMT’s
graduates, while about 50% were hired by SMEs. By major, Precision Machine shows a very
high employment rate, while Shipbuilding and Machine shows the lowest employment rates.
Considering its comparatively larger number of students, Robot Tech also shows a high
employment rate, particularly in the public enterprises and larger companies most pursued by
BMT graduates. According to a survey conducted by BMT, the majority of students (70%)
responded that their plan after graduation was either employment with large companies
(35.6%) or public enterprises (34.8%); 21.5% responded that they were planning to work at
SMEs (Educational Planning, 2015, BMT).

BMT teachers believe their students are highly competent. During the teacher survey, 96%
responded that their students are highly competent and 97% believe that BMT is attractive to
highly competent students. During the interview, teachers mentioned a “virtuous circle,”
indicating that because the school achieves successful results, graduates have a high chance
of being employed, which makes the school very attractive to prospective students who are
already competent and can easily obtain the skills taught by BMT. As a result, the school
produces successful outcomes again and again.

Findings

In this paper, ‘excellent TVET’ institution’ means that it helps students’ transition smoothly
into the labour market upon graduation by inputting adequate resources. BMT teachers
agree, stating that ‘excellent school’ means that it produces a high employment rate and, in
order to do so, the school requires competent teachers, demand-driven programs, and well-
established school-industry linkages. The teachers pointed out that the skills currently in-
demand by industry include basic technical skills along with socioemotional (SE) skills such
as adaptation, diligence, consideration for others, problem solving and work ethic.

BMT’s teachers further described an excellent school as one having a “virtuous circle.” If the
school inputs key resources and uses them efficiently, then more students become
employable, which in turn results in a higher graduate employment rate. This outcome in
turn increases the school’s brand power, which attracts even better teachers and more

competent students. Also, when the school produces high employment rates, it receives more
financial support from the government, which enables the school to acquire and retain
expensive equipment and practical training facilities. With the high social recognition of
being a top performing school, more companies are interested in hiring BMT graduates. This
is BMT’s virtuous circle.

BMT’s students agree with its teachers. During the interview, students stated that the factors
contributing to BMT graduates’ high employment rate are good teachers and facilities, and
the school’s well-established school-industry cooperation. In addition, some students
highlighted the school’s reputation, and alumni support, while others mentioned its strong
emphasis on employment and provision of various employment service programs.

All students stated that they choose BMT because they believe it will help them secure a job
upon graduation. Currently, they are satisfied with their choice and with the school’s
facilities, equipment and teachers, who they view as competent in their technical and teaching
skills and actively able and committed to helping them secure a job. Given Korea’s high
youth unemployment rate, BMT’s success is all the more remarkable.


Factor 1: Adequate Resources
	
Financial Resources

Budget

BMT is overseen by three government agencies: the Ministry of Education, Busan
government’s local education office, and the Small and Medium Business Administration
(SMBA). SMBA is the main agency that provides annual funding to BMT, and it also funds
two other Meister High Schools for the purpose of producing and supplying adequate skilled
workers to SMEs. According to 2015 data, the government (SMBT and the provincial office)
provides the highest percentage (about 60%) of BMT’s total revenue, followed by parental
support. Regarding expenditures, the school spends the most on student welfare (i.e.
dormitories and food), followed by administration. More than 20% of the total budget is
allocated to curriculum development. BMT spends 16% of its total budget on teachers’
wages. Teacher and student survey and interview results demonstrate that the school retains
adequate financial resources with 85% of surveyed students responding that at least some
portion of course fees, residential costs, and academic materials are covered by the school.

Facilities and Equipment

During the teacher survey, 85% responded that school building conditions are excellent or
good, 84% believe equipment maintenance is excellent or good, and 83% agree that retention
of full or updated equipment is excellent or good. Overall, the majority of teachers are
satisfied with school facilities, equipment and their maintenance. The student survey showed
majority satisfaction regarding school’s facilities and equipment. Sixty-seven percent
responded that they are satisfied with classroom conditions, 61% are satisfied with computer
labs and access, and 72% are satisfied with practical training resources. All ten of the

interviewed students agreed that BMT retains adequate training facilities and equipment,
providing each student with practice space and materials.

Human Resources

Number of Teachers and Staff

As one of largest Meister High Schools, BMT also retains a large number of teachers and
staff, including one principal, two vice-principals and 113 teachers.

Teacher Characteristics

The majority of BMT teachers are in their 50s, while there is a shortage of teachers in the 40s
age-range. This shortage prevails throughout Korean TVET schools, because during the
1990s government policy on TVET teachers limited their numbers. The average years of
teaching experience is high, with nearly half of BMT teachers possessing over 20 years. The
average educational level of the teachers is an undergraduate degree, and roughly one third
have also obtained a master’s degree in their areas of specialty.
	
In-service Training

BMT requires its teachers to receive 90 hours of in-service training per year. According to
their 2015 Educational Planning, among 65 specialty teachers, 4 from Precision Machining, 8
from Mold Design, 17 from Shipbuilding and Machining, and 15 from Robot Tech, received
in-service training in their respective areas. Our teacher survey results show that 96% of
BMT’s teachers received in-service training, and among them 59% had received more than
61 hours by April of 2015. The majority (61%) had received seminar/workshop training.

During the survey teachers were asked to assess their own competency. Ninety-eight percent
regard themselves as a competent teacher who possesses the required technical and teaching
skills. The same proportion of BMT’s teachers believes that the school has adequate teacher
recruitment standards. During the in-depth interview, all teachers indicated that the most
important element of being a competent TVET teacher is technical skill. However, newly
hired teachers often lack technical skills due to a lack of practical training during tertiary
teacher training programs. According to the Principal, BMT offers 3-6 months of training to
newly hired teachers, hiring substitute teachers during their absence, in order to overcome
this issue. The school also appoints industry mentors for teachers to help them improve their
technical skills.

According to the student survey, 75% of students agree that their teachers are competent.
Interviewed students further stated that BMT’s teachers are competent in both technical
knowledge and teaching. Students said the older teachers have more teaching and technical
skills than younger teachers, and that older teachers are able to teach the latest skills.
Students also mentioned that teachers support them in acquiring certificates by working with
them even after class, on weekends and during vacations. Students further report that their
teachers actively find prospective companies for them, continually providing information on
employment with these companies.

Career Development Supporting Programs

BMT offers various programs to help its students build their career plans. First, “Semester
for Promotion of Learning Motivation” is a new initiative developed by the current Principal,
Dr. Lee. The program is offered to freshmen during the first month of the high school year
and aims to improve learning motivation to help them develop career plans. The program
also seeks to enhance students’ sense of community, self-reflection, self-esteem, self-control,
commitment to and respect for others. During this month, students participate in various
group activities and attend special lectures conducted by prominent graduates.. They also
visit large companies and SMEs. Overall, the teachers (59.5%), parents (63.5%), and students
(63%) are satisfied with this program (The Educational Planning of 2015, BMT). During our
interview, students said that “My future company visit” during the Motivation program was
key in helping them understand how a manufacturing plant operates and the workings of a
real job. Another program, “Weekly Special Lectures of Personalities,” invites prominent
alumni (such as corporate CEO) to foster student motivation for future achievement and job
acquisition. Lectures are aimed at increasing student self-confidence, helping them
developing their future career plans and cultivate a sense of caring for others. Overall, the
teachers (69.7%), parents (57.3%), and students (51.9%) are satisfied with this program (The
Educational Planning of 2015, BMT).

The fact that BMT has instituted an excellent support system to enhance student employment
is supported by evidence collected by our study. During the teacher survey, 38% rated
BMT’s support system as excellent, particularly in the area of career services. During the
interview, they agreed that the school has successfully motivated student learning, helping
them develop career plans. According to the Principal, BMT’s support system directly and
positively influences the graduate employment rate. As of April, 90 students out of 295 (3rd
grade) had secured employment and in order to make this happen, the school has provided
various other programs, besides the two aforementioned, such as Employment Camp, Job
Fair, and Company Field visits.

BMT’s students also said that the school’s support system has been very helpful. During the
survey, 63% reported receiving career counseling, and among them, 89% responded that the
counseling has helped them navigate their career plans. In particular, homeroom teachers
guide them in finding their specific interest, occupation and companies. Then, the school
provides information on the company and employment opportunities: for example, assisting
students in acquiring certifications needed for the specific job and company, improving their
interview skills, and supporting them in writing a resume and self-introduction letter.


Factor 2: Relevant Program

As BMT is a specialized high school whose specific purpose is to produce skilled workers
within relevant fields, the specialist subjects occupy the most (50%), and are comprised
primarily of required credits. BMT’s 1st year program focuses on the National Common
Basic Curriculum, while the 2nd and 3rd year programs focus on Optional Subject Curriculum.

Our study findings support the fact that BMT is providing its students with programs that
enhance industry-required skills. Ninety-three percent of teachers said BMT offers high

                                                                                              Page	26	of	47	
                                                                                                              	
                                            Promoting	Skills	Development	and	Job	Creation	in	East	Asia	Project	
                                                     Compendium:	Case	Studies	of	Excellent	TVET	Schools	
                              	
                                                                                                                	




	
quality programs and 87% believe its curriculum is industry-relevant. Sixty percent of the
teachers reported that students need to take additional training to be employed. This is
because in Korea’s case, the students need to acquire certificates, and additional training
serves this purpose. Overall, 95% of surveyed teachers believe that the school provides
relevant programs (including practical training) to produce competitive graduates. During the
in-depth interview, teachers generally agreed that the school offers its students what industry
requires. Furthermore, 90% of teachers believe that BMT’s program can also help students
advance to higher education.

According to the Principal, currently needed skills include basic technical skills, cognitive
skills, and SE skills such as adaptation, consideration for others, diligence, patience, problem-
solving skills, and self-determination. In regard to technical skills, teachers believe that the
school should impart basic technical skills because these are the job-ready skills needed on
production lines and they form the basis for acquiring firm-specific skills. To meet the rapid
changes in industry, BMT annually reviews its curriculum and updates supplemental training
materials.

Students agree that BMT provides industry relevant programs. During the internal survey,
63.7% of students responded that they are satisfied with their major (The Educational
Planning of 2015). In our survey, 72% of students responded “Yes” to the question of
whether they believe BMT is preparing them adequately, skill-wise, to find a job and 56%
mentioned receiving more than 20 hours of practical training each week at BMT.
Nevertheless, 78% of students said that they take additional training outside of BMT’s
regular program, and among them, more than half are receiving 10-15 hours of additional
training per week. Students said that they take additional training aside from school’s regular
program not because they lack practical training but because they need to prepare for certain
certificates. According to students, Korean companies emphasize whether or not an applicant
holds needed certifications during the hiring process.


Factor 3: Effective Management System

The teachers all agreed that BMT’s management contributes to its positive school outcomes.
	
Organization of School Management

BMT’s management includes one principal, two vice principals, seven centre heads and 25
team leaders. Under the Principal, there are two vice-principals and one head of
Administration. Each vice principal is responsible for the three centres, and each head of
centre manages their own department. The head of Administration under the Principal
manages the school administration centre that consists of five departments, including school-
industry cooperation.	
	
Centre-focused Department Management

BMT’s unique Centre-focused Department Management aims to improve open
communication, unity, and harmony among faculty members by integrating 25 departments


                                                                                               Page	27	of	47	
                                                                                                             	
                                           Promoting	Skills	Development	and	Job	Creation	in	East	Asia	Project	
                                                    Compendium:	Case	Studies	of	Excellent	TVET	Schools	
                              	
                                                                                                               	




	
into seven major centres. The seven centres are the Education Planning Research Centre;
Meister Centre; Technical Education Centre; Creative Design Centre; Cognitive Education
Centre; Student Support Centre and; the School Administration Support Centre. The school
holds bi-weekly meetings to discuss and share the centres’ issues, including curriculum,
budget, and facilities; therefore, during the meetings, the teachers understand the total
workflow across the department as well as among the centres. Also, this centre-focused
management approach enables BMT to use the budget efficiently as funds are allocated by
centre, and departments within the centre share the funds overall.

To assess management perceptions, BMT conducted an internal survey of its teachers.
Regarding the question of to what extent teachers’ suggestions and demands are reflected in
the school’s education plan and aim, 36.7% of the teachers responded “some” and 44.3%
responded “moderate.” In response to the question of to what extent teachers’ suggestions
and demands are reflected in the school’s division of duties and personnel management,
40.5% of teachers responded “some” and 35.4% responded “moderate.” On school support
for in-service training, 17.7% of the teachers responded “very satisfied” while 46.8% said
“satisfied.” Another question concerned whether they were satisfied with BMT’s suggested
2014 educational goals and 62% responded “satisfied.” Lastly, 35.4% of the teachers said
they are “satisfied” with the centre-focused management (The Educational Planning of 2015,
BMT). Overall, BMT’s teachers are satisfied with its management system.

The Bank also conducted a teacher survey to assess their perception of school management,
particularly leadership. Ninety-one percent of the teachers believe that BMT’s school leaders
have consistent school policies and an equal percentage believe that the school leaders
execute BMT’s guiding principles with clarity. Ninety-two percent believe their school
leaders envisage the future and consistently look for new and innovative products, processes,
and services. Seventy-four percent of teachers find school leaders encourage collaboration
by building trust among faculty members while the same percent indicated that their school
leaders encourage self-determination and ongoing competency development among teachers.
Eighty-two percent teachers responded that BMT has a vision that is shared among faculty
and staff. Seventy-six percent said that school leaders are consistent about their words and
deeds and 87.7% of the teachers said, “the school leaders recognize my contribution by
showing appreciation.” Lastly, 82% of the teachers responded that the school has the
capacity to deal with both anticipated and unexpected challenges/risks.

The teachers indicated that the Korean education system confers strong management power
to the Principal. For example, Principals can reorganize the school system, manage teachers,
and even develop new curricula. This is particularly so in Meister High Schools, which have
more freedom to develop their own curricula to meet industry demands. Accordingly, BMT’s
Principal is able to develop and institute new initiatives and he has a strong vision. Several
teachers referred to the school’s new initiative programs as one example of the principal’s
strong leadership.

One teacher pointed out that management impacts graduate employment rates by increasing
student motivation and confidence. In particular, student experiences during the new
initiative programs, directly influence their motivation for learning and acquiring a job. This
view is supported by the students as well. During the interview, students stated that their
experiences during “Semester for Promotion of Learning Motivation” helped them find the

purpose of their study and navigate a career plan, which pushed them to work harder during
the school year to achieve their employment goals.



Factor 4: School Industry Linkages
To strengthen school-industry linkages, BMT has created various departments, including
School Industry Cooperation TF, the School-Industry Cooperation Advisory Committee,
Council for Operation Field Practice, and Management of Job Career Development Center.
Furthermore, the school organizes several field visits to select companies for the students.

School-Industry Cooperation Advisory Committee

The committee is composed of the school teachers/staff and representatives from enterprises.
The chair is selected from industry, and the head of the Meister Centre is designated as an
assistant administrator. Within the committee, operation committee members are composed
of the vice principal, the head of five centres, and the team leader of the 3rd grade, two staff
members from the school-industry cooperation department, and the head of four major
departments; while advisory Committee members are composed of representatives from
enterprises. The meeting is held annually, and during the meeting, the members discuss
specific programs, textbooks, curriculum to meet industrial demands, share employment
information, and discuss the possibility of in-company training for both the students and
teachers.

Council for Operation Field Practice

The council is composed of the vice principal, the head of five centres, and the team leader of
3rd grade, the head of four major departments. The vice principal is designated as a head and
the head of the Meister Centre is designated as an assistant administrator. Their main tasks
include selecting companies for practical training; defining procedure for in-company
practical training; and assessing practical training.

School Industry Cooperation TF

Its role is to develop a MoU with prospective companies, and their specific activities include
finding excellent SMEs, visiting these SMEs, developing a MoU with them, and sending
students to these companies for in-company practical training and employment.

Job Career Development Centre

The centre’s main responsibilities include building a database on company information in
connection with SMEs administration; supporting educational programs offered by the
companies; organizing staff’s company visits to develop MoU for employment. In addition,
the centre provides the students with the latest information on the companies, helping them
prepare self-introductions, resumes, and job application letters, and providing personalized
career counseling via job interview simulation. According to the internal survey, 65.9% of
teachers, 55.9% of parents, and 62% of students are satisfied with their experience with the
Job Career Development Centre (The Educational Planning of 2015, BMT).

Field Trip to Select Companies

The school provides students with an opportunity to visit prominent companies to help them
understand how products are manufactured in the production lines, to help them develop their
career roadmaps, and to promote school-industry linkages. Because the students of 3rd year
are taking in-company training during summer, the site visit is designed specifically for 1st
and 2nd year students who are still developing their career plans.

According to the teacher survey, 95% reported a belief that BMT has built successful
partnerships with companies that enhance school outcomes. Also, in regard to the type of
cooperation, 96% of teachers believe that a school should have a formal partnership with
companies. However, teachers often face difficulty in finding interested companies. Indeed
67% of those surveyed identified companies’ disinterest as the main impediment to MoU
development. During the interview, all teachers stated that in particular SMEs are generally
not interested in developing school-company cooperation.

To overcome this challenge, BMT teachers have made tremendous efforts by visiting
companies in person to discuss possible collaboration and MoU. Once a MoU is developed,
then the companies participate in developing training materials and curricula as well as
provide scholarships, in-company training for the students and teachers, places for the field
visits and employment.

Also, all teachers agreed that their cooperation with the companies is systematic as the MoU
defines each party’s roles and responsibilities. The role of companies is rather advisory: for
example, during the School-Industry Cooperation Advisory Committee meeting, the
representatives from the companies provide advice on the direction of the program and
curriculum. In regard to developing BMT’s own training materials, the teachers of each
department work closely with the representatives from four companies according to their
relevant fields.

However, most teachers indicated that the companies need to be more active in this
cooperation. Although the formal School-industry Cooperation Advisory Committee is held
twice a year, sometimes one third of representatives of the companies fail to attend the
meeting. Therefore, the teachers note that school-industry cooperation can have the best
outcome only when the companies also actively participate in this cooperation.


Conclusion

This study reversely examined the relationship between outcomes and premise factors by
selecting a high-performance school and the impact of the premise factors on school
outcomes. The logic is that if this high-performance school demonstrates that it possesses
these factors, then these premise factors likely raise employment rates.

The first research question is whether or not the school possesses these factors. The findings
strongly support that BMT has 1) adequate resources, 2) relevant programs, 3) excellent
management, and 4) well-established school-industry linkages. The second question is
whether or not the above premise factors impact school outcomes. The findings suggest that

                                                      Compendium:	Case	Studies	of	Excellent	TVET	Schools	
                               	
                                                                                                                 	




	
these factors both directly and indirectly influence BMT graduate employment rates.
According to the survey and interview conducted with teachers and students, these factors
increase student employability. The third question concerns which of these factors
contributes most to the enhancement of school performance, in what context, and how this
factor can be strengthened. According to the findings, the primary factor has changed over
time due to economic and social conditions.

During the 1970s, because the country shifted from a lighter to heavier manufacturing
industry, it required different types of labor force, such as skilled technicians and experts.
Accordingly, the government expanded technical and vocational education to meet the
demand for skilled workers in the heavier manufacturing industry (Zang, 2009; Kim, 2000;
Lee et al, 2012). Given this economic context, BMT was strongly supported by the
government. In fact, the government founded BMT in 1967 to meet this shortage of skilled
workers with support from the German government as well as IBRD. Then, the government
produced practical trainers within a short time period by issuing a practical trainer certificate
to those who graduated from BMT. The teachers stated that during this period, both financial
and human resources were the most important factors contributing to the school’s
performance. Although BMT faced a lack of resources, strong government support, along
with support from IBRD and other donor countries, and their ability to expedite technical
teachers enabled them to overcome the odds.

Since 1985, higher education enrollment (both 2 year technical and vocational college and 4
year university) has rapidly increased due to economic growth and social demands. As a
consequence, according to the teachers, all TVET schools had the most difficult time during
the 1990s: most students entered academic high school to pursue higher education, while
stigma attached to those who studied at TVET schools prevailed. During this time, the
teachers generally agreed that management, particularly a strong leadership and vision, was
the most important factor contributing to school outcomes. First, BMT management
efficiently utilized its resources in the face of a lack of financial support from the government.
Second, management focused on establishing school-industry cooperation with strong alumni
support. Because of its long history, BMT had a good number of prominent alumni, including
CEO of SMEs. Their companies provided scholarships, lectures, and employment to BMT
students. Also, under strong leadership direction, the teachers not only taught but also
actively worked on establishing the school-industry cooperation. Therefore, the teachers said
that during the 1990s when there was low demand for and high stigma attached to TVET
schools, BMT’s management was the most important factor, and their recommendation was
to have a leader with strong vision and leadership.

In 2008, the government made a major policy change in the TVET system. Due to a shortage
of technical skilled workers and stigma attached to TVET schools, it decided to establish the
Meister High Schools by selecting 39 existing TVET schools whose performance meet the
criteria. The purpose of establishing the Meister High School is to produce skilled workers
via a curriculum tailored to industry needs in order to reduce skills mismatching. By
transforming TVET schools into specialized high schools purposed to produce the best
skilled workers, the Meister High Schools would reduce the stigma attached to TVET schools.
To achieve this goal, the government first provides the schools with financial resources to
substitute their students’ tuition, dormitory, and fees, as well as to maintain training facilities
and equipment. Second, the schools are given the autonomy to develop customized curricula

                                          Promoting	Skills	Development	and	Job	Creation	in	East	Asia	Project	
                                                   Compendium:	Case	Studies	of	Excellent	TVET	Schools	
                             	
                                                                                                              	




	
to meet the demands of companies in their relevant fields. Third, due to increasing school
autonomy, the government encourages the schools to select a Principal with strong
management skills via public contest. Lastly, the government encourages Meister from
industry to train Meister High School students via school-industry cooperation.

Since becoming a Meister High School BMT has received strong government support,
particularly financial resources. BMT has built a strong reputation and high employment rate
outcomes. Given that a Meister High School has strong autonomy in the areas of curriculum
development and management (including the Principal’s), most of BMT’s teachers agreed
that management, particularly leadership, is a key factor in determining school outcomes.
They recommended that schools should have a good leader who has vision, manages
resources efficiently, encourages teachers to improve their competencies, develops demand-
driven, tailored curricula, and establishes meaningful school-industry cooperation. In
Korea’s BMT Meister High School, all school inputs are created and utilized under the
direction of the Principal’s strong leadership.

                              Korea’s Yeungjin School
	
	
Background
	
Korea’s Yeungjin School was selected because it meets all three study criteria and is well-
known for producing successful mid-level technicians for the manufacturing sector. The
study collected data from multiple sources (archived information, quantitative measures, a
survey, and interviews) to increase validity.

The Survey

The survey is designed to directly address whether or not the schools retain each factor
(resources, teaching, management, and linkage with industry) and these factors’ impact on
school outcomes. It was conducted with the students and professors of three majors directly
related to the manufacturing sector [School of Mechanical Engineering, School of Electronic
and Info-Communication, and School of Electronic Engineering] and the President of
Yeungjin. Six hundred ninety-three students out of the total number of 1,400 responded to
the survey. Among faculty members, 23 professors of the aforementioned majors responded
to the survey.

The Interview

The interview investigates the association between the premise factors and the factor most
effective in enhancing school outcomes and how this identified factor can be improved. To
conduct an in-depth analysis, we interviewed 10 students, 10 professors, and the President.

colleges retaining more than two thousand graduates with 79.3% of its graduates employed.
In 2011 the MoE, whose aim is to cultivate Korea’s best technology masters in colleges,
nominated Yeungjin as one of seven World Class Colleges (WCCs). This is a meaningful
award as a WCC is a comprehensive evaluation that assesses college infrastructure,
educational performance, financial integrity and the satisfaction rate of industries with
education. As the graduate employment rate is an outcome indicator in this study, Yeungjin is
assumed to be an excellent school. Next, we will reversely examine whether or not the
school possesses all of the premise factors before determining whether or not these premise
factors are likely to impact employment rates, and in what direction.

Case Study Analysis

Factor 1: Adequate Resources

To determine whether or not Yeungjin has adequate financial and human resources to
enhance student employability, we conducted a survey and interview with teachers and
students.

The Teachers’ Perception

During the survey, teachers were asked to assess three areas, a) the school’s financial
resources and facilities; b) teachers’ recruitment standards and in-service training; and c) the
support system for employment. Results show that Yeungjin retains adequate financial and
human resources. All surveyed teachers believe the school provides adequate financial
support to students, and 96% responded that providing financial support plays a primary role
in attracting talented students. Regarding school facilities, 65% of teachers answered
“excellent,” while 57% answered “excellent” for equipment maintenance, and 56% answered
“excellent” for retaining full and updated equipment.
	
In the area of human resources, teachers were asked about teacher recruitment and in-service
training. For teacher recruitment, teachers were asked to identify which is most important, 1)
minimum academic qualifications; 2) minimum years of industry or work experience; 3)
minimum years of teaching experience; or 4) other. Thirty-five percent responded that
“minimum years of industry or work experience” is the most important criteria. Ninety-one
percent responded that Yeungjin’s recruitment standards for teachers/instructors are adequate
enough to provide students with state-of-the-art skills. All of the teachers believe themselves
to be competent teachers with the required skill set for teaching. Ninety-one percent of
Yeungjin teachers had completed in-service training as of April 2015 and the majority (67%)
had taken a formal type of in-service training, such as mentoring or leadership coaching.

Teachers were also asked to assess Yeungjin’s support system for student employment.
Ninety-one percent answered that the school has a support system to assist students with their
career plans and provides various employment services, such as a job service center. In
addition, all teachers said that they have guided their students in developing career plans.

Regarding facilities and equipment, teachers pointed out the benefits of participating in
government projects that support SMEs. The school has been nominated as a learning and
skill hub in the region for several government projects that support SMEs in boosting the

                                                                                               Page	35	of	47	
                                                                                                              	
                                            Promoting	Skills	Development	and	Job	Creation	in	East	Asia	Project	
                                                     Compendium:	Case	Studies	of	Excellent	TVET	Schools	
                              	
                                                                                                                	




	
local economy. Through this SME consortium, Yeungjin provides SMEs access to its
facilities and faculty in exchange for the SME’s providing expensive machines and
equipment. The teachers said that through this process, the school was able to upgrade its
training facilities and secure the best equipment in the region.

Regarding human resources three key themes emerge from the study, 1) teachers with
industry experience are recruited, 2) advisors work closely with students, and 3) a virtuous
circle is maintained. First, teachers pointed out that Yeungjin recruits teachers from industry,
particularly those who hold middle or high level positions at large companies, via public
contest. The goal is to secure faculty members who are able to develop demand-driven
programs as well as strengthen school-industry cooperation. Selected instructors are able to
develop relevant curriculum and training materials, as they know the types of skills and
knowledge demanded by the current labor market. Additionally, they respond to market
changes by continually updating training materials and, if necessary, changing out entire
courses. All teachers agreed that hiring instructors from industry has a direct impact on
increasing the graduate employment rate. Based on their industry experience, instructors are
able to inform students of the types of certificates and courses needed to attain employment
in their chosen industry and, ideally, at their dream company. Teachers are further able to
help students gain employment by leveraging their own networks.

Second, in Yeungjin, there is an advisor for each class who is responsible for aproximately 30
students. Via one-on-one meetings, each advisor works closely with their respective student
on developing their career plans, providing company employment information and job
opportunities. Advisors teach job ethics classes to help students prepare for work, provide
career counseling, and support students in developing their academic skills.

Third, teachers pointed out that the school is in a virtuous circle, similar to that described by
the teachers of Busan Meister High School. Because the school retains adequate resources,
excellent facilities and faculty members, it produces high graduate employment rates,
particularly with high quality jobs. Then, based on good assessment results, the school
receives more financial support from the MoE and is able to participate in the government-
supported SME consortium. This in turn helps the school retain excellent facilities and
strengthens school-industry cooperation. Then, the school is able to secure competent
students and teachers and, in this manner, continually produces the best outcomes.

The Students’ Perception

During the survey, the students were also asked their perception of the school’s resources.
Eighty-three percent reported receiving at least some level of financial support to cover
course fees, residential costs, academic materials, etc. Sixty-seven percent are satisfied with
classroom conditions. Regarding teacher competence, 71% said they are satisfied. Regard
career support system, 63% had received career counseling, and among these, 92% said that
the counseling helped them navigate their career plans in order to secure a job. In general,
66% of the students are satisfied with school life.

In addition to interviewing teachers and staff, we conducted an in-depth interview with ten
students. Those interviewed agreed that enough machines and equipment are available to
them for their practical training. They are impressed with Yeungjin’s training facilities,


                                                                                               Page	36	of	47	
                                                                                                               	
                                             Promoting	Skills	Development	and	Job	Creation	in	East	Asia	Project	
                                                      Compendium:	Case	Studies	of	Excellent	TVET	Schools	
                             	
                                                                                                                 	




	
because some of the expensive machines they have access to are not available in other
universities and they notice no shortage of machines or equipment.

All interviewed students agreed that their teachers are competent. According to the students,
based on their work experience with large companies, their teachers are able to design
demand-driven, customized programs, teach the most relevant skills, and develop useful
training materials. Interviewed students mentioned that based on their experience, the
teachers continually give students tips for employment preparation, guide students in
developing career plans, and provide company-specific information. The students said their
teachers directly assist in connecting students with companies within their respective
networks. Furthermore, interviewed students said Yeungjin’s teachers continually update
knowledge and skills in their fields while maintaining relationships with companies.
Teachers are able to freely develop and update training materials for the classes they teach.
One student mentioned that some employed graduates still use school training materials to do
their current job.

Students said that the one-on-one meetings with an advisor are very helpful in solidifying
their career plans because advisors provide them with company specific information and
inform them of certificates necessary for applying to a particular company.

Interviewed students agreed that most teachers not only teach but also emphasize individual
student job placements. They continually provide tips for job preparation during classes and
directly help students obtain jobs by matching company requests with students’ skills to
identify ideal candidates. By utilizing their own network, teachers find places for in-
company training and even jobs for students. Most importantly, students said that their
teachers care about them, for example, supporting late learners by using personal time after
class and on weekends to help them catch up. All interviewed students agreed that their
teachers are available anytime they need help outside of class and many provide special
weekend lectures and lectures during vacation.

The Teachers’ Perception

The teacher survey investigated three areas: a) program relevance, b) students competencies,
and c) articulation between the two. In regard to the relevance of the program, 61% of the
teachers strongly agree that the school curriculum (both academic and practical) reflects
current industry demands. Also 57% of the teachers strongly agree that the school offers high
quality programs. However, 57% of the teachers responded that their students need to take
additional outside training in order to secure employment.

Eighty-three percent of teachers believe their students are competent and 52% strongly agree
with the fact that the school is attracting highly competent students. Overall, 87% of the
teachers believe that the school provides relevant teaching programs (including practical
training) to produce competitive school outcomes. Eighty-three percent of teachers believe
that the school offers academic programs to students who want to continue their
education/pursue an advanced degree, and all teachers think that Yeungjin’s program helps
students advance to higher education.

The interview followed, and three program-related themes emerged, the importance of 1)
developing a demand-driven program, 2) having a flexible curriculum, and 3) balancing
theory and practical training. First, the teachers agreed that Yeungjin’s programs meet
industrial needs by pointing out its demand-driven programs. Each year, teachers and
representatives from companies of each sub-major design curricula together via an annual
committee meeting, updating the curriculum based on company needs. Teachers mentioned
Yeungjin’s customized classes. Each department has several customized classes created
upon request from a specific company6. Accordingly, students obtain more specific skills
than transferable skills, enabling them to immediately work for specific companies upon
graduation. A second, related advantage

The strength of Yeungjin’s program lies in its flexibility; teachers continually review and
update programs in response to rapid industry changes. Even customized classes can be
closed if there is low demand, and new customized classes are created if there is high
demand. Teachers also mentioned that feedback from alumni who are currently working at
prospective companies is useful for updating the program.

Third, teachers pointed out the importance of balancing theory and practical training. Ideally,
training schools might provide theory and basic knowledge of each field as well as the SE
skills needed to succeed in the world of work. At the same time, the school needs to provide

enough practical training to help students prepare for future, hands-on jobs. One teacher
shared his own experience upon graduation from a top ranking university saying, “I had
difficulty working at Samsung right after joining the company, because I mainly studied
theory and did not have much practice while studying at school.” Therefore, he believes that
Yeungjin should emphasize practical, hands-on training, in addition to theory. In general,
teachers agreed that provision of relevant knowledge and skills directly increases graduate
employment rates because the knowledge and skills obtained in school are also tested during
the hiring process. In Korea, the hiring process includes a Document Screening Process,
Aptitude Test, and Interview, and during the interview, companies test applicant knowledge
in their chosen field.

The Students’ Perception

According to the survey, only 9% of students pursue further education, while 91% want to be
employed upon graduation. Among those who are looking for a job, 60% expect to obtain a
mid-level skilled position and 71% expect to receive more than USD 20,000 in annual
income. Fifty-nine percent of students hold certifications. Fifty-four percent of surveyed
Yeungjin students said they are satisfied with the program. About half said that they receive
more than 10 hours of practical training per week, while the other half indicated that they
take less than 10 hours. Thirty-eight percent receive additional out-of-school training, and
46% are planning to receive additional training from another institute after graduation.
Nevertheless, 69% believe that Younjin is adequately preparing them to find a job upon
graduation.

All ten of the interviewed students agreed that the curriclum is designed well enough to help
them acqire a range of information from basic knowledge and theory to specialized
knowledge and hands-on skills. During the first year, all students study common subjects,
then they are dividied into sub-majors based on their interests and levels of competence.
During the 2nd year, the students obtain in-depth knowledge and skills in their relevant fields.
The students reported that they are satisfied with this balance of theory and practical training.
Like the teachers, they said that the program should include theory, because the college is not
a training institute whose program is mainly designed to help trainees obtain certificates. The
students also believe that their practical training is adequate preparation for employment
opportunities. However, considering the importance of possessing particular certificates for
certain job applications, aside from the regular courses, they feel it is necessary to take
additional courses to obtain these certificates. Finally, students reported improved creativity
after taking the Capstone course. During the class, the students organize into groups, select a
topic, develop an idea based on open debates and discussions, present their ideas, produce a
product, conduct a survey for market value, and present their final product during graduation.
The teachers support them in finding necessary materials and share sound advice. According
to them, during the Capstone process, their ideas are developed, and most importantly, their
self-confidence increases.


Factor 3: Effective Management System
Yeungjin’s uniqueness in terms of school organization is its emphasis on the school-industry
linkage by instituting a separate “Industry-College Cooperation Corp” division. Four

departments comprise this division, a) Industry-College HRD Center, b) Office of Industry-
College Convergence, c) Daegu Techno-Park Yeungjin Branch Office and, d) the Business
Support Center.

Teachers’ Perception

During the survey, the teachers assessed Yeungjin’s leadership and the management system.
Fifty-six percent strongly agreed that the school leaders execute the school’s guiding
principles with clarity, and 48% said that the school has shared its vision with its faculty
members. Furthermore, 57% of teachers strongly agree that their school leaders are
consistent with their words and actions.           Regarding leadership’s consideration for
employees, 52% of the teachers reponded that their school leaders encourage collaboration by
building trust among faculty members; 52% strongly agreed that their leaders encourage self-
determination and teacher competency development while the same percent agreed that their
school leaders recognize their contribution by showing appreciation. Sixty-one percent of the
teachers strongly agreed that leaders envisage the future and consistently look for new and
innovative products/processes and 65% responded that the school has the capacity to deal
with both anticipated and unexpected challenges/risks. Regarding relationships with the
leaders as well as with other teachers, 48% said their relationship with the President of
Yeungjin is excellent, and 39% said their relationship with other teachers is excellent.

Interviewed teachers pointed out management’s contribution to Yeungjin’s high graduate
employment rate. According to them, under strong leadership, Yeungjin’s management
system coordinates the efforts of all faculty members to accomplish the school’s single
objective of increasing the graduate employment rate by utilizing financial and human
resources efficiently and effectively. First, the teachers all agree that leadership is key to not
only the school’s outcomes but also the school’s survival. According to them, 2-year
colleges were founded based on the country’s economic needs during the mid-1970s. Until
the early 1970s, Korea did not have 2-year TVET colleges, because the government
emphasized expanding TVET high schools and 4 -year universities to supply urgently needed
skilled workers to fast growing industries; however, as industry became more complicated,
companies also began requiring mid-level skilled workers to fill the gap between low and
high skilled workers. Due to resource constraints, the government encouraged the private
sector to establish 2-year colleges to produce these mid-level technicians by providing more
relaxed regulations to school openings. Yeungjin was one such 2-year school established
during this period.

Since the mid-1980s however, 2-year colleges have faced the major issue of declining
demand. The factors contributing to low student demand for 2-year college include shifts in
the economic structure demanding more higher skilled workers, the change in the
government’s higher education policy allowing 4-year universities to accept more students,
establishment of in-house universities at large companies that provide specific skills, and
increasing social demands for a 4-year diploma. As a result, the training market became
more competitive, and 2-year colleges lost competitiveness against 4-year and in-house
universities. Like other 2-year colleges, Yeungjin has faced the challenge of maintaining
adequate numbers of students. According to the teachers interviewed, the main contributing
factor to school survival during this time has been strong leadership and management: the

President supports teachers and has helped them feel a sense of ownership of and belonging
to the school.

Under this strong leadership, Yeungjin has reformed its entire school system. First, it changed
the management system to coordinate the efforts of all faculty members to accomplish the
school’s single objectives of maintaining adequate student number by utilizing financial and
human resources efficiently and effectively. Next, teacher recruitment policy was changed in
order to replace academic based teachers with industry-experienced teachers. Via public
contest, the school started recruiting new teachers who held middle to high positions at large
companies. Next, with this manpower, the school reformed the curriculum from supply to
demand-driven. In order to develop a demand-driven curriculum, teachers conducted a series
of surveys and interviews with specialists of companies in each major and created
competency-based programs based on their responses. Finally, management knew that
providing a demand-driven program was key to success in the training market as most
schools then provided supply-driven courses and failed to meet industrial demands.
Accordingly, the school strengthened school-industry cooperation by utilizing teachers’
networks and participating in government projects that support SMEs. For the latter, the
participation in government projects that support SMEs in the region will not only enable the
school to secure the best facilities but also strengthen school-industry cooperation to secure
in-company training places and employment for the students.

Even after entering this “new normal” stage, Yeungjin’s leaders continually prepare for the
next challenge, for example Yeungjin was the first college to advertise itself in 1995. In
addition, it began accepting younger students to offset the impacts of Korea’s aging
population.

Teachers agree that strong teacher commitment is another key to success; in other words,
teachers share their visions and communicate with each other as well as with their leaders.
By doing so, teachers feel a strong sense of ownership and belonging. The teachers said that
during difficult times, strong leadership support enabled them to develop ideas to reform the
program, increase their sense of ownership, and make tremendous efforts towards mutually
achieving school goals. For example, they visited high schools to attract students, developed
the customized program and training materials, and created MoUs with companies.

Third, regarding resource management, the teachers agreed that the school utilizes its
financial and human resources efficiently. In terms of human resources, the teachers pointed
out the school’s performance-based payment and incentives.          The teachers’ work on
developing a specific customized course, strengthening school-industry cooperation by
establishing MoUs, and conducting administrative work is reflected in the teacher’s
assessment that is linked with immediate rewards. In fact, the most important element of the
teacher assessment is their students’ employment. Incentives have also played a role;
according to teachers, the school changed its teacher wage policy from seniority to
performance-based payment. Teachers agree that these measures encourage teachers to
produce better outcomes.

Factor 4: School Industry Linkages

Customized Education

Yeungjin has successfully built a customized education system via strengthening school-
industry cooperation. Customized education means that the school receives requests from
select companies to supply a certain number of skilled workers and then develops courses and
curricula to meet their requests. Then, the students are expected to be hired by these
companies upon graduation since they have acquired company-specific skills in addition to
transferable, basic technical skills. Currently, Yeungjin is requested by 285 companies -
large and SMEs, domestic and overseas - to supply 4,493 technicians.

By participating in several government projects, Yeungjin has strengthened industry
cooperation. The first example is the industry-college convergence zone development
project, Quality of Working Life (QWL), which is managed by the Ministry of Knowledge
Economy. Both the MKE and private sector fund the project with a total of USD 450
million. The purpose of QWL is to produce skilled workers by strengthening school-industry
cooperation that connects education, R&D, and employment. The project required a college
campus with adequate training facilities, and Yeungjin met this criteria. The projected
number of skilled workers that Yeungjin will train for the next five years will be 3,000 and
the school plans to bring in 200 SME-sized enterprise research institutes. By participating in
this project, Yeungjin expects to strengthen its relationships with the SMEs, as well as
contribute to local economic growth by supplying adequately skilled workers to the SMEs.

Teachers’ Perception

All surveyed teachers believe that a school should build a formal partnership with companies
and that Yeungjin has built a successful partnership with companies, enhancing school
outcomes (e.g. graduate employment rate). The companies provide resources (e.g.)
scholarships, in-company training for students, instructors and special lectures. As a hub of
the SMEs consortium in the region funded by the government, Yeungjin provides SMEs with
facilities and human resources. For example, Younjin teachers provide technical assistance to
the SMEs. At the same time, teachers obtain information on employment, industrial demand,
and company-specific information from these companies.

For the program, the teachers of each major and representatives from ten relevant companies
hold a meeting twice a year to develop curriculum and training materials together. During
that meeting, the school receives the companies’ demanded skills in the relevant fields.
Particularly, for the customized classes that are created based upon the company’s request,
the teachers and the representatives from that specific company develop curricula together,
and 60% of the program is required by the company.


Conclusion

This paper reversely examined the relationship between outcomes and premise factors by
selecting a high-performance school (the high graduate employment rate) and the impact of
the premise factors on school outcomes. The logic is that if this high-performance school

                                                                                              Page	43	of	47

                                                     Compendium:	Case	Studies	of	Excellent	TVET	Schools	
                              	
                                                                                                                	




	
demonstrates that it possesses these factors and that they have close relationships with the
outcomes, then we can conclude that these premise factors are likely to raise employment
rates.

The first research question is whether or not the school possesses these factors. The findings
strongly support that Yeungjin has adequate resources, relevant programs, excellent
management, and well-established school-industry linkages. The second question is whether
or not the above premise factors impact school outcomes. Findings suggest that these factors
both directly and indirectly influence Yeungjin’s graduate employment rate. According to
the survey and interview these four factors all increase student employability, making
graduates more likely to land a job. The third question is which of these factors is the
determining factor that contributes most to enhancement of school performance, in what
context, and how can this factor be strengthened.

In Korea’s case, industrialization, education, economic growth, and the labor market are
closely related. Economic policy continues to guide educational policy based on the
assumption that education, although not sufficient, is a necessary factor contributing to the
country’s economic growth by providing adequately skilled workers to industry. 	
During the 1970s, because the country shifted from a lighter to a heavier manufacturing
industry, it required a different type of labor force, including skilled technicians and experts.
Accordingly, the government expanded technical and vocational education to meet demand
for skilled workers in the heavier manufacturing industry (Zang, 2009; Kim, 2000; Lee et al,
2012). During this decade vocational schools grew by 24.5%. 	

Since the late 1970s, Korea’s strategic industry has shifted to more skill-intensive industries,
such as the electronic and car industries. To meet this demand, higher education (both 2-year
college and 4-year university) was greatly expanded to train skilled workers for this new type
of industry (Zang, 2009; Kim, 2000). The expansion of secondary and higher education is
illustrated in Graph 1 (Lee, 2011; Lee, 1993; Kim, 2000). Then, between 1985 and 2007,
there was sudden and rapid expansion of 4-year universities. This is because as technological
development changed the industrial structure, demand for highly skilled workers (e.g.
managers and experts) who had completed higher education increased (Lee, 1993).

In addition to the economic change, expansion of 4-year universities was also influenced by a
strong demand for higher education from the new middle class who had accumulated their

wealth during industrialization (Lee, 2011). A 1991 survey conducted by KEDI showed that
41.7% of parents believed that people who do not attend university “are not respected in our
society.” Twenty-one percent of parents thought that “these people have limited options in
choosing their occupation” while 12.5% believed that “these people are paid less than higher
education graduates” (Kim, 2000).

However, most teachers in Yeungjin agreed that regardless of these economic and social
changes throughout time, the most important factor contributing to the school’s success is
well-established management and leadership, because it directs all resources, including
human resources, towards achieving the goal of enhancing school performance. Some
teachers pointed out a leader who supports the teachers, while others pointed out the teachers’
ownership as being the most important factor for success. Both indicate that well-established
management is based on everyone working together to achieve a shared vision. When
Yeungjin faced outside challenges, the President and faculty members united to overcome
them. The leader strongly supported the teachers’ suggestions on transforming the program
from supply-driven to demand-driven, and the teachers made efforts to establish school-
industry connections.

Under circumstances of rapid labor market shifts, the management system emerges as the
most important factor not only contributing to high graduate employment rates but also
impacting the more fundamental issue of Yeungjin’s survival in the training market. The
school’s flexible management system enables it to reform its system in response to changes,
including reorganizing structure, altering curriculum, changing teacher recruitment and
payment policies, and strengthening school-industry cooperation. Also, an efficient
management system enables the school to optimize resource use. Teachers recommended
that leadership is central to a well-established management system. Under leadership that
provides an overall direction, management utilizes all resources efficiently to achieve goals
and support faculty members in working at their maximum level with a strong sense of
ownership. Accordingly, management emerges as the key factor in increasing Yeungjin’s
internal and external efficiencies and therefore producing the best outcomes, including high
graduate employment rates.



                                   Lessons Learned

The aim of this study is to provide policy makers with empirical evidence that might be used
to develop new policies to direct schools toward more market-responsive and demand-driven
approaches to TVET training. In it, we have summarized the successful experience of a) three
Chinese agricultural TVET schools (one secondary vocational school and two tertiary
vocational schools), b) Korea’s Busan Meister Technical High School, and c) Korea’s
Yeungjin School. The case study schools were selected because they met three research
criteria: 1) exemplary outcomes, including high graduate employment rates; 2) TVET
offerings at both the secondary and post-secondary levels within the same sector; and 3) skills
training provision for sectors that may best represent the country’s economy. In collecting
information via surveys and interviews, we have made an effort to analyze the challenges
faced and solutions found by these TVET leaders.

                                                       Compendium:	Case	Studies	of	Excellent	TVET	Schools	
                                 	
                                                                                                                  	




	


Lessons learned from these three case studies include:
    •   Teachers make all the difference. In all three case studies, students ranked their
        teachers highly in terms of technical and experiential knowledge in the industry and
        believed them to be good at delivering curriculum content. Furthermore, teacher’s
        industry connections were key in establishing MOUs to support student apprenticeships,
        one of the most direct routes to employment upon graduation.

    •   Strong school-industry linkages are paramount to student success. While teachers
        in all three case studies mentioned the challenge of engaging industry to support TVET,
        particularly as enterprise size increased, school-industry relationships were viewed by
        all as absolutely critical for student success and employment opportunities upon
        graduation. Students in all three case studies cite the importance of spending time
        working within an industry and at a specific enterprise in landing their first successful
        job. TVET is hands-on and practical experience is one of the best ways for students to
        get it.

    •   Programs must be relevant to current labor market needs. TVET is often viewed in
        both China and Korea as a less glamorous route to success than tertiary education.
        Strong connection between current labor market needs and TVET curricula is therefore
        necessary in order for TVET schools to survive. Indeed, industry input into curriculum
        creation at Busan Meister played a key role in the school’s reorganization, which led to
        higher student employment rates. In turn, higher employment rates raised the perception
        of BM among potential students and industry, creating a virtuous circle that teachers
        view as central to its ability to attract the best students and remain competitive within
        Korea’s competitive TVET sector.

    •   Supportive, involved management is key. Yeungjin’s flexible management system
        enables it to respond to changes – for example restructuring, adapting curriculum,
        changing teacher recruitment and payment policies, and strengthening school-industry
        cooperation, as needed.

    •   Resources matter. Having the tools to teach the trade(s) is obviously important. When
        resources are lacking, students bear the cost. Indeed, one of the limiting factors for
        China’s agricultural training institutes is lack of sufficient student housing. Beyond
        simply having resources however, how management employs them matters a great deal.
        For example, according to Yeungjin’s teachers, under leadership that provides an
        overall direction, management is able to efficiently utilize all resources to achieve goals
        and to support faculty to work with high levels of efficiency, effectiveness and
        ownership.

    •   Success is a combination of all of the above factors. Busan Meister’s teachers noted
        efficient resource use as the beginning of their “virtuous circle.” According to them,
        efficient resource use results in more students become employable, which in turn leads
        to increased graduate employment rates. This success in turn increases the school’s
        brand power, which attracts more competent students and better teachers. Also, when
        the school produces high employment rates, it receives more financial support from the

                                                                                                 Page	46	of	47

                                                   Compendium:	Case	Studies	of	Excellent	TVET	Schools	
                             	
                                                                                                              	




	
     Korean government, which enables it to acquire and retain even better resources
     (expensive equipment and practical training facilities). Finally, with the social
     recognition of being a high performer attached to the school, more companies are
     interested in hiring Busan Meister graduates.

The biggest takeaway from this study is perhaps that it is not any one factor, but rather a
combination of factors that keeps TVET institutions connected to industry and providing high
quality workforce development training. The lessons from the case studies, in combination
with context-specific approaches, may be used to improve vocational education in other
countries across the EAP region and around the globe.
