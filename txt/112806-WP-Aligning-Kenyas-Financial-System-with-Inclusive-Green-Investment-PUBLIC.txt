                    ABOUT THIS REPORT
Executive Summary   This report aims to promote inclusive green investment in Kenya. It
                    focuses on policy, structural, and investment innovations across the
                    economy and financial sector that would increase capital flows that
                    support sustainable development.

                    Inclusive green investment forms an important part of the broad
                    environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations that
                    underpin sustainable investment. “Green” investment supports
                    economic growth in a clean, resilient, and sustainable manner –
                    such as initiatives to encourage more efficient use of resources,
                    reduce pollution, and mitigate environmental damage. “Inclusive”
                    investment serves not only investors, but the broad interests of
                    society, particularly low-income segments of the population.

                    The report is a product of a global collaboration involving the
                    International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the United Nations
                    Environment Programme Inquiry into the Design of a Sustainable
                    Financial System (UNEP Inquiry), with support from the Deutsche
                    Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) on behalf of the
                    German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).
                    It is based on broad-based research, which included extensive interviews
                    and dialogues with stakeholders across Kenya’s investment value chain.

                    MAIN FINDINGS
                    Kenya’s fast-growing economy is the largest in East Africa, and serves
                    as a trade and investment hub for East and Central Africa. While
                    the economy is diversifying, it remains largely dependent on natural
                    resources. Agriculture and tourism account for nearly half of gross
                    domestic product (GDP).

                     Kenya is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change,
                     environmental shifts, and associated social effects.

                    According to the Kenya National Climate Change Action Plan
                    2013-2017, extreme climatic events could cost the economy as much
                    as $500 million a year, equivalent to about 2.6 percent of the country’s
                    GDP in 2013.1 Aggregate models project that these economic costs will
                    increase in the future, with some sources suggesting they could reach the
                    equivalent of 7 percent of GDP by 2020. Such losses could result from
                    lower crop and livestock yields, forest fires, damage to fisheries, reduced
                    hydropower generation, lower industrial production, and reduced water
                    supply. In addition to the effects of climate change, Kenya also faces
                    costs from environmental pollution, which adversely affects human
                    health and raises the risk of epidemics.

            A. Glossary
Annexures   Cleantech: Products, services, and processes that either directly reduce or eliminate ecological impact, or provide
            performance at least matching that of traditional alternatives while requiring less, or a different mix of, resource inputs.
            Cleantech is an investment theme rather than an industrial sector. It may include investments in agriculture, energy,
            manufacturing, materials, technology, transportation, and water. In 2005, cleantech was North America’s fifth largest
            venture capital investment category, attracting more than $1.6 billion.

            Climate change: Defined by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change as “a change of climate
            which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and
            which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.”

            Climate risks: Risks stemming from climate change that may affect companies, industries, communities, and whole
            economies. The five key areas of business risk associated with climate change are regulatory, physical, litigation,
            competitiveness, and reputational.

            Corporate governance: The procedures and processes according to which an organization is directed and controlled.
            Corporate governance structures specify the distribution of rights and responsibilities, including the board, managers,
            shareholders, and other stakeholders. They also lay down the rules and procedures for decision making. Best-practice
            corporate governance may be determined by both national and international standards.

            Corporate social responsibility: A business approach that takes into account economic, social, and ethical effects to
            mitigate risk, decrease costs, and improve brand image and competitiveness. This approach may be implemented using
            a comprehensive set of policies and procedures relating to all levels of business activity, including corporate governance,
            employee relations, supply-chain relationships, customer relationships, environmental management, philanthropy, and
            community investment. Investors, including institutional investors like pension funds, can use their leverage (through
            responsible investments) to encourage companies to adopt corporate social responsibility practices. Such practices have
            been linked to improved financial performance.

            Developmental investment: Targeted financial investment that prioritizes the allocation of capital to investments and
            projects that achieve specified developmental outcomes.

            Developmental mandate: Discretionary investment of a proportion of assets in specialized strategies as part of a
            diversified portfolio consistent with the fund’s strategic asset allocation and asset/liability profile, subject to due diligence
            and other prudent investment standards.

            Economically targeted investment: An investment that aims to achieve a market return while improving economic
            conditions by, for example, providing private housing or employment opportunities.

            Environmental, social, and governance (ESG): The environmental, social, and governance issues that investors consider
            in the context of corporate behavior, alongside traditional financial criteria in managing and selecting investments. No
            definitive list of ESG issues exists, but they typically:

             • Are often considered non-financial or not material.

             • Are medium- to long-term investments.

             • Have qualitative objectives that are not readily quantifiable in monetary terms.
