Abstract: Verification in results-based financing (RBF) mechanisms is one of the key
differentiators between it and related health financing structures such as social health insurance.
Verifying that providers have achieved reported performance in RBF mechanisms is considered a
crucial part of program implementation and key to maintaining trust through transparency, as well
as the viability of the mechanism. Verification is however a process which has thus far been little
studied. Information on the methodologies used in different settings (including frequency and
sampling methodology), the effectiveness of the verification process, the direct and tangential
effects, and the cost is scarce. Plan Nacer employs one of the largest RBF mechanisms in the
world and is therefore an excellent case study for the role, methodology and effects of the
verification process. This study will give the background to Plan Nacer, detail the major
characteristics of the verification process and draw lessons on the process which can inform the
design of verification in RBF mechanisms in other countries.

                                                PREFACE
Argentina is located in the south eastern part of South America. It is a federal country with 23
provinces next to the capital Buenos Aires1. This middle-income country and its approximately
41.6 million inhabitants faced a significant economic crisis in early 2000s. Health sector reforms
were initiated to ensure access to public health services for the poor while at the same time
recognizing the need to improve the quality of care. Among other policies, Argentina used a
results-based financing (RBF) approach called âPlan Nacerâ to accomplish this. The program was
piloted in nine of the poorest provinces in the country and subsequently expanded nationwide.
Through Plan Nacer provinces are incentivized to enroll uninsured pregnant women and children
under 6 years of age to ensure they have access to basic health services. The Ministry of Health
at federal level decides on the benefit package and pays the provinces 60 percent of a capitation
fee for each beneficiary enrolled in Plan Nacer. The remaining 40 percent is paid based on
achievement of ten health indicator targets (called âtracersâ) that are agreed upon with the
provinces. This results-based payment mechanism is called Plan Nacer. More recently the
government has expanded the RBF approach to include women and adolescents and a wider
package of service called Program Sumar. In both schemes, the Provincial Health Insurance uses
RBF payment and other funds to reimburse the providers on a fee-for-service basis for the agreed
upon services provided to the target population.
This study aims to describe the methods used to verify the results in Plan Nacer, to present the
results, and discuss some of the challenges and lessons learned.
There are four types of verification mechanisms in the scheme:
      ï§    Verification of beneficiary enrollment carried out by the Central Executive Unit (called
           âUECâ) of Plan Nacer. On a monthly basis the enrollment records are checked for
           duplications and compared against databases of other insurance schemes.
      ï§    Counter-verification of the beneficiariesâ enrollment is performed by a third party through
           checking the consistency and source of the information every 2 months.
      ï§    The third party uses this same process to help determine the provinc esâ performance
           against the tracer indicators. In addition, a sample of clients is verified at the health facility
           level by a review of the clinical records and checking of, for example, the beneficiary
           signature on the enrollment form. The third party verifier reports these results every four
           months to the UEC.
      ï§    The third party verifies the use of the funds received by the provinces through Plan Nacer
           to ensure it is used for the purchasing of services covered by the program. This is
           checked by the third party at facility level, usually at the same facilities mentioned in the
           previous step.
The following results of verification were identified by this study:
      ï§    In the first phase of Plan Nacer (9 provinces) there was a sharp decline from 20 percent
           of beneficiary enrollment records rejected by the third party in the first year to 2.7 percent
           in year two and ranging between 0.1-1 percent in subsequent years. The subsequent
           nationwide roll-out started out with lower rejection rates ranging between 0.4-0.7 percent
      ï§    The verification of tracers by the third party also saw a decline in rejection rate from 25
           percent of the records declared by the provinces in 2005 to a slower progression to
           approximately 5 percent of the declared records rejected in 2012.

These verification findings are used to make adjustments to the RBF payments to the provinces
and when necessary impose fines in line with the operational manual of the program. Between

    The capital Buenos Aires has a similar status as any of the Provinces in this federal system.

2004 and 2012 this represented 5.9 percent of the gross transfers with the majority, $8.3million,
due to adjustments to tracer payments and $2.75million for beneficiary enrollment adjustments.
Seeing this in light of the cost of the third party verifier, at a value of $21.6million during this same
period, one could say that more than half of the costs of the third party verifier are recuperated
through fines and adjustments to the RBF payments. Of course it is not known what the level of
error in reporting would have been without the involvement of the third party and thus the total
amounts saved because of the verification. The verifier costs are influenced by the team
composition (both number and qualification) as well as the sample size with corresponding field
visits. There has been tension between the objectives of the third party and those of the UEC. It is
in the interest of the third party verifier to limit the size and distribution (mostly large health
facilities) of the sample selected but to be sufficient to form their independent opinion while it is in
the interest of the UEC to have as many facilities as possible verified to create an environment of
control. A larger sample size and inclusion of smaller health facilities would lead to additional cost;
consideration may also be given to whether other actors or tools can play this role. The role of the
provinces versus the role of the UEC at national level in this verification at health facility level
should also be taken into account.
The third party verifier has had a positive influence on the Plan Nacer program by ensuring that
reporting errors are corrected and RBF payments adjusted accordingly. Moreover, it has
functioned as a mediator between the national government and the provinces. While it is formally
not mandatory for the government to follow the opinion of the third party, in practice 99 percent of
the recommendations of the third party are implemented. This use of a third party to help govern
the relationships is especially suitable given the federal nature of Argentina.




               PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY

Verification in results-based financing (RBF) mechanisms is one of the key differentiators between
it and related health financing structures such as social health insurance. Verifying that providers
have achieved reported performance in RBF mechanisms is considered a crucial part of program
implementation and key to maintaining trust through transparency, as well as the viability of the
mechanism. Verification is however a process which has thus far been little studied. Information
on the methodologies used in different settings (including frequency and sampling methodology),
the effectiveness of the verification process, the direct and tangential effects, and the cost is
scarce.

Plan Nacer employs one of the largest RBF mechanisms in the world and is therefore an excellent
case study for the role, methodology and effects of the verification process. This study will give
the background to Plan Nacer, detail the major characteristics of the verification process and draw
lessons on the process which can inform the design of verification in RBF mechanisms in other
countries.



                                      METHODOLOGY
To complete this case study, project documents were reviewed and meetings with key actors
were held. The review of project documents provided information on Plan Nacerâs organizational
structure, regulatory framework, and its control and verification methods. The primary focus of the
meetings with key actors was to discuss the organizational features of Plan Nacer that are related
to its supervision and verification.

This case study is part of a broader analysis of multiple country case examples to expand
knowledge about the verification process and practices to address the immediate design and



8
implementation needs of RBF programs. The other country mechanisms studied in the series are
Afghanistan, Burundi, Panama, Rwanda and the United Kingdom. A cross-case analysis will draw
together the lessons from the six cases to identify trends, commonalities, differences and provide
recommendations for the design of new verification processes. Lastly the cross-case analysis will
provide suggestions for further analysis and research.

All the case studies in the cross-country analysis follow a similar structure for comparative
purposes. Therefore, this case study is organized into the following sections:

In 2001-2002 Argentina faced one of the biggest socio-economic and political crises in its history.
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) decreased by almost 11 percent in 2002 and by 18.9 percent
between1998 and 2002. A devaluation of the peso of 300 percent resulted in a decrease in per
capita income from US$8000 to US$2695, and poverty increased by 20 percent in 2002 (World
Bank, 2004). Despite the gravity of the situation, it was an opportunity for the Government to take
steps towards Health Sector Reform.

Historically, levels of health expenditure compared with GDP were higher in Argentina than in
most countries in the 1990s, but health outcomes did not reflect that. In the early 2000s when
Plan Nacer was being designed, maternal and child health was particularly poor in comparison to
other middle income countries in the region such as Chile, Costa Rica, and Uruguay. The infant
mortality rate had slowed or stagnated at around 17 deaths per 1000 live births after 20 years of a
descending trend, and even increased in the poorest Provinces, especially in the Northwest
(NOA) and Northeast (NEA) regions2. By contrast, infant mortality in Costa Rica (around 8 deaths
per 1000 live births), Chile (around 10) and Uruguay (around 14), was lower. Similarly, the
Maternal Mortality Ratio, which had been declining, appeared to increase, trending from 52
maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 44 in 1995, 35 in 2000, and 39 in 2005. Cost
Rica, Chile, and Uruguay generally saw rates continue to decline3.

The health sector reforms were aimed at improving the availability and effectiveness of public
health services to improve the health of the population, especially the poorest. The reforms
included: a) broadening the Primary Healthcare Strategy, b) adopting insurance-based schemes
to improve access, as well as quantity and quality of services, c) designing incentive and results-
based financing mechanisms, d) expanding decentralization in decision-making for expenditure
allocation.

The new public policy of directly tying results to financing was a substantial modification of
common practices used by the governments and financial entities. This required transitioning from
a traditional and bureaucratic model of public sector management focused on the purchase of
inputs, central intervention, and formal completion, to a new approach with an emphasis on
incentives, decentralized responsibility and a focus on impact and results, user satisfaction,
transparency and social monitoring.

and Santiago del Estero. NEA refers to North East Region composed of the Provinces of Misiones,
Corrientes, Formosa and Chaco.

OVERVIEW OF PLAN NACER

As part of a larger program implemented by the Ministry of Health, a health insurance plan
targeting mothers and children, specifically pregnant women and children under six years of age
without an explicit insurance coverage, was created. That program, called Plan Nacer, was
designed between 2003 and 2004. The objective of Plan Nacer was to ensure that the eligible
population had access to a basic package of services. The package was selected based on its
importance in improving population health. To this end, Plan Nacer emphasized preventive
actions.

Plan Nacer was partially funded by the World Bank 4, supplementing existing national and
provincial government funds, and included a set of incentives for achieving explicitly defined
results. The program aimed to contribute to the reduction of maternal and child mortality and
morbidity, and thus to achieve the maternal and child health-related Millennium Development
Goals by 20155.

One of the main purposes of Plan Nacer was to contribute to the creation of provincial-level
insurance programs for mothers and children and, once it was fully developed, to a further
expansion to other populations and other service packages. So far, Plan Nacer has had three
stages: During the first phase, the project was piloted in nine Provinces of the Northwest (NOA)
and Northeast (NEA) regions, chosen for their particularly sensitive poverty situation. The second
phase extended the same scheme to the rest of Provinces of the country. The third stage, which
is just beginning to be implemented in all Provinces, expands both the eligible population and the
service package on the same conceptual basis. In the latest phase, the program is named
Programa SUMAR or SUMAR Program. This report focuses on the first two phases of Plan
Nacer.

One important factor is that Argentina has a federal political system: there are 24 jurisdictions that
can participate in the Program, all with the same institutional status (23 Provinces and Buenos
Aires City). For simplicity in this study, all entities will be called Provinces. To participate in the
program and access its benefits, Provinces must sign a five year agreement with the national
government called an Umbrella Agreement.

Several actors are involved in the execution of the Program: the Ministry of Health (National
Government), provincial governments, and health providers. The structure is based on clearly
defined functions and follows Argentinaâs federal structure. The Plan offers participating Provinces
great freedom in establishing their own guidelines to use these reform tools to best meet their
specific needs, for instance, planning for enrollment, developing internal information systems,



4 Plan Nacer was financed by two sections of an Adaptable Program Loan, one of US$135,8 million (project
unique identifier P071025, approved on April 15, 2004) and targeting the nine poorest Provinces in the
north; the other of US$300 million (project unique identifier P095515, approved on November 2, 2006) is
scaling up the project to cover the entire country. At the time of writing this study, a third operation is in the
initial processes and will receive US$400 million in financing (project unique identifier P106735, approved
on April 28, 2011), and it will include an extension of the project to a broader segment of the population (not
only mothers and young children but also women and adolescents) and a larger service coverage. For this
last stage, the name of the Program was changed to âPrograma SUMARâ.
5In2010 the scope of Plan Nacer was extended to cover the treatment of congenital heart disease. This is
coverage for events of low incidence but with a high cost of treatment, and in that it resembles catastrophic
insurance. For that, a part of the per capita sum is put aside to cover these services that are provided
centrally by a specialized team. The payment order is made through the Provincial Insurance Management
Unit (UGSP) and the payment is made directly by the Unidad de Financiamiento Internacional , International
Financing Unit (UFI).

designing and implementing incentives for personnel, pricing each service in the Package,
defining administrative and monitoring processes.

The role of the national government is to coordinate and regulate the project, to prioritize the
benefits of the Health Care Plan as well as the tracers, and to supervise project implementation;
the national government transfers resources to the Provinces, based on enrollment and health
results, and finances equipment and technical assistance.

The Provinces are responsible for (i) creating a Provincial-Maternal Child Health Insurance (SMIP)
through which the benefits of Plan Nacer are accessed, (ii) registering beneficiaries and (iii)
updating the beneficiary registry. They are also responsible for purchasing the necessary health
services and are accountable for the use of funds and the supervision of health facilities.

The health facilities are responsible for the provision of contracted services in accordance with
established quality standards. Health facilities receive a payment for each service according to the
prices established by the Province. The funds can be managed by the health facility (if it has an
appropriate administrative structure) or through a third party administrator (usually another health
facility). Regardless, the health facility that owns the funds decides how to use or allocate the
money. On top of that, Provinces can define eligible expenses (for instance some Provinces do
not allow expenses for certain items such as fuel, travel or hiring of staff). The allocation of funds
is to be done according to provincial rules that fulfill certain conditions established by the program.
Each Province can decide to adopt (or not) a system of incentives to be paid to provider staff. If
they adopt this system, up to 50 percent of the funds may be used to incentivize individuals, while
the rest has to be spent on medical supplies, equipment and investments as determined by the
expenditure director of the facility. In the first stage of the project, only four of nine Provinces
introduced systematic incentives, with considerable variability among them (Argentina National
Ministry of Health, Plan Nacer 2011). In the second phase of the program, most Provinces did not
implement staff incentives.

There are two sets of relationships among the National Government, provincial governments, and
health providers which are regulated by agreements (see table 1). On the one hand, the
relationship between the National Government and the Provinces is regulated by the Umbrella
Agreement which establishes the rights and obligations of each party. It also includes the
mechanism through which funds are transferred from the National Government to the Provinces.
On the other hand, the relationship between Provinces and providers is regulated by a
Management Agreement which governs the billing and payment for the provision of health
services to beneficiaries. These payments are made on a fee for service basis.

Note: Performance verification is different in the case of National and Provincial Governments. The
National Government oversees Provinces in aspects such as financial performance, use of funds, incentive
systems, counterpart funds, etc. Provincial Governments oversee providers in aspects such as reporting of
information relevant to measuring service coverage (tracers), allocation of resources, compliance with
protocols, invoicing, etc.


The Umbrella Agreement establishes a monthly per capita payment in Argentinean pesos (ARS)
for each registered beneficiary. The amount was originally ARS 12 and reached a final value of
ARS 17 (approximately US$ 3). Of this amount, 60 percent is paid monthly based on the number
of beneficiaries enrolled in the program. The remaining 40 percent is paid every four months and
is based on the achievement of targets related to ten health indicators called âTracersâ. These
targets are agreed upon by the Nation and the Provinces and are included in an annual
performance agreement signed by both parties. The tracers enable the monitoring of the projectâs
progress and the development of the provincial insurance plans. These tracers have not changed
since Plan Nacer started. They are described in Table 2.

The second transfer of 40 percent of the per capita amount is paid every four months, based on
achievements of tracer targets agreed upon explicitly between the National Government and each
Province individually. It has gone through two iterations over time to measure tracer target
achievement. At the beginning of the Plan, from 2004 to 2008, the 40 percent transfer was based
on a binary achievement of that agreed upon level for each tracer. The percentage level was
either achieved, in which case the 4 percent (that is, the total 40 percent divided by ten indicators)
allocated to that tracer was paid, or it was not, in which case the payment was 0 percent. This was
therefore an all-or-nothing scheme, whereby the assessment of the target achievement had only
two possible outcomes: objective completed or not completed (see figure 1).

From 2008 onward, the all-or nothing scheme was replaced with a flexible, linear and continuous
scheme. Each tracer now has three target thresholds: a minimum, an intermediate and a
maximum value. As the Province crosses each of the three performance thresholds, that is, as
the Province increases their target achievement, their payment is exponentially higher, because
the slope of the curve determining payments gets steeper after each threshold. Therefore, for
each of the ten tracers, achievement below the minimum threshold pays nothing, achievement
between the minimum and intermediate thresholds pays between 2 and 3 percent of the per
capita amount, achievement between the intermediate and maximum thresholds pays between 3
and 4 percent, and achievement above the maximum threshold (which is never below 90 percent
coverage) pays 4 percent of the per capita amount (see figure 2). Therefore, Provinces are
incentivized to produce the best health outcomes on each tracer to receive an exponentially high
payment percentage for that tracer. For the ten tracers the maximum achievable remains 40
percent of the capitation payment.

In both cases of all-or-nothing or continuous exponential payment, all the tracer targets have
equal weight. If at least four of the targets are not met in three consecutive periods, the national
government has the right to declare the Province in violation of the Umbrella Agreement and
suspend the transfers. In practice this right was used only in one case in 2007.

Due to the two types and schedules of payments for the Results-Based Financing (RBF) program,
linked to beneficiaries enrollment on the one hand and to tracers target achievement on the other
hand, two verification processes are generated, one monthly and the other every four months.
The schedule is the same for all the Provinces: January to April, May to August and September to
December. It is also synchronized with the reports from the third party verification agent, in
Argentina called the Concurrent External Auditor (CEA), hereafter referred to as the third party
verifier.

The money received by the Province per capita must be used exclusively to purchase services
from providers. Under the Province-Provider Management Agreement, payment is made based
on the provision of services registered and billed to the Provincial Insurance. Services are billed
and paid according to a package of services which is the same in all participating Provinces.
However, the prices of those services differ among Provinces given that they are determined by
each Province. The provider is directly involved in making decisions about the end use of funds.
The package of services was chosen for its impact on the health of the target population. In 2008
it included consultations and outpatient treatment, perinatal care, medical imaging, lab work,
ambulance services, medical rounds in the community ("health rounds") and outreach services. In
2010, surgical correction of congenital heart disease was added to Plan Nacerâs benefits. In May
2012, health services for high-complexity neonatal care and high-risk pregnancy care were
introduced. Later in August 2012, when Plan Nacer evolved into Programa SUMAR, the target
population increased to include children up to nine years of age, adolescents up to 19 years of
age and women between 20 and 64 years of age without explicit health coverage.

Finally, it should be noted that the Plan requires a joint financing effort, as each Province has
been required to contribute a percentage of the per capita value since January 2009 in phase one
and since January 2011 in phase two Provinces. This co-financing is verified periodically and
penalties exist if the Province does not contribute accordingly. Penalties include an interest charge
and eventually the suspension of transfers until Provinces comply with co-financing. In practice,
every month half of the Provinces have some kind of financial delay. These delays are due to both
financial and bureaucratic issues, but once the Provinces meet their contribution of funds,
penalties are discontinued.



      INTERNAL ORGANIZATION OF PLAN NACER LINKED TO
               SUPERVISION AND VERIFICATION

This section describes Plan Nacerâs regulation, organization, and information system, as well as
the role of the third party verifier. In particular, it discusses issues related to the Regulatory
Framework, the structure of the entities driving the Plan (organization, procedures, systems), and
the system for supervision and oversight.

REGULATIONS GOVERNING PLAN NACER

The regulations governing the relationship between the National Government and the Provinces
originate in the Loan Agreement, the Operational Manual, the Umbrella Agreements between the
National Government and each of the Provinces, and the internal rules of the Unidad Ejecutora
Central, the Central Executive Unit (UEC), which is now called the Equipo Nacional de Compras
de Servicios de Salud, National Team for Purchasing of Health Services (UEC). The UEC has
continuously made efforts to harmonize regulations, protocols and evaluation criteria, both in their
definition and in the way they are supervised. These efforts were made to allow for a common
interpretation of the rules and protocols across Provinces, as well as across different firms

Among regulations ruling program oversight, some trigger financial payments for their application
or financial sanctions for their wrongful or lack of application; conversely, some oversight
regulations do not have financial implications. Within regulations that have financial implications,
there is a distinction between those regulations directly related to the measurement of results and
those not directly related. Each type of regulation governs operational processes which have
specific procedures and corrective and punitive consequences. Table 3 below presents the main
aspects related to the operation and oversight of the Plan.

6 Under the SUMAR Program, payments to Provinces require the provision of health services to a
beneficiary in addition to enrollment. This is described under the âEffective Coverageâ term. Effective
coverage means that beneficiaries received a health service that was billed to and authorized in a given
period of time according to each defined age group.

ORGANIZATION OF PLAN NACER

For the implementation of Plan Nacer, the creation of specific organizations at the National
Government level (initially the UEC, which was later called UEC) and in each of the Provinces was
required. Annex 1 presents the organization of the initial UEC during the first phase of Plan Nacer.

Beyond some minor changes that occurred over time, the UEC, naturally raising the number of
people employed8, ran the project from the national level between 2004 and 2012. The
responsibilities of the Coordination, Legal, Monitoring, Capitations and Operations Departments
within the UEC are presented in Table 4.

INFORMATION SYSTEM

The information system for the Plan has two basic sources of information: (i) one derived from the
enrollment processes of potential beneficiaries; (ii) the other based on clinical records. Ideally, the
best way would have been to define a single information system with standard functionality criteria
that would have allowed interoperability across Provinces. However, the development of an
information system followed a pragmatic path based on the idea that each Province should find
the best way to generate the data, as long as the information provided to the Plan was totally
standardized.

The UEC designed Plan Nacer, and later Programa SUMARâs information system and developed
two analytical software packages: one to consolidate the beneficiary roster and one used to report
tracers. The development of the two software packages and their operation are monitored and
evaluated by the third party verifier, according to international standards. In its report for
November-December 2011 based on surveys conducted up to then, the third party verifier firm,

8Initially   there were about 40-50 people employed increasing to around 120 people by the end of Plan
Nacer.

Crowe Horwath, rated the information system a two out of five in its level of maturity. However,
there has been recent progress in several aspects and its maturity now rates a three.

ROLES OF ACTORS INVOLVED IN VERIFICATION

Together the UEC, in particular the Capitation, Operations and Supervision Departments, and the
third party verifier are responsible for the verification process at central level. The roles of the
different actors are described in Table 5.

      MAJOR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VERIFICATION METHOD

WHO DOES THE VERIFICATION?

The third party verification function is contracted through an independent firm 9. This contract is
awarded based on international competitive bidding. The method of selection is based at 70
percent on quality and 30 percent on price. Contracts are signed for two years with an option to
extend for another year if the government is satisfied. Once this is done, it is not possible to
contract the same firm for another term for the same phase, so as to maintain the independence
of the verification firm. There is a general rule, however, that the same firm could be contracted
immediately for a different phase of the project, or that it could be contracted for the same phase

9Inaccordance with the Loan Agreement, it is not possible to disburse funds of the component related to
capitation if there is no signed contract with a firm that performs the tasks defined for the CEA.



19
following a period during which a different firm is contracted. Overall, this rule has both positive
and negative aspects. On the positive side, it results in a disruption in the relationship between the
verifier and the one verified which reduces the possibility of familiarity and the risk of conflict of
interest or collusion. On the other hand, there is a learning curve of at least six months for new
firms, during which service quality might be affected and additional effort is required from the
counterpart team.

However, since the work does not start immediately upon the signing of the contract, the terms of
reference (ToR) typically include initial tasks of retroactive review for operations carried out in the
brief periods before contract signing, so the firm can get more familiar with its expected duties.

The contract is a fixed price contract. Ten percent of the price is paid in advance, and the
remaining amount is paid through bimonthly installments, upon the issuing of the reports.

THE SCOPE OF WORK OF THE THIRD PARTY VERIFIER

The third party verifier was envisioned as a tool to audit the main fiduciary aspects of the Plan,
create a culture of verification between various stakeholders and ensure an unbiased and
independent opinion in the case of disputes, mainly between the State and the Provinces. The
third party verifier is primarily responsible for the verification of information submitted by Provinces
to the National Government, and for the review of information processes conducted in the UEC
with this information. Specifically, the third party verifier firm must counter-verify beneficiary
enrollment data (following verification by the UEC), verify that the tracer data was valid, ensure
compliance by the Provinces with general procedures, and report whether payments to providers
complied with standards.

During phase one and two, different firms were hired. The ToR were adjusted over time, either to
improve the precision of the requirements or to adapt to changes in the Plan, however between
2005 and 2008 the ToR were not substantially modified. The ToRs are summarized in Table 6.

Since 2009 there have been some minor changes in the ToR. First, there are certain changes in
the objectives and formal aspects to further specify responsibilities and describe all activities. For
example, the fourth objective that was referring to a vague general task was replaced by two more
concrete objectives as follows:

     ï§   To issue a professional opinion on whether participating providers were contracted by
         UGSP in accordance with the contracting rules defined by the program.
     ï§   To issue a professional opinion on whether the application by the UEC of any of the
         sanctions provided by the program for participating Provinces was in accordance with the
         rules of the program.

Also, it was explicitly stated that it was mandatory to issue both an Opinion and an Internal
Verification Report. The Opinion Report is presented in a short report used for decision making; it
describes verification results, fiduciary information and proposes penalties to apply to Provinces.
The longer, Internal Verification Report describes whether the different actors fulfill their
obligations as set out in the program, and provides a review of organizational aspects, processes,
and compliance with formal project documents. This separation of the two reports has been done
in accordance with an agreement between the firms and the authorities.

Some responsibilities were also added related to the extension of the Plan to cover the surgery for
Congenital Heart Disease.

It is important to mention that the ToR of the third party verifier is primarily focused on the
issuance of a third party, independent opinion. This results in a peculiar relationship with the
authorities of the Plan and it should be noted that:

     ï§   In order to provide an independent view, the firm must have the autonomy to select and
         apply the most appropriate methodology to support its opinion.
     ï§   As a general rule, the opinions issued by the firm are considered binding by the
         authorities of the Plan, although there are a few exceptions such as explicit error from the
         firm representative on a sanction to a Province, or the submission by the Province of a
         report justifying that the sanction requested by the firm is not appropriate. The third party
         verifierâs report is written every two months (results of tracer verification are reported in
         every other report). There is regular discussion of the third party verifierÂ´s reports.
         Eventually Provinces involved can participate in the clarification of the points established
         by the third party verifier, by submitting requests for clarification as per the programâs
         operational manual. The operational manual also states that the UEC can evaluate the
         opinions issued by the firm and act as the firmâs technical counterpart.


21
     ï§   Due to the professional relationship between the third party verifier and the authorities of
         the Plan, the approvals or rejections of the reports are based on highly objective criteria,
         and do not affect the independence of the firm.

HOW IS VERIFICATION DONE?

The firm Crowe Horwath was first hired for phase one. It was subsequently contracted for phase
two and for the audit of the Congenital Heart Disease Program. During the execution of the first
contract, UEC and Crowe Howarth developed tools and reports to carry out verification and
counter-verification, as well as financial audit tasks. These tools have been included in the ToR
for subsequent tenders and used by the firms contracted in later contracts 10. The above-
mentioned Opinion and Internal Verification Reports stemmed from this tool development by the
first firm.

In the next sub-sections, the following processes will be reviewed individually:
     ï§ Beneficiary Enrollment Verification
     ï§ Beneficiary Enrollment Counter-Verification
     ï§ Tracer Verification
     ï§ Verification of the Use of Provincial Funds to Purchase Services
     ï§ Other General Verification

Verification of Beneficiary Enrollment

The first level of verification of beneficiary enrollment is the responsibility of the Capitation
Department of the UEC and involves the following procedures:

     ï§   Every month, the Provinces (UGSP) send a CD to the UEC with the full archive of data on
         the provincial registry (File B). This information supports the capitation payment request
         made by the Province to the National Government.
     ï§   The UEC consolidates the files sent by all the Provinces to purge duplicate records (there
         is a possibility that a beneficiary appears registered in more than one Province, in which
         case there are preset criteria to detect the valid record) and produce a unified national
         registry of the Plan.
     ï§   This registry is compared against the largest dataset of the explicitly insured population in
         the country, which comprises the beneficiaries of the National and Provincial Social
         Security Insurances and other programs with national coverage, and is called PadrÃ³n
         Ãnico Consolidado Operativo, the Unified Consolidated Operating Registry (PUCO). This
         comparison is done to verify that registered beneficiaries are not already insured and are
         eligible for the Plan.
     ï§   The results of the verification carried out by the Capitation Department are translated into
         adjustments to the payment amount, and when applicable, corresponding fines are
         applied. Not all adjustments result in fines; for example, when a beneficiary is registered
         in more than one Province, because one Province does not know what happens in
         another Province, neither will be fined. When finalized, the adjusted capitation payment
         transfer is made. The Operational Manual for Plan Nacer details the fines applicable
         under various scenarios.




10In all cases, firms hired used as general methodological approach the recommendations of COSO
(Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission - www.coso.org)



22
Counter-Verification of Beneficiary Enrollment

The second level of verification is done by the third party verifier and follows a set of procedures in
which there is a distinction between tasks performed in the Provinces and those performed in the
central offices. The results are given to the UEC in a report every two months.

Tracer Verification

Tracers measure performance against select maternal and child health indicators, which
determine part of the capitation payment (up to 40 percent) to the Province. The numerator uses
data reported by the facilities11 to the province, where data is collated and reported to the national
level while the denominator at provincial level is based on official information which is updated
every 1-2 years. In making its determination, the third party verifier uses confidence intervals to
analyze the results.

The verification of achievement against tracers is performed every four months and, as in the
case of the List of Beneficiaries, the process begins in the Capitation Department of the UEC. The
Capitation Department receives an Affidavit from the Province reporting the level of achievement,
with supporting data on CD.

Afterwards the third party verifier initiates the process of verification (see figure 3). It consists of
three steps: (i) general consistency test, (ii) information source validation, and (iii) field test. The
first two are done on every case presented by the Province, whereas the last one is done on a
sample of cases.




11   As the facilities are paid on a fee for service basis by the provinces and not based on targets.

The general consistency test involves a series of checks on the database of positive cases sent
by the Province, in order to detect the following: duplication, inconsistent data, missing data,
verification against the PUCO, and consistency of the dates. Details of the methodology used for
global consistency can be found in the bimonthly report submitted to the UEC. This methodology
provides information regarding to whom it applies, criteria for detecting duplicates, minimum data
requirements for registries, and allowable consistency parameters for data.

Subsequently the third party verifier performs information source validation to ensure reported
data originates from approved sources. Possible information sources include the UGSP, a
hospital, or Centros de AtenciÃ³n Primaria de la Salud, Primary Health Care Centers (CAPS)12.

Finally, there is field verification. The previously described processes determine which of the
cases presented by the Provinces are valid. Therefore only the valid data from the Tracer records



12While data for tracer I, VI, VIII and IX (see table 2) comes from CAPSs, data for tracers II, III, IV and VII
comes from hospital databases. Data for tracers V and X comes from the UGSP.



24
that the Province declares completed constitutes a pool from which a field verification sample is
drawn.

The issue of sampling will be discussed further, but at this point it should be noted that there are
standards for quality and criteria that the data must meet (the minimum criteria is to have a
registry, acceptable sources for comparing data, registry characteristics).

The field test carried out by the third party verifier consists of a review of clinical records and data
quality at each sampled health facility following guidelines and protocols defined by the Ministry of
Health. The existence of clinical records with all required information filled out, and the
consistency of the information, allows one to estimate, to a degree, the quality of care, which is
not audited directly. The results of the tracer verification activities are reported to the UEC in every
other Opinion Report, every four months.

Verification of the Use of Provincial Funds to Purchase Services

The third type of verification done by the third party verifier has to do with the use of the funds
received by the Province through the monthly capitation (60 percent) and additional tracer
payments (up to 40 percent). The verification of beneficiary enrollment and of tracer indicator
achievement described so far have to do with the fiduciary oversight of the funds transferred by
the UEC to the UGSP. Here we are describing the fiduciary oversight of the funds transferred by
the UGSP to the providers. Strictly speaking, the verification of the payment for results could be
considered finished after verification of the beneficiary enrollment registries and Tracers, since the
RBF contract is between the National level and the Province. However, one specific rule of Plan
Nacer is that the funds must be used to purchase services covered by the program actually
provided to beneficiaries. The UGSP is primarily responsible for overseeing that this is the case.
Their oversight is verified by the third party verifier, because the National Government wants to
ensure that the funds are transferred in accordance with the rules of the program.

For this level of verification, a sample of the paid services is taken and verified in the field, in the
same way as it is done with the records that are used to track the achievement of the Tracers.

Verification samples tend to have a significant overlap with the samples used to check the
achievement of Tracers due to the fact that: (i) providers that report records for Tracers usually
also have the capacity to bill services, so the set of providers tend to be the same in both cases;
(ii) there is an implicit incentive for the third party verifier to match both sets of providers because
this means lower costs for verification.

Other General Verification

Operational Monitoring

The above-mentioned verification mechanisms are described in the Opinion Report addressed to
the UECENCSS, and have direct financial consequences for Provinces. The report is generated
bi-monthly and presents the findings of the verification of registries and of the payment to
providers. Every other report also includes results on the tracers. This report also includes a
proposal of the penalties to be applied to the Province as result of the assessment carried out.

In addition to these verifications, the third party verifier performs a set of general monitoring tasks
that ensure good professional practices and are summarized in the Internal Verification Report.
These tasks include ensuring compliance with agreements and administrative requirements, as
well as establishing protocols (see Annexes 2 and 3 for details).




25
Evaluation of the Work of the Third Party Verifier and Reports Approval

The Opinion Report and the Internal Verification Report are reviewed by the relevant departments
of the UEC, which are: Capitation, Legal, Supervision, and Medical. Whenever there is a
discrepancy related to compliance with the ToR, the clarification is issued and, if resolved, the
report is approved to trigger the payment for services provided by the third party verifier.

The final reports are resubmitted to the respective Provinces. At the same time, the reports are
submitted to the AGN, which performs an annual ex-post financial audit. Up until now, the AGN
has not had any negative comments regarding the financial functioning of the Program.

As can be seen, in the first phase of the Plan, there was a sharp drop in the rate of rejection
during the first two years. Over the years the rejection rate in phase 1 Provinces then stabilized at
levels in the range of 0.4-0.6 percent. In phase two, the rejection level was slightly more stable
than in the first phase. The rate of rejection is evidently very small and is reflected in the very
small level of financial adjustments made to beneficiary enrollment payments. It should be noted
however that these adjustments are based on database verification and not field verification.

VERIFICATION RESULTS ON TRACERS

The verification of tracer indicators determines the degree of achievement for the tracers. This
degree of achievement is a percentage applied on the 40 percent of capitation payment to
determine transfers. The third party verifier assesses the achievements of the Provinces for each
of the ten indicators against their declared figures. In the instance that the third party verifier
deems certain patient records not to meet the required criteria13 for a particular indicator, those
records are rejected. These rejected records will reduce proportionally the amount received by the
Provinces. This adjustment of the amount received by Provinces has amounted to 11.5 percent of
total tracer payments over eight years (see table 10).

For the purpose of this study, the authors processed and standardized information provided by the
Plan in order to analyze the first and second phases together. As a result, for each four month
period, the tracer achievement percentage declared by Provinces and the percentage determined
through the third party verifier assessment were calculated. Figure 4 shows the percentage of
declared records (that is, records which the Provinces state meet the criteria for a tracer) which
are then rejected by the third party verifier. Ideally there would be no difference between the
declarations made by the Provinces and the assessment of the third party verifier. The graph
below shows the rejection rate started at 25 percent in 2005, and slowly decreased, albeit not in a
smooth progression, towards 5 percent.

The following two tables 8 and 9 are based on data from all Provinces from the second trimester
of 2008 up to the second trimester of 2012. Taking all the tracers for all Provinces and all
trimesters between 2008 and 2012 together as the universe of results, table 8 shows that of the
total number of tracers declared, a significant proportion showed a greater than 20 percent
difference between declared and verified, whereas a relatively small proportion showed a greater
than 40 percent difference between declared and verified. This shows that whilst declared results
are sometimes erroneous, the majority of declared results are relatively accurate. The value of
third party verification is though proven to be valuable. As can be seen from table 8 as well, the
incidence of error rates varies by indicator.

Note: Some tracers have incurred higher error rates due to tracer-specific challenges. For example, tracer
IX has incurred high error rates due to the absence or incompleteness of clinical record and registers.
Efforts have been made to reduce error rates over time, including through improving data recording.

Table 9 shows how often the achievement of a Province for one tracer was downgraded by one
tier following verification by the third party verifier. That is to say, for example, that a Province,
following third party verification, would have been downgraded from the tier which pays between 3
and 4 percent of the capitation payment, down to the tier which pays between 2 and 3 percent of
the capitation payment. Again the table shows that there is significant variation across tracers.

Note: This table calculates the difference between the payment for each indicator based on declared
coverage, and the payment based on verified coverage. Where the difference in payment is 1 percent or
greater (out of a possible 4 percent per indicator), it is assumed the achievement dropped a tier .


The verification process involves many actors and each of them can make adjustments both
related to beneficiary enrollment and to tracer indicator achievement. For example, after
adjustments in payments in the Capitation Department over the official declaration of a Province,
there can be further adjustments made by other departments of the UEC or by the third party
verifier, for achievements that originated in the previous periods (because the third party verifier
verifies post-payment). The adjustments are communicated to the Provinces, which may appeal
and settle the matter with the authorities of the UEC.

Most of the adjustments assessed in the field pertain to tracers. In this respect it is important to
remember that the determination of errors done by the third party verifier is based on a sample.
However, the error percentage determined on this sample is then used to determine the
Provinceâs achievement rate for that indicator. This estimation takes into account a confidence
interval calculated based on the parameters with which the corresponding sample was designed.

ADJUSTMENTS AND FINES BASED ON VERIFICATION

The Operational Manual of the program includes a set of situations that, if identified, trigger
adjustments and penalties to the capitation payments made to the Provinces. In case of serious
breaches, the contract with a Province can be suspended or terminated. Suspensions of transfers
have been rare (and all related to non-contribution of Provinces to the joint funding of the Plan,
rather than for RBF-related reasons) and no contracts have been terminated.

The usual processes of supervision and verification by the UEC and the third party verifier have
led to the application of adjustments and fines enumerated in the Operational Manual, as well as
actions that may arise from verification findings, both from internal parties and the third party
verifier. Table 10 presents a summary of the total adjustments over the project.

    The above table reflects a number of interesting features:

         ï§     Fines and adjustments represent 5.9 percent of gross transfers recorded from 2004 to
               June 2012.
         ï§     The majority of adjustments are related to tracer payments accounting for US$8.3 million
               versus US$2.75 million for beneficiary enrollment adjustments.
         ï§     The majority of the adjustments followed third party verifier assessments and, within
               them, most are based on findings from the field.

    SAMPLING

    The work of the third party verifier is centered around issuing an opinion on main fiduciary risks of
    the Plan. In this context, the methodology developed by the third party verifier ensures oversight of
    the major financial bodies of the project.

    Once the information systems had been sufficiently tested, the main sources of audit findings
    were the third party verifier field work. The process of verification for the third party verifier
    involves three types of samples:


    31
     ï§   Samples of enrollment forms: These are the samples that are drawn bimonthly from
         the beneficiary roster. The third party verifier verifies the consistency of the information
         and the compliance with certain formalities such as the beneficiary signature in the
         application form.
     ï§   Samples of tracer achievement information: A representative sample is taken for each
         Province and for each tracer from the provincial level records to determine the degree of
         achievement against the target set for the tracer. Sample selection takes into account the
         geographical areas and health facilities that present and contribute to the highest volume
         of records (thereby constituting risk-based sampling).
     ï§   Samples of services billed by providers to the UGSP: In each Province a sample of
         services billed by the providers is checked.

From a financial point of view, the most important sample is the one linked to the completion of
results, that is, the sample of tracer information. While the other two samples generate findings
exclusively from cases encountered and are more related to ensuring administrative requirements
and appropriate use of funds, samples of tracer information are used to estimate overall
achievement rates. The following points relate to this last type of sample.

The firms base their professional opinion on a sample with a size and distribution that makes their
opinions technically sustainable, but that are also financially and logistically optimal for the third
party verifier (the more facilities are seen, the more expensive and logistically challenging the
verification exercise becomes). By contrast, from the standpoint of the authorities of the Plan, to
ensure adequate oversight and accurate reporting, it is important to maintain on all health facilities
a credible threat of verification, and hence of sanction or adjustment should the clinics misreport
on their achievements. In other words, it is important for the authorities of the Plan that all health
facilities be included in the sampling frame used by the third party verifier, even if not all facilities
may end up in the sample drawn from that sampling frame.

Determining the optimal sample implies an economic calculus that considers items such as the
number of clinics to visit, the distance from the clinic to the CEAÂ´s headquarters, or the number of
records that each clinic reports. Until now, the fiduciary framework has let the third party verifier
with a certain level of freedom in how the sample of health facilities is determined to ensure the
independence of its opinion. However, the TOR does require a minimum of
accuracy/representativeness. The methodological criteria used for deciding on the sample are the
same in each province â however, the size of the sample is different in each case. Based on the
experience of a third party verifier in 2011, samples highlighted the following: (i) the number of
visits to clinics represented 15.1 percent of the total number of clinics that reported production; (ii)
the number of different clinics visited represented 10 percent of the total number of clinics that
reported production; and (iii) the estimated distance from the clinics involved in the samples to
CEAÂ´s headquarters represented 9.5 percent of the distance required to visit all the clinics that
reported production. This data implies that it is possible some remote, small health facilities may
not be included in the sampling frame. As a result, the fiduciary responsibility of those facilities
may be diluted, since they may never be subject to the verification of tracer achievement.

Improving the information system so that verification can be done by the third party verifier without
physically reaching all facilities could be one way to increase the fiduciary responsibility of all
facilities, at an affordable cost. In addition, this point highlights that the role and responsibility of
the provinces, as opposed to the UEC, in ensuring accurate results by health facilities may still be
a question for the program to explore further.

DISSEMINATION PROCESS

Once they have been internally validated by the UEC, the reports of the third party verifier and the
UEC Supervision Department are sent to the respective Provinces for their acknowledgement,
with an opportunity provided to discuss the results. The reports are also sent to the AGN that


32
performs an annual ex-post review of the main fiduciary aspects of the Plan, as well as its general
evaluation. There is generally no additional dissemination of the information contained in the
reports.


                   COST OF THE THIRD PARTY VERIFIER

To analyze the costs of the third party verifier, several elements could be considered that can
serve as general parameters in this work. It should be considered that so far four firms have been
contracted by the Plan to carry out the third party verification. These are Crowe Horwath, Price
Waterhouse, PKF and BÃ©rtora. The first one has the most years of experience. It is also the only
one that audited both phases of the program. The contractual values of the selected firms are
described in Table 11.

The total cost is related to the length (in months) of the contract and the number of Provinces
audited. An appropriate measuring unit is the cost per Province or per month of contract. One
reason for that is that the verification tasks did not involve any notable differences in personnel
assigned to the Provinces (perhaps with the exception of the Province of Buenos Aires which is
significantly higher than the rest), considering that the sample sizes are relatively similar. Based
on the average value of the contracts it can be concluded that the average cost per Province and
per month is in the range of $12,332 dollars, and the amount is very similar for both phases of the
Plan.




34
There is one additional variable that could influence the cost: the dispersion of field samples. In
this respect there are significant differences across Provinces (for example, more dispersed
populations in Southern Provinces). However, because samples are usually drawn from relatively
dense Province areas, there does not appear to be a significant cost difference among Provinces.

The last element to consider with regard to bidding is that the bidders face a two-year agreement,
which in Argentina carries a macroeconomic risk. Consequently, the bids are expressed in US
dollars, but during the analyzed period the exchange rate grew at a lower rate than that of the
salaries. Assuming that bidders make some allowance for the expectations they have at the time
of signing, the values are possibly somewhat distorted. The costs of the contracts are financed by
the Project; there is a special budget line for this with the understanding that the verification
process is a transactional cost inherent to the RBF approach.

The composition of the verification teams could also affect the cost. A typical team consists of a
socio-accountant, a medical manager, an accounting manager, medical professionals,
accountants, assistants, and an information systems staff member, as presented in table 12.

Note: in the case of the Buenos Aires Province, there are 2 or 3 staffers for each category

In quantitative terms, this structure requires approximately 310 consultancy hours per Province
per month. However, the contract for Phase 2 which included Buenos Aires, required 350 hours.

Freight and transportation costs, which depend on the dispersion of the samples, fall at an
estimated 12-15 percent of the total contract cost.14 Plan NacerÂ´s management requires high
quality information which means accepting higher transaction costs. Among these costs are those
associated with the third party verifier. When comparing the total amount of the third party verifier
contracts with the amount of the subcomponent corresponding to the RBF payment (consisting of
the capitation amount of Component 1 of the project), it appears that this amount represents 6.69
percent of the total.

The third party verifier tasks involve some indirect costs for the necessary involvement of UEC
staff. It is highly difficult to estimate these costs and separate operational management tasks for
specific departments of the Plan. However there is an allocation of eight accountants in the
Supervision department, four people in the medical field, four people in the Capitation department,
one in the Operations department, and finally the Legal department has three lawyers. The time
allocation of this staff is variable. All are involved for one to two weeks every two months to review
the reports of the third party verifier. Supervisory staff also has a continuous task of developing its
management supervision plan, which implies devoting half of the time in the field and the rest in
the offices of the Plan. Medical staff is strongly involved in field tasks, but dedicate their time to
developing best practices to improve service quality.



                           SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Plan Nacer has been developing since 2004, with a strong focus on continuous improvement. It
was never regarded as a static, finished product but as a constantly evolving project. This
evolution has been fairly natural as different actors keep adapting to the changes that occur.

This sense of evolution can be seen in small adjustments to the regulations, which were always
intended to be few, clear and accomplishable. This resulted in various actors adapting their
procedures and behaviors to these regulations.

This organizational environment led to the development of a dynamic integration of operational
and supervision/oversight roles and procedures.

From the operational point of view, the Capitation and Operations department bear the biggest
responsibility, as they are involved in receiving documentation from the Provinces that triggers the
process of payment, verifying the information through the available means, making appropriate
adjustments, and processing the respective payments.

On the other hand, the supervision, oversight, verification and counter-verification processes are
to be found primarily in the Supervision department and in the third party verifier, the Concurrent
External Audit. A third party audit in a classical sense is the one made annually by the National
General Auditor.

There are some observations that could be considered key to the performance of the verification
processes in the Plan:

     ï§   The regulatory framework of the Plan displays strong internal consistency between
         regulation, structure, information system and the verification framework.
     ï§   Verification processes started out with a certain degree of overlap, to later become more
         specialized in terms of supervisory tasks, which in turn helped the actors to better
         understand these processes.




36
     ï§   The smooth interaction of operational and monitoring processes generated stability in the
         processes that facilitated the incorporation of the concurrent work of the third party
         verifier.

There are several important points regarding Plan Nacer:

     ï§   The Plan aims to create an environment that ensures the trust of all the stakeholders by
         having clear, simple and achievable rules.
     ï§   Some overlap in the processes carried out by the Supervision department in charge of the
         programâs internal oversight and those carried out by the third party verifier were built in
         from the beginning. This overlap was useful to complete and standardize processes and
         procedures, for staff training and for better management of the contract with the
         verification agent. Once processes were clearly established, the overlap was reduced
         over time, generating a functional specialization, which leads to less redundancy and
         more efficient processes.
     ï§   Likewise, these processes were designed with a focus on operational monitoring. This
         meant that while verification happens after the fact, it is done shortly after the results and
         processes have occurred, which allows more accurate and effective corrections to be
         made. In line with this focus, an auditor (the third party verifier) was contracted to fulfill
         their role concurrently.
     ï§   After eight years of evolution, Plan Nacer has developed processes and procedures with
         a high level of sophistication and formalization, particularly those related to measuring
         results. Those processes are now documented and described in several procedural
         manuals. Also, payment processes are ISO 9001 certified.

As an institution of the project, the third party verifier has played a very important role. It has
contributed positively to Plan Nacer in a number of ways:

         ï§   By helping create an environment for oversight of the Provinces;
         ï§   By acting as a mediator to settle differences between the actors, namely between the
             National Government and the Provinces;
         ï§   By contributing to the improvement of the standards of Plan Nacer, ensuring that
             reporting errors, both unintentional and intentional, are corrected;
         ï§   By providing inputs to the management of the Plan, through the Coordination unit of
             the program;
         ï§   By identifying 70 percent of adjustments and penalties, this has equaled about 37
             million pesos from the beginning of the plan until June 2012.

The third party verifier has two features that are relevant and somewhat contradictory for a classic
auditor. First, it is "Concurrent" which puts it very close to the management and translates into
engaging in some operational processes such as determining adjustments and penalties. Second,
its independence as a third party forces it to distance itself from the other actors. The desired
balance would be to remain close enough for management to develop a profound understanding
and distant enough to be credible as an independent opinion in case of conflict.

The above issue presents a challenge for firms that are hired by the Plan, as they are generally
accustomed to a strict role of audit firms. It is also a challenge for the authorities of Plan Nacer,
who must maintain a climate of control and ensure balance between involvement in management
and an independent opinion. This balance can evolve over time, as the verification objectives
themselves evolve along the spectrum of control or fiduciary responsibility on the one hand, and
supervision and system strengthening support on the other hand.

After an international competitive bidding process, the winning third party verification firms are
contracted for two years, with the option of an extension for another year. The changes of the
verification firms are often accompanied by periods of increased demand for additional UEC
support as companies that are new to the Plan have to make significant efforts to assimilate the



37
internal logic of their processes to the audits. The benefits of change are linked to the possibility of
an unwanted strengthening of the bond between the third party verifier and the Provinces.
However, this benefit should be weighed against the costs generated by the changes.

The ToR has been evolving during the eight years of management. However there has been no
substantial change in terms of the objectives and scope of the specific tasks, as well as the
overall focus, which has always been on issuing a professional opinion on the aspects that have
fiduciary consequences.

The third party verifier's views are presented as a report package that includes, for each Province,
an Opinion Report and an Internal Verification Report. The first one focuses on the assessment of
the most relevant procedures in terms of fiduciary impact and includes the findings and
recommendations of the analysis of: (i) the beneficiaryâs roster, (ii) tracersâ target achievement,
(iii) capitation payments to Provinces based on (i) and (ii), and (iv) use of funds by the Provinces.
The second one is a more detailed analysis of the said issues and it includes a review of the
supervision environment, the structure and operation of the UGSP and other aspects of
compliance of the project.

Tasks are executed partially at headquarters and more substantially in the field.

One aspect of the responsibilities of the third party verifier that is perceived as a challenge for the
authorities of the Plan is the size, distribution and method of selection of the samples for field
verification of the Tracers. The authorities of the Plan would prefer that the third party verifier
generates a large and widely distributed sample of providers, for example by ensuring that in each
Province all the providers are visited. The firms design their samples in accordance with their own
criteria and evaluation of risks, and they look for the level of representation that will allow them to
issue and sustain an opinion required by the ToR while containing costs and limiting logistical
challenges.

This issue can be analyzed from different angles:

     ï§   The objectives and scope of the tasks: a larger sample (in terms of territorial coverage)
         would likely not have a significant impact on the opinions issued by the auditors.
         Nonetheless, it would probably have an impact on the management and governance of
         the Plan for several reasons: (i) there would be more detailed information at the micro
         level; (ii) it expands the scope of the supervision in the network of providers; and (iii) it
         supports Provinces in performing the audit tasks (which is their responsibility).
     ï§   The cost of services: Obviously a larger and more dispersed sample would increase
         costs, and for this reason there should be a cost-benefit analysis before the decision to
         expand the objectives of the third party verifier is made. Based on the information from
         the third party verifier for phase two in 2011, this study has determined that: (i) audit visits
         were made to 10 percent of providers who reported an average of 1.5 visits per site per
         year; (ii) distance covered during these visits is about 10 percent of what would be
         covered while visiting all the sites once in one year.

To address this tension between what is adequate to produce a professional opinion and what is
desired for supervisory and capacity building information, several solutions are possible
depending on where the Plan aims to be positioned along the spectrum of control or fiduciary
responsibility on the one hand, and supervision and system strengthening support on the other
hand. Proposed solutions are the following: (i) there should be a change in the ToR of the third
party verifier to specify sampling requirements, or (ii) at least a portion of the third party verifier
contract should include a variable fee adjustable for different sample sizes, or (iii) the central
government should contract a different type of firm, with a health background and focus rather
than a traditional financial audit focus, that might be better able to adjust to the concurrent
supervisory aspects of the contract. In either case, it might be appropriate to evaluate another
approach to the problem: since the performance verification is an inherent responsibility of the



38
Provinces, one way to strengthen their role would be to let the third party verification firm oversee
the Auditing Plan developed by each Province and then let the Provinces carry out the work.

Costs associated with the third party verifier are not inconsequential compared to the capitation
payments (6.69 percent). However, this analysis should take into account externalities that have
occurred, such as improvement in clinic records, the availability of verified data, and the
enhancement of a culture of oversight. The average cost of the third party verifier is approximately
$ 12,332 per Province, per month, and it is estimated that the working hours fall between 310 and
350 hours per Province and per month. It is also estimated that the reimbursable costs (freight
and transportation) represent between 12 and 15 percent of the contracts amount.

The possible ways of reducing the costs are the following:

     ï§   The limitation of the scope of work of the third party verifier . One possibility is for the
         audit to focus exclusively on aspects related to the transfer of funds, that is, results
         indicators. This would mean that the third party verifier would have to provide only the
         results of the so-called Opinion Report, and leave out the Internal Verification Report. The
         arguments in favor are the following: (i) verification of services does not generate
         significant financial impact and responds to a supervision responsibility of the Province;
         (ii) some tests carried out by the third party verifier in the Provinces relate to activities that
         repeat every two months and do not result in large adjustments. The information is
         generally used by the UEC for supervisory functions in its interactions with the Provinces
         and the tasks may be better suited to one of the departments of the UEC.
     ï§   The simplification and updating of the standards to concentrate on certain key
         accomplishments. The rules still include certain requirements (reflected in the ToR and
         reports of the third party verifier) that were relevant at the time of early implementation of
         the Plan (for example, some aspects of the compliance with the agreed framework).
         These requirements may no longer be necessary.
     ï§   Reducing the requirements pertaining to the qualifications of auditors. Strictly
         speaking, the task of auditing does not necessarily require the presence of a medical
         doctor, as it is about data quality checks and record quality. Other specialists could
         perform this task. Allowing flexibility in hiring could allow firms to more efficiently choose
         who is needed to complete tasks. However, it should be noted that, according to the
         personnel of the consulted companies, relaxing requirements may not be helpful or
         cheaper. That said, there is a strong moral imperative to ensure patient confidentiality
         when conducting verification involving either patient contact or review of patient records.
     ï§   Further development of information systems. As the information systems mature and
         develop, the monitoring and supervision activities change their orientation, scope, and
         possible cost. The strengthening of information systems related to clinical information in
         specific Provinces and management processes of the Plan is one of the biggest
         challenges to be faced in the future that will certainly affect verification practices.

Verification in results-based financing (RBF) mechanisms is one of the key differentiators between it and
related health financing structures such as social health insurance. Verifying that providers have achieved
reported performance in RBF mechanisms is considered a crucial part of program implementation and
key to maintaining trust through transparency, as well as the viability of the mechanism. Verification is
however a process which has thus far been little studied. Information on the methodologies used in
different settings (including frequency and sampling methodology), the effectiveness of the verification
process, the direct and tangential effects, and the cost is scarce. Plan Nacer employs one of the largest
RBF mechanisms in the world and is therefore an excellent case study for the role, methodology and
effects of the verification process. This study will give the background to Plan Nacer, detail the major
characteristics of the verification process and draw lessons on the process which can inform the design of
verification in RBF mechanisms in other countries.
