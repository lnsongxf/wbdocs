    pattern shown in Figure 3 remains even after other factors that are likely to have influenced
    household education spending (e.g. levels of household income) are controlled for. Moreover,
    drops in household education spending directly after the introduction of the BOS program
    were relatively larger for the poorest 20 percent of households in Indonesia. The analysis
    contained in the report also reveals that declines were largely confined to government schools
    where the program was more strongly associated with reducing the cost burden of sending
    children to school.
    Household education spending trends at senior secondary did not follow the same
    pattern which provides some evidence to suggest that BOS reduced costs for at least
    some households. In the immediate period after the introduction of BOS household
    education spending per senior secondary school student continued to increase. This stands

    only one measure of the potential effect of BOS on school participation. The program was
    expected to improve the chances of all children completing the full nine years of compulsory
    education by improving transition rates between primary and junior secondary education.
    Transition rates of this kind have indeed increased since the introduction of BOS and have
    followed a similar trend to the enrolment rates shown in Figure 4. However, further analysis
    shows that the introduction of the BOS program and subsequent increases in its level were
    not associated with jumps in transition rates.

         •	   Use the BOS formula to provide more funding to schools serving poor and vulnerable                                           The central government could also consolidate more of its funding into the BOS
              children. Schools serving poor and disadvantaged students need additional support                                            program and provide a greater share of funds directly to schools. Alternatively, formula

                                                                                                                                           funding to schools on basis of a single formula. Given its initial success it is perhaps timely to
              Existing guidelines on BOS allow schools to cover the education costs of poor
                                                                                                                                           explore how the program and the mechanisms it has introduced for allocating and managing
              households. However, large cash transfer programs (e.g. Kartu Indonesia Pintar)
                                                                                                                                           resources can be adapted to make an even bigger contribution to improving education

                                                                                                                                           outcomes in Indonesia.
              programs require strengthening, they should be the principal way of reducing the
              direct costs of schooling.
     3.	 Improve coordination of BOS with other school funding
         •	   Clarify school fee and contribution policy. Despite government efforts to provide
              clear guidelines, survey data reveal that fees and charges continue to represent
              a significant proportion of ‘out-of-pocket’ expenses. Efforts to clarify the rules
              governing voluntary contributions to schools should continue and consideration
              should be made to strengthening the role of school committees in managing the
              level of contributions. Regulations should also be clearly communicated to parents
              and other stakeholders.
         •	   Coordinate more closely with local governments. Many local governments also run
              school grant programs to support school operating expenses beyond basic BOS
              funding. It is important that these funds are used to raise overall school standards
              beyond the level provided by BOS.
     4.	 Revitalize the role of the BOS program in empowering schools and local
         communities.
         •	   Strengthen school committees. Strengthening school-level management of the
              funds to improve their effectiveness is vital. Strengthening the role of the school
              committee by for example, transferring responsibilities of the BOS team to the
              committee and ensuring better representation in the committee have the potential
              to significantly improve the effectiveness of BOS funds.
     The introduction of BOS type programs in ECED, senior secondary and tertiary
     education is testament to the success of the BOS program. In the nearly 10 years it has
     been running it has established itself as a program that is able to deliver resources to schools
     on a regular and timely basis. It is popular amongst parents and is becoming increasingly
     well known.
     Other countries having successfully established school grant programs and their
     financing mechanisms have further developed them to address other education
     challenges. For example, programs of this kind have been used to consolidate the different
     channels of funding schools receive. In particular, other countries have included teacher
     salary costs in funding formula which has contributed to better spending efficiency.
     As the report shows, Indonesia suffers from significant budget fragmentation in
     its school financing system which contributes to the large and growing spending
     inefficiencies. Consolidating a larger share of their budgetary resources, and in particular
     teacher remuneration, into BOS type formulas could be useful for local governments striving
     to improve spending efficiency and sustainability.

         The definition of school grants, used in this report are funds that are provided to schools and which are spent by
         authorities at the school level. Schools must have an element of discretion over the use of these funds to qualify
         as grants. Grants are usually from public sources and exclude school income from fees and contributions by
         parents and the local community.

     The size of per-student allocations in the BOS program have been calculated on the basis of
     studies to determine the operational expenditure needs of schools as well as the availability
     of the budget. At the outset, per-student allocations to the BOS program were considerably                                                                                 District, provinces and central BOS teams reconcile data and

     2006, the value of per-student amounts were adjusted on the basis of a school survey that
     was designed to determine average school operating costs (Ghozali 2005; Arze del Granado,                                                                                     Basis of disbursment and distribution to each province:

     1.5 Summary
     This chapter has highlighted the significant reforms that have occurred in the Indonesian
     education sector over the last 10 years. The BOS program has been a central component of
     this overall agenda and has provided vital funding for school improvement and to support
     the necessary changes to their management that these reforms have demanded. The large
     share of the budget the program absorbs and its coverage of approximately 220,000 schools
     is testament to its importance to the reform process. The program is designed to contribute to
     the overall objectives of the sector by reducing the costs faced by households in sending their
     children to school and by providing schools with resources to implement better school based
     management. The extent to which the program has supported these ambitious objectives is                                               2.1 Introduction

                                                                                                                                           Schools grants such as the BOS program are meant to increase state funding of schools,
     costs faced by households and improving levels of participation and attainment. Chapter 3

     For example, between 2003 and 2006 average household spending declined by an amount

     Households in the poorest quintile with children in junior secondary school fared somewhat
     better than average households – particularly at the outset. Between 2003 and 2006,                                                                                                  Spending by households with children in senior secondary schools increased marginally
     spending per student for this group fell from IDR 961,742 to IDR 858,113 – a decline of                                                                                              between 2003 and 2012 (Figure 2.6). For households in the poorest quintile there was a
     about 11 percent. However, this reduction did not persist. By 2009 household spending                                                                                                steady increase between 2003 and 2009 followed by a slight fall in 2012. Spending per
     among the lowest quintile was 12 percent higher than in 2006 and by 2012 it was 14                                                                                                   student at the senior secondary school level for households in the poorest quintile was 11
     percent higher than the first year of the BOS program.20 These results are striking given that                                                                                       percent higher in 2006 than in 2003. By 2012, spending at this level was 23 percent higher
     household spending for poor households was increasing at the same time that BOS grants                                                                                               than it had been in 2003.21

     senior secondary school spending provides an opportunity to assess if the patterns in school
     levels covered by BOS differed at all from other levels of the education system. This is not                                                In principle, the BOS program could have reduced household spending on education through
     an ideal comparison group against which to evaluate the BOS program but it is the only                                                      direct financial support to the poorest households. For example, in the beginning, schools

     when looking beyond 2006. Trends in fees after 2006 were similar across different school                                                    regional independent monitoring shows that only a limited amount of the funds were used
     levels which suggest that if there was an effect of the BOS program on fees and charges at the                                              for this purpose (see Figure 3.7). This is corroborated by the slight initial reductions in
     primary and junior secondary school it was relatively weak.                                                                                 transport costs for junior secondary school students in Figure 2.7.
     Over the period 2003-2012, the incidence of fee payment has also been changing. Figure
     2.8 shows the proportion of students reporting the payment of fees in each round for which                                                  2.3 Trends in school participation26
     we have data. It shows that the introduction of BOS in 2005 coincided with a big drop
     in the number of students reporting fee payments.25 These drops are largest for primary                                                     A key objective of the BOS program was to raise participation in basic education particularly
     school followed by junior secondary school. The incidence of fee payment increased again                                                    for the poorest households (see Figure 2.1). Figure 2.9 assesses whether net enrollment rates
     in 2009 before falling again in 2012. The fact that the percentage of students reporting fee                                                changed when BOS was introduced.27 The figure indicates the school year in which BOS
     payments is substantially smaller in 2012 than in 2009 coupled with the fact that average                                                   was introduced as well as subsequent years when its value was raised. The expectation would
     amounts of fees reported are higher in 2012 would suggest that those who do pay fees are                                                    be that these years would result in an increase in primary and junior secondary enrollment
     paying substantially more than they did in 2009. It is possible that that the decline in the                                                rates. In contrast, it would be expected that a different pattern would emerge for senior
     percentage of households that reported paying fees in 2012 is a result of regulations issued                                                secondary schools given that there was no BOS for schools at this level.
     around that time which attempted to outline the contributions schools were allowed to seek
     from parents and contributions that were prohibited (see Box 4.1). This may have resulted in                                                Enrollment rates

     education law outlined the new roles and responsibilities for different levels of government
     and also gave schools significant autonomy over their own affairs. The same law mandated
     the establishment of school committees as a key mechanism to both hold schools accountable
     but to also foster greater participation of parents and the local community in supporting
     their local schools.
     It was not until the introduction of the BOS program that schools received the resource boost
     necessary to execute their new roles and responsibilities. The program not only provided
     needed funding but also stipulated that these funds had to be managed using the newly
     created school based management structures (e.g. school committees) and processes (e.g.
     school improvement planning etc.). In this way the BOS program provided an important
     incentive to schools to adopt school based management. It also underpinned key government
     objectives to raise education participation rates and improve quality (Figure 3.1).
     This chapter reviews the implementation and outcomes of the school based management
     approach in Indonesia and in particular how it has influenced and been influenced by the
     BOS program. The specific focus is on the utilization of funds by the school based agents to
     achieve the objectives of BOS. In order to do this the chapter reviews the existing literature
     and analyzes data from a survey of schools that included a comprehensive survey of 10
     key stakeholders in the SBM process. While the information in the survey is from 2010,
     it is invaluable in providing critical and detailed information on the working of the SBM
     process. Moreover, anecdotal evidence from recent school visits and reviews of other recent

     the quality of decision making is likely to be weaker in schools where decisions are made by

     working effectively it has the potential to improve education outcomes and by consequence
     make better uses of the resources available to schools through BOS. Evidence from other
     countries also points to the relatively long length of time that reforms of this kind take to
     deliver results (Bruns, Filmer et al. 2011). It seems clear that further efforts to reinvigorate
     and strengthen school based management reforms could have significant pay-offs.

        The evaluation found similar results of the different interventions on parental
        participation in school affairs. The study found that meetings and text messages
        increased the overall participation of parents in schools but in different ways. The
        effect of school meetings seemed to be largely limited to increases in parental visits to
        schools - a result in part of the school meeting itself. The text messages appeared to
        increase direct communication between parents and the schools through, for example,
        direct interactions between parents, the principal and the school committee.

     populations decreased, the number of schools and teachers remained unchanged because                                                  References
     decisions on the allocation of public resources were input-based. This reduced the efficiency
     of public education spending and led to significant imbalances in funding across regions. In
     response, a number of countries introduced school funding formula that covered the bulk
     of education funding (e.g. including teacher salaries) and were allocated mainly on the basis
     of the number of students or the size of the school age population. This had the effect of
     increasing allocations to urban areas that were experiencing rapid population growth and
     less to rural areas with declining populations. (Alonso and Sanchez 2011). The introduction
     of formulas of this kind also meant that efficiency gains were maintained without the need
     for one-off adjustments to allocations that were frequently difficult to achieve and politically
     costly.                                                                                                                               ACDP (2013). Analysis of School Operational Funds.
