         TURNING CHALLENGES INTO OPPORTUNITIES FOR POVERTY REDUCTION AND
                                INCLUSIVE GROWTH

                                                               EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

COUNTRY CONTEXT

1. Guinea-Bissau is fighting a battle against poverty, low growth, and political fragility.
Each of these areas presents both a formidable challenge as well as an opportunity for
serious, long-lasting and much-needed change. With a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita
of US$570, Guinea-Bissau is the 12th poorest country in the world. Gross domestic product (GDP)
growth averaged a mere 0.4 percent between 2000 and 2014, a rate that is symptomatic of a
stagnating economy; this is roughly one-quarter the average performance of Sub-Saharan Africa
(1.9 percent). The economy is dominated by agriculture, accounting for over 40 percent of GDP
and employing about 80 percent of workers, high by regional standards. The production and export
of raw cashews nuts constitute the main source of income for more than two thirds of the
households (and for virtually all small farmers) and represent over 85 percent of the country’s total
export earnings. Little productivity growth across all sectors and low (public and private) savings
and investment have undermined growth potential. The economy is characterized by a dual
vulnerability to external developments stemming from a high dependence on a single export and
a high susceptibility to international price shocks. Additionally, frequent bouts of political
instability and shocks associated with adverse weather conditions impose large costs on economic
and social development in the country.

2. Poverty is entrenched, inequality is high and other human development outcomes are
weak with many of the key indicators worsening over time. In 2010, over two-thirds (67.1
percent) of the population survived on less than US$1.9 per day (2011 PPP), which is well above
the poverty rate in other Sub-Saharan African countries (42.7 percent) and noticeably high by
global standards.1 Additionally, poverty rose between 2002 and 2010, especially the extreme
poverty rate. At 0.50, the Gini coefficient indicates that inequality in Guinea-Bissau is high, even
in comparison to African and overall low-income country standards, and has worsened over time.
Guinea-Bissau ranks 177th of 187 countries on the United Nations (UN) Human Development
Index. The majority of the population, particularly the poor, have limited access to basic goods
and services that directly influence the well-being of households. Consequently, a substantial
number of households are trapped in a vicious cycle of low assets, low productivity, and low
incomes.

3. Fragility is intrinsically linked to low growth and lack of inclusiveness. After
independence in 1974, local elites quickly filled the power vacuum. The absence of strong local
institutions meant that elites competed to capture the limited rents available, a feature which is still
present in the country, leading to the constant threat of political upheaval. Over time there have

  See Annex 1A1 for a detailed discussion on the benchmarking exercise conducted for this report. The benchmarking methodology creates an
algorithm to compare Guinea-Bissau against two groups of peers; its neighbors in sub-Saharan Africa and the world. Within these two groups,
Guinea-Bissau is then benchmarked against the group’s best performer, considering a normalized range within the sample of data for each indicator.



                                                                       xi
been several coup attempts including four realized, the highest number in the world. Instability has
led to a weak State and institutions. Guinea-Bissau scores in the bottom 10th percentile on all
indicators measuring public sector capacity in the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicator
(WGI). Weak governance and elite capture have, in turn, created a patchy social compact, leading
to weak provision of basic public goods and services, limited economic opportunities for the
private sector and perversion of justice. Public sector management is also dysfunctional; public
administration is undermined by a large bureaucracy, notably the overrepresentation of the
military. Public institutions are geared toward providing private goods to elites—political and
military—rather than public goods to citizens. Of course, instability has also been costly for the
country. The most recent coup-imposed government mismanaged the 2012 and 2013 cashew
campaigns, oversaw an increase in smuggling of natural resources, the suspension of donor
programs, and halted public investment, which cut current expenditures and increased arrears.
The economy contracted by 1.8 percent in 2012 and barely recovered in 2013, growing at 0.8
percent.

4. Nonetheless, the country has potential for unlocking income-generating opportunities
for growth. Much of the country’s rich endowment of natural capital comprising pristine national
parks, forests, vast agricultural land, fisheries, as well as unexplored mineral fields, remain
untapped. This is in spite of the of the country’s advantageous geographical location which is
conducive to maritime and inland waterway transport and trade. Agriculture, albeit pervasive, is
mostly done through extensive subsistence farming, with little infusion of productivity-enhancing
techniques and technologies. As a result, agricultural products are sold unprocessed. Much of the
economy is not monetized, based instead on bartering, which may hamper incentives to exploit
income-generating opportunities. The development of human and physical capital in agriculture
can help farmers enter higher-value markets providing much needed boosts to the current cashew
market and other cash crops, including revitalizing the tattered rice sector. Similarly, the
development of landing capabilities and appropriate gear for fishermen can go a long way in
bolstering value added in the fisheries sector. The extractive industry is small, with a large potential
for the extraction of minerals such as bauxite and phosphates. There are also opportunities for
timber production, processing and export. Additionally, the country’s vast biodiversity is yet
another underused source of high-value international tourism. Lastly, addressing deficiencies in
the current system of land rights and titling should improve households’ investment decisions
inside and outside of the cashew sector. The central government’s commitment is very important
for this potential to flourish. Following elections in 2014, Guinea-Bissau released a strategy called
Terra Ranca, which proposed investments in human development, infrastructure, business
environment, urban development, biodiversity and natural capital, with an overarching theme of
peace and governance.

5.      The diagnostics framework of this Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) is based on
three interrelated themes: inclusiveness of growth, overall economic growth and macro
context, and sustainability risks, including the overarching issue of fragility. Broadly
speaking, these three closely intertwined core building blocks lay at the foundations for inadequate
levels of income and consumption in the population: 1) the inclusiveness of the economy (micro-
determinants of household welfare), namely the availability of equitable opportunities, through
asset accumulation and utilization, for all members of the society to contribute to and benefit from
economic growth; 2) robust and sustained economic growth and cross-cutting economic services,


                                                  xii
and fair, transparent and efficient governance and economic institutions; and 3) economic, social,
political and environmental risks for the sustainability of the process of growth, distribution and
poverty reduction (Figure 1.2). At the micro level, the inclusiveness of the economy is assessed by
the assets households own, the intensity with which they are utilized and their returns. At the macro
level, raising household incomes requires an enabling economic and institutional environment.
The sustainability element examines whether the current economic, political, social and ecological
systems and processes are dynamically sustainable in the medium and long term. Finally, as a
cross-cutting theme, fragility and weak governance are considered and addressed at each step of
the development process in Guinea-Bissau.

TRENDS IN POVERTY AND SHARED PROSPERITY

6. Poverty in Guinea Bissau is high and increased between 2002 and 2010, in particular the
rate of extreme poverty. Nearly 1.2 million people (69.4 percent) were poor in 2010. One third
of the population (33.1 percent) lived in extreme poverty, surviving on under US$1 per adult
equivalent per day (national extreme poverty line). Both absolute and extreme poverty rose
between 2002 and 2010, the former by 3.7 percentage points and the latter by 11.5 percentage
points. Rural standards of living are considerably lower than those in the capital, Bissau, reflecting
lower rural human capital and low agricultural productivity. The difference in standard of living
in rural and urban areas has widened over time. This has been accompanied by a similar shift over
time toward employment in agriculture, further emphasizing the link between a sector plagued by
low productivity and higher poverty rates. The higher levels of poverty seen outside of Bissau are
further compounded by multiple deprivations in non-monetary dimensions, such as access to basic
and social services, human capital, and levels of public infrastructure.

7. While the poor in Guinea-Bissau experience multiple deprivations, the extreme poor are
further disadvantaged when compared even with the moderate poor. Household size among
the extreme poor is substantially larger—on average over two more members- partly driven by a
higher number of children which increases the dependency ratios (Table 2.1). School attainment—
proxied by literacy rates and primary education for the head of household—is also lower. The
extreme poor also have fewer household assets. Compared to the rest of the poor, their incomes
are not only lower but also less diversified as nearly 90 percent of the extreme poor are employed
in agriculture. When it comes to connectivity, the extreme poor are significantly more
disadvantaged; on average farther from markets and schools and lacking access to electricity.
General access to services, already low for the population in general, is even more critical for the
extreme poor, with nearly half lacking safe drinking water and four-fifths lacking sanitation.

8. Between 2002 and 2010, consumption growth was on average only positive for the top
10 percent of the population and negative for the remaining households, highlighting poor
households’ limited ability to productively exploit assets. The greater consumption growth is
associated with higher returns to assets for the non-poor, and is tightly linked to the ability of the
elites to more efficiently capture the productive markets in Guinea-Bissau. The poorest of poor
fared worse than the rest of the population since their consumption fell between 5 and 10 percent.
Many other factors contribute to negative consumption growth among the poor, including
significantly lower human capital, higher presence of those households in sectors plagued by low
productivity such as agriculture, as well as a strong rural presence where markets are often non-


                                                 xiii
monetized (i.e. barter), disconnected (due to lack of infrastructure), and operating within a weak
legal framework for land tenure and rights. Poor Bissau-Guinean households not only suffer from
a paucity of human capital and physical assets, but their ability to productively exploit the assets
they do possess is limited, adding another barrier to exiting poverty. The overall low returns to
assets highlight the wide scope of the low-productivity and fragile economy equilibrium that
characterizes Guinea-Bissau.

TAPPING INTO GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES

9.      The reality in Guinea Bissau is one where the country has lost decades without
achieving significant growth and has been underperforming relative to most of its peers since
independence. The economy, which is dependent on the cultivation and export of unprocessed
cashew nuts, has barely grown over the past twenty five years, recording average GDP per capita
growth of about 0.7 percent significantly below peers. In fact, Guinea Bissau is one of the slowest
growing economies in the continent. The country’s inability to break out of the low growth, high
poverty incidence trap can be attributable to its narrow economic base, low human capital and the
absence of fiscal buffers which increases it’s susceptible to shocks (including, but not limited to,
terms of trade and unfavorable political events). There is a strong negative correlation between
Guinea Bissau’s growth performance and political developments. Institutional and political
economy factors are major impediments to strengthening fiscal policy and management of public
finances in the country; existing organizational structures have not supported the required fiscal
discipline.

10.     The main engine of growth, agriculture, is constrained by several bottlenecks.
Productivity in the agriculture remains weak. Major constraints limiting the exploitation of the
existing agricultural potential, include: (i) unclear land rights and poor land management system;
(ii) lack of hydro-agricultural developments; (iii) limited access to inputs and technologies to
support production; (iv) inadequate investment in agricultural research and development (R&D)
and extension; (v) underdeveloped agribusiness value chains with low ratio of food processing to
primary agriculture due to poor infrastructure (logistics, energy, storage, etc.); (vi) a lack of finance
for agriculture; and (vii) unpredictable policy environment and dearth of market information.
Within agriculture, in addition to cashew output, most of Bissau-Guinean products are essentially
raw materials, which means the structure of the economy is concentrated in the first rung of the
value ladder. Almost all of Bissau-Guinean exports are at the fringes of the product space, serving
as raw inputs to more sophisticated value chains in other countries. This limits the ability of the
economy to diversify into other products and create forward and backward linkages with other
sectors. Cashew is the best example of a raw material with considerable potential to add value
through processing. 	

11.      Nonetheless, Guinea Bissau’s persistent low growth does not reflect its potential,
given the country’s abundant natural resources and advantageous geographical location. 
Guinea Bissau possesses opportunities to grow much faster but the key to unlocking this potential
will require action on several fronts including, inter alia, tapping multilateral agencies, regional
institutions West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) and other stakeholders for technical and financial support to
anchor critical interventions, while also introducing initiatives to directly address the underlined


                                                  xiv
weaknesses in the existing business environment and governance framework. The country has the
opportunity to advance its development agenda by expanding its cashew value-chain, capitalizing
on emerging green shoots in agriculture and other sectors by creating the environment for greater
private sector participation in the economy, and by addressing some of the pressing infrastructure
needs of the country. There is great potential in cashew processing, cultivation in rice and a
diversified range of cereal, fruits and tubers. Fisheries and mining are also recognized as possible
engines of growth. In spite of the country’s significant natural beauty, the potential of the tourism
sector remains largely untapped. Moving into higher value added activities in industry and services
will be crucial to achieve the growth rates Guinea-Bissau will require to catch-up with other
countries.

TREADING A FRAGILE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT

12.     Political instability has been continuously hampering economic growth, making
recent efforts to capitalize on periods of stability critical for poverty reduction. Guinea-Bissau
suffers repeated cycles of fragility with negative effects on economic, political and social systems.
This has been induced by competition for power among the political and military elites, and
enabled by weak institutions, meant to govern the country and provide public goods to the
population. The country scores in the bottom 10th percentile on all indicators measuring public
sector capacity in the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicator. Rooted in colonialism and
continued by those who have governed after independence, weak governance has allowed a rentier
economy to fester, effectively diverting much of public resources toward private gains. The main
consequences have been low provision of services, faltering infrastructure, low access to education
and health, and low-level household welfare equilibrium, to the low and unstable growth,
inadequate private sector development, vulnerability to shocks and overall poor macroeconomic
management. Moreover, there is growing consensus among both academics and policymakers that
weak institutional capacity, governance and accountability are important in explaining why
political instability and violence repeats in the same countries or subnational regions (WDR, 2011).

13.     The business environment is skewed towards the interests of the elites, affecting all
sectors and is particularly problematic in cashew production and trade where profits are
concentrated. In Guinea Bissau, the business of the Government is often conducted through
personal networks and political patronage. The tiny private sector remains controlled by few
groups of elites, often political ones. The close-knit nature of this group encourages corruption and
discourages transparency. An important source of rents is found in the agricultural sector,
particularly in the production and export of cashews, where the elite benefits mainly as traders.
Many smallholders do not capture the main benefits of cashew production and trade, and might
benefit from diversifying their activities; nonetheless, they remain in agriculture due to a mix of
low-liquidity, the low-risk nature of cashew cultivation, and the fear of land-grabbing (due to weak
land rights) should they not keep the land busy year-round. Outside of agriculture, appropriation
of budget and external resources through holding public office or being a public servant is another
major source of rents. Likewise, illegal activities, especially around drug trade and illegal fishing
and lumber exports are the third major source of rents in Guinea Bissau. Addressing the generally
weak governance and institutional frameworks which enable elite capture is paramount for
reducing poverty and promoting shared prosperity.

PRIORITIES IN TURNING CHALLENGES TO OPPORTUNITIES

14. The Guinea-Bissau SCD is forward-looking and relies on a prioritization process to
identify main binding constraints to poverty reduction and inclusive growth, and to guide
future engagement with the country. The analysis highlights entry points where policy
intervention can contribute to breaking the current low-welfare, low-growth equilibrium, and the
high-fragility environment in Guinea-Bissau. To address low inclusiveness and low rural
productivity, households need to be propped up by better access to basic services, especially
education, health and water and sanitation. Guinea-Bissau could benefit greatly from more reliable
port, road, and utility infrastructure and which could help to strengthen the value-chain in cashew
and other crops. Shocks can be potentially life threatening to the poor and extreme poor, hence
social protection is another important part of this strategy moving forward. The low and unstable
growth that has plagued the country is partly rooted in a low-equilibrium in its largest sector,
agriculture, and in the undiversified nature of the economy. The cashew economy as central to
agriculture can benefit from investments in developing and expanding its value chain (i.e.
extension services, as well as storage and transportation infrastructure); other crops such as rice
and sectors such as fisheries can also benefit from more investment. Financial inclusion can help
poor households diversify their income by increasing the availability of credit through greater bank
penetration and microfinance opportunities. Governance can be strengthened by improving public
management systems and simplifying bureaucracies, particularly where transparency and
accountability in expenditures are concerned. A more friendly business environment can also be
constructive for the country, including streamlining import/export practices, and beginning to
address property rights issues. Lastly, this SCD cannot overstate the importance of sustained
political stability as a prerequisite to unlocking the country’s limitless potential in many of the
areas explored by this document.

1.1        Guinea-Bissau is rich in natural resources and has opportunities to develop some
           sectors that can ignite growth

1. Guinea-Bissau is a tropical country on West Africa’s Atlantic coast. It has a population
of 1.7 million and possesses rich cultural and religious diversity. Guinea-Bissau shares borders
with Senegal to the North and Guinea-Conakry to the East and South. Much of what is known
about Guinea-Bissau dates back several centuries from its inclusion in the African kingdom of
Mandinka under the Kabu Empire in the 12th century, to its transition to Portuguese rule in the 16th
century, and to its full independence from Portugal in 1973 (recognized in 1974). Today, over 20
ethnicities, multitudes of religions, languages, and cultures are represented in Guinea-Bissau. The
official language, Portuguese, is spoken by less than 20 percent of the population (mostly in the
capital, Bissau), while Creole (a mix of Portuguese and native tongues) is the language spoken by
the vast majority of people. The country has a large Muslim population and a Christian minority,
with several other native African religions intertwined in between. Guinea-Bissau is a member of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) which provides the country access
to regional markets and institutions through the promotion of interstate economic and political
cooperation.2

2. The country has rich biodiversity and ecosystems of both local and global significance.
This natural capital results from the country’s unique geographic position: a coastal country lying
in a transition zone between the Sub-Saharan arid savannah in the northwest, and humid tropical
forest ecosystems in the south, which benefit from substantial rainfall and rivers. This unique
region is characterized by a dense mesh of small river basins, as well as the Bijagos Archipelago.
These areas are home to large diverse ecosystems and habitat habitats, including mangroves,
sandbanks and mudflats, shallow estuarine waters, and sub-humid Guinean forests, all of which
are known to be among the most diverse ecosystems on the West African coast. Inland, in the
south and southeast areas of the country, a forest belt region comprised of dense and open patches
of forest, interspersed with woodland savannahs, also hosts significant biodiversity.

3. Guinea-Bissau has the potential for unlocking currently untapped income-generating
opportunities for growth. Natural-resource-based sectors are already the largest in Guinea-
Bissau, in particular agriculture. Nevertheless, much of the country’s rich endowment of natural
capital, comprising pristine national parks, forests, vast agricultural land, fisheries, as well as
unexplored mineral fields, remain untapped in spite of their advantageous geographical location,
which is conducive to maritime and inland waterway transport and trade. Agriculture, albeit
pervasive, is mostly done through extensive subsistence farming, with little infusion of technology.
Much of the country’s economic activities are based on a system of bartering, which hamper
incentives to exploit income-generating opportunities. Nonetheless, the development of human
and physical capital in agriculture can help farmers enter higher-value markets providing a much
needed boost to the current cashew market and other cash crops, including revitalizing the tattered
rice sector. Similarly, the development of landing capabilities and appropriate gear for fishermen
can go a long way in boosting the value added in the fisheries sector. The extractive industry is

small, with a large potential for the extraction of minerals such as bauxite and phosphates. There
are also opportunities for timber production, processing, and export. Additionally, the country’s
vast biodiversity is yet another underused source of high-value international tourism. Lastly,
addressing deficiencies in the current system of land rights and titling should improve households’
investment decisions inside and outside of the cashew sector.

1.2        Economic growth, poverty reduction, and shared prosperity performance have been
           disappointing

4. Guinea-Bissau has a history of low and volatile economic growth. With a Gross National
Income (GNI) per capita of US$570, Guinea-Bissau is the 12th poorest country in the world.
Between 1990 and 2014, Guinea-Bissau’s real per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) fell by
12.3 percent. GDP growth averaged a mere 0.4 percent between 2000 and 2014, a rate that is
symptomatic of a stagnating economy. This is roughly one-quarter of the average performance of
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (1.9 percent) and is well below the performance of some of the
neighboring countries (1 percent in Senegal, 1.2 percent in Mali, 1.7 percent in Liberia, and 2.6
percent in Burkina Faso). The economy is dominated by agriculture, which accounts for over 40
percent of GDP and employs about 80 percent of workers, considered high by regional standards.
The production and export of raw cashews nuts constitutes the main source of income for more
than two-thirds of the households (and for virtually all small farmers) and represents over 85
percent of the country’s total export earnings. Other agricultural activities include small-scale rice
production and horticulture. Little productivity growth across all sectors and low (public and
private) savings and investment have undermined growth potential. The economy is characterized
by a dual vulnerability to external developments stemming from a high dependence on a single
export and a high susceptibility to international price shocks. Additionally, frequent instances of
political instability, and shocks associated with adverse weather conditions, impose large costs on
economic and social development in the country.  
 
5. Poverty is entrenched, inequality is high, and other human development outcomes are
weak. In 2010, over two-thirds (67.1 percent) of the population survived on less than US$1.9 per
day (2011 purchasing power parity (PPP), which is well above the poverty rate in other Sub-
Saharan African countries (42.7 percent) and noticeably high by global standards.3 Additionally,
poverty rose between 2002 and 2010, especially the extreme poverty rate. At 0.50, the Gini
coefficient indicates that inequality in Guinea-Bissau is high, even in comparison to both African
and overall low-income country standards, and has worsened over time. Guinea-Bissau ranks 177th
of 187 countries on the United Nations (UN) Human Development Index. The majority of the
population, particularly the poor, have limited access to basic goods and services that directly
influence the well-being of households. Consequently, a substantial number of households are
trapped in a vicious cycle of low assets, low productivity, and low incomes.

1.3        A vicious cycle of low assets, low productivity and lack of inclusiveness
 
6. Faster economic growth alone will not be enough to bring significant improvements to
the living standards of most Guineans. The evidence shows that even the modest economic

  See Annex 1A for a detailed discussion on the benchmarking exercise conducted for this report. The benchmarking methodology creates an
algorithm to compare Guinea-Bissau against two groups of peers; its neighbors in sub-Saharan Africa and the world. Within these two groups,
Guinea-Bissau is then benchmarked against the group’s best performer, considering a normalized range within the sample of data for each indicator.



                                                                        3
growth recorded in the 2000s (assuming its distribution was neutral) would have reduced poverty
by over 8 percentage points. Yet, in reality, since growth happened at the top, but consumption fell
for the rest of the income distribution, poverty increased by 3.7 percentage points.

7. Several reinforcing mechanisms exist in Guinea-Bissau that, if unaddressed, will likely
cause poverty and underdevelopment to persist. Most of the population, especially women,
suffers from a paucity of endowments such as human capital, skills, and physical capital. Adults
in the bottom 40 percent complete on average just two years of schooling, life expectancy is below
the average for Sub-Saharan Africa, and most lack secure tenure rights. Inadequate nutrition, and
a large burden of disease of adults and children limits the ability of individuals to work at full
capacity and results in lasting effects across generations. Low access to basic services, such as
clean water, sanitation, and electricity, coupled with failures in critical markets (for example,
credit), poor public infrastructure, and pervasive fragility and natural resource depletion, limits
economic opportunities and reduces returns to endowments differentially. In addition to material
constraints, behavioral traps also appear to play a role because households’ mental resources are
overly focused on short-term basic needs, resulting in forgoing opportunities with higher returns
in the middle and long term. Consequently, most households are stuck with cashew production, a
stable yet low-investment, relatively lower-risk and low-productivity subsistence item. Nearly
seven in ten individuals are below the poverty line, and over half of the population are deemed
chronically poor. In contrast, the better-off population manages to benefit from modest but positive
growth.  
 
1.4   An undiversified and vulnerable economic base and an unfriendly business climate

8. In view of the narrow economic base and low productivity, economic growth is
constrained and largely susceptible to external and internal shocks. The structure of Guinea-
Bissau’s economy has barely changed over the last two decades and remains largely agrarian.
Growth performance is volatile, with the production and export of a single commodity
(unprocessed cashew nuts) being the engine of growth. The production of cashews is concentrated
in the first rung of the value ladder, serving as raw inputs to more sophisticated value chains in
trading-partner economies. The high degree of concentration in one activity and the lack of safety
nets, social insurance, or credit leaves the country subject to occasional trade shocks, harvest
failures, and climatic events, undermining the stability of income of the poor. Increasing
diversification and quality upgrading to levels observed in the WAEMU between 2001 and 2010
could have resulted in an increase in the average real growth rate for Guinea-Bissau by about 1
percentage point (International Monetary Fund (IMF) 2014a). Low and unpredictable public
revenues, regressive and distortionary taxation, and poor quality of public expenditure, a part of
which is related to the size of government, limits the effectiveness and equity of the fiscal policy
to redistribute resources.

9. The potential of the economy to contribute more to output growth and prosperity is
further constrained by a less than accommodating business environment. Guinea-Bissau is
weakly integrated into global agricultural value chains, in particular due to an unfavorable business
environment. The private sector depends heavily on the public sector’s consumption and
investments due to a small domestic market and very few export-oriented sectors. The business
climate is not conducive to the generation of growth, employment, and productive capital. Guinea-
Bissau ranks at the bottom of all the 10 Doing Business indicators. The challenges are


                                                 4
considerable, and range from a poor business and regulatory environment to limited access to
finance, poor infrastructure, low productivity, and relatively high labor costs and political
instability. Another central challenge is the complexity of the import and export environment, with
many stakeholders controlling the port, and much of the institutional authority relying on informal
dealings that decrease transparency, and encourage corruption and clientelism. In fact, Guinea-
Bissau performs below Sub-Saharan Africa with regard to most of these business indicators. The
lack of investments is an important pillar of a vicious circle of low productivity, low growth, lack
of opportunities, and elite capture which then feeds back into low investments, suggesting the
country is trapped in a low-growth equilibrium.  

1.5        Cross-cutting challenges stem from endemic fragility and a weak governance
           framework
 
10.     Guinea-Bissau has a history of political and institutional fragility dating back to its
independence.4 Understanding the country’s fragility requires a look at its colonial period.5 Unlike
other Portuguese colonies, Guinea-Bissau was not considered fit for settlement, and the colonial
administration thus made no significant investments in the country beyond what was required to
extract natural resources. Other than a small local elite, Guineans received virtually no provision
of health care, education, or social services, and were unable to access—much less participate in—
any aspect of the public administration. At the time of independence in 1974, Guinea-Bissau’s
literacy rate was 1 percent, and the country had only 60 kilometers of paved roads. The liberation
war, which was one of the bloodiest on the African continent, did not automatically deliver
improved livelihoods and peace. Instead, Guinea-Bissau has been beset by one experience of
political instability after another, starting in 1980 when the first elected president was ousted in
the country’s first military coup - leading to the peaceful separation of Cabo Verde and Guinea-
Bissau.  
 
11.     Guinea-Bissau is one of the most coup-prone and politically unstable countries in the
world. Four successful coups have been recorded in independent Guinea-Bissau, with another 16
coups attempted, plotted, or alleged.6 Among the previous five chiefs of staff of the armed forces,
three were murdered and one was forcibly exiled by rival officers. In recent years, the army has
arguably become ever more powerful by drawing on financing from the international narcotics
trade, which has led some observers to refer to Guinea-Bissau as Africa’s first ‘narco-state’.
Military coups are just one manifestation of fragility. Frequent government turnover is another.
Between 1999 and 2009, Guinea-Bissau experienced a government turnover each year. This was
as much a consequence of military interference as it was of dismissals of the Government by the
President, a constitutionally admissible process in the country’s semi-presidential polity.  
 
12.     Fragility is largely the result of a rentier economy and the interlinked competition for
rents among the elite. The functioning of product markets, for instance in agriculture, is often
exposed to rent seeking through the weak country’s business regulatory framework. Parts of the
cashew business are controlled by powerful elites, which enjoy market power in the distribution
and export channels. Another common form of rent extraction is the misappropriation and

misallocation of public resources such as taxes, subsidies, funds from schemes created to increase
access to finance and to promote the industrialization of the agricultural sector and wages of public
officials. The appointment of civil servants is often based on patronage and corruption objectives
rather public administration needs or merit. Reviews of the country’s public finance management
system find discrepancies in amounts imported by other countries and exported by Guinea-Bissau
implying potential corrupt practices (i.e. under reporting of exports) between traders and port
officials. The amount of and competition for rents has increased in recent years with the
intensification of the international drug trade, which uses Guinea-Bissau as a transshipment
location. Civilian elites, too, compete for rents, supported by strong clientelist networks, further
entrenching the country’s fragility.

13.      Rent extraction is the consequence (and likely also the cause) of weak public
governance, which ultimately results in a broken social compact. Guinea-Bissau ranks in the
bottom 10th percentile on all indicators measuring public sector capacity in the World Bank’s
Worldwide Governance Indicator (WGI). These institutional weaknesses translate into a weak
public financial management framework manifested in insufficient internal and external controls,
disconnect between the budget and the implementation of government programs and policies, an
outdated tax framework and ineffective tax management. Public administration is undermined by
a large bureaucracy, notably the overrepresentation of the military. Public institutions are geared
toward providing private goods to elites –political and military ones– rather than public goods to
citizens. The broken social contract is reflected in the low provision of basic public goods and
services, limited economic opportunities for the private sector, and perversions of justice.
Benchmarking analysis undertaken for the SCD shows that Guinea-Bissau ranks poorly (at the
bottom 10-20 percent) with respect to regional averages in most, if not all, the indicators of human
capital, physical capital, business climate, transparency, rule of law, and other quality of
institutions.

14.     The cost of political and institutional fragility has been very large. The costs from the
2012 coup were severe. The military-backed government mismanaged the 2012 and 2013 cashew
campaigns, aggravating the income losses of farmers and domestic traders due to a large drop in
cashew prices. Smuggling of lumber increased when border controls softened, and corruption
spread. The immediate suspension of donor programs in response to the coup dried up external
financing. Public investment ground to a halt, current expenditures had to be cut, and arrears
increased. This resulted in widespread strikes, the disruption of education and health services, and
severe outages in both electricity and running water in Bissau. The economy contracted by 1.8
percent in 2012 and barely recovered in 2013, growing at 0.8 percent. Frequent political
disruptions, such as the civil war and military coups, are the main culprits causing recessions in
Guinea-Bissau because they unsettle economic activity from which the economy recovers only
slowly (Figure 1.1). In the most recent Article IV assessment (July 2015), the IMF estimated that
Guinea-Bissau’s GDP per capita could have been 65-90 percent higher had it not been for its
endemic fragility.

15.    Elections restored democracy in 2014, and the new government embarked on
ambitious reforms. Guinea-Bissau’s largest political party, the Party for the Independence of
Guinea-Bissau and Cabo Verde (PAIGC), won the elections held in early 2014, both at the
parliamentary and the presidential level. The candidate of the main opposition party conceded



                                                 6
quickly, paving the way for the return of democracy. The new government, led by Prime Minister
Domingos Simões Pereira, took important steps to curb military interference in politics, and
developed an ambitious national development plan and strategy aimed at reigniting growth and
poverty reduction (see Annex 1A). The plan is closely aligned with the World Bank Group (WBG)
Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) that was finalized in January 2015. Early actions by the
government included addressing macroeconomic issues in consultation with the IMF. The
government also made considerable progress in restoring the orderly functioning of public
finances, and started preparing a comprehensive plan to demobilize the military. Key public
services were partially restored. A window of opportunity appeared to have opened, and the donor
community rushed to help the country seize it by pledging US$1.5 billion during a donor
roundtable in March 2015. Growth rebounded in 2014 and 2015.

16.     A short-lived period of political stability after the elections fostered important steps
toward a set of reforms, including achieving stronger fiscal sustainability. Upon taking office
in 2014, the leadership swiftly passed a retroactive budget for 2014 and prepared a 2015 budget in
record time, both of which were unanimously adopted by parliament. It suspended the
controversial and regressive 'FUNPI surcharge', an additional tax on export which the World Bank
has estimated to have increased poverty by as much as 2 percentage points. The new government
also successfully strengthened domestic revenue mobilization, significantly increasing non-tax
revenues (especially through fishing licenses), while also raising customs and tax revenues by 39
percent and 9 percent year-on-year respectively. In addition, structural reforms were put in place
that tightened control over fuel imports, reduced tax exemptions, rehabilitated customs posts and
intensified tax audits of large taxpayers. Combined, these actions have given a much-needed boost
to public revenues. The Government also succeeded in clearing all external arrears and a
significant portion of domestic arrears.

17.     However, a fresh round of political tensions emerged in mid-2015 and continues until
today. After the 2014 elections, the hope was that Guinea-Bissau had turned decisively away from
a history of instability. Nonetheless, the country’s underlying fragility was revealed by tensions
between the President and the Prime Minister, reminiscent of the past experience of frequent
government turnover and ushering in a new round of instability. President José Mario Vaz
dismissed the Pereira Government on August 15, 2015, which resulted in two months of
uncertainty and speculation before a new cabinet was sworn in on October 13, 2015. The new
government was led by Carlos Correia until May 2016, when he was removed by the President in
another bout of instability (albeit constitutional). The Correia Government had committed itself to
the policies of its predecessor, particularly the development plan shared with donors and known
as “Terra Ranca”. Fortunately, the military has not intervened throughout the crisis and has
declared itself neutral.
1.6        Dark clouds on the horizon risk sustainability of growth, distribution, and poverty
           reduction

18.      The structure of the economy in Guinea-Bissau, including the large dependency on
its natural wealth to ignite and sustain growth, and the political settlement and interlinked
elite competition for rents, subject the country to multiple economic, environmental, and
political risks moving forward. On the macroeconomic side, structural issues and existing and
emerging risks threaten economic progress. Over time, the dependence on the cashew sector has
grown, leaving the economy highly vulnerable to external, political, and natural shocks. While
existing risks of fiscal distress are moderate, the sustainability of the fiscal accounts is dependent
on grants from the international community, which in turn are unpredictable due to endemic
fragility. Structural fiscal deficits are also a common feature of the economy.7  At the current rate
of utilization of natural resources, Guinea-Bissau is depleting rather than building the value of its
total wealth. Risks in the non-renewable sector such as depletion, environmental degradation, and
mismanagement of rents, are also prevalent. Climate change will exacerbate many of these risks.
Important drivers of fragility, the major source of political, economic, and social instability, remain
unaddressed. The internal competition between politicians and the different arms of government
is a major risk to the current reform agenda. Insofar, as elite capture and corruption, investment in
the poor can contribute to promote inclusive growth but also stimulate demand for transparency
and accountability. While interference of the military in political and economic spheres has
lessened, the politicization of the security sector continues to create a series of severe imbalances.
Reform of the security sector is crucial but bears its own risks. Impunity, a weak justice sector and
a lack of effective conflict resolution systems fuel instability. Defining features of Guinea-Bissau’s
fragility, such as weak institutions and a rural-urban divide, also remain unaddressed.

1.7        Looking ahead, change in Guinea-Bissau will require major strategic efforts
 
19.    Considering fragility and weak governance as strong contextual factors, issues of
inclusiveness, higher rural productivity, and overall growth are found to be key areas of
binding constraints to poverty reduction and shared growth in Guinea-Bissau. They follow
from the analytical model applied in the SCD and from existing evidence because they reflect a
context where the basic elements of well-being and economic opportunities are inadequate and
                                                            
7
  Structural fiscal deficit is the deficit that remains across the business cycle, and reflects the fact that the general level of government spending
exceeds prevailing tax levels.



                                                                          8
unequally distributed, and where economic growth, a key ingredient for poverty reduction, has
been unsatisfactory and volatile. Cutting across most of the economic, social, and political
structures of the country, the existence of fragility and weak governance, the third set of core
constraints, represents major obstacles to improving the development outcomes of the country.

20.     Results from the prioritization exercise highlight entry points where policy
intervention can contribute to breaking the current low-welfare, low-growth equilibrium in
Guinea-Bissau. In these areas of constraints, there is broad consensus resulting from the
diagnostics and consultations that the selected policy actions contemplated are able to deliver the
desired impact on poverty, with some actions even becoming entrenched. They include the urgent
need to improve basic service delivery, raise productivity in agriculture, diversify the economy,
strengthen market support services, and address allocative, technical, and regressive inefficiencies
in public spending. With regard to addressing the constraint of fragility and weak governance,
many of the more difficult reforms rate poorly on feasibility and traction, pointing to an
unwillingness to break from the established order. This suggests that the gains from addressing the
other constraints remain at risk.

21.     Addressing the impediments to inclusive growth will require confronting the vicious
cycle of fragility and elite capture by utilizing flexible strategies to engage directly with the
elite and with other actors that can legitimately circumvent it. The challenges to poverty
reduction and shared prosperity in Guinea-Bissau are self-reinforcing and well entrenched,
requiring a massive and disruptive mix of measures to break with tradition and transform the
economy. Marginal and stand-alone interventions, though feasible, may not be enough to break
well-established norms that have kept the country in a high poverty, low growth fragility trap for
the past three decades. Breaking the status quo will initially require strategies that yield benefits
both to the poor and to the elite. This SCD points to a mixture of strategies that combine direct
engagement of government with increased participation of other local, regional, and international
actors to create a critical demand for transparency and accountability. Explicitly excluding the elite
from the reform process may not be realistic or even effective in challenging elite domination. On
the contrary, it can exacerbate rather than lessen fragility. Empowering the poor through increased
demand for transparency and accountability, and through direct, more effective delivery of basic
services, can be a major catalyst in the process of strengthening institutions and addressing
behavioral norms in public and political spheres. This includes strengthening mechanisms to
channel broad-based demands for improvements in public goods, and to achieve better
performance by public officers. Working directly with beneficiaries, for instance, through
community-driven programs implemented by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO), can
contribute to address urgent needs in basic services such as education, health, and water.
International actors like WAEMU, ECOWAS, the African Union (AU) and the donor community
can also harness forces to align incentives to bring about more transparency and stability.

1.8   Diagnostics framework

22.     The diagnostics framework of this SCD is based on three interrelated themes:
inclusiveness of growth, overall economic growth and macro context, and sustainability
risks. Broadly speaking, these three closely intertwined core building blocks lie at the foundations
for inadequate levels of income and consumption in the population: (1) the inclusiveness of the
economy (micro-determinants of household welfare), namely the availability of equitable


                                                  9
opportunities, through asset accumulation and utilization, for all members of the society to
contribute to and benefit from economic growth; (2) robust and sustained economic growth and
cross-cutting economic services, and fair, transparent, and efficient governance and economic
institutions; and (3) economic, social, political and environmental risks for the sustainability of the
process of growth, distribution and poverty reduction (Figure 1.2).

23.     At the micro level, the inclusiveness of the economy is assessed by the assets
households own, the intensity with which they are utilized, and their returns. The assets base
is comprised of different forms of human, physical, natural, financial, and social capital. Intensity
of factor usage is captured, for instance, by labor market participation (intensive and extensive
margins, and formal and informal work shares) and by land utilization, among other uses. Returns
can be measured by remuneration to labor factors or by returns in investments in human capital.
Transfers (private and public) can complement household income. Risk management factors
influence the household’s ability (or inability) to hedge against losses due to shocks such as the
variability of cashew prices, to climatic factors such as droughts or floods, or to idiosyncratic
events, such as job losses or health shocks. 8

24.     At the macro level, raising household incomes requires an enabling economic and
institutional environment. Core functions of the overarching macro and institutional
environment include equitable and efficient fiscal policy, macro-stability, availability and quality
of crosscutting economic services like finance, electricity, roads and telecommunications, a fair
and transparent overall institutional environment, and well-functioning markets. This part of the
framework allows for a systematic look at a number of interlinked economy-wide factors -- such
as political instability, exogenous shocks, poor risk management and coping, a weak institutional,
policy and regulatory environment, low private investment, imperfect markets, and a paucity of
core public goods – which have a powerful bearing on households’ incentives and ability to utilize
productive assets.




                                                            
8
  This draws from the asset-based framework, previously presented in Attanasio and Székely (1999), Carter and Barrett (2006), and more recently
Bussolo and Lopez-Calva (2014) as well as in the World Bank ‘Risk Management Concept Note for Latin American and the Caribbean’ (2015).



                                                                     10

25.     The sustainability element examines whether the current economic, political, social
and ecological systems and processes are dynamically sustainable in the medium- and long-
term. This includes assessing what factors hinder the sustainability of policies to invest in more
and better quality public goods and redistributive resources. It also looks at the factors that threaten
political stability, such as rivalry and internal competition between politicians and the different
arms of government, security sector reforms aimed to diminish the interference of the military in
civil affairs, and unmet expectations from the civil society. Finally, sustaining and prudently
managing the natural resource wealth is critical to ensuring environmental sustainability of the rich
renewable and non-renewable natural capital base of the country.

26.     Finally, as a cross-cutting theme, fragility and weak governance must be considered
and addressed at each step of the development process in Guinea-Bissau. Inclusiveness,
economic growth and sustainability factors will take place within the same Guinean context; one
where fragility of institutions and weak governance may continue to erode improvements across
the board and in any particular area. Historical hampering of economic growth due to political
instability, concentration of rents at the top, and lack of transparency indicates that for the country
to achieve significant and prolonged growth, it must address issues of national leadership tensions,
rent-seeking, elite capture, military meddling, the culture of clientelism, transparency of national
accounts, and increased fiscal responsibility and accountability, as well as achieving a stable
transition of power between elected governments.

1.9        Scope and process

27.     The purpose of this SCD is to guide the WBG’s future engagement in Guinea-Bissau
by identifying key constraints and potential solutions to boosting growth, sustainably
reducing poverty, and increasing shared prosperity.9 In so doing, this SCD has drawn from
available evidence, commissioned new analyses, including a joint World Bank-UN Fragility
Assessment, and integrated country knowledge and expertise from across the WBG and other
development partner institutions. The SCD also benefitted from in-country consultations (held in
May 2015 and March 2016) with several stakeholders. The SCD was prepared in close
collaboration with the entire Guinea-Bissau country team. It includes an in-depth discussion of the
sources of growth, the drivers of poverty in Guinea-Bissau, and the constraints it faces in making
growth inclusive and sustainable to improve the welfare of households, focusing especially on the
most vulnerable population groups. Throughout the consultations, there was a broad consensus on
the diagnosis of the challenges faced by Guinea-Bissau and on the priorities identified in this
report.

28.     This SCD identifies three core interconnected areas of binding constraints. These three
core areas are: (1) lack of inclusiveness and low rural productivity; (2) low and unstable economic
growth; and (3) fragility and weak governance. These constraints follow from the diagnostics
framework in that they reflect the evidence that, under the current conditions, the gains from future
growth will not be adequately shared due to the limited provision of public goods and opportunities
and to the large barriers for households wanting to take up more profitable economic opportunities.
Likewise, economic growth will likely continue to be low and volatile, and fragility and poor
governance will undermine almost every economic, social, political environmental aspect of life
in Guinea-Bissau. The SCD identifies priority policy areas and specific actions for each of the
clusters of constraints for which a strong evidence base supports interventions in pursuit of the
WBG’s twin goals: reducing extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity.

29.     While the main findings of the SCD are seemingly robust across the existing sources
of quantitative and qualitative evidence, it is worth flagging key knowledge gaps that merit
further research. As expected for a diagnostic exercise that focuses on the development of a
country as whole, the findings are often constrained by data limitations. This SCD has made an
effort to go beyond the symptoms and identify the underlying constraints to faster and shared
growth in Guinea-Bissau. However, economic, social, political, and environmental systems are
intricately interconnected, making it a challenge to disentangle the root causes of development
performance. Another important issue is the limited availability of quantitative data. When
available, the data is sometimes outdated, patchy, or not fully reliable. The next poverty household
survey is estimated to be finished by 2017. This will help to improve the quality of data and iterate
the current picture of poverty in Guinea-Bissau. Other limitations hinge on qualitative data, which
can be prone to limited external validity and subjective biases. This has left the following overall
five critical areas that should guide further research and exploration:

A. In spite of the detailed account and research in this SCD, it is important to further understand
   how much of the poverty increase between 2002 and 2010 reflects cashew price trends versus
                                                            
9
  Reducing poverty means raising the proportion of the population living above a poverty threshold (for instance, US$1.25 per day or less); boosting
shared prosperity means raising the incomes of the poorest 40 percent of the population.



                                                                        12
    a structural shift in the ability of a large share of the population to generate income;

B. The important interplay between risk management mechanisms and how they affect the
   production choices of rural households, especially the poor. This is to say how do
   households informal risk management influence their levels of welfare;

C. This SCD offers many entry points for change. These include among other things the provision
   of services, better human capital, greater citizen engagement in the political process, expansion
   of agriculture and non-agricultural activities. Further analysis is needed to understand how
   much demand will follow an increase in supply and quality of these entry points for change.

D. How can political constraints be sustainably addressed in Bissau? This means further
   understanding how to provide development support in the realistic context of potentially
   recurrent political instability and understanding how to maximize benefits while minimize
   risks of inconstant donor presence.

E. Finally, the SCD makes an in-depth and meaningful attempt to identify ways to break the
   vicious cycle of elite capture, poor governance, weak social contract and fragility; nevertheless,
   further work should provide continuity to the exploration of these complex interlinkages, in
   particular looking for stronger causal links.

30.     In addition to the need for further research, capacities for statistic and analytical
work in Guinea-Bissau need to be strengthened in areas of improved policy design and
monitoring. Timely high-quality macroeconomic and social data is key for evidence-based policy
interventions across all sectors. On the macroeconomic front, consolidated fiscal data consistent
with developments in the country is important for appropriately monitoring spending, especially
in the context of the relatively low and volatile revenue flows. Frequent statistical surveys of social
conditions will enable better analysis on poverty and growth, enabling the authorities to monitor
progress and to appropriately adjust policy intervention. Improving existing monitoring and
evaluation frameworks is necessary for promoting evidence-based and effective policy making. In
this regard, investing in the national statistical system is critical.

31.      Following the structure of the diagnostics framework, the analysis of the SCD is
organized into six chapters, one of which is devoted to the issue of fragility and weak
governance, given its cross-cutting nature and relevance for the development of Guinea-
Bissau. After this introduction, Chapter 2 assess whether the minimum elements of well-being and
personal opportunities are adequate and equal. Chapter 3 presents the growth patterns and the main
factors driving and constraining economic growth in Guinea-Bissau. Chapter 4 zooms in on the
political and institutional context of Guinea-Bissau to highlight the negative implications of
fragility and weak governance for growth, poverty reduction, and shared prosperity. Chapter 5
discusses the main economic, fiscal, environmental, and political risks to boost and sustain
inclusive growth in the medium and long term. Finally, Chapter 6 discusses the process and results
of the prioritization analysis.

                   2   POVERTY, SHARED PROSPERITY AND EQUITY

     As of 2010, 67.1 percent of Guineans are poor on the basis of the $1.90/day (2011 PPP)
    poverty line. Poverty, especially the extreme poverty rate, increased between 2002 and 2010,
    and it is well above the average poverty rate of Sub-Saharan Africa. At 0.50, the Gini coefficient
    indicates that inequality in Guinea-Bissau is high, even in comparison to low-income country
    standards, and has worsened over time.

     Faster economic growth alone will not be enough to bring about poverty reduction in Guinea-
    Bissau. The modest economic growth recorded in the 2000s (assuming its distribution is
    neutral) would have reduced poverty. Yet, in reality, since growth happened only at the top,
    poverty increased by 3.7 percentage points. Assuming sustained political stability, the country
    has a chance to exploit both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors that can be pivotal in
    reducing extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity.

     The assessment of the poverty, shared-prosperity and equity conditions reveals reinforcing
    mechanisms that lock most of the population in a persistent poverty trap. The low and unequal
    allocation of human and physical endowments (for instance, low school attainment, weak
    nutrition, a big burden of disease and low life expectancy) constraints the income generation
    capacity of households. Adults in the bottom 40 percent complete just two years of schooling,
    and their life expectancy is below the average for Sub-Saharan Africa. Weak nutrition and a
    big burden of disease among both adults and children limit the ability to escape poverty.

     Low access to basic services such as clean water, sanitation, and electricity, low access to
    primary-care in health and primary education, coupled with failures in critical markets (for
    example, credit and cashews), poor infrastructure, and natural resource depletion constrain
    economic opportunities, undermine asset utilization, and reduce asset returns. Poor
    infrastructure, in particular, renders potentially productive connections between markets more
    difficult. Certain groups, particularly women and the extreme poor, are disadvantaged in the
    allocation and utilization of resources. Each of these are areas urgently need interventions in
    order to unlock opportunities for Guinean households.

     Taken together, the low level of assets, the lack of an enabling context, and behavioral factors
    trap most households in cashew production, a stable yet low-investment, relatively low-risk and
    low-productivity subsistence equilibrium. In contrast, the rentier nature of the economy, the
    high concentration of the most important private and public rents, and a weak governance
    framework means that the better-off manage to benefit from modest but positive growth.

     Lack of inclusiveness and low rural productivity are each core areas of binding
    interconnected constraints for shared growth in Guinea-Bissau. Breaking the low equilibrium
    of welfare moving forward requires improving service delivery, enhancing market accessibility,
    reforming land tenure systems, improving agricultural technology and market support services,
    and reducing vulnerabilities of households to shocks. Yet, unlocking the underlying poverty trap
    is faced with challenges from systemically weak governance and institutional capacity, in spite
    of recent short-term advances in political stability.




                                                    14
32.    The assessment of the poverty, shared-prosperity, and equity conditions for Guinea-
Bissau carried out in Chapter 2 reveals several reinforcing mechanisms that cause poverty
and underdevelopment to persist. Most of the population, especially women, suffers from a
paucity of endowments such as human capital, skills, and physical capital. Adults in the bottom
40 percent complete just two years of schooling on average. Their life expectancy is below the
average for Sub-Saharan Africa, and households lack secure tenure rights. Weak nutrition and a
big burden of disease among adults and children limit the ability of individuals to work at full
capacity, and have lasting effects across generations. Low access to basic services such as clean
water, sanitation, and electricity, coupled with failures in critical markets (for example, credit),
poor public infrastructure, and pervasive fragility and natural resource depletion constrain
economic opportunities and reduce returns to endowments differentially. Consequently, most
households are stuck in cashew production, a stable yet low-investment, relatively low-risk and
low-productivity subsistence equilibrium. In fact, nearly seven in ten individuals are below the
poverty line, three in ten individuals are extremely poor, and more than half of the population are
deemed chronically poor. In contrast, the better-off manage to benefit from modest but positive
growth.

33.      Since growth alone will not be enough to bring about poverty reduction, breaking the
low equilibrium of welfare moving forward requires improving service delivery and raising
agricultural productivity to trigger a virtuous cycle of wealth accumulation at the household
level. As discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, conditions for more robust and diversified growth, political
stability, and stronger governance are necessary but are not sufficient to create an enabling context
for equitable growth and wealth accumulation. The increasing poverty trend in Guinea-Bissau is
indicative that some kind of poverty trap is in operation. Most households are below a threshold
that limits their ability to acquire enough wealth and to increase their future level of income and
consumption. To improve the productive capacity of households, investments are needed in the
delivery and reliability of basic services. Improving production practices in the cashew sector
through extension services, increased access to enhanced inputs, and improved technology is
expected to raise agricultural productivity in the most important economic activity of the country,
which is the main employer of the poor, and potentially to generate opportunities for diversification
in and outside of agriculture. The development of credit markets can also help to alleviate liquidity
constraints which prevent these market managers from taking risks in the search of higher returns.
Yet, unlocking the underlying poverty trap will be particularly challenging in the current context
of fragility and limited institutional capacity.
 
2.1   Poverty in Guinea-Bissau is deep and entrenched

34.     Poverty in Guinea-Bissau is high and increased between 2002 and 2010. Based on
consumption data from the Poverty Evaluation Household Surveys (ILAP, Inquérito Ligeiro para
a Avalição da Pobreza, in Portuguese) conducted in 2002 and 2010, nearly 1.2 million people in
2010 (69.4 percent) are poor – that is, they live on less than $2 per adult equivalent per day, which
is the definition of the national poverty line. One third of the population (33.1 percent) lives in
extreme poverty, surviving on under $1 per adult equivalent per day (national extreme poverty
line). Both absolute and extreme poverty rose between 2002 and 2010, the former by 3.7
percentage points and the latter by 11.5 percentage points (Figure 2.1).

35.     Poverty incidence in Guinea-Bissau measured using internationally comparable lines
is equally high and lies above the average for Sub-Saharan Africa. Extreme poverty, measured
by the international line of US$1.90/day (2011 PPP) was 67.1 percent in Guinea-Bissau in 2010
versus an average rate of 42.7 percent for Sub-Saharan Africa in 2012. Guinea-Bissau has a level
of poverty only slightly lower than Liberia (68.6), one of its neighbors, but higher than most other
neighboring countries in West Africa including Burkina Faso (55.3 percent), Togo (54.2 percent),
Nigeria (53.5 percent), Benin (53.1 percent), Sierra Leone (52.3), Mali (49.3 percent), Senegal (38
percent), and Guinea (35.3 percent), as well as many other Sub-Saharan African countries (Figure
2.2).

36.    Poverty in Guinea-Bissau is more prevalent in the rural areas, illustrating the
connection between low growth, low agricultural productivity, and low inclusiveness. The
cumulative distribution function of consumption per capita shows that rural standards of living are
considerably lower than those in the capital, Bissau, reflecting lower rural human capital and
potentially lower agricultural productivity. As of 2010, the median consumption in rural Guinea-
Bissau was US$1.21 per capita per day, 38 percent less than in Bissau (US$1.96 per capita per


                                                            16
day). As a result, poverty rates in 2010 were higher in rural Guinea-Bissau (75.6 percent) than in
the capital (51.2 percent). Moreover, the difference in poverty between rural and urban areas
widened over time (Figure 2.3). This has been accompanied by a similar shift over time toward
employment in agriculture, further emphasizing the link between a sector plagued by low
productivity and higher poverty rates. The higher levels of poverty seen outside of Bissau are
further compounded by multiple deprivations in non-monetary dimensions, such as access to basic
and social services, human capital, and levels of public infrastructure (explored further below).

37.     In some parts of the country, four out of every five households are poor. The country
is administratively divided into eight regions plus the capital city, Bissau. Poverty rates
disaggregated at this level show substantial variation. In some geographical areas of the country,
almost everyone is poor. Gabu and Cacheu –northern regions bordering Senegal– have the highest
poverty rates (83.5 and 80.5 percent, respectively), whereas Bolama/Bijagos and Bissau have the
lowest (47.2 and 51.2 percent, respectively) (Figure 2.4). The eight regions are themselves divided
into 39 districts, 22 of which (all rural) have poverty rates (obtained from poverty mapping
techniques) above 80 percent. There is also considerable spatial concentration of poverty among
sectors within regions – for instance, within the Gabu region, the poverty headcount range from
90.2 percent in the Sonaco sector to 57.9 percent in the Boe sector. The concentration of extreme
poor households (that is below the $1/day national line) is higher in rural areas, particularly in the
regions of Gabu (47.2 percent), Oio (45.6 percent), Cacheu (42.8 percent), and Quinara (41.1
percent). In contrast, at 13.2 percent, extreme poverty is substantially lower in Bissau.

38.      While in general all the poor in Guinea-Bissau experience multiple deprivations, the
extreme poor are further disadvantaged when compared even with the moderate poor.
Household size among the extreme poor is substantially larger—on average over two more
members. Part of this is driven by a higher number of children (that is, on average one additional
child), increasing the dependency ratios (Table 2.1). School attainment—proxied by literacy rates
and primary education for the head of household—is also lower. The extreme poor also have fewer
household assets. Compared to the rest of the poor, their incomes are not only lower but are also
less diversified with nearly 90 percent of the extreme poor employed in agriculture. When it comes
to connectivity, the extreme poor are significantly more disadvantaged. On average they are more
commonly far from markets and schools and lacking access to electricity. General access to
services, already low for the population in general, is even more critical for the extreme poor, with
nearly half lacking safe drinking water and four-fifths lacking sanitation. This is a further challenge
to reducing poverty in Guinea-Bissau, and addressing the problems of the extreme poor.

39.     In spite of modest improvement between 2002 and 2010, low and unequal access to
key basic and social services—especially in human capital—suggests that non-monetary
poverty remains high holding back potential productivity gains and other economic
opportunities. Monetary measures alone cannot capture the various dimensions of household
welfare or the deprivations suffered by individuals or households. Income and consumption
challenges that poor people face are often related to factors such as access to vital services, as well
as their ability to build human capital, one of several main pillars of higher productivity. An
analysis of seven indicators – school attainment of the household head, children’s school
attendance, housing quality (proxied by roofing material), household assets, and access to
electricity, clean water, and sanitation services, based on ILAP data, shows that more than 87
percent of the population live with deprivations in at least three of the seven indicators, and over
70 percent with regard to four of the indicators (Figure 2.5). Furthermore, for one-third of the
population (the extreme poor), these deprivations are even more profound (Table 2.1). Between

but little progress was achieved in the other dimensions.

40. Two-thirds of the population are poor in the monetary sense and over half in the non-
    monetary sense, pointing possibly to the existence of major poverty traps. In the absence
    of longitudinal data, the intersection of non-monetary and monetary poverty allows for a proxy
    assessment of the temporality of poverty. In general terms, households living below the $2/day
    national poverty line and experiencing, for instance, four or more non-monetary deprivations,
    are more likely to be exposed to long spells of poverty, this is, chronically poor. Under this
    rationale, 55 percent of the country’s population (including the majority of the extreme poor)
    face the greatest challenges in moving out of poverty due both to low incomes as well as to
    severely-constrained human capital, access to services, and household assets. Only a small

2.2     Inequality is particularly high and the poor are not able to capitalize on growth

41. In addition to widespread poverty, inequality in Guinea-Bissau is also high, even in
    comparison to African and overall low-income country standards, and has worsened over
    time. The increase in inequality in Guinea-Bissau is partly symptomatic of the rentier
    economy, which favors the long-standing business and political elites in the country. The Gini
    coefficient for Guinea-Bissau was 0.50 in 2010, which places it among the countries in the
    region with the highest levels of inequality (Figure 2.7). Inequality can also be measured
    through the ratio of consumption levels at two different points of the distribution. Expenditures
    for the top quartile is nine times higher than that of the bottom quartile. Similarly, average
    consumption at the top ten percent is 23 times higher than consumption at the bottom ten
    percent, and eleven times higher than the average consumption of the bottom 40. Inequality
    has worsened since 2002, when the Gini coefficient was 0.35.

42. A decomposition of poverty into growth and redistribution factors shows that while
    growth alone could have been sufficient to contribute to some poverty reduction, it did
    not, in fact, benefit the poor. Rather, the observed increase in consumption inequality more
    than offset the potential poverty reduction effect of growth. Keeping the baseline income
    distribution constant, growth contributed to a decrease in poverty rates of approximately 8.2
    percentage points. However, since growth happened at the top, the redistribution effect
    contributed to an increase in the poverty rate of about 11.9 percentage points. The net effect
    was an increase in poverty by 3.7 percentage points.

43. Without strong human capital and access to services, the poor are unable to reach higher
    incomes. Overall, the trend between 2002 and 2010 was one of growth at the top and
    declining welfare for the rest of the population, which can explain the increase in poverty.
    Growth incidence curves (GIC) plot the growth rate of a welfare measure (for instance,
    consumption or income) between two points in time for each percentile of the baseline
    distribution. GICs can be used to assess how the gains of economic growth (or the losses of
    economic stagnation) are distributed across the population. A GIC for Guinea-Bissau for the
    period 2002-2010 shows that positive consumption per capita growth was experienced only by
    the top 10 percent of the distribution (Figure 2.8). The rest of the distribution saw negative
    consumption growth, consistent with the increase in poverty recorded during this interval of
    time. Furthermore, the rate at which consumption falls per capita increases systematically as
    one moves from the top to the bottom of the distribution. Consequently, the poorest of poor
    fared worse than the rest of the population with their consumption falling between 5 and 10
    percent. The breakdown by occupations corroborates the overall trend of wealth accumulation
    at the top consumption deciles, particularly for those in management positions (that is, public
    and private sector).

44.     While a drop in cashew prices could partly explain the increase in poverty, the uneven
allocation of endowments and economic opportunities structurally limits the inclusiveness of
economic growth in Guinea-Bissau. The increase in poverty between 2002 and 2010 may be
associated with the fact that real cashew prices fell over the same period. Yet, the fact that some
groups of people saw their consumption levels increase over the same period, and that this positive
consumption growth was experienced solely by households at the top of the distribution, (which
also derives part of their incomes from cashew) is indicative that structural inequality in
opportunities constrain the inclusiveness of the economy. This emphasizes the focus on improving

returns for the poor, who are more prevalent in rural areas and more likely to earn a living from
agriculture. The asset profile illustrates how households from the bottom 90 percent of the
consumption distribution in 2002 had less ownership of, and access to, assets and services
(schooling, sanitation, water, and so forth) that are central to seize opportunities for income
growth. The pattern of deprivation is even more pronounced among the extreme poor for all the
dimensions analyzed (Figure 2.9).

45.     The ability of the elites to widely dominate the few markets that exist in Guinea-
Bissau is exemplified through the presence of much higher returns to assets among the better
off, a major contributor to the skewed nature of consumption growth in Guinea-Bissau.
Using the Firpo et al (2007) framework to decompose the growth incidence curve into composition
of endowments and returns to endowments shows that differences in household welfare are largely
driven by the latter (Annex 2A). This is to say that non-poor households are better off due to having
higher returns to the endowments they have, rather than the bigger stock of endowments itself,
explaining the overall shape of the growth incidence curve. More specifically, the non-poor are
able to derive higher returns to the allocation of assets, including education, work experience, other
household assets, and to their work in agriculture. Returns to the accessibility to markets are more
important to the poor, meaning that in a context of an unleveled playing field, ease of access to
markets is an important channel for the poor to trade goods and ultimately increase their
consumption. The composition effect (from how endowed a household is) is much less
pronounced, and is driven upwards by the distribution of a household’s asset-base10 and
downwards by its distribution of demographics, especially the fact that poorer households are
larger. As shown in Table 2.1, the poor and extreme poor are also less likely to work in non-
agricultural sectors, which command higher returns.

46.     In what follows, the SCD documents in more detail the constraints that the population
faces to raise their standards of living based on an exhaustive assessment of three major
elements: (1) assets ownership; (2) intensity in which assets are utilized; and (3) returns
earned on the factors of production. This analytical framework is useful for understanding the
micro-level factors underpinning the low levels of welfare across the country and across groups
(especially women relative to men). The household asset base may be comprised of demographic
endowments (the proportion of young and productive members of the household, implying a
demographic dividend), human capital, natural capital, social capital, and financial capital.
Intensity of usage is captured through labor market participation, its intensive and extensive
margins, formal and informal work shares, and land use, among other uses elaborated below.
Finally, returns are examined by the wages for labor factors. The assessment ends with a
discussion of the extent to which private transfers11 complement household income and the
vulnerability of households to systemic and idiosyncratic shocks.

system, poses a major obstacle to improving labor productivity and generating income for
the population. While official statistics indicate that school attendance has improved over the
past several years, Guinea-Bissau continues to have some of the lowest education results in the
region. Primary net enrollment increased from 45 percent in 2000 to 67 percent in 2010. However,
primary completion is low. A 2010 education sector analysis completed by the World Bank and

  The asset-base is composed by education, experience and household assets (e.g. electricity, good roofing, and land ownership).

  While the standard assets-based model treats private transfers as independent of household income-earning assets, they—particularly international
remittances—may be correlated with access to markets and the probability of households to migrate, factors themselves that determine the level of
income of the population.

Pôle de Dakar found that out of 100 children starting the first year of primary, only 72 continued
into the second year, and only 38 arrived at the sixth year. Overall, 64 percent of children complete
primary education compared to 69 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa and 92 percent worldwide. At
51 percent, the literacy rate is also lower than the regional average of 60 percent (Figure 2.10).
Inequities are found to remain between genders (Figure 2.11), rural/urban locations, and
socioeconomic levels.

48.      While there is relative parity between girls and boys in enrollment at the primary
school level, there is still a large gender gap at the secondary level. The ratio of female to male
enrollment is lower than for every West African neighbor, except Togo. Evidence suggests that
pregnancy (17 percent) and early marriage (17.2 percent) are the most common reasons for girls
to drop out of secondary school, while work is the most common reason for boys (38.6 percent)
(Government of Bissau, 2012). Among women aged 20-49 years, 37 percent were married before
the age of 18, and 7 percent were married before 15, according to the 2014 Multiple Indicator
Cluster Survey (MICS). Early marriage is effectively promoted indirectly via a law, which sets the
legal age at just 14 years for girls, compared to 16 for boys, and the international standard of 18
(AfDB, 2014). Lack of proper sanitary facilities and long distances to school are thought to be
critical barriers to educational participation, especially for girls. Only 6 percent of secondary
school teachers are females.

49.     Low educational achievement more systematically affects the extreme poor,
highlighting the deficient human capital causing lower returns for this group. Data from ILAP
shows that adults in the bottom 40 percent completed just two years of schooling on average, but
that even for the top quintile, school attainment does not exceed five years (Figure 2.12). Overall,
three-quarters of Guinean household heads had not completed primary education. Literacy rates
were also lower among the extreme poor. Less than one-third of adults (aged 15 years and over)
in the lowest consumption quintile reported an ability to read and write. Here again, there are
significant differences by gender, with female educational achievement lagging significantly
behind that of their male counterparts. Parental education is generally associated with better
educational outcomes for children, and in Guinea-Bissau nearly 70 percent of households whose
heads are illiterate have at least one school-aged child out of school, compared to about 40 percent
for children of parents who are literate.

50.     Substantial improvements in coverage, quality and institutional strengthening are
needed in the education sector. Recent tests of mathematics and Portuguese based on a 2014
evaluation reveal very low achievement levels. Less than 40 percent of teachers at the primary
level are trained, many of whom are often appointed based on clientelist rather than education

sector objectives. High internal inefficiency has significant costs, with 47 percent of allocated
resources wasted due to repetition and dropouts (Pole de Dakar, 2015). While achievement is low,
access to schooling is also constrained, with only a quarter of schools offering all six primary
grades. It is necessary to improve staffing, management, and training policies in the sector as well
as to set mechanisms to control the hiring of teachers and ensure the sustainability of the cadre of
teachers. Similarly, the lack of rules to address issues of absenteeism of teachers and children is a
problem.

51.       Health outcomes are equally poor, limiting the ability of individuals to work, and
undermining their productivity. The poor general health of the population is encapsulated in the
low average life expectancy in Guinea-Bissau: 54 years at birth, compared with sub-Saharan and
world averages of 56 years and 71 years respectively. Poor health outcomes are closely related to
the inadequacy of safe water and sanitation services. Even though indicators of access to clean
water and sanitation show a modest improvement, more than a third of the population (36.4
percent) still lack access to safe water for drinking and bathing, and close to two-thirds have no
access to modern sanitation (Figure 2.13, Panel a). Morbidity in adults is most commonly
associated with lower respiratory tract infection, HIV/AIDS and malaria. Morbidity patterns,
especially those associated with malaria, have serious implications for labor productivity and
people’s capacity to work over extended periods. In the 2010 ILAP, 78 percent of respondents
(most of them poor) reported that they had missed at least one day of work due to illness during
the four weeks before the survey was taken.

52.     Health outcomes are particularly weak for women. The maternal mortality rate in
Guinea-Bissau is one of the highest rates in all of Africa and appears to have increased since
2004. The latest national estimate suggests that there were 560 deaths per 100,000 live births in
2013 World Development Indicator (WDI), which made Guinea-Bissau the 13th highest in the
world (WDI, 2013), well above the global rate (210) and higher than the level in Sub-Saharan
Africa (510)12 (Figure 2.13, Panel b). This means that among West African neighbors only Sierra
Leone and Liberia have lower rates. Moreover, this figure is above the rate of 400 estimated in
2004, suggesting that maternal mortality has been on the rise. While coverage of pre-natal care is
high at 93 percent, the high levels of maternal mortality indicate that the quality of care is low.
Additionally, at just 43 percent, the proportion of births that are attended by a skilled health
professional (one of the most important interventions for reducing maternal mortality) is lower
than that of almost every West African neighbor. Fertility rates are also high, partly due to the low
prevalence of contraception (14 percent among women ages 15-49), although that is rising slowly
and is higher among the younger generation. However, it is not clear whether supply or demand
factors drive the low use of contraceptives (see Box 2.1 on the practice of female genital

and global scales. At 78 per 1,000 live births, infant mortality is 30 percent higher than the sub-
Saharan average and more than double the world average. While under-five mortality has fallen
over time (from 225 in 1990 to 88.8 per 1,000 live births in 2014), it is twice the global average
(44 per 1,000 live births) (MICS5, 2015) (Figure 2.15). Almost two thirds of households in the
bottom 40 percent experience frequent hunger, revealing a largely food insecure population.

     Mortality rates from MICS data for Guinea-Bissau show an increasing trend going from 349 in 2000, to 405 in 2005, to 900 in 2014.

Nearly one-quarter of Guineans of all ages are undernourished, whereas almost one-third of
children under five suffer from stunting (an indicator of chronic malnutrition) and one-fifth suffer
from wasting (acute malnutrition, usually associated with illness). The high prevalence of
undernourished children is further compounded by high rates of morbidity. According to ILAPII-
2010, over 12 percent of children ages 0 to 5 years old (mostly from extreme poor households)
were reported to be sick with diarrhea or malaria in the four weeks before the survey. The
underinvestment in the human capital of children, largely driven by weak, under-budgeted, and
inefficient education and health sectors, weakens the already difficult process of development in
Guinea-Bissau by limiting their current and future productivity and contributing to the
perpetuation of poverty across generations.

                       Box 2.1. Female Genital Mutilation and HIV in Guinea-Bissau
The practice of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is quite prevalent in Guinea-Bissau. Data from
MICS5 (2014) suggest that 44.9 percent of women (aged 15-49 years) in the country have been subjected
to FGM, though data from previous years suggests this could be as high as 95 percent for women of the
two major Muslim ethnic groups (World Bank, 2009b). Data from the last MICS survey suggest that the
practice is common across all wealth quintiles, but is less prevalent among women who have had some
education (28 percent) than those who have had no education (65 percent). The parliament passed
legislation against FGM in June 2011 (UN, 2011b). Given the importance of customary and religious law
in Guinea-Bissau, it is encouraging that these formal efforts were backed up by the Guinea-Bissau National
Islamic Council (African Development Bank (AfDB), 2014). On the ground, Muslim and Christian leaders
have also worked to spread the message that FGM is not justified by religion and is harmful (AfDB, 2014).
However, there are indications that these efforts have not been sufficient to have any real impact. In the
region of Gabu, where FGM is universal, not a single case has been heard by the Regional Tribunal since
the law was passed (AfDB, 2014). However, results from the latest MICS5 data suggest that FMG may be
becoming less socially acceptable, with the share of women who stated that they think FGM should continue
declining to just 13 percent, compared to 34 percent in MICS4.

The prevalence of HIV is higher than that found in neighboring countries, and women are more likely
to contract it. In Guinea-Bissau, 3.7 percent of the population aged 15-49 are infected, compared to 1.7
percent in Guinea and 0.5 percent in Senegal. As in many countries, women make up a majority of those
infected (59 percent). Moreover, prevalence is 1.9 times higher among young women than among young
men (ages 15-24). The high rates of FGM may increase the chance of women becoming infected with
HIV/AIDS.

54.     The incidence and mortality of malaria have gone down over the years, but the rate
of malaria-related deaths remains relatively high. The incidence of malaria is comparable to
the levels recorded in Sub-Saharan Africa. This is positive for children because 78 percent of all
malaria related deaths in Africa affect children under the age of five. Guinea-Bissau has one of
the highest rates of coverage of children with a fever receiving anti-malarial treatment (Figure
2.16). Nevertheless, treatment still reaches only half of all children suspected of having malaria.
Out of 47 African nations, Guinea-Bissau ranked 20th in the number of confirmed malaria cases,
but 9th in number of malaria-related deaths per capita. This situation reported in 2014 is an
improvement from the 2012 number of confirmed malaria-related cases and deaths by a decrease

of roughly two-thirds. Overall, however, the country lacks robust health information systems,
including disease surveillance capacity for early detection and response to disease outbreaks.

Natural resources and physical assets

55.    Aside from labor, the productive asset that is most available to Guinean households
is land, to which they generally possess usufruct (rather than ownership) rights, in
accordance with customary practices. As noted in the January 2015 Guinea-Bissau CEM, wealth
accounting methodologies suggest total natural wealth in Guinea-Bissau could be up to US$3,874
per capita (Figure 2-17 and Figure 2-18). This natural resource base provides a multitude of goods
and services, contributing directly to household incomes. As part of an effort to protect access to
the country’s natural wealth by the population, a statute was passed in 1975 prohibiting private
ownership of land. The statute rules out freehold property rights for individuals, groups,
businesses, and institutions, and underlines the responsibility of the state in safeguarding land
resources as the mainstay of people’s livelihoods. While this law is aimed at protecting the rights

of the poor, it may have counter-productive effects by hampering potential benefits associated with
land holding and title holding by households. In the context of the cashew economy, such benefits
may include the ability to make longer-term and more diversified investments that do not chiefly
hinge on keeping the land ‘busy’ with cashew trees (as further discussed below).

56.     Allocation of land and other renewable natural resources is largely determined by the
diverse traditional customs of Guinea-Bissau’s twenty or more different ethnic groups.
Traditional land tenure systems vary by region, ethnicity, and the type of agricultural activity being
pursued. Both customary practices and national laws generally protect the usufruct rights of
individuals and households, although differences in traditional norms and modern land policies
generate ambiguities. Inheritance norms, for example, vary significantly across ethnic groups, with
some groups allowing inheritance by direct descendants (sons), while others require that use rights
pass to nephews or other male relatives – dampening incentives to invest in land improvements.
Land is exclusively administered by the male head of household/family clan, known as the chefe
de tabanca or regulado. This makes women extremely vulnerable with respect to land rights since
they are entirely dependent on the goodwill of the regulado in obtaining access to land. Use rights
for women are usually acquired through birth in their family of descent or through marriage, and
are usually only accorded for horticultural subsistence fields. In the event of conjugal separation,
women generally lose their land rights, and separated women are rarely (if ever) granted land use
rights in their family of descent (see Box 2.2 on women and land rights).

57.     Land tenure issues in Guinea Bissau are further complicated by a series of national
laws passed between the mid-1970s and the mid-2000s, which attempted to modernize land
policy and institutions, and which are overlaid on the mosaic of customary land practices. In
the colonial period, the traditional authorities covered the function of official community
administrators. A 2006 Bank-commissioned study – Land Tenure Issues and Policy Study (Land
Study) —showed that this formal link between the public administration and traditional leadership
was not renewed in the post-independence period. Instead, the Government sought to establish a
new system for land administration by establishing official land committees at national, regional,
sector, and section levels. National land laws permit women to access land in their own right, and
authorize the granting of land concessions for up to 90-year periods to private individuals and



                                                         30
enterprises as a means of promoting investment.13 Vast tracts of land have indeed been granted
under this concession scheme, principally for cashew plantations and for achieving rice self-
sufficiency. The criteria and process by which land is allocated to different groups is not clear, and
concessionaires are not required to pay taxes on the concession land – limiting their value from
the standpoint of strengthening public revenues, as well as raising questions about the transparency
of these transactions. Overall, however, the majority of the rural areas continue to be administered
by traditional authorities in accordance with traditional practices. State land laws are rarely
implemented due to the weak capacity of state land institutions, including the cadastral service, to
implement national policy.

58.     In addition to profitability reasons, the notable increase in the cultivation of cashew
has been partly driven by land customs that tend to increase security of tenure when land is
planted with cashew. Guineans have increasingly sought to concentrate their labor and other
resources in cashew production for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is obtaining returns
on investment. However, incentives to shift to cashew are also strengthened by customary land
tenure norms, which tend to protect investments in land. Since planting of cashew trees is seen as
an improvement to the land (similar to investments in infrastructure), customary practice requires
that the individual/household that planted them continues to hold that land as long as the trees
remain on it. Households, therefore, have a strong incentive to produce cashew rather than
seasonal crops since that helps guarantee longer security of tenure. Moreover, the ability to gain
concessions for cashew outside of the household’s own locality is a powerful incentive to cultivate
cashew among ethnic groups which have inheritance rules that do not benefit direct descendants.
Since the cashew concessions are acquired outside of the clan’s area, they fall outside the
traditional rules of inheritance and can be transferred to sons.14 In some regions, cashew production
has encroached on traditionally managed communal forests, often without the consent of the local
community – leading to societal tensions.

59.     Existing land tenure and inheritance policies undermine agricultural productivity
and inhibit a much needed structural change within and outside agriculture, likely
perpetuating poverty and inequality. A major binding constraint to investment, for both
smallholder and commercial agriculture, is the lack of secure tenure rights. The current mix of
national and customary land usufruct, concessions, and inheritance rights constrains rural
development in several ways. By concentrating land and labor on cashew production, farmers
forego crop portfolio diversification and higher returns in higher-value agricultural activities; in
other words, cashew may offer low short-term risk, but also below-potential returns. Sales and
rental restrictions on agricultural land constrain investments in land and agricultural technology,
employment transition across farm and to non-farm activities, and access to credit and insurance,
and subsequently lead to lower agricultural productivity. By fear of losing the future income stream
of land, insecurity of property rights limits migration. Moreover, these adverse incentives affect
different groups, particularly women, disproportionally. Current land policies also have adverse
impacts on sustainability via environmental or social impacts (conflict) and fiscal/revenue

  However, the rights granted to women under the law are rarely implemented.
14
  Revenues from cashew are principally invested in rice and other consumption goods. However, as a consequence of rapidly spreading cashew
production, traditional rice-fields (bolanhas) have been increasingly neglected, –making usable rice fields increasingly scarce.

implications. A number of models have emerged elsewhere on the continent that would be
illustrative for Guinea-Bissau.15
                                  Box 2.2 Women, Land and Productivity
While statutory law provides equal land rights to men and women, in reality customary practices
impede women’s land rights, with women’s access to land and other assets often dependent on their
marital status. A study conducted for the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) found
that 63 percent of 80 localities visited had no justice services, with 58 percent of individuals stating that
justice was determined by the community (AfDB, 2014). This is important given the discrimination that is
apparent in many of the customs that are followed by the patriarchal communities of Guinea-Bissau. These
customs mean that women largely access land through men. While this puts all women at a disadvantage
and in a state of dependence, it results in particular vulnerability for single, widowed, and divorced women.
Marriage is the institution through which men are allocated land by autochthonous kinship and domestic
groups. Women generally only gain usage rights to such land, as well as the ability to hire labor, through
their husbands. Women have no right to inherit property from their husbands or fathers, and if they are
given any land as inheritance this is usually held in trust and inherited by sons once they marry. Single,
widowed, and divorced women are often given inferior land and may have to re-negotiate access to land
every year.

Women’s agricultural productivity is constrained by their less secure access to land and reduced
access to farm labor. Insecure land rights not only constrains women’s participation in cash crops but may
also reduce their overall agricultural productivity by reducing their incentives to invest in their land. For
example, looking at the case of Ghana, Goldstein and Udry (2008) find that insecure access to land is
associated with lower investments in land fertility. Part of the reason is that those with less secure access,
such as women, feel less able to let their land lie fallow due to the greater risk that their land will be
expropriated. This ultimately results in lower yields for women.

Women’s agricultural productivity is also constrained by having less access to agricultural inputs.
First, female household heads may find it difficult to access farm labor because they have fewer household
members to draw from, due to various factors such as widowhood, migration of their husbands, or divorce.
Secondly, emerging research suggests that women in SSA countries also find it more difficult to hire non-
family farm labor and may achieve lower returns to that labor. Women can less afford to pay for the best
workers and have less time to supervise workers due to their unequal responsibility for domestic chores.
Evidence suggests that all other productive inputs, such as credit, materials, equipment, and training, are
distributed according to the same patriarchal rules that provide men with an advantage in land access
(Boubacar-Sid et al., 2007). Moreover, these customary rules are reflected in the Civil Code (article 1678)
which states that a couple’s assets belong to the husband.

Women’s lower access to productive assets may also constrain their ability to improve their welfare
outside of agriculture. The Civil Code contributes to the difficult environment women find themselves in,
with article 1686 stating that a woman cannot operate a business without her husband’s consent, unless she
owns all of the household’s property or if the couple has specifically chosen to have separate property
(AfDB, 2014). It is not surprising that only 19.9 percent of businesses that took part in the World Bank’s
Enterprise Survey for Guinea-Bissau stated that they have female representation in their ownership,
compared to a Sub-Saharan average of 33 percent (World Bank, 2006).

  In Rwanda, a country equally small, government and civil society have successfully developed land laws and land administration systems for
recognizing land rights for all citizens; elsewhere in former Portuguese Africa, Mozambique has adopted one of the most progressive land laws on
the continent, and laws that allow the recognition of community land rights, and which clarify institutional authority across multiple sectors.

2.4        Assets are not only low but also are used at suboptimal levels

60.     Poorer Guinean households not only suffer from a paucity of human capital and
physical assets, but their ability to productively exploit the assets they do possess is limited,
adding another barrier to exiting poverty. In 2010, labor force participation in Guinea-Bissau
for the population over age 15 is estimated at 67.7 percent,16 comparable to the levels seen in other
countries in the region (Figure 2.19). However, engagement in the labor market is much lower for
some groups of the population. For instance, while over 70 percent of men are working or actively
looking for a job, just over half of women are engaged in the labor market. These differences in
labor participation by gender are higher than the regional average. Furthermore, engagement in
labor activities in Bissau is low. One out of two of economically active individuals from the capital
participate in the labor market compared to three out of four from rural areas (Table 2.2).

61.     Economically active women are disadvantaged in the labor market. The formal sector
is small, with salaried employees making up only 10 percent of the total workforce (AfDB, 2014).
Women are less likely than men to work in the formal sector and, when they do, they are less likely
than men to work in senior or skilled positions. Women make up only 26.5 percent of formal sector
workers (GoGB, 2012). Data from the 2010 ILAP shows that only 4 percent of women report that
their primary occupation pays them a salary, compared to 16 percent of men. Women are also less
likely than men to report working in the private sector (4 percent versus 11 percent), which is
significant because poverty rates are lower for those working in the private sector (World Bank,
2015).

62.     The low intensity of labor utilization is also evident among young, urban men. In 2010,
11.2 percent of male youth (ages 15-24) in Bissau were unemployed, compared to 6.9 percent of
females. The overall unemployment rate for all adults (15+) is 7.3 percent. While unemployment
rates are lower for rural citizens across all age groups and genders, these data might hide significant

   The International Labor Organization’s (ILO) definition of labor force participation is the one used here, and it is calculated as the ratio of the

underemployment which is thought to be especially significant in rural areas (IMF/World Bank,
2011). Unlike men, many women may not even be actively looking for work. According to data
from the 2010 ILAP, poor urban women are the least likely to be economically active (41 percent),
followed by non-poor urban women (44 percent), and poor urban men (59 percent) (see Table 2.2).
Indeed, while men are much more likely to mention the unavailability of jobs as a reason for not
working, women are much more likely to cite domestic responsibilities.

63.     The low demand for labor feeds into the low-level equilibrium in the Guinean
economy. An indication that the labor force is underutilized under current market conditions is the
expressed desire of all of the economically active population to have an extra job or work more
hours (Figures 2.20 and 2.21). Guinea-Bissau is affected with a potentially low intensive margin
of labor. The vast majority (98 percent) of the active labor force has expressed availability to do
more work, while 37.7 percent have sought out ways to further generate income. Within the latter
group, over half report doing so by working extra hours in a secondary occupation, while 27
percent report working extra hours in their current occupation, and 15 percent report changing jobs
to seek out higher returns. Further highlighting under-utilization of labor, 11 percent of the male
working-age population that are neither working nor seeking work cite low demand for labor as a
discouraging factor. As noted above, illness, hunger and disabilities impose further limitations on
the ability of the population to provide their labor and increase productivity (see Box 2.3 on the
impact of demographic changes on the labor market).

64.     Autonomous household activities are the main type of economic activity practiced in
rural areas, especially among the poor. The majority of rural households participate in
autonomous household activities, ranging from agriculture to trade and crafts, and small
businesses. A clearly visible, probably not surprising, pattern is that households in the lower
income/consumption quartile tend to participate more in these autonomous economic activities.
Transition from these potentially less-rewarding autonomous economic activities to private and
public sector employment is limited among poor households. Only a 2 percentage points decline
(from 89 to 87 percent) in the share of households participating in autonomous activity was
recorded between 2002 and 2010 for households in the lower consumption quartile. On the other
hand, a higher proportion of households in the upper two quartiles have moved to private and
public sector employment, which is more rewarding.

65.     Utilization of natural resources is inefficient and hinders their sustainability.
Terrestrial and some sea-based resources are over-utilized. The Land Law (which rules out
freehold property rights for individuals, groups, businesses, and institutions), multiple customary
land practices, and an uncertain system of land concessions overlap to discourage utilization and
investments in land. For instance, customary land tenure norms establish that households that plant
cashews can hold the land as long as cashew trees remain. This incentivizes households to grow
cashews extensively. Cashew trees grow easily, and planting them closely enough reduces the
scope for invasive plants to develop between trees, thus reducing maintenance need and allowing
larger areas to be colonized. As a result, natural resources such as forests are over-utilized (or
simply lost) relative to the level that would allow sustainability. 
 

        Box 2.3. Opportunities and risks from future demographic changes in Guinea-Bissau
Demographic projections suggest that the working age population will increase relative to the total
population. Based on the UN’s fertility and mortality assumptions, Box Figure B2.3.1 maps out
demographic projections for Guinea-Bissau. The figure shows that the population will grow rapidly, given
the currently high fertility rates. By 2100, the population is estimated to quadruple. However, the
composition of the age structure changes. As both fertility and mortality rates fall, the ratio of the working
age population to dependents (that is, children and teenagers below the age of 15 and elderly people 65
years or older) is projected to rise from 54 to 65 percent.

Improving dependency ratios can result in a ‘demographic dividend’. World Bank simulations suggest
that the increase in the working age population presents a considerable opportunity for Guinea-Bissau.
Assuming that labor force participation rates are roughly constant (at 67 percent, according to the ILAP II),
unemployment remains at about 8 percent (ILO estimate), and that labor productivity grows at its historical
average of about 0.4 percent, the demographic change alone will raise GDP per capita by 20 percent in real
terms comparing 2050 to 2015 levels. Additional improvements in the labor markets would result in further
prosperity gains. For example, increasing the labor force participation rate gradually from 67 to 80 percent
would boost real GDP per capita by a total of 39 percent. Raising labor productivity by 0.1 percentage
point per year would more than double GDP per-capita levels.

Demographic change, however, also constitutes a major risk as new jobseekers put pressure on the
labor market. A ‘demographic dividend’ can only occur when new labor market entrants find productive
jobs. Given the current underemployment in Guinea-Bissau, the relatively low returns to labor, potentially
diminishing returns in the cashew sector, and limited job opportunities outside cashew, the probability that
the labor market will struggle to absorb incoming generations is relatively high. In this case, household
income will fall as the younger generations will add little additional income to families. This would likely

translate into an increase in poverty. It may also be a source for social dissent which can be particularly
perilous in a fragile state like Guinea-Bissau.

2.5        Returns to assets are inadequate and undiversified

66.      The overall low returns to assets highlights the wide scope of the low-productivity and
fragile economy equilibrium that characterizes Guinea-Bissau. Most poor households are
engaged in agriculture, mainly in cashews, and subsist with lower returns. This is rooted in large
differences in ownership of physical and human capital between the non-poor, and the poor and
extreme poor. It is also a result of an economy that has been plagued by frequent bouts of
instability, and a resulting short-term outlook in which the elite is better positioned to capitalize
on short-term gains. It is also anchored in poor infrastructure (roads, ports and
telecommunications), which disconnects farmers from markets and keeps transaction costs high.
Symptoms of this underdeveloped and unstable labor economy include a high prevalence of
informal jobs, low educational achievement, and a context where households are unable to make
long-term, higher-risk investments in both the non-agricultural and agricultural sectors. This
reality is even more prevalent among the extreme poor perpetuating overall high poverty rates and
inequality.

67.    Generally, the effect of education on earnings is positive in Guinea-Bissau, but the
highest returns to education are almost exclusively enjoyed by the better-off individuals,
underscoring the high concentration of public and private rents. Returns to schooling for
Guinea-Bissau were obtained from the estimation of a standard Mincer earnings equation using
ILAP-2010 data17 (see Annex 2B). The results are consistent with the notion that more education

   Unfortunately, this dataset lacks information on individual earnings. For this reason, a synthetic individual was constructed, comprising the
averaged values of all working individuals within a household, as a best approximation of individual returns to education. To ensure robustness and
comparability, two sets of estimations were performed. Given that earnings were reported only at the household level, both sets of equations use
the same values for the dependent variable (log of monthly earnings), but the latter (that is: i.e. synthetic) uses an averaged value for each of the
explanatory variables in the equations.



                                                                                        36
contributes to higher earnings. The average return for a year of education is in the order of 5
percent. However, the average effect masks variations in returns across education levels. While
returns to primary education are negligible—at least in a statistical sense—the wage premium is
concentrated among workers that have completed secondary education (4 percent) or some years
of or completed tertiary education (8 percent). These differential returns across education levels
tend to exacerbate poverty and inequality due to the low level of school attainment of moderate
and extreme poor households (Annex Table 2B.1). 1). In addition to formal education, the
agricultural sector where most of the poor work, lacks extension services. Informality and low
levels of education, already more prevalent among the rural poor, are coupled with a lack of
extension services, which could disseminate off-the-shelf knowledge and help boost productivity.

68.     Even though poor and non-poor households benefit from accumulating secondary
and tertiary education, the poor exhibit a relatively higher return, which points to
underinvestment in education for this group of people. In the case of completed secondary
education, the return among the poor is 52 percent higher than for the non-poor (5.3 percent
compared to 3.4 percent). Along the same lines, on average poor households see a wage earnings
increase 2.2 percentage points faster than their non-poor counterparts (8.4 percent compared to 6.2
percent) as they accumulate tertiary education (Annex Table 2B.1). These results suggests that
increasing investments in the education of low income households would substantially raise the
return that they can derive from their human capital. In reality, however, most people with
secondary and tertiary education belong to better-off households.

69.      Informality is highly prevalent in the labor market, due to the large reliance on
agriculture and to informal contracts in other sectors of the economy. This translates into low
labor productivity and low returns. Informal work is identified in this analysis with the type of
remuneration, meaning informal pay is taken as a proxy for informality in the labor market. Within
this definition, 90 percent of the labor force is employed in the informal economy in Guinea-
Bissau; this is larger outside of the capital (96 percent) and smaller in Bissau (67 percent) (Figure
2.22). Looking across sectors, agriculture is nearly all informal, whereas industry and services
house roughly two-thirds of informal persons within each sector. Figure 2.23 presents a breakdown
for the type of remuneration in Guinea-Bissau. A large share of informal employment is associated
with higher poverty and lower returns, as informal work tends to be marked by poor working
conditions and an absence of legal identity, implying low job security and a lack of social
protection mechanisms (International Labor Organization (ILO) 2015).

70.      In the main economic sector (cashews), women do not benefit as much as men from
the economic returns—even though about half of the cashew workforce is female. Cashews
account for 26 percent of income (net of remittances) for female-headed households compared to
35 percent for male-headed households (ILAP, 2010). As with all agricultural production,
women’s roles in the cashew industry tend to be at the bottom of the value chain and they have
little control over key productive inputs. In a sector where returns for poor farmers are already low
compared to non-poor counterparts, men own most of the land on which cashews are grown (see
Box 2.2 above dealing with land and productivity issue), they make the key decisions on whether
and when to sell, and they take the lead selling the nuts to middlemen and processors, who also
tend to be men (AfDB, 2014). Women, on the other hand, farm and harvest the cashews, peel and

sort the nuts, and are involved in processing the cashew stem or fruit, which is much less valuable
than the nuts, which are seen as belonging to men (AfDB, 2014).

71.     Low returns are also evident among workers that have jobs thought to be more stable
and of better quality. Overall labor earnings are remarkably low across all types of jobs, yet
having a salaried (often more formalized) job commands relatively higher wages. Poverty
measured at US$2 (national poverty line) is 56.7 percent for households whose heads are salaried
and 71.8 percent for the unsalaried. The fact that more than half of the households whose household
heads are employed in wage jobs are poor is indicative of a low-productivity, low-returns context,
even in the sectors that are relatively more developed. This highlights that the general constraints
to productivity, such as low human capital, infrastructure, and technology, are not only present in
agriculture but permeate all aspects of the labor market, creating bottlenecks to growth.

72.    Returns are eroded by high transaction costs. As noted above, weak connectivity to
markets limits households’ ability to diversify away from cashew and to benefit from higher prices
when demand is high. For instance, trade and crafts contributed 11 percent of incomes of
households that are less than half an hour commute (on foot) from markets, but their role declines

continuously to only 3 percent for those households that are located more than one hour walk from
markets. Higher poverty rates for those with difficult access to basic infrastructure and remoteness
from markets underscores potential transaction costs and lower farm gate prices, particularly in
rural areas. According to data from 2010, households with easier access to local markets and public
transit were less poor on average. Between those near (0-30 minutes) and far (more than one hour)
from public transit and from a local market the difference in poverty rates was of 15 and 19
percentage points, respectively. In general, households within short commutes to markets have
better diversified income sources.

73.     The largely agrarian economy has to cope with low returns to labor, capital, and
ensuing low agricultural yields. The large share of value added by agriculture in Guinea-Bissau
(explored further in Section 3, below) implies that low productivity in this sector has deep
economic implications. With the plethora of challenges facing rural households, including low
human capital, market disconnect, and few systems to disseminate agricultural knowledge, the
sector has not seen much technological advance over the years, with yields low when compared to
the region (Figure 2.24). Rice yields are lower than the regional average and have been stagnant,
while cashew yields have been below the regional average in spite of an upward trend.

74.     In the agricultural sector, returns may also be inhibited by Guineans’ heavy reliance
on raw cashew production/exports, because the sector is often subject to political and climate
shocks, and relative prices showed a declining trend in the 2000s. Political turmoil derails
economic activity, including the cashew sector. Indeed, cashew prices collapsed in 2012 in
response to the military coup. Returns in the cashew sector are vulnerable to shocks from natural
disasters, whether they are diseases or shocks from climate change. Moreover, the cashew price
that Guinea-Bissau collects was falling (at least before 2014) in real terms with the exception of
the increases observed during the commodity price shock of 2011 and the upward trend after 2014.
At the same time, the rice price has risen modestly. Although rice is grown on a subsistence basis,
rice imports have been increasing.18 Rising rice prices and falling cashew prices have driven a
deterioration in the cashew-to-rice price. Finally, the high risk of political turmoil may keep

  Per capita rice imports between 2008 and 2014 were twice the size of imported volumes between 2000 and 2007. Rice is the second most
important import good for Guinea-Bissau, after fuel.

hampering long-term returns.

2.6   Private transfers provide modest support to household incomes

75.     While employment opportunities and incomes remain low in Guinea-Bissau, private
transfers support household incomes and diversification. Based on data from ILAP2, nearly
one-fifth of Guinean households report receiving transfers. Perhaps due to easier access to
financial services, infrastructure, and migratory connection, the proportion of households in Bissau
receiving transfers such as remittances or internal transfers was closer to 25 percent compared to
15 percent elsewhere. The income share of private transfers is 7.3 percent for the whole population
and 41 percent when looking exclusively at recipient households, indicating a significant support
to household income.

76.     The highest rate of transfer receipt occurs in female-headed households located in
Bissau, indicating a pattern of migration of male workers out of Bissau as well as frequent
flows of internal transfers to support widows. It is not uncommon for men to be more likely to
migrate to look for work elsewhere, leaving households to be headed by female spouses. This
pattern of migration is more evident in the capital city and helps explain why female-headed
households are less poor than male-headed households. Almost half (42 percent) of female-headed
households in Bissau were transfer-receiving households as opposed to 23 percent in other parts
of the country. Consequently, the income share from transfers is more than three times higher in
female-headed households compared to male-headed households—16.3 and 5 percent,
respectively. At the same time, a large proportion of households whose head is a widow,
particularly women, receive transfers, also suggesting that internal transfers between support
communities and families are at play.

77.      Private transfers contribute moderately to alleviate poverty. Poverty rates are lower
for households receiving transfers both in urban and rural areas, although this difference is only
statistically significant in rural areas. Simulation analysis suggests that the overall poverty rate
would be 1.6 percentage points higher in the absence of private transfers (Table 2.3). As expected,
the effects are more concentrated among female-headed households, for which the incidence of
poverty would increase by 4.4 percentage points (from 65.4 to 69.9 percent). The modest overall
effect of remittances on poverty is likely driven by the limited financial infrastructure of Guinea-
Bissau and by liquidity constraints that limit the ability of low income households to migrate.
Indeed, households in the bottom 40 percent are almost half as likely as those in the top quintile to
be the recipient of a domestic or international transfer.

2.7        Household well-being is highly vulnerable to shocks

Risks from natural disasters and climate change

78.     There is already evidence that Guinea-Bissau’s climate is changing in a number of
ways. These changes range from increasing rainfall variability, to late onset of the rainy season,
to increases in temperature, and to a rise in sea level and tidal surges (see Annex 2C on climate
change impacts). For instance, average yearly temperature has increased about 1°C over the past
decades. Observations suggest a shortening of the cool season during the months of December-
February. Trends show increased irregularity in precipitation, together with an overall trend of
decreased mean annual precipitation and seasonal precipitation. Changes in rainfall patterns are
leading to longer, hotter dry seasons, particularly in the northeastern interior, resulting in seasonal
water shortages which directly affect access to water for the population’s needs, as well as for
agriculture, and livestock. Flooding events occur frequently in inland and coastal areas, causing
severe impacts on infrastructure, agriculture, and public health. Approximately 70 percent of the
population lives in the coastal area, making it highly vulnerable to rising tides and sea levels
Projections suggest that these trends are likely to be exacerbated going forward since Guinea-
Bissau, while a low emission country, is highly vulnerable to the impact of global climate change,
ranking second only to Bangladesh on the 2014 Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI)19
(see Box 2.4 below on the Government policy on climate change).

79.      Climate stress, in conjunction with anthropogenic pressure (especially slash and burn
agriculture, cashew plantation, and logging), has the potential to accelerate deforestation
and degradation of forest cover as well as to affect a number of other sectors. The country’s
terrestrial and mangrove forests are of critical importance to local livelihoods. Forests also have
significant economic value both as a source of timber and carbon stocks, as an essential breeding
and nursery ground for the country’s fishing stock, and as an important defense against floods and
saline intrusion from rising sea levels. These ecological services directly and indirectly underpin
the well-being of the population. At the household level, non-timber forest resources provide,
among other things, food, medicine, construction materials, shelter, and fuel. Fuel wood and
charcoal, together with agricultural biomass, make up 80 percent of the country’s energy
consumption; the poor spend 15 to 20 percent of their income on energy alone. Changes in the
quantity of both forest timber and non-timber resources will thus have direct impacts upon the
subsistence livelihoods of the poor, and particularly on woman for whom the collection of fuel
requires considerable time and effort. A number of other economic activities, ranging from
fisheries to nature-based tourism, would also be adversely affected by climate change, and there
will likely also be important impacts on infrastructure, urbanization, water supply, and health as
well.

   The CCVI ranks the climate related risks to the populations, business and governments of 67 countries over the next 30 years, down to a level of
22km² worldwide. It is based on three factors: (1) exposure to extreme climate-related events, including sea level rise and future changes in
temperature, precipitation, and specific humidity; (2) the sensitivity of populations, in terms of health, education, agricultural dependence, and
available infrastructure; and (3) the adaptive capacity of countries to combat the impacts of climate change, which encompasses, R&D, economic
factors, resource security, and the effectiveness of government (Maplecroft CCVI 2015).




                                                                       41
                         Box 2.4. The Government policy on climate change
Guinea-Bissau has signed and ratified the Framework Convention on Climate Changes and the
Kyoto Protocol, and has undertaken a considerable amount of policy planning and analysis about
climate change adaptation. It has prepared an initial and second National Communication on Climate
Change (2004 and 2011, respectively), and prepared a National Programme of Action of Adaptation to
Negative Effects of Climate Changes (NAPA, 2006). The NAPA assessed the country’s vulnerability to
climate change and proposed steps and priority activities to reduce and/or mitigate the negative effects of
climate changes, and to implement early warning and forecasting measures enabling a response to future
catastrophes.

The country’s development strategy for 2015-2025 also addresses the climate change theme.
Specifically, it calls for the implementation of the National Protected Areas Strategy, the preparation of an
overarching National Sustainable Development Strategy, and the creation of a specific Climate Plan
focused on increase resilience to climate change. The development strategy also highlights the intention to
implement a coastal protection plan and an adaptation and mitigation plan to response to the physical and
social risks posed by climate change. The State Secretariat of Environment is completing a detailed review
and analysis of environmental governance as the first step towards the preparation of the National
Sustainable Development Strategy.

As is the case for managing natural resources across the board, the country’s capacity to address the
challenges and risks of climate change is weak. Natural resource information and data is limited and of
variable quality, as is the monitoring of climate parameters. Institutional capacity varies between the
multiple sectors, but overall the capacity for on-the-ground implementation and enforcement is limited.
Over the past few years, the country’s increasing awareness of the importance of addressing these
challenges has been demonstrated by the preparation and request for donor support for a growing number
of climate-related projects (not all financed), such as: those aimed at improving the knowledge base, and
implementing actions, to promote climate resilience and adaptation in the agricultural and water sectors as
well as in the coastal zone; strengthening the climate early warning system; developing forest monitoring
systems; and building institutional capacity, among others.

Risks stemming from other systemic and idiosyncratic shocks

80.     The well-being of households in Guinea-Bissau is also highly susceptible to other
systemic shocks, such as military coups, civil strife, social upheaval, macroeconomic shocks,
and harvest failures. GDP per capita has fallen in Guinea-Bissau following the military coups
and bouts of political instability that have affected the country (Figure 1.1). Moreover, the negative
effects of growth collapse, changes in food prices, terms of trade shocks, and harvest failures are
likely to disproportionally affect the poor, who lack effective formal and informal means to prepare
ex ante for these risks, and to cope with their consequences as they materialize into major shocks.
As result, households tend to rely on sub-optimal coping strategies, such as reducing consumption,
cutting back on investments in the human capital of children, high-interest borrowing, or selling
productive assets. In preparation to confront the effects of shocks, households may also smooth
income ex ante by engaging in economic activities that allow the exchange of lower risks for lower
returns. Opportunities for family and community risk-sharing are likely undermined by the
covariant nature of the shocks.

81.    Households are also largely exposed to idiosyncratic shocks. Mortality risks associated
with childbearing, for instance, are high given the high rates of maternal mortality. At 560 deaths


                                                     42
per 100,000 live births, maternal mortality in Guinea-Bissau is among the highest in all Africa.
Infant mortality rates are equally high. The most common causes of morbidity and death, such as
respiratory infections, diarrhea, malaria, and HIV/AIDS are either preventable or treatable. Health
shocks often result in over 40 percent of health care out-of-pocket payments, increasing the risk
for affected household to fall further back into poverty.

Public and private mechanisms for risk mitigation are weak

82. Public risk management and coping mechanisms basically do not exist, exposing the
population to great risks from even common life events. Limited fiscal space means that there
is limited room for the Government to mitigate shocks, whether they are from the local economy
or from natural events. Low capacity also limits the ability of the government to develop disaster
management plans or to prepare adaptation strategies for climate change. The government’s
limited presence in rural areas means that these areas are particularly vulnerable to shocks. As the
2015 CEM illustrates, the country lacks social security and social assistance programs to protect
against these income shocks, help smooth consumption over the life cycle, reduce poverty, and
promote greater human development. Similarly, risks from old age remain uncovered, because
there are no formal pension systems that protect the elderly except for a few particular schemes
with similar objectives catering to some civil servants and the military. Simulations suggest that a
well-targeted cash transfer scheme equivalent to 1.5 percent of GDP could reduce extreme poverty
by up to 10 percentage points.

83.     In view of the underdeveloped financial sector and poor investment climate, private
risk management is also limited in Guinea-Bissau. The financial sector is shallow in Guinea-
Bissau, as explained further below. This also means that there are few insurance companies
(including micro-insurance) that could offer products to consumers to hedge their risks. Partly, this
is linked to the country’s poor investment climate. Risk management, especially for the poor, takes
two forms: (1) private transfers, whether they are remittances or social transfers within
communities, such as to the elderly or to widows, and (2) diversified agricultural production.
However, the dependence of households on cashews has risen, reinforced by the nature of cashew
production which only allows very limited intercropping.20 As a consequence, the increase in
cashew production in the absence of formal risk management and coping systems has come at the
expense of limiting risk mitigation through agricultural diversification.

     For example, the juice of cashew apples is poisonous to many other crops.

                    3    MACRO LEVEL COUNTRY CONTEXT

 Growth in Guinea-Bissau has been systematically low. GDP per capita grew by 0.7 percent
annually between 2003 and 2014, less than half the average recorded for the Sub-Saharan
region (1.5 percent) during the same period.

 The structure of Guinea-Bissau’s economy has barely changed over the last two decades.
Growth performance is volatile, with the production and export of a single commodity as the
engine of growth. The production of cashews is concentrated in the first rung of the value ladder
and engages 75 percent of small farmers, underscoring the tight connection between incomes
and movements in farm gate prices or production levels, especially for the poor.

 The existing economic structure limits its resilience to mitigate the impact of shocks (terms of
trade, political, and natural) and the intense competition for rents among the elite undermines
the maximization of additional economic opportunities (cashew processing, rice, fisheries,
mining, and tourism).

 Low and unpredictable public revenues, regressive and distortionary taxation, and poor
quality of public expenditure limits the effectiveness and equity of the fiscal policy.

 The current business climate is not conducive to the generation of growth, employment, and
productive capital. Financial inclusion is among the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa, and
infrastructure is in a woeful state, from the port to roads, to access to electricity, to potable
water, and to telephone and the Internet. Guinea-Bissau is at the bottom for all of the 10 Doing
Business indicators. The improvement of the business climate is an important prerequisite to
increasing the inflow of private investments, which can boost non-agricultural activities, helping
to diversify incomes. It will also provide opportunities to help leverage the existing agricultural
activities, mainly in cashew production and processing.

 Low investments is an important pillar of a vicious circle of low productivity, low growth,
lack of opportunities, and elite capture which then feeds back into low investments, suggesting
that the country is trapped in a low-growth equilibrium. Nevertheless, there are emerging
opportunities to support more consistent growth, particularly drawing on electricity cooperation
across West Africa, telecommunications permeability through mobile services, and improvement
of cashew-related country infrastructure.

 Low and unstable growth constitutes the second core area of binding constraints for poverty
reduction and shared prosperity in Guinea-Bissau. To overcome this challenge, while
capitalizing on emerging green shoots in the economy to boost poverty reduction and shared
prosperity, Guinea-Bissau will need to implement policy actions geared towards diversifying the
economy, improving cross-cutting economic and production support services, increasing
financial inclusion, increasing flexibility of the labor market, enhancing fiscal discipline and
public revenue collection and efficiency, and capitalizing on regional integration of markets and
infrastructure. Participation in regional and international organizations could provide added
policy discipline.

84.      Guinea-Bissau has lost decades without achieving significant growth,
underperforming relative to most of its peers since independence. The economy, which is
dependent on the cultivation and export of unprocessed cashew nuts, has barely grown over the
past twenty-five years, recording average GDP per capita growth of about 0.7 percent significantly
below peers. In fact, Guinea-Bissau is one of the slowest growing economies in the continent. The
country’s inability to break out of the low growth, high poverty incidence trap can be attributable
to its narrow economic base, low human capital, and the absence of fiscal buffers, which increases
it’s susceptibility to shocks. There is a strong negative correlation between Guinea-Bissau’s
growth performance and political developments. This is further compounded by weak budget
management practices and fiscal policies which distort the allocation of capital and lower
investment productivity. The wage bill accounts for a significant part of fiscal revenues, thereby
reducing the fiscal space available for productivity-enhancing public spending, including public
investment which is complementary to private investment and expenditures on education and
health. As Chapter 4 will show, institutional and political economy factors are major impediments
to strengthening fiscal policy and management of public finances in the country. Existing
organizational structures have not supported the required fiscal discipline. The country has also
been unable to raise productivity levels in the context of relatively low investments, poor
infrastructure, inadequate human resources, limited access to finance, unaccommodating business
and regulatory environments, coupled with weak linkages across sectors, and low technological
infusion into productive activities.  
 
85.      The analysis described in this chapter shows that Guinea-Bissau’s persistent low
growth does not reflect its potential, in view of the country’s abundant natural resources and
its advantageous geographical location.  Guinea-Bissau possesses opportunities to grow much
faster, but the key to unlocking this potential will require action on several fronts including, among
others, obtaining assistance from multilateral agencies, regional institutions such as the WAEMU
and ECOWAS, and other stakeholders for technical and financial support to anchor critical
interventions, while also introducing initiatives to directly address the underlined weaknesses in
the existing business environment and governance framework (see Chapter 4 for a more detailed
discussion, and Box 3.1 below for a discussion of the Government reform agenda). It has been
empirically shown that improving fiscal institutions and boosting fiscal space through raising tax
revenue and containing current spending, as well as through lower military spending and, to some
extent, higher social expenditures, are significantly and robustly associated with building
resilience. The commitment to an IMF program suggests a willingness on the part of the
Government to start tackling some of these issues. While these are difficult reforms and may take
time, the country has the opportunity to advance its development agenda by capitalizing on
emerging green shoots in agriculture and other sectors by creating an environment for greater
private sector participation in the economy. The country has been producing groundnuts with some
degree of success, and the Government has also initiated steps to encourage sesame production.
There is also potential in cashew processing, cultivation in rice, and a diversified range of efforts
involving cereal, fruits and tubers. Fisheries and mining are also recognized as possible engines of
growth. While the country possesses significant natural beauty, the potential of the tourism sector
remains largely untapped. Moving into higher value-added activities in industry and services will
be crucial for achieving the growth rates Guinea-Bissau will require to catch-up with other
countries.

                Box 3.1. “Terra Ranca” is the Government reform agenda moving forward
    The Government elected in 2014 has committed to an ambitious reform agenda in order to turn the
    vicious cycle between fragility and poverty into a virtuous one of stability and prosperity. The plan’s
    vision for 2025 is “a positive Guinea-Bissau, politically stable through inclusive development, good
    governance, and preservation of its biodiversity.” The operational plan—with which the 2015 CEM was
    closely aligned—underpinning specific planned investments is based on six strategic axes: (1) governance
    and peace; (2) infrastructures; (3) industrialization; (4) urban development; (5) human development; and
    (6) biodiversity. The strategy identifies four growth sectors, agriculture/agribusiness, fisheries, tourism,
    and mining, which are framed by major investments to upgrade the electricity and Information and
    Communications Technologies (ICT) sectors. The implementation of the operational plan is expected to
    bring significant short-term economic benefits, especially in the construction and retail sectors. The plan
    was presented to the donor community at the pledging conference in March 2015, when US$1.5bn were
    mobilized over five years. Box Figure B3.3.1 illustrates the intended distribution for these investments
    across the strategic axes and growth sectors respectively.


3.1      Growth has been low, largely due to a narrow economic base

86.     Growth in Guinea-Bissau has been low, especially when compared to the economic
performance of the region (Figure 3.1). Real activities expanded at an annual average rate of 0.4
percent per year in per capita terms between 2000 and 2014, significantly below the average 1.9
percent recorded for the Sub-Saharan region during the same period. This occurred in the context
of extreme political instability, and recovery from these disruptions has often been slow. More
recently, in 2010 and 2011, stronger and positive growth was recorded (2.1 percent and 6.5 percent,
respectively), influenced by a sharp rise in the global price for cashews (as a consequence of the
global commodity disruption in supplies from Cote d’Ivoire due to civil war). This stability was,
however, short-lived as a result of the major coup in 2012, which was followed by other bouts of
instability in 2015 and 2016. Growth turned negative to -1.8 percent in 2012 before gradually
recovering to approximately 5 percent in 2015 from 2.9 percent and 0.8 percent in 2014 and 2013,
respectively.

87.     In per capita terms, Guinea-Bissau has also fallen behind many of its peers.
Comparing Guinea-Bissau with its closest 19 African peers in per capita GDP in 1990 shows that
the country has lost ground. Between 1990 and 2014, Guinea-Bissau’s real per capita GDP
declined by 12.3 percent falling from 10th to 18th in this group of 20 countries (see Table 3.1).
Notably, only Congo and Central African Republic performed worse than Guinea-Bissau.
Neighbors, Senegal and Guinea–Conakry, not included in the list of twenty closest peer countries
in per capita terms, both recorded growth in income over the period.

88.      The structure of the economy has barely changed over the last two decades, contrary
to developments in broader Sub-Saharan Africa (see the comparison between Guinea-Bissau
and Cabo Verde in Box 3.2). A breakdown of the Guinean output shows that the composition
across sectors has remained fairly constant between 1987 and 2013. The contribution of agriculture
to total value added has oscillated about 43 percent. Industries contribute 16 percent of GDP, while
services make up roughly 41 percent. This is a contrast to the Sub-Saharan African average where
both service and industry account for the major part of GDP, and where agriculture, though
important, has a relatively small share. The share of services has progressively increased in the
region from 45 to 58 percent, whereas the role of agriculture declined from 20.5 percent and 14.5



                                                   47
percent.21 In contrast, this shift from the primary to the tertiary sector is not observed in Guinea-
Bissau. The service sector is concentrated in Bissau and is mostly informal. Almost 76 percent of
workers in the capital are engaged in informal businesses, such as the sales of handicrafts and other
street vendor items, and in restaurants and hotels.

89.     Guinea-Bissau’s economy is largely agrarian. Production in the country is closely linked
to the products of the soil, which is dominated by cashew cultivation but which also includes a few
other activities, such as small scale rice production and horticulture. It is estimated that the country
produces about 200,000 metric tons of cashew nus per year. Agriculture is mostly a family activity,
a large portion of it which is unpaid due to alternatives such as subsistence or bartering. About 80
percent of workers are employed in the sector, most with low levels of human capital. Virtually all
small farmers are engaged in growing at least some cashew, underscoring the tight connection
between incomes and movements in farm gate prices or production levels, especially for the poor.
A small proportion of cashew nuts is consumed domestically and there is also limited processing
of cashew apples into juice and wine for domestic consumption. Given the high dependence on
cashew nuts, Guinea-Bissau’s economy is largely undiversified and, hence, highly vulnerable to
demand, supply and price shocks (Figure 3.2).

90.     The dominance of cashews is also evident in the balance of payments. Guinea-Bissau
is a relatively open economy with exports and imports approximating 70 percent of GDP.
Unprocessed cashew nuts are also the main export, accounting for 85 to 99 percent of the country’s
total exports (see Figure 3.3.). While almost all unprocessed cashews are exported through the port
of Bissau, a part of the production is smuggled through Senegal and the Gambia. The country’s
main market for its cashew nuts is India, where the raw nuts are further processed for local
consumption and re-exported to Asian and other developed countries. 22 Other sources of external
earnings are remittances (an estimated 7–8 percent of GDP in recent years) and donor flows. The
main imports are fuel and food—the two items being equivalent to about 60 percent of total
imports. However, this share has fluctuated in recent years due to variation in world prices for both
oil and grains, among other reasons. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has been relatively low, at
about 2 percent of GDP over the past 10 years. 	




                                                            
21
    Economic performance of other sectors have been modestly satisfactory but they make up for a small fraction of the economy. Of the 16 economic
subsectors, construction (20 percent), mining (20 percent) and financial services (17 percent) were the fastest growing between 2007 and 2013.
However, these three sectors combined account for less than 5 percent of GDP. The most important sectors - agriculture and wholesale/retail trade
- grew at annual average rates of 3 percent and 4 percent, respectively. 
22
    The recent CEM also confirms that the country is has a large fishing sector though fish exports do not show up in the official export statistics.
EU vessels have fishing rights in Guinea-Bissau, paid for under an EU fisheries agreement, with receipts classified as a transfer in balance of
payments statistics, and a government revenue.

                       Box 3.2. Economic Growth in Guinea-Bissau and Cabo Verde
    The Portuguese colonies of Guinea-Bissau and Cabo Verde achieved independence in 1974,
    following a liberation struggle that lasted almost 20 years. The path to independence is often described
    as having been one of the longest and bloodiest on the continent. Following a military coup in 1981,
    which saw Luís Cabral—an ethnic Cabo Verdean—being deposed from the presidency, Guinea-Bissau
    and Cabo Verde separated and went down independent development paths. Starting out at roughly equal
    levels of gross national income (GNI) per capita (in purchasing power parity [PPP] terms), Cabo Verde
    has grown rapidly, graduating from the United Nations (UN) list of Least-Developed Countries
    (LDCs) in 2007 and now enjoys income levels four times that of Guinea-Bissau. Guinea-Bissau,
    however, remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with a GNI per capita of US$ 590 (Atlas
    method).

    The difference in the growth outturn between both countries has been largely attributed to the
    interruptions caused by frequent coups and other political upheavals in Guinea-Bissau. Both Cabo
    Verde and Guinea-Bissau embarked on a process of democratic transition in the 1990s which gave birth
    to a period of growth. In Guinea-Bissau, however, growth came to a sudden halt in 1998 when civil war
    erupted. Although peace returned in 1999, economic dynamism
    did not, and fragility continued to mark the Guinean landscape.
    A period of relative calm began after the assassination of
    Guinean strongman Nino Vieira in 2009. In spite of occasional
    incidents in the wake of this event, the country experienced a
    rare period of stability and economic resurgence. But another
    intervention by the army during the run-off of presidential
    elections in April 2012 stifled optimism yet again and derailed a
    hopeful period of cautious progress.

    Another important explanation for the divergence in growth
    performance relates to the fact that unlike Guinea-Bissau,
    Cabo Verde had better organized institutional and policy frameworks which made it possible for
    the country to capitalize on early incentives to promote Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).
    Investments in human capital created a better-educated workforce, which afforded Cabo Verde a literacy
    rate of 62 percent at the time of its independence, the region’s highest. In this context, the country was
    generally better prepared to meet the challenges of independence, and thus enjoyed more favorable
    growth prospects.


91.     Trade with regional neighbors is almost non-existent in spite of its advantageous
position, pointing to medium- and long-run benefits of investment in infrastructure. Many of
Guinea-Bissau’s neighbors are landlocked, requiring good roads and, where possible, rail networks
in linking these countries to both regional and global markets. Cashew is also produced in some
of the neighboring countries, although on a more limited scale. Non-tariff barriers associated with
the high transactions costs hinders progress. These costs are due to inadequate transport
infrastructure, inefficiencies in customs procedures, and poor quality and costly logistics deriving
from weak competition among service providers. The existing road network, the primary, basic
artery of economic activity, is very deficient, particularly feeder roads which stem from main roads
connecting producers with processors and other markets.

92.     The potential for agriculture to contribute to output growth and economic prosperity
in Guinea-Bissau is constrained by several bottlenecks. Productivity in the sector remains weak.
For instance, yields for rice (about 1.7T/ha) and millet and sorghum (0.8T/ha) are well below the
standards for countries with similar agro-climatic conditions. Major constraints limiting the use of
the existing agricultural potential, include: (1) unclear land rights and poor land management
systems; (2) lack of hydro-agricultural developments; (3) limited access to inputs and technologies
to support production; (4) inadequate investment in R&D and extension; (5) underdeveloped
agribusiness value chains with low ratios of food processing to primary agriculture due to poor
infrastructure (logistics, energy, storage, and so forth), (6) a lack of finance for agriculture; and (7)
an unpredictable policy environment and a dearth of market information. The deteriorated state of
rural road networks and the lack of a sufficient power supply network increases costs for farmers
and agro-business, lowering their productivity and competitiveness. Political instability has also
slowed agri-processing investments.23 In this context, Guinea-Bissau is weakly integrated into
regional and global agricultural value chains, in particular due to an unfavorable business
environment and a lack of infrastructure to support production and trade.
	
93.     The high reliance on agriculture also translates into very little economic
diversification and concentration in low value-added sectors. The structure of the economy in
Guinea-Bissau is very basic. In addition to cashew output, most of Guinean products are
concentrated in the first rung of the value ladder. Almost all of Guinean exports serve as raw inputs
to more sophisticated value chains in other countries. This limits the ability of the economy to
diversify into other products and to create forward and backward linkages with other sectors.
Cashew is the best example of a raw material with considerable potential to add value through
processing (see discussion of potential growth factors for Guinea-Bissau in Box 3.3).

   There are only a few isolated cases of foreign investors, mainly involved in rice cultivation (production and processing) and in horticulture in the
Bafatá region.

              Box 3.3. How much does Guinea-Bissau have to grow to catch up with the world?
    Guinea-Bissau continues to lag behind global growth and GDP per capita levels, as well as those of
    Sub-Saharan Africa. A considerable growth spurt will be required to catch up. GDP per capita in
    Guinea-Bissau stood at just under US$570, compared to US$1,057 for all of Sub-Saharan Africa,
    US$7,857 for the world and almost US$32,400 in the best regional performer — the Organization for
    Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) economies. Even if Guinea-Bissau grew by 9 percent
    on average, as assumed in the government’s development strategy, it would take the country over 50
    years to catch up with the rest of the world. Box Figure B3.3.1 uses UN population projections and
    assumes historical GDP growth for Sub-Saharan Africa, the world average, and OECD, the club of the
    world’s richest economies. Even when growing at such a breakneck pace, it would take Guinea-Bissau
    16 years to catch up with the 2014 GDP per capita of Sub-Saharan Africa; in the same vein, it would take
    48 years to catch up with the world and 71 years to catch up with the OECD. Assuming that these other
    regions continue to grow at their average growth rates, it will take even longer to catch up: 22 years with
    Sub-Saharan Africa, 53 years with the world, and 76 years with the OECD.

    More conservative growth estimates for Guinea-Bissau increase the amount of time necessary to
    catch up with comparator regions and the world average. If Guinea-Bissau continues to grow at its
    historical average of about 3 percent per annum, it would take the country 187 years to catch up with
    Sub-Saharan African GDP per capita of 2014, and 262 years assuming historical growth in the region.
    Catching up with the world or the OECD would virtually be impossible. Assuming a more realistic 5
    percent average growth rate, Guinea-Bissau could catch up with Sub-Saharan Africa in 55 years; yet it
    would still take over 100 years to catch up with the world.

3.2      Low productivity, savings and investments also underpin slow growth

94.   Low GDP per capita is largely a consequence of weak growth in labor productivity.
Between 2000 and 2014, average GDP growth of 3 percent per annum exceeded population growth
by a mere 0.4 percentage points, resulting in low average GDP per capita growth of 0.4 percent.


                                                                    51
About half of GDP per capita growth can be attributed to demographic change, where the
population of working age grew faster than the population as a whole (a so-called ‘demographic
dividend’). This suggests that labor productivity grew no faster than 0.4 percent on average during
that period.

95.     Weak labor productivity, in turn, is driven by low levels of savings and investment,
even by regional standards. Cross-country regressions show that savings are positively
associated with productivity growth, especially in poor countries (Aghion, et al. 2009). Yet, at 1.9
and 6.6 percent of GDP, respectively, savings and investment in Guinea-Bissau are significantly
low and many times less than the rates observed in West Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure
3.4). Savings are closely linked to the cashew price, the main driver of the economy, external trade,
and in turn the country’s current account. Strong cashew prices tend to improve the trade balance
and translate into higher national savings (Figure 3.5). With the exception of the global commodity
price boom in 2010 and 2011, the cashew price has been falling in real terms. These adverse price
developments can partly explain low savings in Guinea-Bissau. Low savings, in turn, translate into
feeble domestic investment, especially given an underdeveloped financial sector that limits
financial intermediation. About 40 percent of domestic investment is government-financed, almost
exclusively with donor support. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is miniscule, not least as a
consequence of political instability but also due to high unit labor costs and an unfavorable
business climate.24

3.3        Economic growth is fragile

96.      Given the narrow economic base, the economy is vulnerable to incidences of trade
shocks, particularly negative shocks to cashew prices. Between 2000 and 2013, global raw
cashew exports rose six-fold (Figure 3.6). As supply expanded, the price of the commodity fell.
Indeed, with the exception of 2011, cashew prices have been trailing general global food prices
more broadly. Weaker cashew prices have been worsening the terms of trade, especially given the
country’s high reliance on rice imports. Rice is Guinea-Bissau’s main staple food and families
barter it for cashew. Although Guinea-Bissau cultivated rice for export in the distant past, it is now
mostly grown on a subsistence basis. Yet given falling real cashew prices and somewhat increasing
rice prices, the ratio of cashew to rice prices—the most meaningful interpretation of the terms of
trade in Guinea-Bissau—has fallen (Figure 3.7). Falling cashew prices and rising rice prices are
reinforcing shocks to the poor, undermining income from their main, monetized economic activity
while eroding their purchasing power.

97.      Political instability has been continuously hampering economic growth, making
efforts to capitalize on periods of stability critical for poverty reduction. There is ample
evidence showing that economic growth is lower in countries with a high propensity of
government collapse through lower rates of productivity growth and physical and human capital
accumulation (Aisen and Veiga, 2010, Jong-a-Pin 2009, Alesina and Perotti 1996 and Barro 1991).
As shown in Figure 1.1, this is the case in Guinea-Bissau, where growth rates systematically fall
following instances of political instability. In the most recent Article IV assessment (July 2015),
the IMF estimates that Guinea-Bissau’s GDP per capita could have been 65-90 percent higher had
it not been for fragility. The uncertainty associated with political instability increases risk aversion
of local entrepreneurs and foreign investors alike, and pushes donors to withdraw their support.
For this reason, sustained periods of constitutional order provide important opportunities, which
should be used to attract investments and bolster economic growth.

98.     The latest coup in 2012 provides examples of the high economic cost of political
instability. The favorable cashew campaigns in 2012 and 2013 were overshadowed by
mismanagement of the military-backed government, aggravating income losses to farmers and
domestic traders from a large global drop in cashew prices. Smuggling increased as border controls
softened and corruption spread, further undermining fiscal discipline. Plundering of natural
resources, especially timber, and embezzled resources from fishing licenses, reduced national
wealth. In addition, the immediate suspension of donor programs in response to the coup meant
that external financing dried up. Public investment ground to a halt, current expenditures had to be
cut, and arrears increased. This resulted in widespread strikes, the disruption of education and
health services, and increasing public health concerns as both electricity and running water in
Bissau experienced severe outages. The economy contracted by 1.8 percent in 2012 and barely
recovered in 2013, growing at only 0.8 percent. In response, nonperforming loans in the banking
sector soared, leaving some commercial banks with a need to recapitalize. The World Food
Program estimates that food insecurity also doubled from 20 to 40 percent between 2011 and 2013.

99.      More recently, the macroeconomic policy agenda in Guinea-Bissau has been broadly
tied to an IMF program aimed at addressing balance of payments and other macroeconomic
imbalances. The Government’s program has been geared toward consolidating the fiscal position
through efforts to boost revenue mobilization while improving expenditure management, the
impact of which has been seen in 2014 (see Annex 3A). This is being addressed through initiatives
to deepen institutional reforms - strengthening budgetary transparency as well as public investment
and debt management. The thrust of the program is consistent with the findings of an IMF paper
which suggest relatively high returns from focusing on building sound fiscal institutions in fragile
states. In particular, the paper found that improving fiscal institutions and boosting fiscal space,
through raising tax revenue and containing current spending, as well as lower military spending
and, to some extent, higher social expenditure, are significantly and fairly robustly associated with
building resilience.25 The IMF program is ongoing but suffered significant setbacks in the context
of political instability. 

100. One source of macroeconomic stability is WAEMU membership, which has kept
inflation low; nonetheless it still leaves addressing idiosyncratic shocks to fiscal policy.
WAEMU membership means that monetary policy in Guinea-Bissau is governed by a competent,
independent central bank, BCEAO, which is largely insulated from the country’s fragility. It has
succeeded in keeping inflation low. Yet, as in any currency union, giving up monetary autonomy
limits the ability of monetary policy to help absorb country specific shocks. Empirical evidence
suggests that shocks to WAEMU member countries tend to be idiosyncratic and the BCEAO thus
cannot respond to individual country needs adequately, potentially at the expense of other
WAEMU member states.26 While there are obvious advantages to Guinea-Bissau retaining its
membership in WAEMU, shock absorption will largely have to be shouldered by fiscal policy,
which itself suffers from multiple constraints, as further explained below.

3.4        Structural weaknesses constrain the effectiveness and equity of fiscal policy

101. Overall, public resources are low and variable. Tax revenues to GDP in Guinea-Bissau,
which are at about 10 percent, are among the lowest in the region, while the average for Sub-
Saharan Africa is about 18 percent. Public revenues have traditionally been supplemented by donor
grants, raising total general government revenue to about 15 percent of GDP (Figure 3.8). Akin to
the broader economy, the fiscal accounts are highly vulnerable to incidences of trade shocks as a
result of their high reliance on cashew taxes (about 15 percent of revenue). They are also
vulnerable to political shocks and decisions on foreign aid. When donors collectively suspended
their programs in response to the military coup in 2012, the public investment program collapsed.
In addition, domestic revenue collections fell, current expenditures had to be cut sharply, and wage
arrears increased.

102. In terms of tax incidence, Guinea-Bissau’s reliance on taxes from cashew exports
means that the poor bear a considerable share of the tax burden. Taxes on international trade
in Guinea-Bissau are unusually high by global comparison with the cashew sector most affected
(Figure 3.9). This, in part, stems from the prominence of the sector, as well as, the fact that most
of the cashew produced is exported, thereby, making collections at the port very easy. Cashew
farmers bear the brunt of the cashew tax burden—highlighting the regressive structure of public
revenue generation. Cashew taxes are set at about 11 percent of the government’s reference price
for exports. Simulation analysis indicates that cashew farmers, mostly poor, absorb about 80
percent of the tax, while exporters absorb 13 percent and traders take up the remaining 7 percent.
This translates into a reduction of nearly 12 percent in the incomes of the farmers.27 Indirect
taxation is distortionary as the main tax (Tax on General Sales) is cumulative and the tax basis is
concentrated on a few formal activities in urban areas. The dependence on trade taxes could
negatively affect the country’s competitiveness. Income taxation is very limited due to precarious
tax administration capacities. Corporate taxes are collected on presumed profits and its tax base is
very small. Property taxes are almost nonexistent and are regulated by legislation dated back in
1920 and 1966. A reform of tax administration has been ongoing for one year (including
refurbishment of the offices, excess unqualified staff made redundant, and recruitment of skilled
new staff).

103. Capital expenditure is dependent on donor financing, and there is limited capacity
for project appraisal. Almost all of Guinea-Bissau’s capital expenditure is financed by donors.
Public investment can be significant, up to 7 percent of GDP in good years, as was the case in
2011. However, donor financing is pro-cyclical as it tends to dry up and aggravate recessions
during episodes of political turmoil. Frequent interruptions in public investment threaten the
quality of investments, as do the shifting priorities of frequently changing governments. The
quality of public investment is further undermined by weak project appraisal systems. This means
that—especially given its limited resources—Guinea-Bissau is ill-positioned to identify the areas
where public investment would yield the ‘biggest bang for the buck’, that is be truly transformative
to enable growth and poverty reduction. This leaves considerable room for spending preferences

for the incumbent government, which as explained further below, are often motivated more by
clientelist loyalties rather than national welfare.

104. Current spending is not well allocated across areas, with significant amounts spent
on public sector workers and the army. As the 2015 CEM illustrates, there are many
inefficiencies in the Guinean civil service. Some areas are overstaffed (such as the military or
customs), while others are understaffed (such as health and education). The armed forces and
paramilitaries account for over a quarter of public employment, which is large by regional
standards (Figure 3.10). Given the need to prioritize payments to soldiers to acquiesce the military,
arrears are often accumulated in other sectors. Although the World Bank has supported the
payment of teachers and health workers during the transition period after the military coup, strikes
remain commonplace—as teachers claimed outstanding payments from previous years. However,
even in education spending, there are signs of unions influencing public expenditures. In 2015, the
Ministry of Education agreed to lower the number of hours taught per week from 32 to 24, and
also to hire additional teachers in spite of shorter school days.

105. Efficiency and quality of public expenditures in Guinea-Bissau are undermined by an
incomplete and weak public financial management (PFM) framework. A weak PFM system
creates opportunities for the elites to extract rents from critical public resources. This is particularly
damaging considering that fiscal revenue is already low, leaving even fewer resources for
spending, and constraining the stability dimension of fiscal policy (Figure 3.12). The latest Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) report notes that some improvements on PFM
strengthening undertaken between 2009 and 2010 had been reversed in the aftermath of the 2012
military coup. Guinea-Bissau has committed to the 2009 WAEMU PFM directives, but they have
yet to be implemented.28 A sign of progress toward better and more transparent budget execution
was the government’s establishment of a Treasury Committee under the Simoes Pereira’s regime,
which was convened relatively regularly (see 2015 CEM).

106. Expected inflows of US$1.5 billion in donor resources pledged over the next five years
is as much a risk as it is an opportunity for fiscal policy. These risks are both political and
economic in nature (see Box 3.4 on the 2015 Brussels Donor Roundtable). Politically, the large
influx of resources can further increase rent seeking, especially in a fragile state like Guinea-
Bissau. Moreover, the population has high hopes of seeing results from this inflow of resources,
increasing the risk that spending may be oriented toward short-term initiatives, rather than
carefully identifying transformative investments that may only yield results in the future. This also
represents an opportunity for the population to push for greater transparency in public spending.
On the economic front, about 60 percent of the pledged resources are loans which will need to be
serviced. The International Development Association (IDA)-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis
assumes economic annual growth rates of 5 percent per annum—in line with the government’s
baseline scenario and significantly below the government’s optimistic scenario of 9 percent. Total
public debt is currently projected to fall from its current relatively high level of about 50 percent

   This would involve the following: (1) improving the reliability and timeliness of macroeconomic forecasts for better annual and multi-year
budgeting; (2) setting budget and financial controls to improve budget preparation, commitment management, control and accounting, as well as
timely and accurate budget execution reports; and (3) improving payment management and controls, more timely and reliable in-year financial
execution reports and their reconciliation with the budget execution reports published by the Directorate of the Budget.

This would reduce fiscal space and thus limit the government’s ability to deliver important public
goods and respond to shocks.

                                        Box 3.4. The 2015 Brussels Donor Roundtable
The new government together with its international partners arranged a donor roundtable on March 25,
2015, in Brussels to mobilize international support for its development priorities. Guinea-Bissau’s
international partners include international organizations, such as the WBG, UN, European Union (EU),
AU, ECOWAS, AfDB, West African Development Bank (WADB), and Community of Portuguese
Language Countries (CPLP), and also bilateral donors, such as the USA, Portugal, Brazil, Cabo Verde, East
Timor, Guinea, UK, France, Spain, Canada and China.

The government’s strategic and operational plan (Strategy Development Plan) for 2015-2020 foresees over
US$560 million to invest in more than 200 development projects. The international community pledged to
support the government with US$1.5 billion, committed by WADB (US$340 million.), UN (US$300
million), WBG (US$250 million), EU (US$160 million), AfDB (US$128 million), Portugal (US$45
million), and other donors, although it remains unclear exactly how much of the pledges are for new
activities and how much had already been committed beforehand.
 

3.5                An underdeveloped private sector and multiple supply-side constraints hinder actual
                   and potential output
 
107. The private sector in Guinea-Bissau is underdeveloped, and faces several challenges.
The economy is largely informal and is reliant on natural resources, principally agriculture and
fisheries, with a considerable degree of subsistence farming and low productivity. Of the 30
percent of the labor force not engaged in agriculture, the majority is in services, mostly self-
employed in commerce and transport. Only one in ten workers is in wage employment, half in
small urban services, and half in the public sector. The private sector depends heavily on the public
sector’s consumption and investments due to a small domestic market, and very few export-

oriented sectors. This form of economic structure discourages entrepreneurs from pursuing
economic opportunities and from making investments that could create firms and generate jobs,
resulting in little economic diversification. At the end of 2014, the taxpayer’s registry included
only 3,243 businesses, including individual entrepreneurs, although one third of those were
classified as “inactive”. The challenges to private sector development are considerable and range
from poor infrastructure and a poor business and regulatory environment, to limited access to
finance, low productivity, and relatively high labor costs and political instability.

              Poor infrastructure

108. The functioning of markets is undermined by the absence of public investments in
fundamental economic services. Guinea-Bissau’s infrastructure is in a woeful state, from the port
to roads, to access to electricity, potable water, or the Internet.29 The failure of Guinea-Bissau over
several decades to provide these key public goods and services, either through direct public
investments or through effective public-private partnerships, severely limits the ability of poor
households to participate in economic activity, both through more productive autonomous
activities, or through accessing employment opportunities that could be generated by a thriving
private sector. Poor infrastructure also limits connectivity to markets, effectively reducing the
scope and incentives for expansion of income-generating opportunities. Households often use
cashew in bartering for rice or other staples, effectively reducing the scope for trading for both
agricultural and other non-agricultural products with money, and lowering the returns and
incentives to enter retail and services. This is particularly common in rural areas. Hence fostering
better connections across the country can boost incomes by expanding economic activities and
opening up the scope of local trade.

109. Under-provision of energy, due largely to weak governance in the sector, poses a
critical constraint to the productivity of the economy, job creation, and household welfare.
There is a severe electricity shortage, reducing most activities both for companies and households.
ILAP data indicate that only about 6 percent of Bissau Guinean households have access to
electricity -- primarily urban households in the higher consumption quintile. Other estimates place
access to electricity at about 10 percent, one of the lowest in the world (Figure 3.12). Abysmally
low coverage, especially in rural areas, obliges high outlays for alternative self-generated
electricity, reducing most activities for both households and enterprises. Absence of, or high costs
for, electricity also bars households from acquiring other physical –and welfare enhancing– assets
such as electrical stoves or cold storage. It takes on average 455 days for new businesses to get
connected to the grid, almost three times longer than the regional average. The economic cost of
these failures in electricity is very high – pushing up production costs and ultimately dissuading
investment and reducing competitiveness.

110. The lack of generation capacity and the unreliability of power supply have technical,
commercial, financial, institutional, and ultimately, policy roots. The power system is well
below the capacity needed. The level of technical and commercial losses is extremely high, having
recently been estimated to occur with about 52 percent on average of energy produced. In the
residential sector, losses could be as high as 60 percent. Non-payment, especially due to an
ineffective billing system, is estimated to be high, and occurs among both public and private
consumers. The prolonged electricity crisis and a decade of ineffective remedial measures have
led to a vicious cycle of regular blackouts, overstaffing and high operating costs, poor billing and
revenue collection, high incidence of electricity theft through illegal connections, and high retail
tariffs in an (ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to cover these inefficiencies. Adding to the problem
is the participation of public officials in theft of gasoil/diesel (for power generation) for resale, and
for use in private cars and trucks. The sector imposes a significant fiscal burden through direct and
indirect subsidies.

111. A second key infrastructure constraint centers on the port of Bissau, which imposes
high transaction costs on cashew and other (actual and potential) exports as well as on
imports of key commodities such as rice. In principle, Guinea-Bissau’s position as a coastal
country on the Atlantic Ocean should be an important asset, enabling the country to derive trade
benefits from direct access to the Atlantic and proximity to the main shipping lanes linking the
American and European continents. As a result, its port system could play a key role in the overall
competitiveness of its economy. The port of Bissau is the country’s main port, and it handles more
than 85 percent of Bissau’s recorded international trade, and is the window to the world for Guinea-
Bissau’s main export: cashew. At the present time, however, the port of Bissau is in a woeful state
with a large number of deficiencies, including in critical areas such as maritime access, surfaces,
warehousing, port buildings, and other infrastructure systems. Moreover, a number of shipwrecks
are significantly hindering port operations. As a result, port costs are markedly high.	The structure
of terminal handling charges shows tariffs to be up to ten times higher than in other ports of the
region, including those that are becoming competitors to the port of Bissau (for instance Dakar
and Banjul) for trade into Guinea-Bissau and neighboring countries.

112. Like most of the public goods in Guinea-Bissau, the port suffers from a host of
managerial corporate governance problems and a poor regulatory context that impact not
only the port’s operational performance but also its financial viability. The Guinea-Bissau
Port Authority (APGB) must contend with both redundant and unqualified personnel, and there is
no master port planning or port investment strategy to guide its efforts. More importantly, it is
currently functioning outside a clear legal and regulatory framework and under an inadequate
institutional arrangement. The existing framework, however, is all but simple, involving a large
number of entities and reporting relations, and creating a complex web of stakeholder interests in
the reform of the port. Failed concessions in the past, which were largely due to the unsettled
institutional arrangement of APGB, the lack of progress on the reform front, political instability,
and vested interests of the elite, have discouraged private investment in the port. Nevertheless,
given that the port of Bissau is the only one in the country and is likely to remain a key piece in
the country’s infrastructure, addressing these issues will be paramount for the improvement of
trade and development in the country.

113. A third major constraint to productivity growth and the functioning of markets,
especially for the rural economy, is the absence of adequate road transport. The country is
home to 1.7 million people, but has only 10 kilometers of paved roads per 100 square kilometers
of land area. This road network coverage appears to be broadly in line with other Sub-Saharan
African countries. However, the roads are in considerably poorer condition, especially secondary
and tertiary roads, which are most important for rural dwellers. The poor road network hampers
the efficient flow of goods and labor and creates high transaction costs. In fact, farmers report
considerable constraints in marketing their goods, especially during the rainy season when roads
are flooded or even washed away. Inadequate roads also inhibit people’s ability to access basic
services, including schools and hospitals. As noted in the inclusiveness section above, the poorest
households and those that have less diversified incomes tend to reside farther away from roads,
including secondary and tertiary roads, and thus are relatively more isolated from markets and
other critical public goods and services, and economic opportunities.

114. While the telecommunications sector has grown and generated positive impacts on
the economy, it remains underdeveloped, representing another bottleneck to growth (Figure
3.13). From 2004-2012, total private investment in telecoms approximated US$134 million and
accounted for 90 percent of total foreign direct investment. It is estimated that Orange Bissau and
MTN (both telecommunications companies) have created about 300 direct jobs and 4,000 indirect
jobs through their distribution networks.30 Total revenues of the telecom sector increased by factor
of six in the past 10 years and the sector’s contribution to GDP has grown to almost 2 percent.31
However, it remains below the African average (7 percent), signaling ample room for growth.32
Landlines are almost nonexistent. Mobile telephony has grown rapidly and a high share of the
population either have, or have close access to, a mobile phone.33 Guinea-Bissau is the only
country on the African coast not connected to a submarine cable. Consequently, internet usage
remains low at 4 percent in 2015 compared to 19 percent in Gambia and 51 percent in Senegal.

   Total revenues of the telecom sector are only those of MTN and Orange and do not include that of the incumbent operator, for which there is a
lack of available data.
32
   In 2011, Orange Bissau alone contributed to 3 percent of the Government total tax revenue and its total revenues represented 22 percent of the
Government total fiscal revenues. http://www.sonatel.sn/guinee-bissau/

   Mobile penetration as measured by number of SIM cards is 81 percent in 2015, but since the average number of cards per subscriber is 2.1, this
suggests that only 41 percent of the population has a mobile phone.

The broadband market, concentrated in the capital, is nascent, with a penetration rate of about 0.9
percent of the population compared to 15 percent in Senegal and Morocco. Notwithstanding these
issues, recent developments in the telecommunication sector hold much promise. An emerging
body of research shows that reduction in communication costs associated with mobile phones has
tangible economic benefits including improving agricultural (and labor market) efficiency, and
fostering both producer and consumer welfare. In Senegal, the Manobi platform was created
primarily to provide real-time information on agricultural prices in local and international markets,
resulting in an increase in certain farmers’ incomes by more than 40 percent.34 For Guinea-Bissau,
the Telco MTN is launching a mobile service allowing cashew nut merchants to improve access
to market information and bypass intermediary agents.

115. In mobile telephony, Guinea-Bissau faces problems of access and affordability,
although this is one of the more developed markets in the country. The country is currently
facing a growing digital divide between the population living in the major urban areas and the
remaining lagging regions. In fact, there are significant differences in terms of mobile coverage
and mobile penetration between regions. Lack of fiber optic infrastructure, imperfect competition,
weak regulation, and excessively high operational costs (caused mostly by critical electricity
problems) lead to economic inefficiencies, high prices, and lower affordability. On average, a
mobile subscriber in Guinea-Bissau spends more than 19 percent of his or her monthly income on
mobile telecommunications services (voice and data), which is much higher than in other
neighboring countries (14 percent in Côte d’Ivoire, 12 percent in Senegal, 9 percent in Ghana, and
4 percent in South Africa).

116. Limited connectivity and persistent economic inefficiencies in the sector mean that
Guinea-Bissau is missing out on many of the economic, governance, and transparency
benefits associated with modern telecommunications. There is abundant evidence showing that
mobile phones connect market participants across distances (World Development Report (WDR),

saving schemes, and even mobile banking, especially in a country with very low financial inclusion
such as Guinea-Bissau.35 Mobile phones are also increasingly used to channel cash to individuals
through official cash transfer schemes or remittances, which reduces poverty and can boost the
local economy through household demand and even investment stimuli. Limited broadband
connectivity means that the country misses out on the benefits of broadband services, which are
found to contribute directly to a country’s productivity, competitiveness, and to its ability to attract
foreign direct investment (FDI), reducing transaction costs and helping countries diversify into
more sophisticated sectors. Within government, mobile phones are also used to track the delivery
and quality of public services (for example, tracking teacher absenteeism). ICT can facilitate
business within government, yet these benefits remains largely untapped. Guinea-Bissau ranks
182th out of 193 countries in the 2014 E-Government Development Index.36

              Weak business environment

117. The business climate is not conducive to the generation of growth and employment.
The country’s unstable political climate, which includes high levels of rent-seeking, is a formidable
deterrent to private investment and growth. Furthermore, the regulatory framework for business
remains precarious and inhospitable despite some efforts to improve it. This is illustrated by the
country’s performance in the Doing Business 2016 report (DB). With an overall rank of 178 out
of 189 economies and a distance to frontier (DTF) score of 40.56 percentage points, Guinea-Bissau
is at the bottom of the classification of “ease of doing business.” While performance varies across
topics (see Figure 3.14), the country does not rank in the top half of the classification in any of the
10 Doing Business areas included in the ranking. The multiple constraints that the business climate
create for the generation of firms in Guinea-Bissau pose a big burden for the formation of
productive capital.

not developed and the necessary institutional arrangements to apply the law are not created. That
was the case of the Land Law (Lei da Terra, Law 5/1998 of April 23), the 2011 Investment Code
(Law 13/2011 of July 6), or the Decree 8/2011 on licensing reform. As a result, some regulations
are partially applied, leaving room for interpretation. This is aggravated by insufficient knowledge
of regulations among public officials, leading to inconsistent enforcement.  Notwithstanding the
creation of a commercial court, and the examples of good international practice for achieving more
efficient resolution of commercial disputes that exist, enforcement of business law remains
challenging. The general corruption and dysfunctional nature of the Guinean justice and law-
enforcement system, where impunity is high, undermine the execution of decisions by the
commercial court. Rent-seeking behavior by low-paid government officials further weakens the
application of regulations. Interactions with the private sector are often seen as opportunities to
extract additional earnings. The multiplicity of fees to be paid in the process of goods arrival and
customs clearance at the port or land border is an example. Implementation of reforms that reduce
opportunities for such rents, for example removing prior approvals and licenses or implementing
transparent procedures, are met with resistance.

            Limited access to finance is a significant constraint

119. The financial sector is highly underdeveloped in Guinea-Bissau, with low access to
formal banking services. Guinea-Bissau has fewer banks than most other nations in Sub-Saharan
Africa (Figure 3.15). Private sector credit to the economy plummeted to below 1 percent of GDP
in 2003 (AfDB, 2014). Since then, overall credit to the private sector has been on the rise, reaching
13.8 percent of GDP in 2013, but still remains significantly below WAEMU countries. Despite
rapid growth, the level of banking penetration remains very low. Between 2007 and 2013, the
number of accounts increased from 27,725 to 60,096 (with a peak of 69,556 in 2012). However,
only about 1 percent of the population is estimated to have a bank account (IMF 2013). This
translates into 35 bank accounts per thousand adults, well below the average for WAEMU
countries at 45. Equally, the banking network is very narrow with just 26 branch offices or
“guichets”, of which only 7 are in rural areas. Low financial coverage is associated with low ratings
in the Country Policy and International Assessment (CPIA) for business environment.

120. Overall, Guinea-Bissau’s banking system is shallow and characterized by low
intermediation. (Figure 3.16) On average in 2011, African banks intermediated about 74 percent
of their deposits, while the ratio was 109 percent in non-African banks (Beck et al., 2011). In
Guinea-Bissau, although the trend has been on the increase, the ratio stood at just 60 percent in
2013, considerably lower than the 2011 regional average. The implication of this low ratio is that
existing resources held by banks are not efficiently channeled to private sector activities, inhibiting
business and employment growth. Most bank lending is short term, which carries high interest
rates (fluctuating between 14 percent and 18 percent) and substantial collaterals to cover
anticipated high risk. Moreover, more than 25 percent of bank lending is concentrated in the
cashew sector in the context of pre- and post-cashew harvest financing, and also includes loans to
small processing plants and trading advances to exporters. Working capital loans to Small and
Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are very limited. The situation worsened after the 2012 military coup,
when non-performing loans (NPL) reached approximately US$50 million in the banks’ portfolios
from cashew sector activities. As a result, most SMEs and poor households are excluded from the
credit market, further limiting their ability to invest in productive assets or to be able to exploit
economic opportunities that could facilitate their exit from poverty. Furthermore, the absence of a
capital market constrains the availability of risk hedging mechanisms, making businesses and
households more susceptible to shocks and less efficient at managing them.

121. The limited uses of financial instruments is constrained by several factors on the
supply and demand sides of the market. The supply of financial instruments is constrained by a
risky business environment, gaps in credit information that prevent accurate pricing, weak debt
recovery mechanisms, weak market and institutional financial infrastructures, including those for
contract rights and enforcement and credit bureaus, and inadequate accounting and disclosure
standards. Factors hindering the demand for credit include challenges in proving title over
property, lack of collateral or high costs of registering it, weak capacity on the private sector to
present bankable loan applications, and lack of proper accounting mechanisms (Figure 3.17).

122. The microfinance sector, although underdeveloped, is necessary and could help
smallholder and enterprises with diversification of credit options. In Guinea-Bissau,
microfinance institutions (MFI) represent very small volumes, contributing a meager 0.09 percent
of GDP. Only six MFIs are currently active, with 19 service points for 16,210 members, and all
are in the form of donor-financed cooperatives or projects with a credit component. Total deposits
amounted to FCFA207 million (the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa) and outstanding loans to 84
million CFA francs in 2014. Despite a 22 percent increase in deposits from 2010 to 2012, MFI
loans actually fell by nearly 46 percent, due to donors’ suspension of financing, resulting in an
average rate of portfolio deterioration in 2012 of 61 percent, versus a norm of 5 percent (AEO,
2014) (Figure 3.19). Field inquiries show that lack of experience, poor management, and weak
monitoring systems caused high NPLs and led to the collapse of the nascent microfinance sector
in Guinea-Bissau. Other reasons for the low density of microfinance institutions are the high
operating cost in Guinea-Bissau and the exclusion of microfinance institutions with licenses from
other countries. A new regulatory framework is expected from the Government in the short- to
medium-term to: (1) strengthen the institutional, legal, and regulatory environment so as to provide
security for the sector; (2) initiate efforts to increase the professionalism of MFIs; and (3) promote
partnerships among all stakeholders in order to provide MFIs with better access to sources of
financing (AEO, 2014).

       Labor costs are high relative to labor productivity

123. Guinea-Bissau’s labor market is characterized by low productivity and relatively
high labor unit costs. Despite relatively low absolute wage levels, unit labor costs (relative to
value added) are high in Guinea-Bissau compared to similar countries (Figure 3.19). In fact, labor
costs amount to as much as 54 percent of value added for the median firm in the country, a
proportion higher than that observed in South Africa (41 percent) and much higher than levels
observed in Kenya (24 percent) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (32 percent). This suggests
that Guinea-Bissau is not competitive internationally in terms of labor costs, due to low value
added per worker (see Figure 3.20 on labor market rigidity, and Figure 3.21 on firing costs
affecting hiring decisions).




                                                 66
124. Low productivity and the relatively high labor unit costs can also be explained by
looking at the low skill level among workers. As noted above in Chapter 2, education levels in
Guinea-Bissau are low, and companies provide limited training. Data from ILAP shows that the
average school attainment for adults in Guinea-Bissau is below 3 years and even less in the bottom
two consumption quintiles. Overall, three-quarters of Guinean household heads did not have
complete primary education. Only about 15 percent of workers have had any kind of technical or
vocational training. These numbers are only based on the manufacturing sector; in agriculture, as
depicted in Chapter 2 and where most Guineans work, education levels are much lower—less than
0.3 percent have higher education and only 3 percent have graduated high school.

3.6        Untapped economic opportunities to spur shared growth

125. There are several opportunities to foster stronger growth. However, this potential
primarily rests on the ability of Guinea-Bissau to remove or at least ease the key growth
obstacles identified in this chapter. There is no silver bullet to solve all of Guinea-Bissau’s
problems, and neither is there any one binding constraint whose removal would by itself resolve
all the other constraints. The challenge is not only about exploring new industries and sources of
growth, but also about making traditional sectors and industries more competitive. In this regard,
there is a need for concerted efforts to directly tackle the many constraints appropriately
sequenced, where possible, capitalizing on low-hanging fruits, and embracing available
technology. Importantly, this will have to be done in the context of limited fiscal space and a
smaller public sector. Having lost decades of potential progress as a result of low and fragile
growth, the government needs to move forward very efficiently, actions which call for urgent
improvement in accountability and governance.

126. Agricultural potential is significant because of favorable factors, such as climate and
soil characteristics, and therefore agriculture should be pursued in the short- to medium
term, if not also the long term, given that the majority of households stand to benefit from
advances in this sector. The 2015 CEM suggests, for instance, that improved farming techniques
could increase cashew yields, and that much higher margins could be gained through processing
cashew domestically. Thus far, however, the country has not managed to establish a cashew
processing industry, a result attributed to the many aforementioned business climate constraints.
There is some limited activity in other agricultural areas. Notably, Guinea-Bissau also produces
groundnuts, which in 2015 was estimated to be 40,000 metric tons.37 The Government has also
initiated steps to encourage sesame production.38 Rice is grown on a subsistence basis although
the country was once a net exporter of the commodity in the 1970s.39 There is also potential in a
diversified range of cereal (rice, millet, sorghum, and so forth), fruit (mangoes, citrus fruit,
papayas, and so forth) and pulse and tuber (cassava and sweet potatoes) crops. There is a fisheries
sector but this is largely dominated by European fleets under licensing agreements with the
Guinean Government.

127. There are also opportunities in other sectors. The mining sector is in its very early stages
of development. Guinea-Bissau has also more than 2 million hectares of forest, with considerable
diversity in its fauna and ecosystem. In spite of the country’s significant natural beauty, the
potential of the tourism sector remains largely untapped.40 Moving into higher value-added
activities in industry and services will be crucial to achieve the growth rates that Guinea-Bissau
will require to catch-up with other countries (Box 3.3).

              Climbing the value chain in the cashew sector

128. Cashew cultivation and exports have grown rapidly over time, and without new
investments, the current status of the activity is reaching its productivity limits. Cashew
                                                            
37
   A consultant report commissioned for this SCD suggests that most of the production of groundnuts feeds a crushing plant in bordering Ziguinchor,
Senegal.

   Favorable cashew prices since the mid-90s, led many farmers to disregard rice, and its more intensive labor requirements, in favor of cashew.

                                                                       68
exports have been growing at almost 6 percent a year from 1994 to 2013, fueled by increased
acreage under cultivation. This is related to availability of vast agricultural lands and the extremely
low production requirements of cashews. Existing farming practices, however, represent a risk to
productivity in the sector. Poor planting techniques result in lower yields per hectare. Processes
such as revitalizing orchards by pruning current trees and replanting old ones with correct spacing
are directly correlated with improved yields, but are not currently performed. Additionally, the
development of a wider variety of cashew trees would help hedge against the risk of widespread
plant disease. The current status of cashew production is geared toward raw nut export, with little
focus on developing the internal value-chain. With little knowledge and bargaining power, farmers
bear the costs of price volatility and cannot properly charge international prices. In 2013, farmers
only received about 40 percent of the reference price of raw cashew nuts sold to exporters. Given
the strong potential of the cashew sector in Guinea-Bissau, improvement of the production process
should be leveraged by private sector involvement as well as by public-private cooperation. The
cashew economy could benefit from several off-the-shelf solutions, both in knowledge (that is,
planting techniques, and seed and fertilizer) and capital improvements (that is processing plants)
that can boost and sustain higher productivity, helping Guineans to enter higher-value markets and
raise efficiency in the production chain.

129. The next step in the value chain is the production of cashew kernels, but the
processing capacity of the country is small. Guinea-Bissau is an important player in the
production and export of raw cashew nuts, despite the country’s small size. In 2012, it was the
fifth-largest producer of raw cashew nuts, after India, Cote d’Ivoire, Vietnam, and Brazil.
However, Guinea-Bissau exports consist of raw cashew nuts. There is little processing power at
home, which means the country is an insignificant player in the production of cashew kernel.41 In
2010, the country had the capacity to process less than 15,000 tons of raw cashew nuts a year,
making it far from the largest player in the sector (Figure 3.22). Additionally, capacity utilization
remained low. In 2013, the country produced less than 250 tons of cashew kernels (<4 percent of
capacity utilization), of which 55 percent were exported and the remainder still awaited a buyer.
Developing a market for processed cashew, as well as complying with international standards, are
important areas for development of the sector.

130. The country has the opportunity to develop a cashew processing industry and move
up in the value chain if critical constraints are properly addressed. The conditions are
favorable for Guinea-Bissau to develop a cashew processing industry. The country boast a plentiful
supply of good quality raw cashew nuts, and labor is available. Nonetheless, significant challenges
remain in place. The high cost of financing may pose the most significant constraint. Furthermore,
the cashew harvest only lasts for three months, increasing the urgency for storage issues to be
addressed. Another issue is an unsuccessful, albeit relevant, cashew-sector guarantee program that
was established in 2013. Issues of low-credit volume and nontransparent allocation of funds both
need to be addressed for the program to work. There are also minimum scale and quality
requirements, such as achieving a consistent supply of container volume and cashew nut quality
(that is, size). Infrastructure is a major obstacle due to the low availability and reliability of
electricity and to the existence of poor roads (especially of secondary roads) and poor port
infrastructure.

                                                            
41   From 1994 to 2014, the country exported 95 percent of the raw cashew nuts it produced, mostly to India.


                                                                 69
    Figure 3.22. Guinea-Bissau is the fifth largest exporter of raw cashew worldwide, yet the country
                              hardly produces processed cashew (kernel)

131. A cashew processing industry would bring sizable benefits to the economy. The
economy would be expected to grow, fueled by an increase in the size of the industry sector, and
employment would increase. It is estimated that cashew-processing creates about one full-time job
for every three tons of processed raw nuts. Processing 30,000 tons of nuts a year could therefore
create about 10,000 jobs, mostly in rural areas. This increase in jobs would particularly benefit
women, who make up the majority of factory workers. Organized communities and a better value
chain could significantly raise incomes, address food security, and reduce poverty. It would also
strengthen producer bargaining power, if they could guarantee a reliable supply to processors.
Processors and exporters also would benefit, because the profit margin for enterprises would be
greater for exporting kernel rather than raw cashew. Finally, the risks in the value chain could
potentially be mitigated due to reduced dependence on the Indian market.

          Reinvigorating the rice sector

132. Rice constitutes the most important grain crop and staple food in the country, but
over time several political and economic factors have adversely affected its cultivation. Rice
is the main staple food, grown largely for domestic auto-consumption. It is a crop with
considerable potential to enhance food security and incomes, especially in poor, rural areas. Rice
is also a major barter good for cashew growers. The cultivation of rice in the country started in the
pre-colonial period over 500 years ago, but several conflicts caused production to undergo major
changes. The colonial war of 1915 worsened the rice-growing situation. By the 1930’s, migrants
leaving the capital set up rice-growing systems in rural areas, resulting in production and export
activities to make a comeback, until about 1960, when the national liberation war (which continued
until 1973) caused rice production to again decline. Much of the infrastructure was destroyed
during these several lengthy conflicts. The early years of independence were characterized by a
program to re-launch agricultural production, which was one of the main pillars in the attempt to
reach food self-sufficiency. This included expanding the area of mangrove swamp rice cultivation
through the rehabilitation of sea dykes, construction of sluice gates, and creation of mangrove
swamp rice perimeters. Rice production collapsed again during the civil war of 1998-1999, but it
has rebounded since, although yields, by most standards, remain low.


                                                      70
133. The topography of Guinea-Bissau is very suitable for all types of rice cultivation. Rice
is currently produced in three ecosystems: rain-fed uplands, lowlands (rain-fed and irrigated), and
mangrove. Mangrove swamp rice is the most extensive system of rice cultivation in Guinea-Bissau
and is widely practiced in coastal regions. The south is particularly suited for mangrove swamp
rice, while the north has the potential for mangrove and lowland rice production and the east for
irrigated rice. Traditionally, many of the ethnic groups comprising the majority of the population
have been focused on rice cultivation, meaning that the human capital inherent in long-term
cultivation of a crop is well developed. The Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) for Guinea-
Bissau, completed in 2010, shows that Guinea-Bissau has a significant comparative advantage in
several aspects of rice production.

134. Boosting rice production, interspersed with cashew or on a stand-alone basis, can
increase incomes and reduce food security, but doing so requires interventions on several
fronts. Increasing rice production would enhance food security, boost incomes of rice farmers,
hedge against monocrop risks, and diversify Guinea-Bissau’s export base. The most immediate
improvements can be promoted by better seed variety, and crop management that maximizes yield
and land utilization. The sector would also benefit tremendously from better on-farm
infrastructure, such as irrigation and drainage. Given the constraints on government capacity,
NGOs with experience in performing knowledge transfer activities can step in to provide extension
services. Public-private partnerships can also be formed to address on-farm infrastructure
deficiencies, such as rehabilitating or constructing dikes for mangrove rice and drainage channels
and anti-erosion banks for lowland rice, creating better irrigation and drainage in lowlands, and
improving management. Nevertheless, even if rice productivity is improved, the rational decision
at the household level might still be to plant cashew. This is due both to the role of cashew in
securing land tenure and to its higher economic returns. This means that the interplay between rice
and cashew should be leveraged when possible to maximize returns while enhancing household
food security.

              Increasing the rents from fisheries while ensuring ecological sustainability

135. Fishing is one of the major economic activities undertaken in the western coast of
Africa and has great potential in Guinea-Bissau. The gross value of fisheries production in 2010
is estimated at US$81.3 million, corresponding to 20 percent of the agricultural value added. 42
This value, however, does not capture the higher potential revenue stream that the fisheries would
generate in the long run. Guinea-Bissau has a relatively small coastline, 270 Km long (excluding
oceanic islands), but the waters are rich in terms of abundance and diversity of fish species,
sustained mainly by an influx of nutrients from the country’s many estuaries which provide 3,400
km of mangrove cover, nearly 10 percent of the national territory. The geographical
configuration and the humid tropical climate offer important productive fisheries conditions for
demersals (that is bottom-dwellers) and small pelagics (that is offshore surface fish). The latest
estimates confirm that the country has a fishing potential of 120,000 tons.

136. Nonetheless, most of the current industry is exploited by foreign companies, with only
a small share benefitting locals. Fisheries resources are extracted by two main fishing industries:

                                                                      71
artisanal and industrial. The estimated total number of artisanal fishing boats operating in Guinea-
Bissau in 2013 was 1,159, with about 40 percent of the fleet operated by foreign fishermen, while
industrial fishing vessels totaled 106, through joint ventures and agreements. Almost 22,000 tons
of fish were landed by the artisanal fishing sector in 2011, while the average annual catch is about
70,000 tons for industrial vessels.43 Nonetheless, fish caught by industrial vessels are landed
directly in foreign ports with very little contribution to national coffers; some estimates reveal that
only about 25 percent of these revenues are captured at the national level. Overall, the contribution
of fisheries to GDP –as estimated by the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission– is less than 4
percent, despite the huge fishing potential of the country.

137. The sustainable contribution of fisheries could be much higher if appropriate
governance and management structures were in place. The fishing industry is a highly
unregulated activity, leading both to overexploitation and underperformance of the resource
base. In Guinea-Bissau and in the West Africa region in general, marine fisheries resources are
enduring excessive fishing pressure in an essentially unregulated environment. With a vast
resource base, the fisheries sector of Guinea-Bissau has the potential to make a much greater
contribution to the attainment of key development objectives, such as economic growth and
poverty alleviation, but only if better managed to prevent overexploitation. The main challenges
are insufficient governmental capacity both to regulate fishing and to prosecute and punish illegal
activity, while at the same time most of the benefits to fishing are not accrued locally. Programs
such as the West Africa Regional Fisheries Program (WARFP) have been introduced, and should
be continued, with the objective of building the government’s capacity to more sustainably govern
the use of the marine fish resources, to reduce illegal fishing, and to increase local value added to
fisheries products.

138. Guinea-Bissau has made progress against illegal fishing, which bodes well for
commercial fishing to make a greater contribution and provide longer-term sustainability of
the sector. In spite of major delays, Guinea-Bissau has achieved a substantial progress in the effort
to monitor and control illegal fishing in the waters of Guinea-Bissau. The national registration
system for industrial and artisanal fishing vessels has been designed and made operational, while
the new regulation has resulted in a 100 percent utilization of VMS (Vessel Monitoring System)
by vessels authorized to fish in Guinea-Bissau. With the recently-augmented patrol capacity,
monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) activities have successfully detected and controlled
violations, and the percentage of fishing vessels committing offenses was well below the target for
2014 and 2015 both in the artisanal and industrial segments. In order to maintain the MCS
activities and continue to reduce illegal fishing, the country needs support for further capacity
building as well as financial sustainability of the MCS program. Stock assessment campaigns must
continue to better evaluate the state of the stocks and determine appropriate levels of
utilization. While these have generated an unprecedented amount of information regarding the
fish stocks in the Guinean waters, continued assessment is essential to accurately evaluate the
trend. Results of these campaigns also provide important data to estimate some key parameters for
bioeconomic modeling, which would help determine possible paths towards sustainable
management and utilization of the fish resources.

   Data unavailability may underestimate the local catch, while the estimated annual production does not include catches take illegally from waters
of Guinea-Bissau.



                                                                       72
              Tapping on nascent extractive industries

139. Historically, the mining and petroleum sectors of Guinea-Bissau have been very
small, mostly involving quarrying and a small amount of artisanal mining, but nevertheless,
there is great potential in these sectors. Currently, the only actively-producing extractive
industries in Guinea-Bissau are small quarries for construction materials, such as granite,
limestone, clay, and sand, although a relatively small mineral sands mine is near production in
Varela, in the northwest section of the country. Recent interest of foreign investors in the extractive
industries (EI) sector holds considerable promise. Petroleum and copper have respectively the
second and third largest potential for export, after the cashew industry. Nevertheless, there are
numerous examples of countries in which the large majority of the population not only did not
benefit but was eventually left worse off after the discovery and exploitation of large oil or mineral
deposits. By fostering local linkages with the economy, mining can support local incomes, while
rents from the EI sector can support critical public investments.

140. The resources closest to realizing their potential are phosphates and bauxite, but there
also are good prospects for sands, gold, and petroleum. Phosphate deposits were first identified
by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in 1978. Since that time, several companies
have started and then broken a lease for exploration due to a series of issues and mutual
disagreements between the companies and the government. Plains Creek (also locally known as
GB Minerals) is the latest company to sign a lease, in 2009, and it has more recently been
successfully securing the funds to begin exploration in Farim (Oio Region). Bauxite deposits are
another important resource, and five companies are closely situated to each another in Boe, in the
southeast of the country. The latest lease, in 2007, was granted to Bauxite Angola. Other players
include the Russian company Poto, which signed a contract in February 2014 for exploitation of 1
million m3 of sand, which is expected to result in about 119,000 tons of mineral sands (ilmenite,
zircon, and rutile), while in the medium or long term, the prospects from gold could also be
significant. In addition, there have been several finds from exploratory offshore drilling for
petroleum in Guinea-Bissau, but to date no commercially viable discoveries.44

141. While laws governing the extractive industry exist, one of their main shortcomings
has been the lack of clauses imposing social benefits to be derived from the vast resources to
be potentially explored. New legislation governing the mining and petroleum sectors have been
in the process of being enacted for several years and is currently waiting for promulgation by
Parliament.45 However, the mining law does not contain provisions dealing with community
development. For example, there is no provision requiring local or even regional employment in
the mines or investments, or providing for the wellbeing of employees. The petroleum law, on the
other hand, has those provisions, albeit in vague language. This is due to the nature of oil
exploration. Because oil discoveries in Guinea-Bissau have all been offshore, the community
development issues are not as complex as they are in hard rock mining, and the linkage
opportunities are much fewer. Hence, overall there is still room to foster linkages with the local
economy. Mining companies should be compelled to work with the Government to provide greater
socio-economic benefits to Guinean communities. These projects, particularly in mining, often

   A new Mining Law (of 2010) is set to replace the Mining Law of 2000, and a new Petroleum Law (also of 2010) will replace the 1982 Petroleum
Law, which has been amended several times through the years.

also help finance critical public investment programs, social assistance schemes aimed at
alleviating poverty, and initiatives seeking to promote economic opportunities.

              Sustainable tourism to give economic value to rich biodiversity

142. Sustainable tourism and ecotourism in Guinea-Bissau has the potential to become a
source of economic growth and employment. Through tourism, protected areas and ecosystem
can gain tangible economic value, helping to further preserve them. Guinea-Bissau is somewhat
unique in that it is among the last countries in West Africa where development has had limited
negative impact on the environment, and consequently, its biodiversity has not yet been
significantly degraded. The country’s ecosystems support a wealth of biodiversiy. Several animal
species found in Guinea-Bissau are globally significant and are identified on the International
Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List as globally endangered or threatened. The
Bolama-Bijagós Archipelago is a recognized United Nations Educational, Scientific & Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) Man and the Biosphere Program (MAB) Reserve, due to its exceptional
combination of biological and cultural assets. Recognizing the critical importance of these
biodiversity, ecosystem, and cultural assets, the Government, together with national and
international partners, has over the past 20 years worked to develop an institutional framework for
their conservation and sustainable use.

143. Guinea-Bissau’s comparative advantage in tourism rests with its natural resources
and cultural assets. The rich biodiversity found throughout the country can be combined with
strong cultural resources to create a unique tourism offering. Cultural resources in Guinea-Bissau
include an interesting and diverse cuisine, many cultural festivals, traditional dance and music,
and authentic handcrafts. In addition to its potential nature- and culture-based tourism products,
the country is well positioned to receive tourists from Europe.46 The country has already created
an international image based on its natural environmental and ecosystems. However, opportunities
remain largely untapped, mainly due to the country’s history of instability. Tourism has a real
potential to be a source of shared growth in Guinea-Bissau, positively impacting communities,
especially if negative externalities are effectively managed. Most studies have pointed to three to
five areas in Guinea-Bissau or niches where tourism seems to be emerging and, with one notable
exception (Bissau), they are in and around the existing protected areas. These include the Bijagós
Archipelago, the Cantanhez National Park, the Varela/São Domingos/Cachéu region and Bissau,
the capital city. Dramatic shifts in community livelihoods can ensue from investment in tourism,
helping to raise incomes, create new jobs, and add value to previously inexistent activities.

         4   WEAK PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONS ARE A
                   CHALLENGE FOR SHARED PROSPERITY

     Endemic fragility (military coups, political assassinations, and repeated unconstitutional
    takeovers of the Government) in Guinea-Bissau have undermined current development and, if
    unaddressed, may threaten future gains. With some stability, GDP per capita in Guinea-Bissau
    could have been 65-90 percent higher in the absence of this fragility.

     Fragility has largely been the result of a rentier economy and the interlinked competition for
    rents among the elite. The allocation of several sources of public resources often lacks
    transparency and accountability, limiting the availability of critical public goods to citizens.

     Weak institutions and governance are at the center of the rentier nature of the economy.
    Guinea-Bissau ranks in the bottom 10th percentile on all indicators measuring public sector
    capacity in the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicator (WGI).

     While instability and corruption are separate problems, both need to be addressed in order
    to achieve higher, more equitable economic growth, and to reduce poverty.

     The broken social contract is reflected in the poor provision of basic public goods and
    services, economic opportunities, and justice. Benchmarking analysis shows that Guinea-
    Bissau ranks in the bottom 10-20 percent with respect to regional and world averages in most
    of the human and physical capital, business climate, transparency, rule of law, and other quality
    of institution indicators.

     Fragility and weak governance constitute the third core area of binding constraints for shared
    growth in Guinea-Bissau. Looking ahead, mitigating actions include: improving public
    financial management systems; addressing allocative, technical, and regressive inefficiencies
    in public spending; aligning incentives in the public sector; building capacity; strengthening
    the business regulatory framework; reforming the management of natural resources; and
    reforming the political system.

     Democratic elections and the maintenance of constitutional order during periods of political
    turmoil suggest that things are changing in Guinea-Bissau. Breaking the vicious cycle of
    fragility and underdevelopment moving forward will require a flexible strategy to undertake
    approaches that engage directly with the elite and to balance those actions with others that
    work to enhance the livelihoods and voice of the poor.
     

144. Weak governance and fragility have undermined the country’s development, and if
unaddressed, threaten future gains. Guinea-Bissau suffers repeated cycles of fragility with
negative effects on economic, political, and social systems. This has been induced by competition
for power among the political and military elites, over time undermining institutions meant to
govern the country and to provide public goods to the population. The country ranks in the bottom
10th percentile on all indicators measuring public sector capacity in the World Bank’s Worldwide
Governance Indicator (WGI). Rooted in colonialism and perpetuated by those who have governed


                                                   75
after independence, weak governance has allowed a rentier economy to fester, effectively diverting
much of the public resources toward private gain. As shown in Chapters 2 and 3, these power
relationships and the resulting rentier economy undermined development outcomes across the
board, ranging from the low provision of services, faltering infrastructure, low access to education
and health, and low-level household welfare equilibrium, to low and unstable growth, inadequate
private sector development, vulnerability to shocks, and overall poor macroeconomic
management. Benchmarking analysis shows that Guinea-Bissau ranks poorly (at the bottom 10-20
percent) with respect to regional averages, let alone to world averages, in most of the human and
physical capital, business climate, transparency, rule of law, and other quality of institution
indicators. 
            
145. Breaking the vicious cycle of fragility and underdevelopment will require a flexible
strategy to balance approaches that engage directly with the elite with other approaches that
legitimately circumvent it to enhance the livelihoods and voice of the poor. A development
agenda to move Guinea-Bissau away from the current high-poverty, low-growth, and high-fragility
equilibrium will necessarily require engagement with the Government. Explicitly excluding the
elite from the reform process may not be realistic and or even very effective in challenging elite
domination. On the contrary, it can exacerbate rather than lessen fragility. Stability is a prerequisite
for much-needed uninterrupted poverty reduction and growth. However, other strategies should be
pursued in parallel to gradually start relaxing the existing political constraints. One approach is to
encourage citizen engagement and demand for accountability and transparency in government
performance. This includes deliberate policy efforts to increase access to and dissemination of
information of general interest, and to strengthen mechanisms that channel broad-based demands
for improvements in public goods, dissatisfaction with underperformance of public officers, and
discontent with rigged politics. Another approach is working directly with beneficiaries, for
instance through community-driven programs implemented by NGOs, to address urgent needs,
such as water and sanitation, school and health services, nutrition programs, rural access roads,
and micro-finance. International actors like WAEMU, ECOWAS, the African Union and the donor
community can also harness forces and align incentives in favor of transparency and stability.
International development institutions, in particular, can increase donor coordination and leverage
their comparative advantage in data and diagnostics to improve the quality of political engagement.

4.1   Fragility, institution-building and economic development

146. Fragility constitutes a major challenge to economic development.  There is fairly
consistent evidence in the literature that shows a correlation between state fragility and low levels
of economic development. Evidence synthesized for the 2011 World Development Report
(“Conflict, Security and Development”) shows that most fragile or conflict-affected states (FCS)
underperformed in a wide array of indicators with respect to other developing countries and were
less likely to achieve the 2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDG). Children born in FCS are
twice as likely to be undernourished, lack access to improved water, and die before their fifth
birthday. Parents in FCSs are more than three times as likely to be unable to send their children to
school. Countries affected by major instability between 1981 and 2005 showed on average poverty
rates 21 percentage points higher than otherwise similar countries that saw no violence. This
evidence is in line with the reality observed in Guinea-Bissau.




                                                  76
147. Weak institutions and governance are at the center of repeated cycles of instability
and violence, and are critical cross-cutting areas for addressing poverty reduction. Kauffman
et al. (2009) defined governance as the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country
is exercised. This includes, among other things: (1) the process by which governments are selected,
monitored, and replaced; (2) the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and
implement sound policies; and (3) the respect of citizens and the state for the institutions that
govern economic and social interactions among them (Figure 4.1). There is growing consensus
among both academics and policymakers that weak institutional capacity, governance, and
accountability are important factors in explaining why political instability and violence are
repeated in the same countries or subnational regions (WDR, 2011). Different forms of instability
are not one-off events but are rather ongoing and repeated. Nine out of ten civil wars in the 2000s
took place in countries that had already had a civil war in the last 30 years. Repeated cycles of
instability and violence exacerbate their negative human, social, and economic effects.

    Figure 4.1. Fragility is correlated with underperformance in multiple human development
                                              outcomes




                         Source: World Development Indicators (2008-2012).

148. The governance framework in Guinea-Bissau is found to be extremely fragile. The
country is known to have relatively weak institutions and traditions with limitations relevant to
democratic participation, free media, freedom of expression, and political rights. Its elites use the
public administration chiefly for their own gain with little responsiveness to the needs of the
citizenry. This is consistent with the poor performance of Guinea-Bissau in the World Bank’s
Worldwide Governance Indicators and Enterprise Survey indicators. The country ranks in the
bottom decile globally, scoring poorly on government effectiveness, the control of corruption, the
quality of regulations, and the upholding and enforcement of the rule of law. Fragile and weak
public institutions lend themselves to an environment of weak transparency and accountability in
the use of public resources. Guinea-Bissau also has weak or non-existent systems in place for
tracking government performance, public spending, and the proportion of budget allocations. This
effectively blurs the revenue pathways and prevents a more efficient management of public
finances.

149. Fragility and resulting development challenges in Guinea-Bissau are rooted in the
colonial history of the country. Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001 and 2012) in their
research show that institutions in the developing countries are, more often than not, inherited from


                                                 77
colonial rulers.47 In countries where colonial powers did not settle but only exploited their
colonies’ resources, wealth institutions were designed purely to extract rents. Newly-independent
governments inherited the former colonial administration and the system of rent extraction, which
were neither fair nor transparent, but the systems just served local elites instead of colonial ones.
That was the case in the Portuguese colony of Guinea-Bissau. During colonial times, formally
from the 19th century until the mid-1970s, Guinea-Bissau was a largely-neglected territory. Unlike
the other Portuguese colonies of Cabo Verde, Angola, and Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau was not
considered fit for large-scale settlement. No significant investment was made in physical
infrastructure, human capital, or state institutions. Guineans were unable to access—much less
participate in—any aspect of the public administration.

150. Fragility and the interlinked competition for rents among the elite have negatively
influenced virtually every economic, social, and political dimension of the country. There is
hardly a domain of economic, social, physical, or human development in Guinea-Bissau that does
not bear the scars of a difficult legacy and the ongoing fragile political settlement. Political
instability has been a defining feature for the country since independence in 1974. Continued
competition among the elite has resulted in endemic political rivalry, frequent episodes of conflict
such as military coups, political assassinations, and repeated unconstitutional takeovers of the
government, weak public governance and institutions, clientelist political systems, and
misappropriation of public rents. This vicious cycle of elite capture and fragility have ultimately
undermined growth and service delivery to citizens.

151. Fragility, weak institutions and governance are pivotal underlying themes in
development moving forward. Fragility, exemplified through the multiple destabilizing political
events occurring throughout the country’s history, has forced economic development into a start-
and-stop pattern that resembles that of political power. Meanwhile, the weak governance
framework has both precluded full representation of the government by the people, and encouraged
those at the top to take advantage of the lack of accountability and massive disenfranchisement of
society. The constraints imposed by fragility and weak governance cut across all areas explored in
this document. Addressing them is one of the necessary pillars for shared prosperity and poverty
reduction.
4.2        Repeated cycles of fragility in Guinea-Bissau

152. Fragility in Guinea-Bissau has translated into repeated cycles of political turmoil in
the form of military coups, political assassinations, and repeated unconstitutional takeovers
of the Government. In countries such as Guinea-Bissau, where the elites are fragmented and
mechanisms limiting corruption are undeveloped, elites competing for rents will try to oust each
other, including through violent means, such as military coups (Figure 4.2). Symptomatic of this
context, the history of Guinea-Bissau was marked by regular attempted and successful military
coups, political assassinations, and civil strife. All in all, four successful coups have been recorded
in independent Guinea-Bissau, with another 16 coups attempted, plotted, or alleged.48 Indeed,

together with Somalia, Guinea-Bissau has experienced the highest incidence of planned or actual
coups in the world (see Box 4.1 for a chronology).This power struggle is evident among the army’s
past chiefs of staff (three were murdered and one forced into exile). Recently the relationship with
the army has become more complex due to alleged funding from the international narcotics trade,
leading some to label Guinea-Bissau Africa’s first ‘narco-state’.

153. Military coups are but one manifestation of fragility in Guinea-Bissau. Frequent
government turnover is another. Conflicts between the Government and the President in the
country’s semi-presidential system also contribute to the fragility in Guinea-Bissau. Between 1999
and 2009, Guinea-Bissau experienced government turnover each year. This was as much a
consequence of military interference as it was of dismissals of the Government by the President, a
constitutionally admissible process in the country’s semi-presidential polity. The recent dismissal
of the Government of Prime Minister Domingos Simoes Pereira in August 2015 continued a cycle
of annual government turn-over between the end of the civil war and 2009, after which a period of
four years of stability ended with the military coup of April 2012.

4.3        A rentier economy

154. Public office in Guinea-Bissau is associated with a personalized, clientelist model of
rent extraction. Weak public institutions enable the diversion of public goods toward private
citizens—often political or military elites—undermining the social compact and poverty reduction.
Appropriation of budget and external resources by those holding public office or being a public
servant is another major source of rents. Likewise, illegal activities, especially involving the drug
trade, illegal fishing, and lumber exports are the third major source of rents in Guinea-Bissau.

155. The functioning of product markets, for instance, cashews in agriculture—is heavily
exposed to rent seeking through the country’s weak business regulatory framework. The
cashew business is in many cases controlled by powerful elites, with the main issues being
uncompetitive practices, distortionary and unfair taxation, port negligence, and general
inefficiencies for smallholders. Background work for this SCD suggests that the quotas (number
of licenses or amounts traded by license) established for cashew traders are a source for corruption,
and also limit competition among traders, adversely affecting the bargaining ability of
smallholders. The Guinea-Bissau cashew market has had roughly 50 exporters, but their market
influence was equivalent to that of 20 exporters according to the Herfindahl–Hirschmann Index
(HHI) which measures market concentration. It is also well documented that the Fund to Promote
Industrialization of Agriculture Products (FUNPI) tax (suspended in 2015) burden fell most
heavily on the producers (upwards of 80 percent), while groups with more influence and market
share, such as brokers and traders, as well as exporters, collectively bear less than one-fifth of the
extra costs—it also distorts prices, encourages smuggling, and its revenue has widely been misused
(CEM 2015). Discrepancies in amounts imported by other countries and exported by Guinea-
Bissau also imply potential corrupt practices between traders and port officials, and highlight the
lack of a tracking system for merchandise at the country’s only port. Lastly, the fear of land
grabbing by government elites is considered one reason why smallholders remain in cashew, so as
to bolster their claims on land.49

156. The business environment is skewed towards the elite interests whereas the
appointment of civil servants is often based on patronage and corruption objectives rather
than on public administration needs or merit (Figure 4.3). The close-knit nature of this group
discourages transparency, and the fraudulent practice of hiring employees that are recorded in the
payroll system but do not work in the public administration (“ghost workers”) is common. In
2009/2010, the Government completed, for the first time in recent memory, a full-fledged audit of
its public administration, which identified 3,378 ghost workers, equivalent to 15.2 percent of the
total employment for the Government of Guinea-Bissau, resulting in significant savings (CFAF
122 million per month). The country does not have an asset-recording and disclosure process for
civil servants, government’s executives or members of parliament.

157. Another common form of rent extraction is the misappropriation and misallocation
of public resources. The last IMF technical assistance mission found that extra budgetary
expenditures bypassing standard procedures still represent an estimated 25 percent of government
spending. Political elites have been associated with embezzlement and misallocation of resources
on many fronts. FUNPI, a fund created to increase access to finance and to promote the
industrialization of the agricultural sector, has been heavily misused. There is evidence that a
transport infrastructure tax that collects as much as CFAF 1 billion (US$2 million) a year has been
financing expenditures unrelated to roads (its original intended use). Part of the subsidies on
gasoline and oil/diesel for power generation are stolen and used for private cars and trucks. In
education, the money paid by parents of students in secondary school goes directly to schools via
a local committee responsible for deploying the resources. These committees are not subject to
proper accounting procedures. Health workers, equipment and supplies are illegally diverted from
public health centers to private clinics to serve mostly the elite in the country. The military has
also been reported to misappropriate public revenue.

158. Illicit financial flows in and out of Guinea-Bissau constitute another sizable form of
corruption. Trade misinvoicing, analogous to trade-related money laundering, is an unlawful
method for moving capital in and out of a country by misreporting the value of a commercial
transaction on an invoice submitted to customs.50 An evaluation of United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) trade data reveals structural differences between Guinea-
Bissau exports to its trading partners and its trading partners’ records of imports from Guinea-
Bissau (and vice versa) that are much larger than normal discrepancies that might be found in
national accounts or from statistical errors.51 When Guinea-Bissau reports US$150 million of
exports to the world, the world reports importing more than US$300 million of imports from
Guinea-Bissau. Similarly, when Guinea-Bissau reports importing US$200 million from the world,
the world reports exporting more than US$400 million to Guinea-Bissau (see Figure 4.4.). The
                                                            
50
   See http://www.gfintegrity.org/issue/trade-misinvoicing. Trade misinvoicing is a method for moving money illicitly across borders which
involves deliberately misreporting the value of a commercial transaction on an invoice submitted to customs. A form of trade-based money
laundering, trade misinvoicing is the largest component of illicit financial outflows measured by Global Financial Integrity.
51
   Trade data from other Sources are unavailable for the recent years for Guinea-Bissau. The data in this section are all from UNCTAD, as of
January 2016.

relative stability of the amounts of the difference suggests that this is probably more related to
trade misinvoicing rather than to glitches in measurement. At the product level, Guinea-Bissau
reports twice less petroleum imports than its commercial partners’ report they export to the
country. On the exports side the differences are even more striking. While Guinea-Bissau reports
exporting almost no fish or wood products to the World, its commercial partners report importing
such goods in amounts equivalent to 30 percent of Guinea-Bissau exports.52

159. The amount of and competition for rents has increased in recent years with the
intensification of the international drug trade, which uses Guinea-Bissau as a transshipment
location. In recent years, the international drug trade between Latin America and Europe took hold
in Guinea-Bissau, with the West African nation serving as an entry point from which drugs are
trafficked onwards by land and air. Estimates of trafficked narcotics volumes are difficult to obtain.
Based on international seizures reported by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
(UNDC), trafficked cocaine in Guinea-Bissau could be valued above US$16.9 million (3.4 percent
of GDP) in 2005, and is likely to have increased considerably in value since that time. Cocaine
flows surged in the aftermath of the 2012 military coup, and there is considerable evidence of
military involvement in the drug trade (see Box 4.2).53 Given the high value of the drug trade, it
can be concluded that rents accruing from it to the armed forces are substantial.

     Figure 4.4. Important differences appear between bilateral trade data reported by Guinea-Bissau

   Looking at Guinea- Bissau’s trading partners allows for the identification of the direction of potential trade misinvoicing, although it is difficult
to underline any specific directions on the Guinea-Bissau export side.52. Such patterns are however clear on the Guinea-Bissau’s import side, and
some trade misinvoicing seem to occur with Portugal–the former colonizer- and Senegal –its biggest neighbor. Especially for Portugal, petroleum
and oil products account for the main difference between the two recorded trade flows.

                        Box 4.2 Elites and the illegal economy in Guinea-Bissau
Guinean elites have a history of involvement in clandestine and illicit activities. There is indication that
cocaine trafficking emerged in the mid-2000s, coinciding with President Lansana Conté of neighboring
Guinea brokering a deal between the exiled Guinean president Nino Vieira and a number of key political
and military figures in Guinea-Bissau to secure the former’s safe return and successful election. Recently,
an estimated 25 tons of cocaine transited through Guinea-Bissau between April and July of 2012 (O’Regan
& Thompson, 2013). The arrest on charges of drugs trafficking by the United States Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) of the former chief of staff of the navy, Rear Admiral José Américo Bubo Na Tchuto
in a sting operation, and the subsequent indictment of the then chief of staff of the armed forces, General
Indjai in April 2013, brought the trade to a temporary halt. It is suggested that it has since resumed, with
small quantities flown by passengers (that is “mules”) in commercial flights from Brazil, and more
generally from Latin America. The Na Tchuto arrest may provide clues about the amounts of money
involved, because the deal the Admiral had agreed to include a US$1 million payment for every ton of
cocaine passing through.

However, as long as the extension of state authority remains weak, Guinea-Bissau remains vulnerable to
not only cocaine trafficking, but also to other illicit economic activities that can undermine development
and stability. For the elites in the Guinean context, cocaine is just one of a variety of opportunistic items
from a wide spectrum of activities varying from the legal to the criminal. Probably equally, and possibly
more profitable, partly illicit opportunities include illegal fishing (or rent capturing from selling fishing
licenses) or trade of precious, protected timber destined for China, which increased immensely as a
consequence of the 2012 coup. On a smaller scale, the trafficking of illegal migrants, the sale of diplomatic
passports, and weapon trafficking are equally worrisome.

4.4     Rent extraction is facilitated by weak public governance

160. Guinea-Bissau ranks poorly on most of the governance indicators. Guinea-Bissau
scores in the bottom 10th percentile on all indicators measuring public sector capacity in the World
Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicator (WGI) (Figure 4.5). These indicators measure
performance in control of corruption, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, and rule of
law. On the latter two measurements, the country ranks as low as the 3rd percentile. Other rankings
produce results along the same lines.

161. The weak public financial management framework of Guinea-Bissau is one of the
main areas where the lack of good governance is more evident, limiting the efficiency of
public resources. There are gaps in the existing PFM system which need to be addressed to enable
the government to administer public resources while minimizing fiduciary concerns. The budget
process lacks sufficient commitment controls, is plagued by significant off-budget expenditures,
does not follow strict procurement, accounting, and reporting procedures, and lacks a credible set
of internal and external controls. The overall legal and regulatory framework that governs the
budget process is weak. A stronger process for budget execution, including fiduciary safeguards,
will be necessary to administer both Official Development Assistance (ODA) and domestic
revenue.

162. Implementation of a credible budget process with sufficient internal and external
controls remains a major challenge for Guinea-Bissau, after many systems were halted after
the 2012 coup. Both the 2009 Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability
Review (PEMFAR) report and the 2013 Public Expenditure Financial Accountability
(PEFA) assessment show that most of the modest gains recorded between 2009 and 2011 have
subsequently been lost.54 Whereas improvements had been made in budget credibility and
reporting, and a new electronic PFM software system was mounted, these advances have largely
stalled and some have been reversed, as PFM institutions have been regularly circumvented since
the coup of 2012. Examples of items setback include preparation of quarterly budget reports for
the National Assembly, attempts to strengthen budget preparation and execution through the use
of the budgetary software system SIGFIP,55 and the adoption of a budgetary nomenclature in line
with WAEMU standards (CEM 2015).

163. Consequently, the budget and the implementation of the government program and
policies are disconnected. It is a well-established norm that a budget is only useful as a policy
tool if it is realistic and comprehensive, with clear lines to government priorities which can be
closely monitored and enforced.56 For Guinea-Bissau, the recent PEFA report shows that the
budget exercise is generally an academic exercise, with ministries largely repeating prior years’
allocations with only limited consideration of policies and government programs. Therefore,
spending units and ministries often ignore the budget and find ways to implement their priorities
through a variety of means, including off-budget sources of financing and unreported expenditures.
This process undermines the usefulness of the budget and is prone to rent extraction.

164. Existing systems of internal and external control are not functional, creating
opportunities for misappropriation of rents in virtually every sector of the economy. Unlike
ex-post financial audits, internal controls are aimed at providing corrective action as the budget is
being used. Yet, the few existing mechanisms of control are limited in scope, capacity, and
independence. For instance, an inspection service exists within the Ministry of Finance
(Inspectorate General of Finance) but it awaits the promulgation of new draft legislation, and its
activities are limited and subject to ministerial and Council of Minister approvals. The Treasury
Committee, which used to impose both cash-management and fiduciary controls, closed down in
2012. The procurement system has seen some improvements but remains underdeveloped; it is
                                                            
54 The 2009 PEMFAR and the 2013 PEFA reports describe at length many weaknesses in public financial management concerning all key areas.
55 SIGFIP is a financial management information system (FMIS) software that is widely used in French-speaking Africa.
56 This is a process which requires consultation with relevant stakeholders.

understaffed, with very weak capacity and limited operational means. There is a need to develop
new procedures manuals, including national standard bidding documents for the procuring
organizations, procurement performance review mechanisms, and electronic tools to monitor and
report procurement transactions.

165. While Guinea-Bissau, in 2009, officially adopted WAEMU PFM directives, they are
yet to be ratified as national law, thereby limiting the effectiveness of internal and external
controls.57 The directives adopted are intended to provide the basis for: (1) improving the
reliability and timeliness of macroeconomic forecasts to better achieve annual and multi-year
budgeting; (2) budget and financial control to improve budget preparation, commitment
management, control and accounting, as well as timely and accurate budget execution reports;
(3) improving payment management and control to produce more timely and reliable in-year
financial execution reports, and to reconcile these reports with the budget execution reports
published by the Directorate of the Budget (DGO). Special attention is required in the area of
human resources and payroll system administration, including the incorporation into the system of
the defense and security forces, which are not currently covered under the scope of the payroll
application.

166. The tax framework is outdated and tax administration is highly ineffective. The low
revenue intake has been the result of the narrow tax base and the existing weakness in tax policies,
and also has been the result of poor administration. Improved business processes can increase total
tax revenue without increasing the tax rate by more efficiently collecting actual tax payables.
Reducing the burden associated with tax payments for companies will not only help the private
sector grow but will also provide weaker incentives to avoid paying taxes. This would strengthen
the collection effort (CEM, 2015). A functional Treasury single account (TSA), which could,
among other things, help restore control over public resources for better service delivery is also
not in place.

167. Public administration is also undermined by a large bureaucracy, notably the
overrepresentation of the military. The size of the public sector in Guinea-Bissau is large and
puts a strain on an already limited public sector resource base. In 2010, the public sector in Guinea-
Bissau was 2.5 percent of the population, above that of Senegal (1.1 percent) and comparable to
some of the largest in the region. Employment in the public sector has been increasing by 4 percent
per year, faster than population and revenue growth, but due to “ghost workers”, this rate could be
grossly understated.58 General administration and education, and, to a lesser extent, the health
sectors, were among the main beneficiaries. Nonetheless, the military and paramilitary sectors
account for the largest share of overall public employment. There are also no systems in place to
track civil servants’ time of duty in public administration, which undermines budget credibility,
particularly since contingent liabilities related to labor are unknown. Salaries represented about
50 percent of current expenditures and about 35 percent of total expenditure in 2013 (or 5 percent


                                                            
57
   In 2009, the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) adopted six new public financial management (PFM) regulations
(Directives) covering transparency in public finances, budget preparation and execution laws, government accounting, budget classifications,
central government chart of accounts, and central government operations tableau des opérations financières de l’Etat (TOFE).
58
   The first public sector census completed in 2010 identified 3,378 ghost workers and double dippers, or 15.2 percent of the total employment for
the government of Guinea-Bissau. Some public employees are not officially registered as civil servants but receive a bonus only, and are only paid
occasionally.



                                                                       85
 


of GDP), corresponding to about 60 percent of domestic revenue and 41 percent of revenue
including grants, highlighting the importance of this problem in an environment of low revenues.

168. Technical capacity in the public sector is low. Human capital may be a binding constraint
to efforts to improve the capacity of the public sector. The 2015 CEM demonstrates that Guinea-
Bissau’s civil service exhibits high capacity gaps and skills mismatches across line ministries. The
latest civil service census confirmed that only 24 percent of total public sector workforce had six
years of formal education or more, of which almost 50 percent held tertiary level qualifications.
Another 15 percent had no mastery of basic numeracy and literacy skills.

4.5   The way forward for stronger governance and less fragility

169. Repeated cycles of fragility and weak institutions have broken the social contract in
Guinea-Bissau. The vicious cycle of fragility and weak governance results in the neglect of the
vast majority of the population, most of whom lack access to stable and reliable basic services and
economic opportunities. Fragility and weak institutions are counter-productive and distortionary
for growth more generally, creating significant barriers in the development of the private sector
and competitive markets. Benchmarking analysis prepared for this SCD shows that Guineans fare
worse than the regional and world averages on most economic, social, and institutional fronts,
reiterating the country’s complex yet much needed task of constructing the fundamentals for
development through the strengthening of the social contract (Annex 1A). Among the main
consequences of this loose social contact is widespread poverty.

170. A new and inclusive strategy which capitalizes on short-term opportunities while
addressing longer-term constraints will be needed to move Guinea-Bissau forward. Donor
pressure alone is unlikely to engender an environment for long-term change. At the same time,
minimal pressure may legitimize weak governance and fragility. Instead, this report argues for a
mixture of strategies that combine direct engagement of government with increased participation
of other local, regional, and international actors to create a critical mass of demand for transparency
and accountability and to increase political participation. A development agenda to move Guinea-
Bissau away from the current high-poverty, low-growth and high-fragility equilibrium will
necessarily require engagement with the Government. Explicitly excluding the elite from the
reform process may not be realistic or even effective in challenging elite domination. On the
contrary, it can exacerbate rather than lessen fragility. Stability is a prerequisite for much-needed
uninterrupted poverty reduction and growth. However, other strategies should be pursued in
parallel to gradually start relaxing the existing political constraints.

    Box 4.3 Strengthening Public Sector Performance in Service Delivery through Partnership with
                                         Social Enterprises
Social Enterprises (SEs) provide innovative and cost-effective development solutions through combining
business strategies to achieve social impact, rather than maximizing financial profits. They target areas
where there are persistent gaps in the delivery of basic services that governments and markets
have not adequately addressed, which includes working in areas such as education, maternal and child
health, water and sanitation, and raising agriculture productivity. SEs manage to reach the poor by working
closely with local communities, raising awareness, designing suitable, acceptable and easily available
solutions, and providing value for money and financing solutions to fit the customers’ needs and profiles.
SEs can be valuable partners to governments, in particular those struggling to extend basic services to the
unserved and underserved populations. By working with SEs, governments can harness the innovations and
strategies that social enterprises have developed to reach the poor. Collaboration can take on many forms,
including replicating the SE’s model, encouraging SEs to expand, contracting directly with the SEs, or
providing a supportive environment in which grassroots SEs can grow. Below are a couple of examples of
the impact social enterprises have made in the region.

Replicating innovation for better educational outcomes. In Liberia, about 42 percent of children are out
of school and the Government, strapped for resources, sought bold innovative solutions to address this
problem. For this, they looked at Bridge International Academies (Bridge), a Social Enterprise in Kenya
that provides low-cost private schooling in poor neighborhoods, at a cost of about US$80 per year— or a
quarter of the US$318 cost for a Kenyan public school pupil. Bridge’s low cost business model is based on
using para-skilled teachers who deliver standardized curriculum provided on tablets, which also enables
close tracking of the curriculum delivery and attendance. School management is centralized, further
reducing overhead costs. Despite its lower costs, educational outcomes have proven to be higher—a Bridge
child in a low income neighborhood had a 40 percent greater chance of passing the national exam than his
public school counterpart. Since the first academy opened in 2009, Bridge currently operates over 450
schools, providing education to more than 110,000 low income students in Kenya, Uganda, and Nigeria.
Under the Government of Liberia’s Partnership Schools for Liberia program, Bridge will implement its
model in about 50 Liberian public schools in a one-year pilot program. Schools will remain free public
schools and be subject to the Ministry of Education’s standards and expectations, but Bridge will be in
charge of curriculum delivery and administration. The partnership seeks to replicate Bridge’s previous
successes to rapidly improve schooling quality and results in Liberia, and if successful could expand the
program nationwide.

Increasing agricultural productivity and livelihoods. Agricultural productivity is another area where
even moderate improvements can have significant impacts on the household income. One Acre Fund
(OAF), a social enterprise working in Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, and Rwanda, provides farmers with
support throughout the value chain, including financing for farm inputs, distribution of seed and fertilizer,
training on agricultural techniques, and market facilitation to maximize profits from harvest sales. OAF
currently serves 305,000 farm families who have gained an average 55 percent (or US$137) increase in
annual income. The OAF model has also proved to be successful in the context of smaller, post-conflict
countries. In collaboration with the Government of Rwanda, OAF entered the country in 2011 and currently
serves 113,500 farmers who have experienced a 67 percent increase in annual income (corresponding to
US$99). Similarly, OAF entered Burundi in 2012 and has served 40,200 farmers whose income increased
by 99 percent (or US$67). There is further evidence of positive spillover effects in terms of increased
agricultural productivity in farm fields neighboring OAF clients. 


171. Empowering the poor through increased demand for transparency and
accountability, and also through direct, more effective delivery of basic services, can be a
major catalyst in the process of strengthening institutions and addressing behavioral norms

                                                     87
 


in public and political spheres. One approach is to encourage citizen engagement and demand
for accountability and transparency in government performance. This includes deliberate policy
efforts to increase access to and dissemination of information of general interest, and to strengthen
mechanisms that channel broad-based demands for improvements in public goods, dissatisfaction
with underperformance of public officers, and discontent with rigged politics. Another approach
is working directly with beneficiaries, for instance through community-driven programs
implemented by NGOs, to address urgent needs such as water and sanitation, school and health
services, nutrition programs, rural access roads, and micro-finance (see Box 4.3 for examples of
alternative service delivery mechanisms which have been used in some countries to raise income
and productivity while circumventing the issues of fragility and elite competition.) Another
approach involves promoting greater private sector participation – with support from reputable
institutions such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency (MIGA) – in the agriculture value chain and other sectors to spur confidence
and leadership outside of the existing elites. International actors like WAEMU, ECOWAS, the
African Union and the donor community can also harness forces and align incentives in favor of
transparency and stability. International development institutions, in particular, can increase donor
coordination and leverage their comparative advantage in data and diagnostics to improve the
quality of political engagement.

172. The way forward should also involve combining stronger incentives and behavioral
norms with capacity building. There is a need to improve the minimum level of public goods
provided to citizens and to restore the ability of the State to efficiently collect and spend public
funds. Public sector capacity needs to be improved through the creation of better standards for
hiring of public servants, better training, and other capacity development measures. Public
financial management systems are at the same time both archaic and cumbersome, requiring better
and more simplified systems of internal and external control, such as better procurement, auditing,
and inspection services more generally. Reallocation of expenditures from sectors such as the
military toward those that build human, physical, and institutional capital is another way to address
weak governance. Finally, a more business-friendly environment to accelerate investments and
economic growth can be achieved through a better business regulatory environment, more
competitive bidding, easier procedures for registering a business, and better contract-enforcement,
and also by making regulatory bodies more independent. These measures can strengthen
governance and improve the ability of the state to provide for its citizens, to restore the social
contract, to reengage the common citizen, and to set forth a path for stable progress.

                                              5        SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGES

 The structure of the economy in Guinea-Bissau subjects the country to multiple economic,
environmental, and political risks moving forward, including an accelerated depletion of its
natural wealth, a weak political settlement, and the interlinked elite competition for rents.

 Economic activities are extremely concentrated, limiting growth opportunities and leaving
the economy vulnerable to external, political, and natural shocks. Reduced fiscal space and
dependence on grants from the international community, which in turn are unpredictable due to
endemic fragility, will continue limiting the ability of Guinea-Bissau to tackle its primary
developmental challenges.

 The current manner of utilization of natural resources with misallocations of their associated
rents results in Guinea-Bissau depleting rather than building its total net capital, undermining
growth potential.

 Important drivers of fragility that remain unaddressed could fuel instability and should
therefore be focused on moving forward. They include an unfinished political transformation,
the existence of military interference in political and economic affairs, a weak justice system, a
captured economy, weak institutions, and a strong rural-urban divide.

 Engendering sustainable growth and boosting shared prosperity in Guinea-Bissau is
contingent on creating political stability and achieving the right mix of macroeconomic policy
choices coupled with improved management of existing natural and environmental resources
 
5.1 Structural issues and existing and emerging risks threaten economic sustainability

           Limited diversification and internal and external sources of instability

173. Notwithstanding the importance of the cashew sector in economic life in Guinea-
Bissau, economic activities are extremely concentrated, limiting growth potential in the
future. The dependence on raw cashews has grown overtime at the expense of other activities and
sectors with higher valued added. A recent IMF report shows that both export diversification
(product and partners) and quality of exports has been declining in Guinea-Bissau. In fact, the
country has the least diversified export base in the WAEMU.59 Increasing diversification and
quality upgrading in Guinea-Bissau to levels observed in WAEMU between 2001 and 2010 could
result in an increase in the average real growth rate by about 1 percentage point (IMF 2014a).

174. The narrow economic base represents a major risk to external sustainability because
it leaves the country vulnerable in terms of trade shocks. While the recent trend in cashew
prices on the international market has been favorable, a sudden reversal would have a deleterious
impact on the country’s external accounts. The same would also be true for oil prices, given the
dependence on imported petroleum products. Frequent instances of political instability are also
known to interrupt financial flows, undermining external stability (see Figure 5.1). Nevertheless,
Guinea-Bissau’s real effective exchange rate is assessed to be broadly in line with the country’s

fundamentals, and the monetary policy framework in the WAEMU has produced substantial
benefits in terms of price and exchange rate stability and convertibility of the CFA franc (Karas,
2006). At the same time, maintaining macroeconomic stability will be made more challenging if
the business cycles of the member countries are not well synchronized and if stabilization
mechanisms aimed at absorbing common and idiosyncratic shocks are absent or ineffective.

175. Most indicators point to substantial stability risks in Guinea-Bissau’s financial
system. The financial system is shallow, informal, and extremely concentrated, and oversight is
weak (IMF, 2015). Relative to other WAEMU countries, the banking sector which dominates
Guinea-Bissau’s financial sector is less liquid with higher non-performing loans. It is also
undiversified, where 25 percent of bank lending is concentrated in the cashew sector. A poor
judicial system, a heavy guarantee mechanism, and lack of operationability all incentivize
informality. Compliance with key prudential benchmarks is also lower, which undermines the
overall stability of the system.

       Fiscal sustainability

176. Limited fiscal space will continue to hamper the ability of Guinea-Bissau to tackle
many of the development challenges identified. As is the case in many fragile states, weak
capacity is reflected in a limited scope of revenue collections. With a relatively narrow tax base,
concentrated on a small number of revenue headings, which primarily cover duties on imports and
cashew nut exports, public finances are significantly below the target of 17 percent required by the
Convergence, Stability, Growth and Solidarity Pact of the WAEMU. There is an overreliance on
donor grants, which represented 43 percent of government total revenue in 2014. On the
expenditures side, the control of the wage bill is a big issue. Payroll expenditures represented 73
percent of tax revenue in 2014, well above the target of 35 percent for the WAEMU zone.
Rigidities in compensation-related expenditures have traditionally limited public investments in
social and public infrastructure, which increases the risk of accumulating domestic arrears linked
to wages. In 2013, they represented nearly 52 percent of total domestic arrears.

177. Guinea-Bissau faces a moderate risk of fiscal distress, but the sustainability of its
fiscal accounts is dependent on grants from the international community. With the relatively


                                                 90
 


low revenue base, which traditionally is outpaced by expenditures, the country has been
accustomed to running deficits. In fact, the country suffered from fiscal stresses in the early 2000s
with an overall fiscal deficit above 10 percent of GDP and with an overall public sector debt stock
in excess of 400 percent of GDP. While the completion of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
Initiative in 2010 helped to bring Guinea-Bissau’s fiscal deficit and debt down to sustainable levels
(see Figures 5.2 and 5.3), the gap between the actual and structural budget balances have started
to deteriorate. The overall fiscal deficit increased to 2.2 percent of GDP in 2012, from 1.4 percent
in 2011. To contain the risk of debt distress and ultimately support long-term debt sustainability
Guinea-Bissau will, among other things, need to strengthen debt management practices, as well as
implement necessary reforms for the economy to achieve higher rates of growth.

manageable levels

178. Fiscal sustainability is anchored by the recent approval of a three-year program by
the IMF under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program. The program is intended to
consolidate the country’s fiscal position through better expenditure management and enhanced
revenue mobilization, to strengthen institutional reforms, to mitigate vulnerabilities, and to
develop private sector activities to support growth and job creation (IMF, 2015).60 Notably, there
is a focus on improving the policy framework by addressing governance and security issues,
strengthening budgetary transparency as well as public investment and debt management, and
improving the compilation of statistics. Efforts to improve budget execution and public financial
management are expected to create a platform to tackle a number of governance-related issues,
while enhancing revenue mobilization should help to build fiscal space for infrastructure and social
spending (see Table 6.1). Effective debt management calls for a prompt upgrade of current
practices and continued reliance on concessional borrowing.

5.2   Risks to environmental sustainability are ultimately risks to long-term inclusive growth

179. Most of Guinea-Bissau’s wealth lies in its natural endowments, especially renewable
natural resources which account for over 90 percent of this wealth. Guinea-Bissau has the
highest proportion of natural wealth per capita in the West African region, accounting for
approximately 47 percent of the country’s wealth. This includes agriculture land (crop and pasture
land), fisheries, forests (timber, non-timber forest resources, carbon), and natural habitats and
ecosystems protected in national parks. It is also among the few countries in West Africa where
development has had limited negative impact on the environment. This may be rapidly changing:
tree cover loss has resulted in a reduction of forest cover by 3.6 percent between 2010 and 2014.
Forest cover had shrunk by 3.4 percent in the ten years before.

180. The natural resource base of Guinea-Bissau is essential for the livelihoods of local
communities, and for biodiversity and public revenue streams. The country’s ecosystems
provide multiple services such as food, water, shelter, income, and resiliency to climate change.
Forests help support hydrological cycles, preserve soil quality, and protect against erosion, which
also serves as a buffer against desertification and a carbon sink. Mangrove forests provide
neighboring villages with flood defense from rising sea levels, and act as an essential breeding and
nursery ground for the fishing stock. The goods and services supported by the country’s natural
endowments also contribute to government finances. Exports of agricultural produce bring in much
needed foreign exchange. Fishing licenses, on average, accounted for 15.5 percent of government
revenue between 2009 and 2011. Improvements in forest governance and tax collection could
result in greater tax revenue from the sales of timber and timber related products. Moreover, forests
have the potential to provide the country with carbon credits to sell in international carbon markets.

181. Sustainability of long-term growth is being mined by shrinking natural assets and a
declining overall asset base. Income, or GDP, results from the productive use of a country’s
assets. It can also occur from the depletion and monetization of certain assets such as timber and
bauxite. To the extent that total wealth has decreased, largely as a result of mismanaged assets,
prospects for nature-based growth will continue shrinking. Furthermore, considering the low
investment in the physical and human capital of the country, the current mismanagement of natural
resources means that Guinea-Bissau is depleting rather than building its total net capital. As noted
above, at about 2 percent of GNI in 2010, savings and investments rates are exceptionally low in
Guinea-Bissau. Estimates of natural capital show that natural-wealth adjusted net savings would
be even more negative had current unsustainable resource exploitation rates in some sectors have
been taken into account (for instance, logging and agricultural practices such as slash and burn
techniques, and overgrazing of livestock). Poor management or mismanagement of mineral
dividends such as phosphate, bauxite, and petroleum reserves pushed net savings rates down
further (Figure 5.4).

182. Weak capacity and governance as well as information gaps are largely responsible
for the loss of valuable natural wealth. Existing institutions for natural resource management
are under resourced and face severe challenges, including lack of human resources and
information, and data constraints. The Government is aware of the importance of the country’s
natural wealth, and since the early 1990s has put in place a number of agencies and plans to oversee
the management of these resources. The initiatives are well placed, but not well financed. The lack

                                                 92 
 
 


of approaches for natural capital accounting causes there to be limits on more explicit analyses of
the costs and benefits of natural resource exploitation and management decisions. Resource
management is largely dependent on official grants, and as a result of high fragility, aid flows have
fluctuated widely. Weak governance leads to the indiscriminant felling of forests, which is taking
a toll on the forest ecosystem. The poor state of the country’s energy infrastructure has increased
the county’s reliance on basic fuels such as charcoal. Illegal fishing is widespread, and the weak
institutional capacity to monitor and enforce licensing agreements is undermining the country’s
marine fisheries. Some agricultural and forest-dwelling practices are hurting local ecosystems.
Slash and burn techniques, and overgrazing of livestock, are not uncommon.

183. Risks in the mining sector such as depletion, environmental degradation, and
mismanagement of rents from mining are also high. The supply of non-renewables is by
definition limited, which means that depletion is unavoidable. Experience in other countries has
shown that mineral resource extraction can lead to significant local environmental degradation
(including, for instance, erosion, loss of biodiversity, and contamination of soil and bodies of
water), to the detriment of local populations, particularly the poor who are the most directly
dependent upon natural resources for daily subsistence, and the most vulnerable to experiencing
negative impacts on their health and wellbeing from a degraded environment. Legal infrastructure
has been built up to protect both the environment and the local communities that would be affected
by mining interests in Guinea-Bissau. However, the capacity to enforce these laws and regulations
is weak. Perhaps the biggest long-term risk to mining is posed by the limited capacity to absorb
revenues and to transform them into other forms of wealth, or to directly transfer them to boost the
incomes of the poorest members of society. Without effective and enforceable transparency
arrangements, these economic rents can increase competition among the elite, which further
increases fragility.

184. Climate change adds extra pressure on the need to preserve natural habitats. The
country’s low lying coastal areas make up 61 percent of the country and are highly vulnerable to
rising sea levels, stronger tides, and salinization of surface water and aquifers. These areas host
approximately 80 percent of the population, the bulk of the country’s economic activity, and much
of the country’s limited existing infrastructure. Increased risks of flooding and coastal erosion
could lead to the disappearance of biodiversity reserves and agricultural land on which the local
economy is based. Guinea-Bissau’s agriculture is also highly vulnerable to changes in rainfall


                                                                                                                   93
 


patterns. The recent NAPA (2011) identifies a reduction in rainfall of 11.7 percent by 2100 and
increased irregularity of rainfall as the most serious climatic risks facing the country. Climate
stress, in conjunction with anthropogenic pressure (especially slash and burn agriculture combined
with cashew plantation and logging) has the potential to accelerate deforestation and degradation
of mangrove and terrestrial forest cover.

185. Maximizing rents from natural resources in a sustainable manner requires managing
important trade-offs. Mineral and petroleum extraction, plus the construction and operation of
associated infrastructures, is likely to cause significant stress on national protected areas and their
wildlife corridors, as well as on Bolama-Bijagos Biosphere Reserve. Policies to promote the
expansion of lowland and bolhana rice cultivation, with a view to improving agricultural
productivity and boosting food security, could come at the cost of mangrove forest. Carbon credits
from REDD+ projects could bring many benefits in the long term (for instance, carbon
sequestration, access to carbon credit revenues, and improved forest management) but could also
result in restrictions on logging activities and timber revenues in the short term.

5.3   Some drivers of fragility remain unaddressed

      Unfinished political transformation

186. The country’s history is marked by an unfinished political transformation driven by
competition for rents. The constitution (adopted in 1991) is ambiguous about the division of labor
between the offices of the president and the prime minister. This has created structural tensions
between a president who is prevented by the constitution from serving as the president of a party,
but at the same time has the right to dissolve the assembly and remove the prime minister; and a
prime minister who hails from the majority party in the assembly, and can be strong as long as he
controls the assembly through that party. In addition, factionalism is endemic. These factions are
defined by shifting alliances among a small and exclusive elite made of security sector officials
and politicians who are frequently also civil servants, businessmen, civil society, and NGO leaders,
all in competition to secure access to segments of the Government. In Guinea-Bissau, the
Government remains the primary tool for personal enrichment, whether through civil service
positions, issuance of contracts to build public infrastructure and licenses to exploit natural
resources (particularly for fishing and logging), access to loans (and protection from having to
repay them), or profitable privatization opportunities. A government-toppling crisis is always a
high latent risk in this context of elite capture and competition for rents. (Figure 5.5).

187. Internal competition between politicians and the different arms of government is a
major risk to the current reform agenda. The current Government is undertaking a complex
balancing act as it tries to mitigate a wide range of opinions, constituencies, and interests. Avoiding
a political crisis is absolutely essential in the present circumstances in view of some of the very
courageous but controversial reforms that the Government has initiated. This will require carefully
calibrated support and a constant watch by the international community over political, economic,
and security trends. The process of security sector reform (SSR) could trigger new instability if it
happens or frustrations of unmet expectations if it does not take place. There is also a risk that the
Government might be overstretching its ability if it moves ahead with too many difficult reforms
in parallel. The Government is engaged in a careful balancing act between the need to maintain

the necessary alliances and compromises while at the same time promoting reforms that affect
important vested interests within the military, political, and business establishment.

       Military interference in political and economic spheres
188. The politicization of the security sector created a series of severe imbalances. Since
the end of the independence war, the Guinea-Bissau state has had difficulties handling the
symbolic and financial weight of the armed forces. A formal merit-based system for career and
rank attribution was never put in place. Instead, personal affiliation to certain politicians and
military leaders and participation in political violence has been a necessity for career advancement.
As such, the army is large compared to the size of the population and for a country that does not
face significant external threats. Salaries for the army alone represents 30 percent of the total wages
paid by the state. Despite the extensive demobilization campaigns over the years the troops-to-
population ratio is still twice the West African average.

189. Reform of the security sector is crucial but bears its own risks. The army has been a
source for rent-seeking and a key driver of the country’s fragility. Reforming it by reducing its size
and improving civilian oversight is crucial. Currently, the Government, with support of
development partners, is developing a financial incentives system for soldiers in order to reduce
the military’s resistance to reform. So far, the focus has been on a special pension fund created to
allow for the retirement and reintegration of more than 2,200 members of the defense and security
forces. This was attempted in the past, but instead of army reform, the army became more
demanding. If this were to happen again, the price for stability would be an increase in public
payments to the military, posing large pressure on the fiscal accounts.

       Impunity, weak justice sector, and lack of effective conflict resolution system
190. Access to justice by all members of society, guaranteed by the constitution, is still far
from real. As with many other institutions in Guinea-Bissau, access to justice is often determined
by social status, inclusion in a network of influence, and the availability of financial resources.
The difficulty in obtaining proper adjudication is forcing people to depend on patrons with
leverage, usually politicians or military, and thus reinforcing the patronage system at the expense


                                                           95
 


of a system based on meritocracy, equality, and rule of law. With such a dysfunctional legal
system, hybrid forms of traditional and informal ways of justice administration and dispute
resolution have emerged, particularly, but not exclusively, in the rural areas. This has its own
challenges as vulnerable groups such as women and youth tend to have uneasy access to local
authorities and their justice mechanisms. These judicial gaps can result in escalation to larger-scale
communal violence.

191. At the central level, Guinea-Bissau’s justice sector faces great obstacles. Cases of
politicians suspected of embezzling public money, or members of the defense and security forces
accused of involvement in violent crimes, if investigated at all, usually end up in judicial stand-
offs. Judicial police and magistrates are often the targets of both corruption and intimidation, and
the resulting impunity and the absence of rule of law have had a deleterious effect on judicial
development beyond the criminal domain. For instance, the absence of mechanisms to enforce
contracts and agreements has prevented investments in larger-scale agriculture and processing
facilities. While natural resources are plentiful, the risks of such investments are significant in view
of the weak regulatory framework and the lack of rule of law.

       Rural-urban divide

192. Lack of a government presence outside of Bissau is a defining feature of fragility,
which has rendered the state illegitimate in the eyes of many. Access to public services and
possibilities to participate in public administration have been limited to the urban center.
Unfavorable terms of trade persisted, with rural production used to subsidize imports benefiting
the urbanized elites. The degradation of public institutions in the rural areas became even more
evident after the 1998/99 civil war. The weak and uneven presence of the Government feeds the
control of opportunities by closed elites. The Balanta tend to dominate the military, the Fulani and
Mandingo dominate trade, and a variety of coastal groups, such as the Pepel, Manjak and Creoles,
with a history of access to formal education, tend to have a strong presence in the administration.
This reality has the potential to feed ethnic politics. The newly-elected government is making
efforts to strengthen local capacity and moderate the rural-urban divide. Local elections are
scheduled for the first time ever in 2017, and the Government has moved to appoint new regional
governors.

       But there are resilience factors

193. The relatively peaceful relations between ethnic and religious groups, which has
persisted despite decades of cyclical crisis, augurs well for building resilience. Contrary to
experiences elsewhere in the region, and despite an increasing reference to ethnicity and, to a lesser
degree, to religion, ethnic relations and religion have remained remarkably peaceful. Guinea-
Bissau is a small country with lots of cross-community personal ties, a strong nationalist narrative,
and a common language, Portuguese kriol. Even the Balanta, who have been most affected by
ethnic narratives have not instrumentalized ethnicity as a main banner for their grievances. Crises
have taken place between political and military elites, but beyond the civil war in 1998/99 they
have resulted in relatively few casualties beyond political assassinations, and have not trickled
down to involve society.




                                                  96
 


194. A vibrant if burgeoning civil society exists and is losing patience with the repeated
political crises and military interference in political and economic spheres. Building on the
country’s tradition of political mobilization, segments of the elite have eagerly seized upon the
political liberalization of the 1980s and support of international partners to build a civil society,
NGOs, and private media. They have not been immune to politics, bad governance, corruption,
and patronage, but have nevertheless created a network with rural roots that can help support
reforms, and strengthen accountability, communication, and information sharing, while helping to
mediate disagreement. Attempts to build strategic networks, and efforts to build coalitions to gain
broad support from different spectrums of society to fight corruption are in their embryonic stages
but reflect a growing demand from citizens for better governance. Advances made by Guinea-
Bissau in terms of access to information, albeit from a relatively low base, was noted in the 2015
Freedom House report.61 The very high levels of participation in the 2014 elections and the orderly
manner in which these took place are a clear indication of a wish to break with the past and to
move forward based on democratic and consensus-building oriented principles.

195. West Africa has recently experienced some of the most important economic and
political progress of the African continent, and Guinea-Bissau’s integration in these regional
organizations had a significant impact on the country’s recent developments. In particular,
membership in ECOWAS has helped generate a certain degree of stability, including more recently
through the deployment of the ECOWAS Security Mission in Guinea-Bissau (ECOMIB) to
support the transition. ECOMIB is viewed as an important stabilization factor for upholding
political balance and avoiding a standoff between the President and the Prime Minister. Similarly,
membership in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has provided some
degree of economic stability and has helped the country avoid the inflationary pressures that are
normally associated with political crisis and the temporary withdrawal of international financial
support.

6              PRIORITIZATION OF CONSTRAINTS ON PROGRESS TOWARDS THE
                                   TWIN GOALS

 This SCD identifies three main interconnected clusters of areas of binding constraints: 1) lack
of inclusiveness and low rural productivity; 2) low and unstable growth; and 3) fragility and
weak governance.

 The three areas reflect a context where the basic elements of well-being and economic
opportunities are inadequate and unequally distributed, forcing people to be trapped in poverty,
and where economic growth has been unsatisfactory and volatile. Fragility and weak
governance are found to undermine most economic, social, and political structures, further
reducing opportunities for shared prosperity.

 Top urgent priority areas in which to mitigate these binding constraints include improving
basic service delivery, raising productivity in agriculture, diversifying the economy,
strengthening market support services, and addressing allocative, technical, and regressive
inefficiencies in public spending.

 Addressing the impediments to inclusive growth requires confronting the vicious cycle of
fragility and elite capture by using flexible strategies to engage directly with the elite and with
other actors who legitimately circumvent it to enhance their livelihoods, and also by creating
demand for transparency and accountability.

6.1        Prioritization of development constraints in a challenging politically environment

196. This chapter brings together the various development challenges confronting Guinea-
Bissau under three overarching and interconnected binding constraints, and outlines a
number of priority policy actions. 62 The evidence in the preceding chapters suggests that the
majority of the citizens in Guinea-Bissau are poor, half of which are in a condition of extreme
poverty. This is due in large part to limited access to basic services, to low and volatile growth and
limited economic opportunities. This has been perpetuated by fragility associated with political
events and distortionary policy interventions which have encouraged a large public sector,
constrained the growth of the private sector, and diverted much of the public resources toward
private gain of the elite. On the basis of this evidence, the SCD outlines three clusters of constraints
to poverty reduction and shared growth in Guinea-Bissau: (1) lack of inclusiveness and low rural
productivity; (2) low and unstable growth; and (3) fragility and weak governance. In this regard,
many of the actions advanced in this section focus on steps to challenge this established framework
with the objectives of fostering better delivery of public service, creating an environment to
enhance private sector performance, and creating opportunities for shared prosperity.

197. Results from the prioritization exercise highlight entry points where policy
intervention can achieve success, but they also reveal some feasibility risks. In the first two
areas of constraints (low inclusiveness and rural productivity, and low and unstable growth), there
is broad consensus in the diagnostics and consultations about the selected policy actions
contemplated being able to deliver the desired poverty impact, with some actions even becoming
                                                            
62
     The order in which the overarching constraints are presented should not be taken as an indicator of importance.


                                                               98
 


entrenched. However, success of many of the proposed actions will of necessity require
advancements in overcoming some of the barriers associated with fragility and elite capture within
the society. In this regard, actions to strengthen the political system to rely on a more participatory
and decentralized approach, which is expected to deliver the highest gains in terms of reducing
poverty, ranks fairly low in terms of feasibility. In fact, many of the more difficult governance-
related reforms score poorly on feasibility and traction, pointing to an unwillingness to break from
the established order. This suggests that gains from addressing the other constraints remain at risk.
There may, however, be opportunities to use alternative mechanisms, including, as discussed in
Chapters 4 and 5, capitalizing on the emergence of a vibrant civil society and on new and more
technical political leadership. Moreover, the policy priorities as outlined reflect stakeholder
perspectives, as well as best practices drawn from World Bank Group experiences in other fragile
states.

198. There is a recognition that finding solutions that do not tackle the difficult and
underlined governance issues in Guinea-Bissau is not realistic. Identifying which stakeholders
will have the incentives to take the lead on specific priorities is beyond the scope of the SCD. Yet,
this report argues for a mixture of strategies that combine direct engagement of government with
increased participation of other local, regional, and international actors to create a critical demand
for transparency and accountability. Explicitly excluding the elite from the reform process may
not be realistic and even effective in challenging elite domination. On the contrary, it can
exacerbate rather than lessen fragility. Investments that target the poor can build the foundation
for inclusive growth, but also empower them by raising the demand for transparency,
accountability, and by direct, more effective delivery of basic services. This empowerment can be
a major catalyst in the process of strengthening institutions and addressing behavioral norms in
public and political spheres. Working directly with beneficiaries, for instance, through community-
driven programs implemented by NGOs, can contribute to addressing urgent needs in basic
services such as education, health, and water. International actors like WAEMU, ECOWAS, the
African Union, and the donor community can also harness forces and align incentives in favor of
transparency and stability.

6.2   Prioritization process

199. The diagnosis and prioritization of developmental constraints occurred in three
phases. The first step drew from the main findings of the analysis. The main challenges in terms
of inclusiveness, economic growth, fragility, governance, and sustainability identified in chapters
2 through 5 were mapped to the diagnostics framework. This part of the analysis revealed that
most of the foundations for robust, inclusive, and sustainable growth to take off in Guinea-Bissau
were not in place. A grouping of the main challenges identified three clusters of interconnected
areas of binding constraints: (1) lack of inclusiveness and low rural productivity; (2) low and
unstable growth; and (3) fragility and weak governance.

200. Drawing from the available evidence, the team developed a long list of broad policy
areas to partly address each cluster of constraints. The policy areas were grouped according to
pathways to economic development that took into account the binding constraints listed above. To
develop the pathway of each policy action, the team analyzed the results chain, from the standpoint
of the central objectives of economic growth and poverty reduction. To do this, the team


                                                  99
 


considered the dimensions of growth, inclusiveness, sustainability, and governance, and then
refined the actions within the country context of fragility and political instability. This process
helped in the identification and consideration of the most “economically, socially, and politically”
relevant priorities. To complement the prioritization process, an extensive benchmarking analysis
was conducted, ranking Guinea-Bissau’s performance against the top performer in Sub-Saharan
Africa and the top performer worldwide. Anchored by the evidence from these processes, the core
team identified a long list of 21 policy areas that reflect the needs and context of Guinea-Bissau.
Efforts were made to make each of the policy options as mutually exclusive as possible, but this
proved to be difficult given the multiple feedback loops across and within the core areas of
constraints.

201. The second step in the prioritization process consisted of consultations with the
country team during which the bindings constraints were discussed, the policy areas were
ranked, and the specific actions within each of the prioritized areas were identified. The core
team, in coordination with World Bank experts on Guinea-Bissau, developed a worksheet
summarizing the rationale and evidence for the three core areas of binding constraints, as well as
the list of policy areas and actions under each of them (Annex 6A). The worksheet included criteria
to rank the policy actions encompassing: 1) poverty reduction impacts; 2) feasibility (political and
institutional capacity; and 3) traction (ability of the mitigating action to deliver results in the short
to medium term). The document described poverty reduction impacts to be the most important
filter for the prioritization, in line with the Bank’s twin goals. Feasibility was considered as being
independent of what the Bank is or could do in the country. The worksheet was shared with the
country team to elicit a vote and ranking of mitigating actions. The results were pooled, averaged,
and standardized on a scale of 1 to 10 to ensure comparability and a clear ranking of options.

202. A meeting was held with the country team to discuss the results of the ranking of
constraints. The exercise elicited responses from different Global Practices working on Guinea-
Bissau. The meeting produced a discussion about the quantitative results where mitigating actions
had been prioritized by pooling and averaging of the ranked answers of each respondent. During
this meeting, attendees had a chance to raise issues that might not have been raised by the exercise,
or to highlight relevant mitigating actions that might not have gained attention from the
prioritization exercise alone. Attendees asked for clarification on whether or not mitigating actions
had some overlap. It was clarified that where actions had a high level of specificity, some overlap
was inevitable. Another clarification included the fact that although some mitigating policy actions
may not have been highly ranked, that did not imply the non-importance of that action for the
country. Modifications to strengthen and clarify some of the policy actions were also suggested
and taken up by the team. Overall, the feedback from the country team consistently identified the
top three or four priority policy areas in each of the core clusters of binding constraints.

203. The third and final step in the prioritization process consisted of in-country
consultations. The team initially held consultations with different stakeholders from the
Government and the civil society in May, 2015. This was useful to further define the hypothesis
and areas of analysis for the SCD. A second consultation was undertaken between March 7 and
10, 2016 as a consistency check of the identified areas of binding constraints and the priority
mitigating policy actions. The consultations included representatives of the Government, the




                                                  100
 


private sector, the civil society, and other development partners and donors. There was broad
support for the framework, evidence, constraint areas, and mitigating policy actions.

6.3   Binding constraints and prioritized policy actions

204. This SCD has identified three clusters of constraints to poverty reduction and shared
growth in Guinea-Bissau. The three core areas of binding constraints are 1) lack of inclusiveness
and low rural productivity; 2) low and unstable growth and 3) fragility and weak governance.
These areas of constraints follow from the analytical model and existing evidence by reflecting a
context where the basic elements of well-being and economic opportunities are inadequate and
unequally distributed, and economic growth, a key ingredient for poverty reduction, has been
unsatisfactory and volatile. Cutting across most of the economic, social, and political structures of
the country, fragility and weak governance, the third set of core constraints, are major obstacles to
improving the development outcomes of the country.

Area of constraints 1: Lack of inclusiveness and low rural productivity

205. Looking ahead, faster economic growth alone will not be enough to bring significant
improvements in the living standards of most Guineans. The SCD shows that even the low
economic growth recorded in the 2000s would have reduced poverty. Yet, since it happened only
at the top decile, poverty increased. More specifically, the proportion of the extreme poor reached
a high mark in 2010, accounting for one-third of the population in 2010. The assessment of the
equity conditions reveals several reinforcing mechanisms that will likely cause poverty and
inequality to persist (i.e. a poverty trap). The low and unequal allocation of human and physical
endowments limits the income generation capacity of poor households. Low access to basic
services, such as clean water, sanitation, and electricity, coupled with failures in critical markets
(for instance, credit), poor infrastructure and natural resource depletion, constrain economic
opportunities, undermine asset utilization, and reduce their returns. As depicted in Table 2.1 the
extreme poor are at an even greater disadvantage across the vast majority of indicators and hence,
along with the moderate poor, have the greatest potential to benefit from the priorities listed below.
Other groups, particularly women, are also disadvantaged in the allocation and utilization of
resources. Taken together, the low level of assets, and the lack of an enabling context and possibly
other behavioral factors, trap most households in the cashew sector, a stable yet low-investment,
relatively low-risk, and low-productivity subsistence equilibrium. There is recognition that this
area of prioritization is not independent of the others. The context of low rural productivity and
lack of inclusiveness is intrinsically linked to low growth and entrenched fragility and weak
governance.

206. The top policy priority area identified to address the lack of inclusiveness in Guinea-
Bissau is the urgent need to improve service delivery through targeted actions to transform
access to basic services. The prioritization exercise highlights interventions in this area as having
the largest positive poverty impact, especially among the extreme poor. To target service delivery
and human capital, health and education are considered the two main services that need immediate
attention. The specific actions prioritized for these two sectors and also for utility services in the
short- and medium- term are as follows:




                                                 101
 


     Health service. In health care, better staffing, health financing, and information systems can
    significantly improve performance. In the short term, support should be given to the development
    of government workforce policies for hiring and training. The immediate focus should rest on
    increasing the availability (supply of) and quality of primary-care workers who can provide, in
    addition to better primary care, reliable maternal and child health services. This is much-needed
    among the extreme poor, who are more likely to being sick, missing days of work, and facing a
    greater challenge to poverty reduction. Financing strategies can be improved by including
    public-private partnerships and by promoting better coordination between donors to avoid
    redundancies. In the medium and long run additional desirable steps are important, including
    acquiring more information via health survey data collection (such as the Service Delivery
    Indicators (SDI) survey promoted by the Bank and other institutions), establishing health quality
    standards and monitoring, and supporting government performance-based pay policies.

     Education service. The establishment of better standards and procedures must be at the core
    of future improvements. The quality of education requires developing criteria for expansion of
    education in urban and rural areas, and for the strengthening of hiring, management, and cost
    control policies. A pressing issue includes developing a strategy to address teacher absenteeism,
    which needs to be better understood via the SDI survey. Improvements can also be made by
    introducing timelines for proper planning, recruitment, and hiring of teachers, as well as ensuring
    that children are present at school on time and able to learn. This has great potential to change
    the education profile of the country over time, which currently has an astounding 86 percent of
    extreme poor and 77 percent of moderate poor household heads lacking primary education. In
    the medium- and long-term the Ministry of Education’s capacity and organizational structure
    should be improved by finalizing organigrams, and by defining narrower roles and
    responsibilities for staff. More details in the budget planning (that is, a three-year plan) could
    help improve the efficiency and transparency of education financing.

     Utility service. Other important areas include the utility sector where much of service
    delivery is tightly linked with infrastructure capacity in the country, which is another main focus
    of the priorities outlined in this section considering that the poor, but above all the extreme poor,
    are more likely to lack clean drinking water and sanitation. The national utility company,
    Empresa de Eletricidade e Águas de Guinea-Bissau, or EAGB, faces managerial challenges
    similar to other institutions in the country; in this particular case, it has lacked a Board Committee
    for 10 years. Hence, it needs to strengthen performance-based processes within the company and
    establish a functioning Board. With only 10 percent of households receiving electricity and only
    one-third accessing basic sanitation, the company needs to reduce technical inefficiencies and
    waste, which are large even by Bissau-Guinea standards. This implies improving both the
    technical and financial performance of the utility by updating its technical model of provision of
    urban service, but also especially its service to rural households.

207. Improved agricultural productivity and market support services are also highlighted
as top priorities to address the lack of inclusiveness. Findings from the analysis indicate that
improvements in these areas can be achieved by using a three-pronged approach:

     Extension services to improve crop performance. Specific focus should be given to
    developing the skills of producers via extension services and access to more productivity-


                                                    102
 


     enhancing knowledge, and promotion of information and communications technology for
     farmers (that is, daily pricing data, via mobile phones). This will be greatly beneficial for poor
     households, who are much more likely to work in agriculture and often lack information due to
     distance from other farmers or markets.

        Improved linkages between producers and processors. Linkages between producers and
     processors are also important and are dependent on infrastructure. For instance, improving
     feeder-road infrastructure (often deteriorated in the rainy season) can result in lowering the
     systemic cost of doing agribusiness. This is central for poor and extreme poor smallholders who
     can only maximize agricultural profits upon minimizing transaction costs. Increased
     coordination among producers can strengthen their bargaining power and allow them to gain
     higher margins on the sales of cash crops. Other areas also need addressing, such as harvesting,
     storage, and transportation, which can further increase bargaining power by ensuring that
     producers do not have to sell more than needed at one time.

      Support for other crops and value chains. The improvement in capital, input, and skills levels
     via the abovementioned interventions will also help to develop other value chains, and cash and
     staple crops, in the medium and long run. Overall, strengthening farmer associations and building
     partnerships with NGOs can offer opportunities to: (1) exploit economies of scale; (2) facilitate
     access to inputs, financial services, storage, and marketing; (3) strengthen value chains; and (4)
     prevent to some extent capture by local elites. Agricultural interventions should be backed by a
     continuous effort to address the both cumbersome and inefficient land rights matrix in Guinea-
     Bissau.

208. The SCD finds that another important area for action is to increase the economic and
social resilience of households, particularly the extreme poor, to the large variety and high
frequency of shocks to which they are exposed. The most common shock in Guinea-Bissau has
been related to political instability, sometimes leading to civil unrest, such as during the Civil War
of 1998-1999. Households are also exposed to other aggregate shocks, derived from climate
variability, such as droughts, late onset of the rainy season, or tidal surges, that affect both
smallholder activity near the coast and fishing patterns. Climate change is widely expected to
accelerate these changes and make them less predictable. One in three Bissau Guineans are
extreme poor and have very little ability to cope with shocks – 90 percent work in agriculture,
having low and undiversified incomes, as well as few assets to liquidate in case of crisis. The main
priority action identified for this constraint is the need to develop and enhance formal and informal
risk management.

      Social Protection Strategy. The high level of vulnerability of the poor presents an opportunity
     to develop a Social Protection Strategy (SPS) for the country – this is particularly pressing for
     the extreme poor, who lack the most basic assets and mechanisms to exit poverty. This should
     involve reforming the pension system and increasing the economic infrastructure to communities
     across the country. A large part of this plan should also involve cash transfer programs to benefit
     poor households faced with increased risk.63 Priority should be given to proven interventions
                                                            
63
  While it was treated as a separate mitigating action in the prioritization exercise, it is worth recognizing that social
safety nets can play an important role in shielding households from negative shocks while increasing their assets,
which has been widely documented by rigorous evidence in many developing countries.


                                                               103
 


    that boost credit and provide a safety net in the short and medium run, such as enhancing
    households’ ability to receive and send remittances (that is, mobile money) and that target cash-
    transfer programs for those most in need (see Table 6.1 below).

      increasing access to enhance inputs and technologies, providing incentives to replace old     2           2            1
      orchards, and developing quality standards.
     Addressing coordination failures in the cashew market, specifically between producers
      and processors, to increase the share of the rents accrued by farmers.
     Rehabilitating warehouse facilities and developing other logistics services.
    Reduce vulnerabilities of households to systemic and idiosyncratic shocks by
     Supporting coping and adaptation strategies (for instance, irrigation, enhanced seeds,
      financial and insurance instruments, credit associations, and so forth).
                                                                                                    3           1            3
     Developing a social protection strategy.
     Piloting and scaling up cash transfer programs to alleviate poverty in the poorest parts
      of the country, especially in times of crisis.
     Reforming the pension system.
    Reform land tenure and management systems to further empower women, and to
    strengthen the rules that determine how land is used, possessed, leveraged, and sold to         4           6            4
    boost investments and productivity in the agricultural sector.
    Develop productive safety nets and public works to provide work opportunities, and to
    contribute to building or rehabilitating small-scale infrastructure that yields services to     5           4            6
    households.
    Enhance market accessibility and bargaining by strengthening connectivity (for
    instance, rural roads), access to information (for instance, telecommunications) and            6           5            5
    farmers associations.


209. The remainder of mitigating actions discussed by the team, albeit not ranked as the
top priorities, still represent good blueprints for medium- and long-term action in the
country. Having a lower poverty ranking, and sometimes (but not always) lower feasibility and
traction ranking, some of the mitigating actions not included as priorities are still important (see
Figure 6.1). For example, reforming land tenure and management systems would strengthen the
rules that determine how land is used, possessed, leveraged, and sold to boost investments and
productivity in the agricultural sector. It is undeniable that Guinea-Bissau has a complex system
of property rights, hampering many income-generating opportunities for households. This
complexity is perhaps the reason for low traction and feasibility in this mitigating action. The


                                                                 104
 


developing productive safety nets and public works are cross-cutting areas that remain important
for Guinea-Bissau, and have the potential to deliver relief to the poorest, increase food security,
and encourage investments in human capital and productive assets. Along with an improvement
in agricultural output, storage, and margins, enhanced market accessibility and bargaining would
greatly benefit smallholders. This mitigating action has strong complementarities with others, and
thus part of it will be addressed indirectly, albeit remaining relevant for long-term development in
the country.

Area of constraints 2: Low and unstable growth

210. Growth in Guinea-Bissau has been low and needs to be accelerated and sustained in
order for the country to make a dent on poverty and foster shared prosperity. GDP per capita
grew by 0.4 percent annually between 2000 and 2014, roughly one-quarter the average recorded
for the Sub-Saharan region (1.9 percent). Comparing Guinea-Bissau with its closest 19 African
peers in per-capita GDP back in 1990 shows that its rank fell from 10th to 18th as result of having
the seventeenth-lowest growth rate in the entire group. The structure of Guinea-Bissau’s economy
has barely changed over the last two decades and remains largely agrarian. Growth performance
is excessively reliant on the production and export of a single commodity, unprocessed cashew
nuts, which are concentrated in the first rung of the value ladder. The production of cashews
engages more than 75 percent of small farmers, underscoring the tight connection between
incomes and movements in farm gate prices or production levels, especially for the poor. This
undiversified economic structure has limited the resilience of the economy to mitigate the impact
of shocks (terms of trade, political and natural).

211. Weaknesses in the fiscal system, a precarious business climate, low financial inclusion,
and limited and unreliable cross-cutting economic services also put a drag on the economy.
Low and unpredictable public revenues, regressive and distortionary taxation, and poor quality of
public expenditure limits the effectiveness and equity of the fiscal policy. The business climate is
not conducive to the generation of growth, employment, and productive capital. Guinea-Bissau is


                                                                       105
 


at the bottom for all of the 10 Doing Business indicators. Financial inclusion is among the lowest
in Sub-Saharan Africa. Guinea-Bissau’s infrastructure that supports production and that provides
economic services is in a woeful state, from the port to roads, and from access to electricity and
potable water to the Internet. The lack of investments is an important pillar of a vicious circle of
low productivity, low growth, limited opportunities, and elite capture, which then feeds back into
low investments.

212. A top priority for Guinea-Bissau is to start capitalizing on many of its opportunities
for economic growth, which remain largely untapped and could thereby be available to
diversify the economy in the medium to long term. This is not only about exploring new
industries and sources of growth, but also about involving making traditional sectors and industries
(for instance, cashews) more productive and competitive. In this regard, the analysis points to three
keys areas for intervention over the short to medium term:

     Fostering moving up the value chain in the cashew sector. Guinea-Bissau has the potential
    in the short-run to move to higher value chain segments within the cashew economy through
    improved processing capabilities. This may require capitalizing on emerging opportunities in
    ICT, as well as attracting a more dynamic private sector (including FDI-type structures) to usher
    in a new era of accountability. It is estimated that cashew-processing creates about one full-time
    job for every three tons of processed raw nuts. Processing 30,000 tons of nuts a year could
    therefore create around 10,000 jobs, which is essential in Guinea-Bissau, and could increase the
    returns to cashew production for the vast majority of the rural population (many of them poor)
    whose livelihoods depend on cashew.

     Development of value chains in rice, and other agricultural crops. The country also has
    potential in the medium to long run to begin a structural transformation of its agrarian economy,
    capitalizing on green shoots in agriculture, such as rice, sesame seeds, and forestry.
    Diversification is pivotal in reducing economic vulnerabilities of poor rural households. Central
    to this process, however, is the need for increased access to inputs, capital, training, and
    accessibility to markets. Notably, immediate improvements can be promoted by better seed
    variety and crop management that maximizes yield and land utilization.

     Development of value chains in fisheries. With a vast resource base, the fisheries sector of
    Guinea-Bissau has the potential to make a much greater contribution to the attainment of key
    development objectives, such as economic growth and poverty alleviation over the near to
    medium term. This requires investments in landing and processing facilities as well as improved
    regulation and management of the sector.

213. Given high transaction costs and unreliable infrastructure, it is key that Guinea-
Bissau improve its cross-cutting economic and production support services. The prioritization
process identified the most pressing actions that have to be taken in electricity, roads, the port, and
ICT as follows:

     Electricity: This is the main deficiency in Guinea-Bissau, with less than 10 percent of overall
    households having access to reliable utility. To this end, efficient management of the National
    Utility Company, (EAGB), is key. The company needs to establish a Board Committee (absent


                                                  106
 


    for over 10 years), institute performance-based systems, sustainably manage its scarce resources
    (that is by reducing technical losses, currently at 50 percent of cost) and work with regional
    partners to bring more reliable energy to the country.

     Road infrastructure: This is also central to unlocking multiple opportunities in Guinea-
    Bissau while reducing transaction costs. Feeder roads (that connect main roads to farmers and
    villages) are in particular disarray. Critical spots are rendered useless during the rainy season,
    and those spots should be the top priority, with general conditioning as a second priority, and
    all-road maintenance and management systems as third priority.

     Port of Bissau: The port system, another pillar of trade and development in Guinea-Bissau,
    needs a more rigorous management framework. The focus should rest on physical and
    administrative bottlenecks; in the short run, the inefficient mesh of administrative stakeholders
    involved in the port’s management needs to be untangled. In the medium-run, storage and
    docking capacity should be improved, as well as harbor navigability, such as establishment of
    lighthouses, better water-depth markers, dredging operations, and shipwreck removals (for
    instance, under the current state, only one ship can enter or leave the harbor at a time).

     Telecommunications. The most significant barrier to telecommunications development is
    prohibitively high costs resulting from the difficulty of doing business and from a general lack
    of infrastructure (that is oceanic cables and reliable electricity). The top priorities for this sector
    in the short and medium term are (1) building connections to main broadband providers; (2)
    developing a regulatory system to create an environment conducive to fair competition between
    providers; and (3) completing the restructuring process for the incumbent operator’s mobile
    subsidiary Guinetel.

214. Increased financial inclusion is a necessary condition to achieving a more diversified
and sophisticated economy. The level of access to financial services and financial literacy is
remarkably low in Guinea-Bissau, with both low demand and low supply of such services. With
deficient human capital, particularly in education, and with part of the local trading economy
(mostly outside of Bissau) based on the bartering of goods, financial services such as savings and
credit accounts have a low density. The country only has 1.8 commercial bank branches per
100,000 adults, a little over half of the average for Sub-Saharan Africa (3.4) and significantly less
than the world average of 11. The following are three specific priority actions identified to raise
financial inclusion (see Table 6.2. and Figure 6.2)

     Expanding bank account penetration. This can be accomplished through, for instance, the
    development of digital, low-fee financial services (for instance, mobile banking, electronic
    payments, and electronic social transfers).
     Development of a microfinance policy environment. This is required for microfinance to take
    off in Guinea-Bissau. Such a policy environment would allow financially strong institutions from
    other WAEMU countries (through the regional regulator) to operate branches in the country.
    This would require overcoming challenges such as allowing companies licensed in other
    countries to operate in-country, and incentivizing the monetization of the Guinean economy.

     Enhancing payment systems. A third option is enhance payment systems through the banking
    sector, in particular payment of salaries and use of debit and credit cards, which are feasible but
    nonetheless face similar challenges to the other proposals for better financial inclusion.

    Improve cross-cutting economic and production support services (electricity, roads,
    ports, and telecommunications) by:
     Improving the technical, operational, commercial, and financial performance of EAGB
      and the port through a performance-based service and management contract, or
      concession with a private operator, and a sound institutional framework.

215. While the prioritization process for improving low and unstable growth has yielded
three clear top choices, other mitigating actions will also help to inform the development
agenda moving forward. Other areas remain important to bring about macro-fiscal stability in
Guinea-Bissau. Enhancing fiscal discipline and public revenue collection and efficiency would
help to insulate the country from the volatility associated with grant flows, to address the narrow,
distortionary and regressive tax base, and to create much needed fiscal space for growth and
poverty reduction, while safeguarding fiscal sustainability. This mitigating action received a lower
poverty ranking and the lowest feasibility ranking, although it remains important and it highlights
issues still to be addressed in Guinea-Bissau. Similarly, it is important to reform the legal labor
code to increase flexibility of the labor market in adjusting to economic fluctuations, as well as to
make potential structural changes, while ensuring social protection. Nevertheless, this mitigating
action was agreed to have very low traction due to its complexity and will be on the agenda for
long-term change. Finally, the mitigating action with near-equal poverty, feasibility, and traction
ranking (all at medium levels) will almost certainly be addressed indirectly through other
mitigating actions. Its objective is to make the most of regional integration of markets and
infrastructure networks in order to exploit economies of scale, internalize technological spillovers,
attract investments, and open new markets.

Area of constraints 3: Fragility and weak governance

216. Throughout the SCD, fragility and weak governance emerged as core obstacles to
economic development and poverty reduction in Guinea-Bissau. Fragility constitutes a major
challenge to economic development. This is the case for Guinea-Bissau. The country is trapped in
a cycle of low growth and high incidences of poverty, anchored by recurrent political instability,
and the interlinked competition for rents among the elite have negatively influenced virtually every
economic, social and political dimension of the country. Results from the benchmarking analysis
show that Guinea-Bissau ranks poorly (at the bottom 10-20 percent) with respect to regional and
world averages in virtually all the human capital, physical capital, business climate, transparency,


                                                                      109
 


rule of law, and other quality of institution indicators. Weak governance also translates into
mismanagement of the natural wealth, which is being depleted at the current utilization rate (see
Table 6.3 for a list and ranking of mitigating actions to address fragility and weak governance.)

217. The top priority in terms of poverty impact under this pillar is to address the
allocative, technical, and regressive inefficiencies in public spending. This can be done directly
through the budget process where resources are redirected away from selected sectors, such as the
military, to areas that contribute to building the human capital of the country, like education and
health, as well as physical and institutional capital. Alternative delivery mechanisms, such as
working with civil society and or coordinated donor efforts will need to be considered to address
this important impediment to growth and poverty reduction in the country. The following are three
specific priority actions identified as important areas for action:

      Strengthening performance, control, and transparency of public revenue. This requires
     efforts to protect and progressively improve the capacity of the government to deal with revenue
     processes using procedures and systems to increase revenue collection, as well as the efficiency,
     effectiveness and transparency of revenue administration.64

      Improve expenditure control, accounting, and reporting capacity. The public procurement
     and internal control systems on expenditures are not functional, which lead to an abusive use of
     exceptional procedures, often bypassing the budget information system. They require efforts to
     strengthen controls needed for fiscal discipline and to promote transparency and accountability
     in public expenditures.

      Introduce equity-based formulas for budget allocation. Technical inefficiencies could also
     be reduced by strengthening project appraisal capacity by government bureaucrats, and by
     introducing equity-based formulas for budget allocation.65 This is a longer-term initiative, given
     the low feasibility, which points to difficulty in breaking established norms, and will include
     working directly with the authorities as well as with other local and international development
     partners.

218. Weak governance and fragility can also be mitigated by improving public financial
management systems, particularly in budget preparation and execution (see Figure 16.3) The
state of public financial management systems is considered poor and underscores the lack of good
governance in Guinea-Bissau. Addressing these deficiencies requires improving capacity,
efficiency, and operationalization in a wide array of government responsibilities, ranging from
budget preparation and execution as first priorities and lowest hanging fruit, to debt management,
macroeconomic forecasting, and accounting. Government effectiveness (ranked one out of 10 in
Guinea-Bissau) is directly tied to budget preparation and transparent execution (better linkage to
policies), helping to improve this pressing outcome. As a third tier of related improvements,
interventions should also target systems of internal and external control, such as procurement,
auditing, and inspection services, as well as building up a reliable Treasury Committee. In this

  Government effectiveness was ranked very low for Guinea-Bissau compared to its neighbors, at 70 percentage points from the top-performer in
the sub-Saharan African distribution, further corroborating the priority in reducing government spending inefficiencies. Corruption is also common
in Guinea-Bissau, exacerbating this issue; 45 percent of firms reported being expected to give gifts of up to 5 percent of contract value in order to
secure a government contract.



                                                                       110
 


context, the WAEMU PFM directives should be ratified as law to help further this process. More
specifically, the analysis points to the need for efforts to:

     Strengthen the link between the budget and policy priorities. This involves helping the
    government to prepare a budget that truly reflects key policy choices.

     Strengthen the government’s fiduciary practices. This involves using well established PFM
    directives to ensure that the execution of the budget is consistent with accepted norms. This is
    critical to ensuring that public resources are spent on their intended purposes. Through efforts to
    empower civil society and creating demand for increased accountability and transparency, this
    could have the impact of lowering incentives for corrupt activities and mitigating the delicate
    relationship between private gains and public funds.

     Publish information on government performance. This involves strengthening human
    resources and statistics systems to help the government identify and monitor key policies and
    carry them out effectively. Transparency would strengthen the link between the budget and
    implementation of government programs and policies. Rents collected by entrenched elite
    networks are obtained from a variety of public sources, including tax revenues, license fees, and
    international aid, and these reforms have the potential of reducing this widespread practice.
    Increased transparency can also boost government credibility and help legitimize future
    decisions in light of political disagreements, thereby also reducing political tension and fragility.

219. Guinea-Bissau also needs to reform public-sector incentives and raise personnel
capacity through the establishment of consistent standards for government employees. Seen
as another top priority for Guinea-Bissau, the overall goal is to move the system away from
cronyism and toward a meritocracy, reducing incentives for cooperation in corrupt practices, and
raising the quality of the public workforce. These reforms can be achieved by looking at best-
practices and establishing guidelines for staffing, entry exams, skills development, and
performance assessment for civil service linked to quality of service delivery, merit-based job
promotion systems, and measures to reduce the fragmentation of government. The appointment of
government officials is often based on corruption needs rather than merit. On the ”control of
corruption” (World Governance Indicator), Guinea-Bissau performed more poorly than many of
its neighbors, some of which also suffer from extreme corrupt practices; Guinea-Bissau was 89
percentage points from the top-performer on the distribution of scores for this indicator, which
highlights the need to work on this priority.

220. Another widely agreed-upon mitigating action is the strengthening of the business
regulatory environment. Most of the untapped potential for Guinea-Bissau, in industry,
agriculture, fisheries, forestry, tourism, and elsewhere, could be unlocked by businesses if the right
regulations were in place. This priority rests on three pillars of actions as follows:

     Streamlining import/export practices. One action that needs to be done is strengthening the
    formal processes of import and export, and reducing the amount of informal interactions between
    government officials and private sector personnel. This would reduce opportunities for the
    currently widespread practices of informal dealings. Using the SYDONIA++ customs system
    that is already in place would be a significant step forward in this regard.


                                                   111
 


     Promoting entrepreneurship: A second priority action is to set up programs that promote
    entrepreneurship in the country, including the availability of credit and financial education for
    small businesses.

     Finalize the land law: The third most pressing policy recommendation is to finalize the land
    law, which would strengthen property rights, land management, and administration. Its
    implementation will require a multi-year process of strengthening of land administration
    institutions. Because the regulation was never adopted, there is currently a legal vacuum.
    Needless to say, the regulation of the law in itself will not address the issue of insecure tenure.

221. In the longer run, addressing some of the inefficiencies in the system will require broader
reforms, such as addressing the lack of transparency in taxation mechanisms, introducing strong
land-titling reform, improving the availability and sustainability of public-private partnerships, and
developing strategies to address the informal payments that tread the fine lines of corrupt practices.
These frameworks also require strengthening commercial justice, and building capacity for legal
professionals in the country. Updating the legal framework to resolve insolvencies and enforce
contracts and strengthening the independence and effectiveness of regulators can also contribute
positively to the country’s business environment.

222. Reforming the management of natural resources is key to a more prosperous and
sustainable future in Guinea-Bissau. This mitigating action, albeit not ranked highly on the
poverty criteria, has a medium-high feasibility ranking, and was agreed upon by the team on the
basis of the evidence of the SCD as a cross-cutting area involving risks of irreversibility. In the
short term, three issues require urgent attention:

     Halting the rapid rate of forest loss. This is caused in large part by cashew expansion and
    small holders’ need for new rice land, but also by illegal felling. Tackling deforestation is
    essential to maintain a lifeline to the livelihood of many subsistence farmers and will require a
    range of instruments including land tenure reform, enforcement and surveillance, investments in
    forest restoration, and tapping into global climate finance opportunities, among others.

     Optimal management of fisheries resources. To date, there is no good information about the
    sustainable catch potential, and the country may soon hit a point of no return in terms of fish
    stocks. Moreover, it is likely that the country could increase benefits from its fisheries by
    improving the terms of foreign fishing arrangements and/or increasing domestic landing of the
    catches.

     Ensuring sustained finance to the Protected Areas system. The establishment of the Bio
    Guinea Foundation is a step in the right direction, but efforts to capitalize the Foundation and
    contribute to the recurrent cost of the Protected Areas system are greatly needed.

223. In the medium term, policies and investments geared to harness the value of a nature-based
   economy are key. Eco-tourism in some of the most pristine marine parks in the region and
   sport fishing, for example, could leverage synergies with commercial fishing in restoring and
   improving the productivity of the ocean, as well as greatly contributing to GDP and labor
   creation in years to come. The Bank’s role in the near term could be to promote south-south

       exchanges to allow Guinea-Bissau to understand how other countries (such as, Costa Rica)
       turned their economies around based on a peace and environment agenda.

224. Other mitigating actions not ranked as the highest priority are still relevant and will
be addressed, even if indirectly, through the list of prioritized actions. For example, advancing
the security sector reform to reduce military interference in political and economic spheres, while
mitigating risks in the process that could trigger new instability, remains a pressing need, as does
improving transparency and accountability by making more information publicly available (e-
government), investing in statistics, and strengthening the roles of oversight and accountability
institutions (national, subnational, and civil society). The issues of stability, accountability, and
transparency have been discussed through other mitigating actions and reinforced here, ensuring
that they are tackled through other pathways. The justice sector also needs strengthening in order
to improve access and equity and to develop effective conflict resolution systems that address the
weakness, favoritism, and corruption of the justice sector and the resulting impunity that
contributes to fragility.

        Annex 1A. The Guinea-Bissau performance in development indicators compared to
                              regional and global benchmarks

1.      The analysis below provides another lens of comparison between Guinea-Bissau and its
peers, as well as with the rest of the world. In the benchmarking previously done throughout this
document, Guinea-Bissau is identified as a country with significant challenges to development.
The results in Annex Figure 1A.1 below represent a consolidation of many concepts highlighted
before. It uses a methodology that compares Guinea-Bissau across a host of indicators as well as
across several countries, adding to the prioritization process in the country, and reiterating areas
where Guinea-Bissau has wide gaps and could therefore most benefit from investments. The goal
of this exercise is to highlight deficient areas where, if addressed, opportunities for higher and
consistent growth can be unlocked, moving towards ending extreme poverty and boosting shared
prosperity throughout the country.

2.      To apply the benchmarking methodology, indicators that represent the areas explored in
this SCD were selected across different topics (also relying on the limited availability and
frequency of those indicators for Guinea-Bissau). The benchmarking methodology creates an
algorithm to compare Guinea-Bissau against two groups of peers; its neighbors in Sub-Saharan
Africa and the world. Within these two groups, Guinea-Bissau is then benchmarked against the
group’s best performer, considering a normalized range within the sample of data for each
indicator. The countries selected for the ‘peer’ group encompass the African social, political, and
economic context, which is shared by Guinea-Bissau due to its geographical location. The other
group, comprised of all countries in the world for which data is available on a particular indicator,
provides a broader perspective of comparison outside the African context.

3.      Across each indicator, the average of the last five years of available data (2009-2013) was
used to avoid outlier values that might deviate from the norm. To ensure better comparability in
terms of level of development, countries above the 95th percentile of GDP per capita distribution
were removed from the sample. Using the selected variables, the distance between Guinea-Bissau
and its peers was defined on each indicator. Considering the high dispersion of some countries
across certain indicators, the distance in terms of percentiles within the sample (that is, Sub-
Saharan Africa and the world) was used instead of the absolute or proportional distance. The
analysis was carried out to allow for a comparison both with its peers, defined as the set of
countries p, and the world, defined as the set w, where w includes all the countries of p. While p is
a conditional comparison that controls for the country’s geographical location (that is Sub-Saharan
Africa), w is an unconditional comparison.

4.      The measure used to benchmark Guinea-Bissau was its gap with respect to the best
performer on a particular indicator66. The following representation is used to explain how the gap
was calculated. To evaluate the gap in any given indicator i between Guinea-Bissau (gnb) and the
best performer (bp) in the set s= {p ,w} 	 ,      . It is defined as:
                                                            
66
  The calculation of this gap draws heavily from the Colombia Systematic Country Diagnostic (2015) and the methodology developed by Samuel
Freije-Rodriguez and Daniel Valderrama Gonzalez.

5.        Where ,bp is the value of the best performer of the set s, including either the World (w)
or the peer group (p), in indicator i; ,gnb is the value of Guinea-Bissau in indicator i; and ,wp
is the value of the worst performer in indicator i. Given the small number of countries that constitute
p, the best performer is defined as the country with the lowest value in the 10th decile. On the other
hand, in the case of set w, considering that that there is a sufficient number of countries to define
percentiles, the best performer is the country at the 95th percentile. Once each indicator’s best
performer has been defined, the gap is normalized using the range of the distribution. To isolate the
effect of the outliers in the value of the range, the range is defined as the distance between the 5th
and 95th percentile for both sets. This normalization allows for the control of the specific variance
of each indicator, assigning a higher value for narrow distributions, such as the Gini index.
Moreover, this range allow for the limitation of the gap from 0 to 100 for indicators in which the
best performers are countries with the lowest indicator value; for example, the case with mortality
rate.

    Annex 2A. Dissecting the drivers of negative growth in Guinea-Bissau with Recentered
               Influence Function (RIF) and Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions

1.      Using the framework proposed by Firpo et al. (2007), we can better understand the drivers
of negative growth in Guinea-Bissau from 2002 to 2010. While an ordinary least squares (OLS)
can be used to estimate the average effects of each household characteristic, Firpo et al. (2007)
demonstrated that it is possible to go beyond the mean estimation, using a recentered influence
function (RIF) regression to estimate quantile effects, providing a level of detail that is more useful
for policy application. The outcome variable of each quantile regression can be further
decomposed, using the logic of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, to estimate endowment and
structural effects in each quantile, effectively linking each percentile of growth to household
characteristics, as well as to a decomposition of effects. This annex, by using the method outlined
above, models the mean differences in distribution of consumption expenditure between 2002 and
2010. Consumption is assumed to be a function of demographic characteristics, such as household
size, sex, and age of head of household; endowment characteristics, such as education and
experience; household assets, such as roof, wall, access to sanitation, electricity, among others;
location characteristics, such as living in Bissau, proximity to markets; and employment in
agriculture (the largest sector of employment in the country). Whereas the Oaxaca-Blinder
decomposition is commonly used to understand differentials in outcomes by gender or race, we
follow Essama-Nssah et al. (2013) using this logic to understand the differences in consumption
expenditure between two years. We model a simple OLS regression to estimate the average returns
to a series of household characteristics in Guinea-Bissau, using the log of per adult-equivalent
consumption as our left-hand side variable and a vector of covariates on the right-hand side.

Findings

2.      The initial results from an overall Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition (Annex Figure 2A.1)
show the growth incidence curve driven most strongly by structural effects, meaning the
distribution of returns (which are a function of asset ownership and intensity of usage, moderated
by price levels) for the aggregate consumption expenditure model benefits the non-poor much
more than the poor and is a larger driver behind the overall shape of the growth incidence curve.
The endowment effect is smaller in magnitude across the distribution, but nonetheless positive
sloping up to the 80th percentile and negative sloping thereafter, meaning it has a similar effect on
the growth incidence curve.

3.       In a more detailed dissection of endowment and structural effects, looking at the
contribution by category of variables, such as demographics, assets, location. and employment,
endowment effect is driven upwards by the distribution of a household’s asset-base, and
downwards by its distribution of demographics, while the distribution of living in Bissau, working
in agriculture, or having better market access are more or less neutral up to the 90th percentile
(Annex Figure 2A.2). Households at the top of the consumption distribution have more assets,
including education, work experience, land, and other household assets, and such endowments are
driving the positive slope of the curve and significantly higher incidences of consumption growth
at the top percentiles of the distribution.




                                                 121
 


4.      On the other hand, the distribution of the returns to market access (price effects) is negative
with a negative slope, implying that the poor may see slightly higher (or “less negative”) returns
from better market access than the non-poor (Annex Figure 2A.3). This makes sense since the poor
largely depend on agriculture (smallholder and subsistence) and may benefit from having stronger
linkages to markets where they can sell or trade goods. The distribution of returns to agriculture is
upward sloping and higher for the 90th percentile, likely a reflection of the non-poor’s ability to
use economies of scale, better access to market, a larger productive asset-base, and strategies to
maximize returns which are unavailable to the poor. The distribution of returns to demographics,
assets, and living in Bissau are fairly neutral and therefore deemed less influential here.

5.      A detailed decomposition (Annex Figure 2A.4) further dissects composition and structural
effects into each of the variables (that is, education, geography, employment) contributing to their
magnitude, where the overall effects are the sum of those variables’ coefficients. The distribution
of returns to participation in agriculture by percentile is positively sloped, indicating that in both
years, returns were higher for the top part of the consumption distribution. In 2010, however, the
returns were reduced for the poor and enhanced for the non-poor. Returns to land ownership were
also both more pro-poor and higher in 2002 compared to 2010. Proximity to markets yielded
similar benefits across time, while living in Bissau used to have higher returns for the poor, shifting
down to a positive but nearly neutral distribution in 2010. The positive sign of the coefficient for
living in Bissau is illustrative of an urban bias; growth tends to be more pronounced in urban areas,
with households benefiting from proximity to markets, better schooling, and employment, with
higher returns, relative to their rural counterparts, who may have less access to markets and basic
services, and may practice subsistence or smallholder agriculture.

                                         GUINEA-BISSAU - SYSTEMATIC COUNTRY DIAGNOSTIC
                                         CONSULTATION WITH COUNTRY TEAM ON PRIORITIES

                                                        IMPORTANT INFORMATION

This SCD identifies three core interconnected areas of binding constraints: 1) lack of inclusiveness and low rural productivity; 2) low
and unstable economic growth; and 3) fragility and weak governance. These constraints follow from the analytical model adopted in
the SCD in that they reflect the evidence that poor governance and the limited provision of public goods are major obstacles to
stimulating growth and reducing poverty in Guinea-Bissau.

Consistent with the approach taken in other SCDs, the evidence was reviewed and a list of mitigating policy actions to partly address
each constraint identified. The pathways of each priority was then mapped to the central objectives: economic growth and poverty
reduction. This helped in the identification of the most “economically, socially and politically” relevant actions and led to a subset of
policies that, to the extent possible, are mutually exclusive given the multiple feedback loops. For the exercise to be relevant, you are
encouraged to accept the realities of modern day Guinea-Bissau which will help to determine what is feasible. There are actions that
may have significant poverty reduction impacts but, given your perspective of the current context in the country, implementation may
not receive much traction. For example, the redistribution of income to the poor may face significant institutional and political
challenges, and as such, actions in this specific area may fail to deliver expected outcomes. Feasibility relates to the likelihood of a
particular action taking root, while traction goes one step further to focusing on the ability to deliver results in the short to medium term

                                                            ACTION REQUIRED

We are seeking your guidance and input to improve this document, for which priorities may need to be added, dropped, or revamped.
Your comments and suggestions will feed into a revised and narrowed list that we hope to discuss with the country team on February
12. In this regard, we are requesting your assistance with two things:

       Rank the mitigating policy actions identified within each of the core areas of constraints along three criteria: poverty
        reduction impacts, feasibility, and traction to achieve the biggest impact in the shorter term. Since there are 9 mitigating policy
        actions identified for Area of Constraint 1, numbers 1 and 9 correspond to the highest and lowest rankings. This system is to be
        maintained for the other two priority areas. Each mitigating policy action should be ranked within (not across) each of the criteria;
        and


                                                                    127 
 
 


       As this is a preliminary list, please feel free to provide comments (in the section provided) to further improve this list,
        including but not limited to, additional actions to be considered for inclusion.


                                                          Other Instructions

        You are encouraged to read the paragraph at the top of each area of constraint which describes the thought process and the
        analytics underlying the identification of the core areas of constraints before proceeding to the ranking exercise.
        Insert any additional comments you may have in the space provided at the end.
        Please submit your rankings and other comments directly to Rohan Longmore and Javier Baez no later than Thursday,
        February 11 (noon, DC time).

NOTE: Confidentiality – rankings submitted will remain confidential and results will be presented in an aggregated manner.

Area of constraints 1: Lack of inclusiveness and low rural productivity

Rationale: Faster economic growth alone will not be enough to bring significant improvements in the living standards of most Guineans.
The SCD shows that even the low economic growth recorded in the 2000s (assuming it distributionally neutral) would have reduced
poverty by over 8 percentage points. Yet, in reality, since growth happened at the top, and the rest of the income distribution saw their
consumption fall, poverty increased by 3.7 percentage points. Underlying the lack of inclusiveness is a low and unequal allocation and
utilization of the endowments (human, physical, and natural capital) that are critical to raise the income generation capacity of
households. Adults in the bottom two quintiles had completed just two years of schooling on average. At 54 years, life expectancy is
three years below the regional average and maternal mortality is one of the highest in all of Africa. At 78 per 1,000 live births, infant
mortality is 30 percent higher than the Sub-Saharan average and more than double the world average. Well over a third of the population
(36.4 percent) still lacks access to safe water, and close to two-thirds has no access to modern sanitation. Only 6 percent of households
have electricity, mostly self-generated. Key endowments are not only low but also used at suboptimal levels. Certain groups, particularly
women, are disadvantaged in the labor market, and virtually all of the economically active population express a desire to have an extra
job or work more hours. The exploitation of natural resources is inefficient and hinders their sustainability. Further compounding this
context, rural productivity is low, indicating a low equilibrium in most markets and returns on productive factors that are inadequate,
undiversified, and eroded by high transaction costs and significant exposure to uninsured shocks.

The analytical work carried out for the SCD identified the following six actions to mitigate the constraints underlying the lack of
inclusiveness and low rural productivity in Guinea-Bissau:


                                                                  128

                                                                                                                       rank       rank         rank
            2.1 Improve service delivery and the human capital base of the population (basic education,
            health, nutrition, water and sanitation, skills development).
            2.2 Enhance market accessibility and bargaining by strengthening connectivity (for instance,
            rural roads), access to information (for instance, telecommunications) and farmers associations.
            2.3 Reform land tenure and management systems to strengthen the rules that determine how
            land is used, possessed, leverage, and sold to boost investments and productivity in the
            agricultural sector.
            2.4 Improve agricultural technology and market support services (access to inputs and
            technologies, agricultural extension, logistics, storage, electricity, and so forth) that are likely to
            have a positive impact in the cashew sector and other untapped agricultural opportunities.
            2.5 Reduce vulnerabilities of households to shocks by developing and enhancing formal and
            informal risk management, coping and adaptation strategies (for instance, irrigation, enhanced
            seeds, financial inclusion such as mobile banking, index-based insurance, credit associations, and
            so forth).
            2.6 Develop productive safety nets and public works to deliver relief to the poorest, increase
            food security, encourage investments in human capital and productive assets, and contribute to
            building or rehabilitating small-scale infrastructure that yields services to households.

Area of constraints 2: Low and unstable growth

Rationale: Growth in Guinea-Bissau has been low. GDP per capita grew by 0.7 percent annually between 2003 and 2014, less than half
the average recorded for the Sub-Saharan region (1.5 percent) during the same period. Comparing Guinea-Bissau with its closest 19
African peers in per capita GDP back in 1990 shows that its rank fell from 10th to 18th as a result of having the seventeenth-lowest
growth rate in the entire group. The structure of Guinea-Bissau’s economy has barely changed over the last two decades and remains
largely agrarian. Growth performance has been low and volatile with the production and export of a single commodity (unprocessed
cashew nuts) – concentrated in the first rung of the value ladder - as the engine of growth. The production of cashews engages more
than 75 percent of small farmers, underscoring the tight connection between incomes and movements in farm gate prices or production
levels, especially for the poor. This economic structure has two broad implications: i) it has limited the resilience of the economy to
mitigate the impact of shocks (terms of trade, political, and natural); and ii) it has limited the income and opportunities of the population,
creating incentives for intense competition for rents which is one of the reasons for the low public investments (across all sectors) and
the underdevelopment of other industries with economic potential within and outside of the cashew sector (cashew processing, rice,
fisheries, mining, and tourism). Low and unpredictable public revenues, regressive and distortionary taxation, and poor quality of public
expenditure limits the effectiveness and equity of the fiscal policy. The business climate is not conducive to the generation of growth,



                                                                                 129
 


employment and productive capital. Guinea-Bissau is at the bottom of all of the 10 Doing Business indicators. Financial inclusion is
among the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Guinea-Bissau’s infrastructure that support production and provide economic services is in a
woeful state, from the port to roads, and to access to electricity, potable water, or the internet. The lack of investments is an important
pillar of a vicious circle of low productivity, low growth, lack of opportunities, elite capture which then feeds back into low investments.

The analytical work carried out for the SCD identified the following six actions to mitigate the constraints underlying the low and
unstable economic growth that has characterized Guinea-Bissau:

                                         Constraints mitigating policy actions                                   Poverty   Feasibility   Traction
                                                                                                                             rank
                                                                                                                  rank                    rank

            3.1 Improve economic resilience through diversification by capitalizing on green shoots in
            agriculture (rice, sesame seeds and fishery) and other sectors (mining and tourism), and moving
            to higher-value chain segments (cashew processing).
            3.2 Improve cross-cutting economic and production support services to reduce the cost and
            improve the reliability of productive services and to generate additional investments,
            employment, and growth (electricity, ports, telecommunications, roads, and so forth).
            3.3 Increase financial inclusion through higher financial literacy and access to finance to raise
            savings and generate additional investments for growth.
            3.4 Reform the legal labor code to increase flexibility of the labor market to adjust to economic
            fluctuations and potential structural changes while ensuring an efficient degree of social
            protection.
            3.5 Enhance fiscal discipline and public revenue collection and efficiency to insulate the
            country from the volatility associated with grant flows, to address the narrow, distortionary, and
            regressive tax base, to create much needed fiscal space for growth and poverty reduction, and to
            safeguard fiscal sustainability.
            3.6 Make the most of regional integration of markets and infrastructure networks to exploit
            economies of scale, internalize technological spillovers, attract investments, and open new
            markets.

Area of constraints 3: Fragility and weak governance

Rationale: Throughout the SCD, fragility and weak governance emerge as core obstacles to economic development and poverty
reduction in Guinea-Bissau. Fragility constitutes a major challenge to economic development. Fragile or conflict-affected states (FCS)
have historically underperformed in a wide array of indicators (WDR, 2011). This is the situation in Guinea-Bissau, where recurrent
fragility and the interlinked competition for rents among the elite have negatively influenced virtually every economic, social, and


                                                                             130
 


political dimension of the country, and are largely responsible for the country’s “stop-and-go” development path. Recent estimates show
that GDP per capita in Guinea-Bissau could have been 65-90 percent higher had it not been for its endemic fragility. Poverty is high
(69.7 percent) and it has been increasing between 2002 and 2010. Weak institutions and governance are at the center of the rentier nature
of the economy, which means that public institutions are geared toward providing private goods to elites –political and military ones–
rather than public goods to citizens. This broken social contract is reflected in the poor provision of basic public goods and services,
economic opportunities, and justice. Benchmarking analysis undertaken for this SCD shows that Guinea-Bissau ranks poorly (at the
bottom 10-20 percent) with respect to regional and world averages in virtually all the human capital, physical capital, business climate,
transparency, rule of law, and other quality of institution indicators. Another major negative implication of weak governance is the
mismanagement of the country’s natural wealth, which at the current utilization rate is depleting the main capital that would eventually
allow its citizens to escape poverty and embark on a path toward greater and shared prosperity.

The analytical work carried out for the SCD identified the following nine actions to mitigate the constraints underlying fragility and
weak governance in Guinea-Bissau:

                                         Constraints mitigating policy actions                                     Poverty   Feasibility   Traction
                                                                                                                               rank
                                                                                                                    rank                    rank

            1.1 Improve public financial management systems (budget preparation, execution, debt
            management, macro forecasts, accounting), including systems of internal and external control
            (procurement, auditing, and inspection services, Treasury Committee).
            1.2 Address the allocative, technical, and regressive inefficiencies in public spending by
            redirecting resources away from some sectors (military) to areas that contribute to building the
            human, physical, and institutional capital of the country (education, health, electricity),
            strengthening project appraisal capacity, and introducing equity-based formulas for budget
            allocation.
            1.3 Improve transparency and accountability by making more information publicly available
            (e-government), investing in statistics, and strengthening the roles of oversight and accountability
            institutions (national, subnational, civil society)
            1.4 Reform public sector incentives and raise capacity through establishing guidelines for
            staffing, entry exams, skills development, and performance assessment for civil service linked to
            quality of service delivery, merit-based job promotion systems, and measures to reduce the
            fragmentation of government.
            1.5 Strengthen the business regulatory environment by streamlining the procedures to start
            new businesses and register property, updating the legal framework to resolve insolvencies and
            enforce contracts, and strengthening the independence and effectiveness of regulators.

    1.6 Reform the management of natural resources to address unsustainable practices and
    preserve the country’s natural wealth (the main foundation for current and future growth), jobs,
    poverty reduction, and shared prosperity in Guinea-Bissau.
    1.7 Strengthen the political system to rely on a more participatory and decentralized approach
    that enhances political participation, stabilizes democratic institutions, breaks the rural-urban
    divide, and addresses the disconnect between the State and the society
    1.8 Advance the security sector reform to reduce military interference in political and economic
    spheres while mitigating risks in the process that could trigger new instability.
    1.9 Strengthen the justice sector to improve access and equity and develop effective conflict
    resolution systems that address the weakness, favoritism, and corruption of the justice sector,
    and the resulting impunity, that contribute to fragility.
