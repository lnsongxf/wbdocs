 Box 1.1  Guatemala’s Development Challenges in 1951
 A 1951 World Bank report on Guatemala highlighted many features that are largely still relevant
 today.
 Untapped potential. The report argued that the country’s natural advantages, properly used “should
 [have made] it possible for the Republic to achieve a relatively favorable position among the nations of
 the Americas both in living standards and in financial stability. Yet actual economic development …
 ha[d] barely scratched the surface of these latent possibilities.”
 Low labor productivity. The report showed that Guatemala’s overall labor productivity was low,
 especially in the agricultural sector.
 Investment. An unfavorable investment climate and the under-provision of public goods were found
 to have led to low private investment. The report highlighted the fact that under-investment was not
 only due to a lack of resources: the equivalent of 2 percent of GDP in 1950 was in US accounts held by
 Guatemalans.
 Lack of adequate transport infrastructure. The report considered that the topography of Guatemala
 kept isolated “large segments of the rural population…. and potentially productive markets.” It felt that
 the “inadequacy of transport facilities probably constitute[d] the greatest single barrier to ... eco-
 nomic development.”
 Lack of coordination of public policies. The report highlighted the duplication and competition
 among agencies that existed in the absence of any mechanism for deciding among them. This was seen
 to endanger development.
 Insufficient and inequitable social spending. Social spending was deemed to be insufficient and
 concentrated in Guatemala City. In the case of health, for example, “public health expenditure at 2.1
 percent of the budget [was] much lower than in other Latin American countries, like Panama (12.4
 percent), Costa Rica (3.5 percent), or Chile (7 percent).” Within Guatemala, the report called atten-
 tion to the large ethnic disparities in terms of health, education, nutrition, and income.
 Financial needs and new revenues. The report raised the issue of the need to increase revenues to
 finance critical investment. “Deficiencies in tax administration, small tax base, and low rate” were
 identified as the main areas that needed reform.
 Ethnic inequalities. Finally, the report highlighted the need to increase the productivity of the
 indigenous peoples for the country to achieve long term development. “In the long term, to promote
 development in Guatemala, it is indispensable that the productivity of the indigenous population be
 raised so as to provide them with purchasing power over and above their subsistence needs. This will
 require measures aimed at improving their education, health, and nutrition. Moreover, to integrate the
 population into a single economy and improve standards of living, jobs must move towards sectors
 with higher productivity.”

2. Poverty and Shared Prosperity 2000-2014
Poverty rates in Guatemala are among the highest in Latin America and the Caribbean and in recent
years have been increasing. The middle class is small and shrinking. Inequality has declined but more
due to falling incomes at the higher end of the distribution than to growth among the poorest. There is
strong evidence pointing to the existence of “two Guatemalas” with the divide being seen along
geographic, ethnic, human capital, and even demographic lines. The poor are concentrated in rural
areas and among indigenous groups and have low human capital and poor outcomes. Labor income
does not drive poverty reduction, and public social policies have had only a limited effect on poverty.

 Box 2.1  Measurement and Data Issues in Guatemala
 Actual Population Size
 The population figures used in this report and in official statistics are projections, not actuals. The last
 Population and Housing Census dates from 2002 so some caution is needed when looking at per
 capita figures. It is expected that birth and death rates will have changed in the 14 years since the last
 census: certainly there is evidence of changes in migration patterns. Obviously, any errors in the
 population projections could affect the analysis of per capita GDP, and, if there are variations in the
 growth of different population groups, this could affect poverty measures as well, although there is no
 data to indicate that this particular problem exists.
 Poverty Measurement
 The data for the poverty measures come from the National Living Standards Measurement Study
 surveys (Encuesta Nacional de Condiciones de Vida or ENCOVI) for 2000, 2006, and 2014. There are
 also data for a 2011 round of the survey but there are some methodological concerns about these data
 in terms of comparability. The government is currently reviewing this issue and since this review may
 lead to revisions of the 2011 indicators, we have chosen to use only data from the 2000, 2006, and 2014
 survey rounds in the present report.
 Guatemala uses a consumption-based monetary measure of poverty. This per capita measure covers:
 (i) the consumption of purchased and non-purchased food (own production, gifts, and donations); (ii)
 transport and communications; (iii) consumer goods; (iv) household services and legal costs; (v)
 utilities, education, and health; and (vi) the annual use value of housing and durable goods. The
 poverty lines used reflect the costs of a minimum level of calories (extreme poverty line) and the cost
 of obtaining both food and other basic necessities (overall poverty line). We use this official measure
 of welfare throughout the report.
 However, the exception is when the focus of the analysis is on benchmarking Guatemala’s situation in
 comparison with other countries (as is in done in this chapter). In such cases, we use an income-based
 measure of poverty and an international overall poverty line of US$4 and an international extreme
 poverty line of US$2.5 per person per day in 2005 PPP terms. While there has been an update to the
 2011 PPP for the US$1.25 line, there are no updates for the US$2.5 and US$4 lines. For this reason,
 the report continues to use the 2005 PPP and the global extreme poverty line of US$1.25 in 2005 PPP.
 Urban and Rural Definitions
 A new urban/rural classification was introduced in the 2002 Census by Guatemala’s National Statistics
 Institute (Instituto Nacional de Estadística, INE). The share of the urban population increased from
 38.6 percent in 2000 to 48.1 percent in 2006. However, only 2.9 percentage points of this increase were
 due to migration and population growth; the remaining 6.6 percentage point increase was due to
 changes in the urban/rural classification (World Bank, 2009). This dramatic increase in the share of
 urban areas in the sample explains why extreme poverty decreased between 2000 and 2006, even

    though both urban and rural extreme poverty increased.
    The more recent evolution of poverty between 2006 and 2014 has not been affected by changes in the
    urban/rural classification.
    When the rural-urban definition is important for our analysis, the discussion will be restricted to
    changes between 2006 and 2014 only.




    Knowledge Gap
    The lack of a recent census creates uncertainty about actual population figures. In a country like
    Guatemala with such high fertility rates, constantly shifting migration patterns, and changes in
    mortality rates, it is crucial to have up-to-date census data. Therefore, a new round of the
    Population and Housing Census is urgently needed.

Labor markets have played only a limited role in changes in welfare in Guatemala. The number of jobs has
increased at the same pace of GDP, which has contributed to poverty reduction. However, the quality of these
jobs has not: earnings are stagnant, especially in the sectors in which the poor are most likely to work. The
lack of human capital affects individuals’ ability to find the types of productive employment that would help
them to move out of poverty. This lack of human capital stems from limited access to basic services such as
education and health. Coverage of these and other services is far from universal and the influence of
geography, ethnicity and household characteristics on inequitable access have changed little in the past 15
years. The poor and ethnic minorities bear the brunt of unequal opportunities and poor outcomes. Spending
patterns restrict Guatemala’s ability to provide universal access to basic services as the low levels of revenues
collected limit the provision of public services. At the same time the incidence of spending is such that overall
fiscal policy actually increases poverty. Inequality is not lowered by the sum of direct and indirect taxes and
transfers. On a range of indicators, Guatemala is not catching up to its peers and competitors, which is
hindering future economic growth, job creation, and welfare gain and putting its social contract under
further stress.

    Box 3.1  Is it Food Contamination? What Role do Mycotoxins Play in
    Malnutrition in Guatemala?
    One unknown in Guatemala is the role that mycotoxins (aflatoxins and fumonisins, fungi that
    contaminate corn and other food crops) are playing in chronic malnutrition. Neither the UNICEF
    framework nor the analysis done in this study address the issue of mycotoxins.
    Aflatoxins and fumonisins are naturally occurring toxins produced by certain fungi. In high doses,
    they can lead to serious illness and even death in both humans and animals. These mycotoxins mainly
    accumulate on crops and grains in tropical regions and contaminate a wide variety of food crops and
    products, such as maize, peanuts, sorghum, and cassava. In corn, the fungi infect plants both prior to
    and after harvest. Poor growing conditions as well as inadequate storage conditions promote the
    growth of the fungi. The toxins pose serious health risks to humans and are closely linked to liver
    cancer and the suppression of the immune system, thus increasing exposed individuals’ vulnerability
    to other diseases. More recently, significant negative effects of aflatoxin on child growth have been
    reported (see Khlangwiset et al, 2015 for a review of the evidence on both child outcomes and
    livestock, while IITA, 2015 cites studies showing that stunting was 40 percent more frequent in areas
    with high aflatoxin contamination). Exposure to these mycotoxins can begin in utero and continue
    throughout life.
    In 2015 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) highlighted that, taken together, the
    few well-documented population-based studies and the mechanistic data in relevant animal models

   suggest that mycotoxin exposure contributes to stunting, both independent of and with other risk
   factors. IARC suggested the need for further longitudinal studies of mycotoxin exposure and child
   stunting, including studies of the underlying mechanisms.
   There is evidence of aflatoxins and fumonisins in Guatemala. A study in 1976 indicated high levels of
   aflatoxins on the Pacific Coast (De Campos and Olsyzna-Marzys, 1979). A follow-up study in 1979
   (De Campos et al, 1980) showed one in six corn samples to be contaminated with levels of aflatoxin
   well above acceptable levels. A 2002 study (Truckess et al, 2002) found aflatoxin contamination in
   samples of INCAPARINA, a high-protein, corn and cottonseed-based food supplement given to an
   estimated 80 percent of children in Guatemala in their first year of life. Most recently, another small
   study done by the Full Belly Project in 2012 (Pawloswski) found evidence of aflatoxins in peanuts in
   Estanzuela, Zacapa. A larger study (Torres, 2013) tested corn samples from across the country and
   found unacceptably high levels of aflatoxins in 27 percent of samples and high levels of fumonisms in
   41 percent of the samples.
   Co-exposures to aflatoxins and fumonisins have also been documented. Recently, maize from 22
   districts in Guatemala was analyzed and 36 percent of 572 samples tested positive for aflatoxins and 99
   percent of 640 samples tested positive for fumonisins. The contamination levels are well above the
   permitted levels (Torres et al. 2015).
   The link between aflatoxins and stunting and other poor growth outcomes among children in
   Guatemala has not yet been proven. Gathering evidence of the role played by aflatoxins in malnutri-
   tion is critical. To date, efforts to reduce malnutrition have focused on health care (substantial
   investment in pre-natal and post-natal attention). Addressing the dangers of aflatoxins would require
   a completely different set of policy options and targets.

                        Box 3.2  The Changing Profile of Guatemalan Emigrants to the United States
                        and Mexico
                        Migration has had many causes in Guatemala. The first wave of emigration of Guatemalans to the
                        US and Mexico began during the second phase of the civil war when large numbers of Guatemalan
                        refugees escaped in the late 1970s. Violence related to the war in this period centered in the western
                        Mayan highlands, forcing the local, mainly Mayan, populations, into refugee camps in Mexico. The
                        negative impact of the war on economic growth also intensified labor emigration to both Mexico and
                        the US. Today, however, the drivers of Guatemalan emigration to the US are different. In addition to a
                        general lack of economic opportunity and high levels of inequality and poverty, a series of natural
                        disasters has also led to Guatemalans leaving the country. In the past two years, the spread of the
                        coffee rust fungus has affected 70 percent of Guatemala’s coffee crop, causing the loss of an estimated
                        100,000 jobs and a 15 percent decline in output. Hurricanes Mitch (1998), Stan (2005), and Agatha
                        (2010) and a powerful earthquake on the southern coast in 2012 all increased emigration significantly.
                        Crime and violence, connected to gangs, drug trafficking and criminal organizations, constitute
                        additional drivers of emigration, together with Guatemala’s generally weak rule of law.
                        Since 2012 a further characteristic of Guatemalan emigration has consisted of the ballooning
                        number of unaccompanied minors (UAM). In 2013 over 75 percent (approximately 51,000) of
                        UAMs apprehended by U.S. migration authorities came from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.
                        Most Guatemalan migrants are young males with limited education and financial literacy, trying to
                        support their direct family members at home. Overall, Guatemalan immigrants in the US tend to be

   the recent waves of immigrants suggests that it is the less well-off who are increasingly emigrating

   the levels of remittances (which, unexpectedly rose sharply in 2015).

   Box 3.3  The Downside of Migration
   While emigration provides opportunities for individuals and families to escape from violence, to find
   better economic opportunities, and to send much-needed income to their households in their country
   of origin, it is not without its costs. In addition to the Dutch disease discussed in Chapter 4, migration
   can have a high human cost.
   The migration experience itself can lead to negative outcomes for the Guatemalan emigrant, ranging
   from death or injury to various forms of labor exploitation. The migration corridor through Mexico is
   one of the busiest and most dangerous in the world (IOM, 2004). In a six-month period in 2010, more
   than 11,000 kidnappings of migrants were reported (CNDH, 2011). A 2013 survey on the southern
   border of Mexico revealed that almost 60 percent of emigrants from Central America suffered from at
   least one episode of violence while crossing the southern border including robbery, sexual violence,
   and extortion (Secretaria de Gobernación et al, 2013). Children and adolescents are particularly
   vulnerable, whether traveling in family groups or alone.
   Most of the migrants from Guatemala are undocumented in their destination countries. Being
   undocumented makes migrants vulnerable to exploitation. A recent study of female migrants from
   Guatemala working in southern Mexico found them to be victims of various forms of labor exploita-
   tion, from forced overtime, low or unpaid wages, restriction of freedom of movement and/or commu-
   nication to physical and sexual violence (World Bank, 2016).
   The families whom migrants leave behind also suffer from their absence. A study in the south-east of
   Guatemala documented how households whose head had migrated were excluded from social
   assistance and in-kind programs on the erroneous (as it turns out) assumption that migrant house-
   holds are better-off. A lack of empowerment and skills and a shortage of labor all can negatively affect
   the welfare of migrant-sending households as well (Coello et al. 2015).

4. Trends and Drivers of Growth in
   Guatemala
Guatemala has experienced modest economic growth in recent years. Its per capita GDP has failed to
converge with those of Latin America (average) and that of the U.S. With a relatively young and growing
population, Guatemala will need to achieve much higher economic growth and job creation rates to reduce
poverty. Persistently low levels of physical and human capital formation have contributed to a long-term
decline in productivity. Like other countries with high poverty levels, Guatemala faces the challenge of
creating new and better remunerated jobs for its growing working age population, a challenge that is compli-
cated by the prevalence of informality in the economy. Persistent competitiveness challenges related to the
under-provision of public goods, rising crime and violence, and weak governance are exacerbated by weak
economic institutions, which complicates the investment climate for the private sector and perpetuates
inequalities. Guatemala’s demographic trends provide an opportunity for higher and sustained growth
provided that the government implements productivity-enhancing investments and policies, such as infra-
structure investments to increase connectivity and industrial policies to foster the creation of better jobs.
However, given Guatemala’s low levels of public revenues and immense investment needs, spending efficien-
cies may not be enough.

Guatemala is known for having persistently                a window of opportunity to seize a demographic
low growth in per capita GDP as a result of a             dividend. This dividend is possible because the
combination of modest aggregate GDP growth                working age population is growing more rapidly
and a fast growing population. GDP growth                 than the dependent population, resulting in more

average of 3.2 percent but not particularly strong        from 51.4 percent in 1960 to 58.1 percent in
when compared to other economies in Central               2014, while at the same time the dependency

   Box 4.1  Guate-Latinas: How Guatemalan Firms Have expanded in the Latin
   American Region?
   The emergence of “Guate Latinas” has been a result of the process of globalization and illustrates the
   strengths of Guatemala’s private sector. The term refers to businesses that have revenues, operations,
   and resources that originate from overseas. This phenomenon is not recent but has accelerated in the
   past decade. There are several examples of “Guate-Latina” firms.

   With operations in 12 countries, Pollo Campero’s sales in 2014 amounted to US$467 million, of which
   75 percent was earned abroad. Almost half of its 8,500 employees are located abroad.
   Grupo Pantaleón, the largest sugar producer in Central America, is another Guate-Latina with
   investments in Brazil, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Mexico. It produces sugar, alcohol, and molasses and
   engages in power generation.
   Planesa is a producer and exporter of berries, snow peas, and sugar snap peas among other products.
   The company expanded its operations into Mexico and Chile in 2012 to provide a consistent supply to
   grocery chains in North America in all seasons. Its products are distributed under the brand Pure
   Fresh.

   Knowledge Gap  What’s the full cost of crime to the Guatemalan Economy?
   Guatemala, like other countries in the Northern Triangle, is showing signs of increasing gang
   violence and extortions, and associated closure of business activities. Firms report that extortion
   demands could range between US$45 to $5,000 per month. Both formal and informal firms are
   equally affected. Dealing with crime and violence could represent between 8 to 15 percent of
   business costs. Although there are not statistics about number of business closures due to extor-
   tions, the question arises of the consequences on entrepreneurial activities and labor incomes.

   Box 4.2  The Case of Banrural, Guatemala
   Banrural S.A. was created in 1998 as the result of the restructuring of the Guatemalan National
   Agricultural Development Bank (Banco Nacional de Desarrollo Agrícola or Bandesa). The process of
   transforming Bandesa into Banrural was part of the modernization process of the Guatemalan
   financial system approved by the Guatemalan Congress in 1997. Banrural was conceived as a joint
   public-private venture with 30 percent of its capital provided by the state and 70 percent by the private
   sector. The mixed ownership structure was designed to facilitate the active participation of civil society
   groups involved in the rural sector with a strong social commitment. Banrural’s private shareholders
   include community groups, cooperatives, and organizations. It holds the accounts of all government
   employees and manages all public trust funds.
   As of December 2015, Banrural was the second largest bank in Guatemala in terms of assets (valued at
   US$6.9 billion). The bank relies on an extensive network of almost 1,000 branches and 2,174 agents to
   serve a loan portfolio of US$4.3 billion, equivalent to 21.3 percent of the Guatemalan banking system.
   At the end of 2014, Banrural started operations in Honduras, and as a result of the forced liquidation
   of Banco Continental in Honudras, it purchased assets estimated at US$225 million.
   Banrural aims to foster economic activity in rural areas of the country in a way that is profitable and
   sustainable for its shareholders, while maintaining a development objective with an entrepreneurial
   vision. It offers a diverse array of financial products and has a special focus on indigenous populations.
   Microenterprise credit, corporate credit, second-tier lending, and international operations as well as a
   number of payment services (water, electricity, and telephone) are all part of its portfolio. First-tier
   lending is provided by a specialized microfinance unit, which is responsible for providing loans to
   individuals or to groups (e.g., solidarity groups, or communal banks). Other loans are tailored to small
   and medium-sized farmers, consumers, and housing renovations and expansions.

5. Sustainability of the Pattern of Growth,
   Distribution, and Poverty Reduction
Despite its macroeconomic stability, Guatemala has experienced low GDP per capita growth, and this growth has
not translated into economic and social gains for the vast majority of the population. The severe disparities in
economic and social outcomes between the “two Guatemalas” is hindering Guatemala’s path for inclusive growth.
Several factors are getting in the way of efforts to reduce poverty and foster sustained inclusive growth, including
Guatemala’s small public sector for the size of the economy paired with limited capacity to provide public goods,
weak governance, high levels of crime and violence, growing urbanization, and exposure to natural disasters.
However, as a result of social and economic pressures, demand is growing for greater provision of public goods
such as education, health care and public infrastructure, and momentum is building behind efforts to seize the
opportunities presented by Guatemala’s upcoming demographic dividend.

  Box 5.1  What Insights Can be Gained from the Chiapas and Oaxaca
  Experiences?
  Given many geographic and ethnic similarities between Guatemala and the two southernmost
  states of Mexico, Chiapas and Oaxaca, there might be lessons that can be learned from Mexico
  that can be applied to Guatemala. Both Chiapas and Oaxaca are states with a high percentage of
  indigenous peoples (36 and 66 percent respectively) and high rates of poverty. In 2008 Chiapas had
  the highest rate of poverty in Mexico (76.9 percent) with Oaxaca in fourth place at 68.3 percent. While
  they were both still among the poorest states in 2014, multi-dimensional poverty had declined faster
  in both states than the median rate in the country. Recent work in Chiapas highlights many of the
  same barriers to poverty reduction as are found in Guatemala, namely that the limited complexity of
  the economy leads to low incentives to accumulate more and more productive assets and that there is
  a lack of coordination among different groups and between the indigenous peoples and the state (Levy
  et al. 2015). At the same time, dependence on federal aid in Mexico can be attributed to a Dutch
  disease effect, raising the costs of tradable goods and making the zone less competitive (Hausman et
  al. 2015), a role that remittances seem to be playing in Guatemala.
  Various analyses done in the context of Chiapas and Oaxaca (and other countries as well) high-
  light ways to promote inclusive growth in Guatemala. First, in Chiapas, there is a large gap between
  the goals and the mechanisms of participatory spaces (local community authorities and organizational
  structures) and invited spaces (where the government invites the participation of communities and
  controls the process). Traditional spaces are as concerned with process as with end goals, have a
  greater focus both on rights in general and on improving the collective and tend to have a long-term
  planning horizon. In contrast, invited spaces usually reflect the much shorter time horizon of elected
  governments, have limited capacity or experience with affecting collective outcomes, and, because of
  their timeframe, and prioritize projects over longer-term changes. (See Cortez Ruiz, 2004 for Chiapas
  and LaFrance and Nicols, 2010 for a more general overview in a different setting.) Finding a mecha-
  nism to close this gap is critical. At the same time, there is a need for the indigenous populations to
  have institutions that are credible both to their constituency and to the broader society (Rosenthal,
  2008) and to have access to government institutions (Anaya Muñoz, 2005). A striking difference
  between Chiapas and Oaxaca is in access to formal government channels. Anaya Muñoz argues that

   representatives of the indigenous peoples were heavily engaged in the San Andres agreement in
   Chiapas, much like the Peace Accords in Guatemala. Both agreements had positive effects, but in
   terms of the politics of recognition of rights and culture, this was not enough. In Oaxaca the indige-
   nous peoples also had access to formal power structures. At the municipal level, traditional electoral
   practices resulted in indigenous peoples being elected to municipal governments and, at the state level,
   a combination of factors gave them access to the governor’s office, albeit informally. Neither of these
   channels was available to the indigenous peoples in Chiapas. This lack of access to formal channels has
   translated into significantly less legislative change in Chiapas than in Oaxaca. Interestingly, in Oaxaca,
   a state with almost twice the number of indigenous people as Chiapas but with more access to formal
   channels, income poverty fell (from 41 to 34 percent) rate between 1990 and 2010 whereas in Chiapas
   it rose (from 46 to 49 percent) (CONEVAL, 2015).

   Box 5.2  The Commission Against Impunity and Accountability
   In 2007, Congress approved the establishment of the Commission against Impunity in Guatemala
   (CICIG). Working under the umbrella of the United Nations, the CICIG was designed to aid local
   investigators and police in developing prosecutable cases aimed at eradicating criminal networks.
   With impunity levels then at an alarming 98 percent, the judiciary was seen as too weak to do so on its
   own. Since its creation, the CICIG has assisted in securing convictions in a number of high-profile
   cases involving top government officials, most recently, as discussed above, the customs fraud scheme
   known as La Línea. The Commission’s findings led to the arrest of Guatemala’s President and Vice
   President as well as other government officials. Thus, the CICIG has managed to change the public’s
   perception that criminal networks are impregnable.
   Guatemalans are increasingly demanding a more transparent and accountable government. In the
   past, Guatemalans have been tended to be either disinterested in public issues or reluctant to express
   dissent. This culture of fear and silence was a result of the bloody civil war between 1960 and 1996, in
   which over 200,000 people were killed. Even as late as 2015, 52 percent of the population believe that
   freedom of speech is still not generally protected. However, this tide of silence appears to be shifting as
   young people who did not live through the conflict begin to feel empowered to take a stand. The
   revelations of the La Linea scandal triggered public outrage and sparked a large number of public
   protests in the streets, organized mainly through social media. These protests have shaken the state’s
   political stability and resulted in the resignation of the Vice President and several ministers. It will be
   interesting to see if the results of new opinion polls reflect any change of attitudes.




In short, Guatemala’s political parties suffer from
various limitations to coordinate policy making

about comparability between the 2000 and 2011 data. However, given what is known about the 2011 dataset, it is expected that the
analysis will overstate movements out of poverty and understate movements into poverty.

Annex 5:2: Legislation Supporting Indigenous Rights 	175
Guatemala has enormous potential to generate prosperity for its
population. Although some pockets of dynamism and successes exist, the country has
one of the highest poverty rates in Latin America. Moreover, tremendous and persistent
inequalities can be found across ethnic groups, locations, and economic sectors. In a
sense, one needs to visualize “two Guatemalas” with large gaps in outcomes between
them to understand the country’s development challenges. This Systematic Country
Diagnostic looks at why a country with such great potential has not been able to
materialize it, addressing the following questions:

•	 How inclusive is Guatemala’s development model and what are the factors that
   prevent it from being more inclusive?
•	 What does growth look like, what has driven it, and what are the bottlenecks that
   need to be addressed?
•	 How sustainable is Guatemala’s development model economically, socially, and
   environmentally?
•	 Are there additional factors that underlie the present Guatemalan economy and
   what changes have the greatest potential to reduce poverty and foster shared
   prosperity?
