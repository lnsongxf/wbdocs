                                             Executive Summary

The Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) is designed to identify the most critical binding
constraints and opportunities facing Indonesia in ending extreme poverty and boosting
shared prosperity. In line with the World Bank Group’s new country engagement model, the findings
of the SCD will provide inputs for the preparation of the Country Partnership Framework (CPF),
which will outline the WBG’s engagement with Indonesia to achieve the twin goals. This SCD has
four main conceptual elements. First, we analyze past trends in growth, poverty and inequality to
highlight their “deep” drivers. Second, we identify the key channels for reducing poverty and boosting
the prosperity of the Bottom 40 percent. Third, we highlight the major challenges and opportunities
along each of the key channels and, finally, we identify prioritized areas of intervention to accelerate
progress toward ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity for each of the channels
identified. This diagnostic exercise was conducted in consultation with national authorities and other
stakeholders in Indonesia, and is based on the current available body of knowledge.
Poverty reduction and inequality: contrasting performance
Thanks to a strong recovery in growth, poverty in Indonesia has fallen dramatically since the
Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. From 1999 to 2012 the national poverty rate was cut in half,
from 24 percent to 12 percent, largely through sustained economic growth and job creation. Following
a 13 percent contraction in 1998, output growth rebounded strongly, grounded on gradually increasing
private sector investment and robust domestic consumption. Real GDP growth averaged 4.7 percent
in 2000-05, 5.7 percent in 2006-10 and 6.0 percent in 2011-12, demonstrating Indonesia’s resilience
to the global economic downturn in 2008. The country’s GDP almost doubled from USD 580 billion
in 2001 to USD 1.1 trillion in 2012, making Indonesia the 15th largest economy in the world and
member of the G20.1 Remarkably, healthy growth has gone hand-in-hand with low fiscal deficits
(average 1.4 percent of GDP in 2000-12), a sharp decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio (from over 100
percent in 2000 to just 25 percent in 2012), and external surpluses until mid-2013, when an annual
current account deficit opened for the first time since 1997.
There is strong evidence that growth and poverty reduction were strongly influenced by global
commodity markets in the first decade of the new millennium.2 Indeed, the significant rise in
commodity prices in 2003-11 led to massive income and wealth effects in Indonesia. These fed into
corporate revenues, household incomes and government revenues, leading to a significant jump in
domestic demand for goods and services. On the supply side, the (largely non-tradable) services sector
rose considerably, contrasting with a quasi-stagnant manufacturing sector, which lost competitiveness
due to a sharp appreciation of the real exchange rate and high logistics and trade costs. Changes in the
labor market reflected this differentiated sectoral dynamics, as 17 out of the 21 million jobs created
between 2001 and 2011 were in the services sector, mostly in its low value-added, low-wage segments
(e.g., retail trade, restaurants, tourism and construction). Since 2012, weaker global commodity prices
and demand, and tighter domestic financing conditions, have combined to slacken growth momentum
(5 percent in 2014). Consistently over several years, the pace of poverty reduction has slowed
considerably, with a near zero decline in poverty in 2014, the smallest reduction in over a decade. As
measured by the current national poverty rate of 11.3 percent, there are 28 million poor people in
Indonesia. An additional 27 percent of the population (65 million people) lives between the official

poverty line and less than 50 percent more than that poverty line, forming a large group of
“vulnerable” people.3 Throughout this report, we denote the “vulnerable” and the poor collectively as
Indonesia’s “Bottom 40 percent”.
The relative success in poverty reduction contrasts with a dismal performance in sharing
prosperity. Between 2003 and 2010, consumption of the bottom 40 percent grew at 1-2 percent
annually, while that of the two richest quintiles grew by about 6 percent. Consequently, the
Consumption Gini coefficient, an indicator of inequality, rose from 30 to 42 over this period, one of
the fastest cases of widening inequality seen in East Asia. Education and ownership of assets are
the key factors explaining inequality in Indonesia. Inequality increased because members of rich
Indonesian households have access to higher education and assets, such as real estate and stocks that
allowed their wealth to grow rapidly. With better education, they are able to find better jobs and benefit
from the increasing “skills premium” in the labor market. Compared with workers with a primary
education or less, those with junior secondary education now enjoy a 20 percent premium, those with
senior secondary a 40 percent premium, while those with tertiary earn double.4 Furthermore, because
richer households own real and financial assets, they benefit when the returns on those assets rise, as
they have over the past decade. Individuals from poor households, however, lack financial assets and
can only improve their income through work. Most of the jobs created in Indonesia since 2001, and
indeed most current jobs, are in low productivity sectors, resulting in low real labor incomes. In
addition, these workers have limited access to formal worker protection.
Digging deeper, about one-third of inequality in recent years can be traced back to
circumstances that children are born into, or develop soon after, or in other words inequality
of opportunity. The latter can be seen by comparing a child born in Jakarta to non-poor parents who
have at least high school education with a child born in a rural area of Papua or Maluku to a poor
family with little education. The former has only a 6 percent chance of lacking proper sanitation,
compared with 98 percent for the latter child. These differences extend across all other indicators of
opportunity, such as access to clean water, decent housing, primary school enrolment, birth by skilled
attendant and immunization coverage.
Three pathways to shared prosperity
The SCD identifies three pathways to reducing poverty and increasing shared prosperity in
Indonesia: strong economic and jobs growth, improved access to key services, and better natural
resource management. First, a strategy that generates strong growth and jobs is fundamental
for Indonesia. While the private sector is the main engine of economic growth, the first pathway, the
Government nonetheless plays a critical role by devising and implementing policies that encourage
private sector participation and through the provision of key public goods. Four key factors have
constrained productivity and GDP growth and the creation of jobs in the higher value-added sectors
over fifteen years:
•   Large infrastructure gaps leading to serious congestion on roads and in ports, and forcing private
    firms to invest in electricity generators, thereby reducing their competitiveness. For instance, with
    an insufficient number of, and poor and congested access to, modern ports, airports, railways and
    road-based logistics transportation, shipping costs within Indonesia are often more expensive than

3The poor are those beneath the official poverty line; the vulnerable are those between the poverty line and 1.5 times
  that line. The Bottom 40 percent is composed of the fifth and fourth quintiles combined.

    the costs of importing from Thailand or China (e.g., logistics costs in Indonesia are estimated at
    24 percent of GDP, against 16 percent in Thailand). Infrastructure constraints have cost Indonesia
    more than 1 percentage point of annual GDP growth over the past decade.5
•   Weak business environment with generally restrictive, and often inconsistent investment and trade
    regulations; time-consuming and costly procedures for obtaining permits and licenses; and limited
    access to bank credit or market financing forcing firms to rely heavily on retained earnings for the
    expansion of their activities.6 These constraints have kept private investment well below its full
    potential.
•   Skills gaps, with more than 60 percent of Indonesian firms reporting that finding suitable
    employees for professional and managerial positions is either “difficult” or “very difficult”, and
    almost 70 percent of employers in manufacturing reporting that they find it “very difficult” to fill
    skilled professional-level positions (i.e., engineers). Skills constraints have delayed Indonesia’s
    move toward higher value-added production in many sectors.
•   Little transformation of agriculture due to weak policies. Although agriculture “released” labor to higher
    productivity sectors over the past fifteen years, the sector still employs 35 percent of the work
    force but contributes only 12 percent to total GDP. This represents a significant drag to overall
    productivity of the economy. It reflects agricultural policies that provide limited incentives for
    efficient use of land, labor and capital resources. Agricultural policies continue to focus on
    achieving self-sufficiency in rice, maize, and sugar based upon fertilizer subsidies and restricted
    trade. Yet, with rising incomes and urbanization, food consumption and expenditure patterns are
    shifting to higher value and processed foods. Between 1998 and 2013, animal product
    consumption more than doubled, while the consumption of cereals declined. Over the same
    period, the share of processed foods in urban food expenditure rose from 15 percent to more
    than 30 percent. Much of the rising demand in processed food is satisfied by imports, since
    agricultural policies have not created enough incentives for Indonesian farmers, manufacturers,
    and services sector companies to boost domestic production. At the same time, the focus on rice
    production has not allowed a reduction in rice prices for consumers. From 2009 to 2014,
    Indonesian’s average rice consumer prices (USD 0.67/kg) were 30-50 percent higher than in some
    regional countries (wholesale prices: USD 0.47/kg in Thailand, and USD 0.40/kg in Vietnam).
    During this period, overall consumer food price inflation was considerably higher than that seen
    in the region’s other middle-income countries.
The second pathway to poverty reduction and shared prosperity, supported by the growth
path, is service delivery and opportunity for all. The provision of decent housing, transportation
services, water and sanitation, and quality education and health care is constrained by a combination
of weak tax collection leading to sub-optimal levels of public expenditure, a poor public spending mix
and spending delivery challenges at the central and sub-national levels.
•   Sub-optimal public spending. Indonesia’s revenue-to-GDP (15.2 percent in 2014) and tax-to-GDP
    (11.3 percent) ratios are very low by international standards. This is not due to lower tax potential:
    by one estimate, Indonesia is collecting less than 50 percent of its total potential tax revenue.7 With
    continued moderation in oil and other commodity prices, revenue-to-GDP may fall to as low as
    13.4 percent in 2015 and remain at this level in the medium term under a “business-as-usual”
    scenario due to significantly lower revenues from oil, gas and other commodities. Over the past
    decade, low levels of revenue (as a percentage of GDP), coupled with a fiscal deficit that is legally

      capped at 3 percent of GDP, have induced sub-optimal levels of total public spending (17.3
      percent of GDP in 2014 compared with an average 28 percent of GDP for middle-income
      countries in Asia). In other words, greater revenue mobilization could have allowed Indonesia to
      spend more on development priorities within the limits of its legal fiscal deficit cap.
•     Poor spending mix at the central government level. Before the introduction of a major fuel subsidy reform
      in January 2015 (move to market-based prices for gasoline), central government spending on
      infrastructure and health programs were significantly crowded out by large energy subsidies.8 The
      latter have remained generally elevated since the mid-2000s, attaining unsustainable levels in recent
      years despite several ad hoc, episodic price increases. In 2014, spending on energy subsidies
      accounted for more than one-fifth of the central government’s budget. This was more than three
      times the allocation for infrastructure such as roads, water, electricity and irrigation networks, and
      three times government-wide spending on health.
•     Poor spending mix and service delivery constraints at the sub-national government level. In Indonesia, service
      delivery (health, education, local infrastructure, water, sanitation, etc.) is mainly a responsibility of
      sub-national governments since the decentralization reforms launched in 2001. District and
      provincial governments now spend about 51 percent of the national budget (net of subsidies and
      interest payments). The evidence is however that the majority of them have failed to deliver the
      improvements in local public services that were expected. This reflects in part poor spending
      choices. For instance, in 2012, district governments spent 52 percent of their budgets on personnel
      and only 3 percent on capital. However, the quality of services is persistently low and unevenly
      distributed across regions, even in those areas where spending has increased significantly over the
      past decade. For instance, (total) government spending on education has tripled in the past 10
      years but little has changed in the classroom—more than half of teachers do not meet minimum
      competency levels, contributing to 40 percent of 15-year-olds, mostly poor, performing below the
      lowest competency level in PISA-math. The fundamental causes of weak local service delivery
      thus are, in addition to technical financial capacity and coordination constraints, weak incentive
      structures and low accountability of sub-national governments for delivering results.
Finally, the special nature of poverty in forest and coastal areas suggests that pathways 1 and
2 need to be supplemented by a third one: natural resource management. Indonesia is endowed
with one of the most valuable forest capital levels of wealth and the largest mangrove and sea-grass
ecosystems in the world. Yet poverty is highest in forest and coastal areas. Six million out of the 32
million people who live in remote forest areas are poor. This is just over one-fifth of the total number
of poor in Indonesia. Similarly, poverty rates among the 140 million people who depend on marine
and coastal resources for their livelihoods are high.9 Clearly, eradicating poverty in Indonesia requires
improving the well-being of households living in forest and coastal communities. Poverty reduction
efforts in these areas are however constrained by the challenges imposed by remoteness, low
population density and dispersed locations, as well as poor governance leading to an overexploitation
of natural resources.


8   Thanks to a fuel subsidy reform introduced in January 2015, the energy subsidy bill is budgeted to fall sharply from
    3.4 percent of GDP in 2014 to 1.2 percent in 2015. The fiscal savings have been reallocated to infrastructure –
    reflected in the increase in planned capital spending from 1.3 percent of GDP in 2014 to 2.5 percent in 2015.
    Revenue collection is however projected to be much lower than expected and only a fraction of the initial increase
    in capital spending may actually materialize (see World Bank, 2015, Smaller Gains, Indonesia Economic Quarterly,
    World Bank, July 2015).
9   While the poverty rate of this population scattered around the archipelago is not available, it is deemed high.
    According to the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries about 90 percent of coastal fishers live in poverty.


                                                             10
•     The challenges imposed by remoteness, low population density and dispersed locations. Forest and coastal
      communities are characterized by remoteness, low population density and dispersed locations.
      This implies that connections with, and externalities from, urban growth centers are weak; and the
      provision of services such as education, health and infrastructure is costly. For instance,
      Indonesia’s village surveys (PODES) show that in 2012, only 12 percent of forest villages had
      maternity facilities and midwives, 38 percent had a primary school within 6 km and only 8 percent
      had a secondary school. This does not help break the intergenerational transmission of poverty.
•     Poor governance leading to overexploitation of natural resources. The United Nations Framework
      Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) estimates that annual deforestation and degradation
      are 670,000 and 425,000 ha/year, respectively. Deforestation results from many factors, including
      significant growth in oil palm plantations and mining production, but substantial governance
      issues in land-use licensing and law enforcement processes are the main cause.10 Similarly, coastal
      deforestation, water pollution and overfishing have also reached high, unsustainable levels. Close
      to 65 percent of Indonesia’s coral reefs are considered threatened by overfishing and more than
      40 percent of Indonesia’s mangroves have already been lost. As a result of these degradations,
      about 58 percent of the population in Java lives in water insecure areas, with water and soil
      pollution levels (mercury and lead) that are among the highest in the world. Rapid deforestation
      and overexploitation of marine resources (especially on Java) have disproportionately undermined
      the livelihoods of people living in forest and coastal areas.
In addition to the above constraints, climate change hazards are likely to disproportionately
affect the poor. Thus environmental sustainability is an integral part of the shared prosperity
agenda. Indonesia ranks among the top greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting countries in the world.
Roughly one-third of Indonesia’s GHG emissions originate from land-use changes and forest
degradation, 26 percent from peat fires and 22 percent from fossil-fuel emissions, which are also rising
steeply. Thus about half of all GHG emissions are associated with poor governance of land use and
rising commodity production (e.g., palm oil) and resource extraction. Oil use contributes most to
current fossil-fuel emissions, but coal emissions have grown fastest over the past decade due to the
increasing use of coal in power generation. The rise in GHG emissions is exacerbated by rapid
urbanization (4 percent annual increase in urbanization) and rapid growth of aggregate consumption
(and with it rapid energy demand growth). Overall, air pollution is high in large urban areas and
generates negative health impacts that cost billions of dollars. As an equatorial and archipelagic
country, Indonesia is expected to begin experiencing significant impacts from climate change over the
next 20 years. The Asian Development Bank projects that by the end of the century climate change
will cost Indonesia between 2.5 and 7 percent of GDP.11 The most severe impacts will fall on the
poorest people, specifically those who live in areas susceptible to drought, flooding and/or landslides
and who are dependent on climate-sensitive livelihoods such fisheries and agriculture.




10   Indonesia manages its forests through concessions and through centralized management structures without local
     monitoring and ownership. The allocation of concessions for timber, pulp and paper production and, increasingly,
     oil palm plantations, is opaque and the enforcement of spatial and environmental planning is ineffective.

Four mega-trends that will shape long-term prospects
Looking ahead, four mega-trends will shape economic prospects, which policy reforms can
turn into powerful drivers of growth and long-term economic transformation. These factors are:
(i) commodity prices; (ii) the developments in China; (iii) Indonesia’s demographics and; (iv)
Indonesia’s rapid urbanization.
    • Global commodity prices. The softening of commodity prices since 2011 poses challenges for
        Indonesia in the short term, as seen in the impact on Indonesia’s trade balance and revenue
        collection. However, it also offers an opportunity to enhance the quality and diversity of
        investments in Indonesia. Over the past decade, high commodity prices tilted investment
        incentives in favor of the resource sector and non-tradable sectors (e.g., the real estate sector)
        and against manufacturing and other tradable sectors. Going forward, lower commodity prices
        should increase the relative profitability and attractiveness of manufacturing and could be used
        to help Indonesia to develop its industrial base. With reforms to reduce the constraints faced
        by manufacturing firms, weaker commodity prices could be a blessing in disguise.
    • Developments in China. China’s rapidly rising wages present Indonesia with an opportunity to
        regain a comparative advantage in labor-intensive export sectors. China’s nominal wages have
        grown by an annual average of almost 15 percent since 2001 which, together with slowing
        productivity growth in low-skilled sectors in recent years, has seen Chinese unit labor costs
        grow by almost 70 percent since 2005 (Economist Intelligent Unit, 2012). This pressure,
        combined with slower overall economic growth as China rebalances, is likely to prompt
        investors to look beyond China’s coastal areas, including toward ASEAN countries.
    • Demographic factors. Indonesia is fortunate to have abundant labor. Between 2013 and 2020, the
        working-age population will increase by 14.8 million, reaching 189 million from the current
        174 million. Today, 50 percent of the population is under the age of 30. This increasingly
        educated and IT-savvy youth is an asset that can be used to boost overall productivity and
        economic growth. With the right policies in place to utilize this labor, Indonesia is poised to
        benefit from a demographic “dividend”, before the population starts to age from 2025-30 and
        beyond.
    • Rapid urbanization. Indonesia’s urban population is increasing at an annual pace of about 4
        percent and, by 2025, 68 percent of the population is projected to live in urban areas, compared
        with 52 percent in 2012. As incomes rise and existing large metropolitan areas such as Jakarta


                                                        12
            and Surabaya become saturated, the demand for consumer durables, shopping space and
            housing will increase significantly in smaller cities. Connecting these cities and their inhabitants
            to rural areas, metropolitan areas and the global economy will be essential in attracting firms
            and achieving shared prosperity. Empirical evidence shows that urbanization supports growth
            and poverty reduction in Indonesia, but only in the presence of adequate infrastructure (Lewis,
            2014).

SCD prioritization and selectivity framework
The three pathways discussed above accompanied by two “pre-requisites” provide a useful
framework to consider priority reform areas. Reforms under growth-jobs, service delivery-
opportunity for all and natural resource management pathways are complementary and mutually
supportive. For instance, reforms to boost non-commodity sector growth can indirectly help service
delivery through greater government revenues and may reduce pressure on natural resources. This
complementarity among the different pathways suggests that shared prosperity should be addressed
using a comprehensive but coherent reform agenda. Reforms under the three pathways should be
supported by two important underlying, cross-cutting pre-requisites: domestic revenue mobilization
(“collecting more”) and “governance” reforms to improve policy coordination, project
implementation and transparency. In this SCD, we attempt to prioritize reforms based on impact
(evidence-based), complementarity/synergy, sequencing and feasibility:
        •   Evidence on the salience of a constraint for achieving the twin goals. The degree to which constraints to
            achieving shared prosperity through the three identified pathways are binding, based on
            existing empirical evidence;
        •   Reform complementarities and synergies. The extent to which reforms addressing the most binding
            constraints have significant impacts on, and relevance for more than one pathway; such
            reforms are considered “high priority” or “transformational”; and
        •   Reform sequencing and feasibility. Some reforms may not be feasible before the full
            implementation of higher order reforms, while other reforms may be pertinent but lack the
            minimum political support needed to implement them.

Economic growth and job creation
Enhancing prosperity for the Bottom 40 percent rests in large part on the implementation of
structural reforms to shift the economy to a productivity-based growth path. The structural
reform agenda ultimately aims to boost productivity in agriculture by increasing cereal yields, reducing
post-harvest waste and shifting to higher-value crops, while also accelerating investments in
manufacturing and services, including tourism, thereby reducing dependence on mineral commodities
for exports. Urgent actions to support this shift include reforms that can be expected to generate
“quick wins”, while recognizing that the full benefits of such a shift will accrue only over the longer
term.
Infrastructure. Large investments in infrastructure (roads, seaports, railways, irrigation and drainage) to
better connect the economy domestically, reduce logistics costs, support productive activities and
improve access to services are clear priorities.12 Investment in infrastructure is “transformative” in
Indonesia in that it supports growth and competitiveness, is crucial to providing key services to the
population and is supportive of human capital development and social inclusion. Indonesian cities are

                                                           13
growing fast and a key challenge for sub-national governments is to rapidly put in place the infrastructure
to support economic activities, ease urban mobility and provide water, sanitation and other services to a growing
population. Infrastructure gaps in rural areas are also large. Priority infrastructure there includes
community-level production-supporting infrastructure, irrigation investment, with complementary R&D and
extension services, and enhancing governance to increase user participation and sustainability of
investments.
A special focus on energy is warranted. Demand for energy is growing by 7-8 percent annually requiring
a rapid supply response to avoid an energy crisis in the years to come. About 35 million Indonesians
lack access to electricity. It is estimated that meeting the energy needs of the economy and closing the
access gap would require 66.8 GW of incremental generation capacity and 477 TWh power supply
capacity for a total investment over USD 200 billion. If the objective were to close the gap in the next
10 years, that would mean an investment of USD 20 billion per year. Furthermore, with energy
contributing almost a quarter of total CO2 emissions, reducing the heavy reliance on fossil fuel sources
to meet rising demand would help Indonesia contribute to the global climate change agenda. To
improve the efficiency and sustainability of the energy sector, a reduction of the large electricity
subsidy bill (USD 10 billion in 2014) is needed to boost investments in the sector, while policy and
regulatory bottlenecks to investments by all players would need to be overcome. Likewise, a special
emphasis on Indonesia’s maritime and logistics sector will be central in addressing the infrastructure gaps
that are impeding a transformation toward higher productivity and job-based growth. In addition, it
will be necessary to address these issues as part of the natural resources management and poverty
focused reforms needed for coastal regions.
The scale of investment needs in national, urban and rural infrastructure is huge (estimated at about
USD 500 billion for the next 5 years). The private sector should thus play a crucial role since the national
budget will be insufficient to finance it. There is however ample evidence that closing the infrastructure
gap in Indonesia is not only about money: it will be crucial to improve the framework for private sector
participation (e.g., the PPP scheme), address land acquisition issues, reduce red tape related to licensing and
permitting, and ensure effective coordination across various agencies and between central and sub-national
governments.
Major investment in new infrastructure presents an opportunity to drive an overall decrease in disaster
risk through growth. The flip side is that under-investing in resilient infrastructure would by default
result in increased risk. Indonesia faces medium to high risk across the whole country from multiple
natural hazards. Therefore, risk-sensitive planning and design standards are essential to protect growth that depends
on critical infrastructure assets. Indonesia has good examples of “building back better” after major
disasters. This is now the chance to be a global leader among MICs in “building better” ex-ante. Key
approaches include risk-sensitive land use planning, adequate budgeting to provide sustainable
operations and maintenance, and insurance options for public assets.
Business environment. More consistent and less restrictive trade and investment regulations are needed to
boost private investment, following a string of inconsistent rules and a flurry of restrictive sector-
specific legislation seen in recent years. Abrupt and arbitrary regulatory changes need to be avoided
and a different more consensus-based and evidence-based approach is needed, consistent with broader
efforts to improve the investment environment. In addition to consistent business regulations, faster
processing of business licenses and permits (including across “doing business” areas) is crucial. The importance of
streamlining business licensing is recognized by the government to be a major policy priority. A central
“one stop service” for investment and business licenses is being established, with the objective of
integrating all licensing processes at the national level under one roof, and simplifying the currently


                                                         14
complex web of business licensing across the different national and sub-national agencies. The
intended result is a quick, simple, transparent and integrated licensing service. The reform at the central
(BKPM) level should however be complemented by the implementation of effective sub-national one
stop services. Finally, better functioning capital, labor and land markets are required for higher job-rich
growth. For capital markets, the need to mobilize more domestic capital for infrastructure investment
is well-recognized, but will require sustained efforts to strengthen the role of the segmented banking
sector and deepen non-bank lending, including over the long term by reducing the aversion to long-
term local currency lending, and the psychological impacts of the 1997/98 crisis. Labor market
reforms could have relatively immediate benefits, but negotiating the “grand bargain” necessary will
be at least a medium-term effort. Land, and its ownership and management, is perhaps the area in
which implementation would be most arduous, requiring major institutional and governance reforms.
The benefits, however, can be cross-cutting for infrastructure development, agriculture, urban
development and environmental sustainability.
Skills. Closing Indonesia’s skills gap requires a three-pronged reform strategy. First, there is a clear
need to improve access to and quality of early childhood and basic education to build a strong base of cognitive,
social and behavioral skills necessary to acquire the higher-level skills needed in the labor market.
However, this is a very long-term agenda. It is therefore essential to find short- and medium-term
solutions for the current skills constraints: the second and third prongs of the strategy are thus
improving the relevance of feeders into the labor market (technical and vocational education, and
tertiary education) and upgrading the skills of the existing workforce (reform of the training system).
Policies that could support this strategy include: improvements in the efficiency of public education spending;
raising levels of teacher competency, which are central to the success of efforts to increase levels of educational
attainment in Indonesia; making vocational education and tertiary responsive to employer needs; improving
information flows and strengthening incentives to improve the responsiveness of tertiary education;
and accelerating the expansion of good quality training opportunities in higher value-added skills in strategic sectors.
Agriculture. There is a need to better align agricultural policies with Indonesia’s transition as a middle-income
country. Current policies have inhibited rather than facilitated the structural transformation within
agriculture and the broader agro-food system. This entails broadening policy goals (competitiveness,
nutritional balance, and environmental protection); strengthening regulatory and facilitative roles
related to food safety and plant and animal health; and tackling supply bottlenecks (land, irrigation
infrastructure, and agricultural innovation systems). Enabling these growth-critical investments
requires the phasing down of sector subsidies and complementary (non-agricultural) policies to improve the
competitiveness of high value perishables subsectors and promote investments in food processing, cold chain logistics, etc.
The provision of public goods is also critical for improving the productivity and sustainable livelihoods of
the 5 million households involved in the production of oil palm, coffee, cocoa, and tea.
Access to key services and opportunities for all
Local service delivery. Improving local service delivery will require building the capacities of local
governments to deliver services, moving toward a more performance-based transfer system, providing the tools for
citizens to monitor local service delivery, as well as differentiated approaches to regional development adapted to different
types of regions. It also requires combining the current top-down approach to reform, whereby local
governments implement national policies, with a more frontline approach, which uses the frontline
service as the entry point to develop solutions, working out from there to identify and align supporting
interventions at each levels of government. Ultimately, improving local service delivery is about
enhancing the way in which central, provincial, district, and village governments work together to
deliver results on the ground.


                                                            15
Social protection and social security. To achieve the twin goals in Indonesia, greater social
protection is needed to shield the vulnerable from shocks that push them into poverty, while helping
those beneath the poverty line to climb above it. This entails strengthening social assistance programs and
making the ongoing social security reforms effective and sustainable. Improving social assistance will likely require
far more resources than are currently spent by the Government, at roughly 0.5 percent of GDP. Other
large middle-income countries spend, on average, three times as much on these programs. At only 1
percent of GDP in 2012, total government outlays on health were the fifth-lowest out of the 188
countries for which data are available: only South Sudan, Pakistan, Chad and Myanmar had lower
ratios. Because only 41 percent of the Bottom 40 are covered, Indonesia is committed to and putting
significant effort into attaining universal health coverage (UHC) by 2019. The country launched a National
Health Insurance Program in 2014 (JKN) and is making health insurance free for the poorest 40
percent of the population—a key policy of the administration of President Joko Widodo (“Jokowi”).13
UHC could be instrumental to boosting shared prosperity and reducing poverty in Indonesia, where
93 million Indonesians (40 percent of the population) live under USD 2 per day and where inequality
is also rising.
Natural resources management and environment sustainability
Removing constraints to shared prosperity include beginning the difficult task of improving
natural resources management and environment sustainability. A key priority in improving
natural resources management and environmental sustainability in Indonesia is a reform of the governance
of land allocation, land rights access and spatial planning. Good management of these is a pre-requisite for
improving the livelihoods of local communities, but will also influence food production, urban and
infrastructure development, and mining and forestry resource management, environment degradation
and pollution, as well as the prevalence of social conflicts. For this policy priority, accelerating
programs such as land registry and implementing REDD+ would be a good start. With land use
changes, forestry and peat fires generating more than 70 percent of CO2 emissions, efforts in this area
could decisively increase Indonesia’s contribution to global climate change initiatives, while supporting
resilience to natural disasters, which disproportionately impact the poor. Building greater resilience to
natural hazards could be supported by the establishment of a national program on hazardous micro-
zoning providing detailed instruments for incorporating resilience into site design and construction
standards; providing a financing framework for both urban, housing and property development that
incentivizes investment with built-in resilience linked to disaster insurance; and a national program on
urban upgrading and ecosystem rehabilitation to increase the resilience of existing settlement and
urban infrastructure as part of the greening of Indonesia’s future growth.
For marine and fisheries resources, priorities include (i) implementing control and surveillance over sovereign
marine and fisheries resources to support the eradication of illegal overfishing (IUU); (ii) improving marine natural
resources and fisheries management to improve the sustainability of the natural capital, while
accommodating an expansion of commercial wild capture fisheries, and sustainable aquaculture
production and tourism; (iii) improve the investment climate and support PPP for sustainable capture fisheries and
aquaculture to increase production and the sector’s contribution to GDP, reduce poverty among fisher
and coastal communities as well as improve national food sovereignty and food security and, finally;
(iv) investing in maritime and logistics both in terms of infrastructure and ‘software’, as well as necessary electrification
in order to create the enabling environment for commercial fisheries, cold storage and processing plants to increase

in eastern Indonesia.
Cross-cutting pre-requisite 1: collecting more and spending better
There is a strong political consensus that boosting reforms and investment in infrastructure,
energy, health and social protection is the right course but this needs to translate into
sustained fiscal reforms in the medium term. Indeed, even if there is no policy reversal of the fuel
subsidy reforms and that the fiscal savings will be reallocated to development priorities, additional
fiscal space is needed to fund a sustained increase in the above priority areas. Given the large
infrastructure deficit, the Government should aim to increase total government infrastructure
spending (reflected as increased capital spending) from 2.3 percent of GDP in 2013-14 to 3.8 percent
by 2019.14 The investment required on the supply-side to implement fully the universal healthcare
coverage program by 2019 requires public health spending, excluding National Social Security System
(SJSN) spending, to increase to around 1.4 percent of GDP per year (from 1.0 percent of GDP in
2014); this will be reflected by higher material spending. On top of the health-related increase in social
assistance spending, social assistance spending on the poor and vulnerable should double, equivalent
to an increase of 0.5 percent of GDP, by 2019 to enable expansion of programs for the poor and
vulnerable. Simulations using a medium-term fiscal framework show total expenditure will need to
increase from 17.3 percent of GDP in 2014 to 20.0 percent by 2019.15 This places reforms to collect
more revenue in intense focus. Indeed, assuming a “business-as-usual” situation with no significant
reforms on revenue policy or administration, baseline revenue for 2015-19 is projected to stay level at
between 13.3 and 13.4 percent of GDP due to expected continued moderation in commodity prices
reducing non-tax revenues from oil and gas. In other words, Indonesia is forced to mobilize more
government revenues in order to adequately finance priority development areas within the legal fiscal
limit of 3 percent of GDP.
Cross-cutting pre-requisite 2: Governance (implementation, coordination and transparency)
Getting the reform priorities right is a first step. Effectively implementing them to efficiently
achieve shared prosperity is a key challenge in Indonesia. Some of the systems and practices
within the public administration that have been part of Indonesia’s development process over the past
decades may not serve its future needs and could undermine future growth. Despite, the substantial
changes in the roles and responsibilities of the public institutions since 1998, many of the core
elements of the pre-1998 era remain. While there are now multiple stakeholders formulating and
implementing policy at both the national and sub-national levels, there are, so far, no effective
coordination mechanisms across government. The outcome has been poor delivery of services by
government institutions, inconsistent policy settings across sectors, and a lack of responsiveness of
the administration to the priorities of the Government and citizens. The failure to adapt old
institutional arrangements and policies to reflect the new environment is an impediment to the
effectiveness of the public administration, and poses a threat to Indonesia’s future ambitions.
To support a rapidly developing economy attention needs to be given to refocusing the public
administration to establish: (i) a stronger Center of Government (CoG) to manage the policy
process and resolve policy conflicts; (ii) an enhanced selection process (including allocation between

     two-thirds of the increase in infrastructure spending is publicly financed.
15   Even assuming that fuel subsidy reforms are not reversed.

private/public sectors) and management of major capital projects to remove obstacles to their
implementation; and (iii) a streamlined bureaucracy for enhanced accountability, among other goals.
These reforms are notoriously difficult to implement. However, given the costs of not acting to the
economy, to citizens and to the country’s ambitions, Indonesia cannot afford not to consider
implementing some of these reforms in the short term. Perhaps the most urgent reform is the need
for a stronger Center of Government. In 2004, OECD/Sigma provided an outline of some of the
core functions one would expect to be effective. These functions include: (i) policy document review,
quality assurance and inter-ministry mediation; (ii) monitoring government performance; (iii)
coordination of horizontal policies/priorities; (iv) legal conformity of draft laws; (v) communication
with media and the public; and (vi) coordinating with other branches of the state.
In Indonesia several different institutions play some role in the coordination of policies,
including the Coordinating Ministries, the Vice-President’s office, the delivery units (UKP4 and
TPN2K) and others. However, this fragmentation of CoG roles and functions has not, so far, served
Indonesia well. On the contrary, ministries have been able to implement new policies and regulations
that conflict with other regulations. Policy management is also more difficult because of the challenges
to coordinate separate planning and budgeting processes for different parts of the budget. In the
future, Indonesian authorities may want to consider how to refine the mandates and functions of the
various institutions that support the CoG, and to empower the President’s office (or its designate), or
another institution, to play a stronger role in managing the policy process.
Hand-in-hand with high quality of spending is the effort to improve transparency and
accountability so as to maximize funding flows to the most vulnerable and the areas of most
pressing need. Indonesian public policy faces governance problems that weaken its effectiveness and
delay the impact of public spending. Corruption detection and enforcement have received relatively
more attention than corruption prevention in the public sector space. The Indonesian Corruption
Eradication Commission (KPK) has been engaged in investigating, prosecuting, supervising,
preventing and coordinating efforts to combat corruption, with some palpable high-profile results.
Strengthening the KPK as a well-funded independent body is critical. Weaknesses remain in the
judiciary for establishing a viable legal system to enforce contracts and increase investment security.
In addition, more attention should be given to corporate governance, also important for improving
the overall investment climate, with issues in the enforcement capabilities of regulators, weak boards
and corporate governance culture, and little participation of institutional investors.
The next decade represents the most favorable window for eradicating extreme poverty and
increasing the prosperity of the Bottom 40 in Indonesia. The country’s ongoing “demographic
dividend” will end by around 2030, when the population above 65 years of age will start increasing
faster than the population of working age. When Indonesia reaches that point, potential growth is
expected to decline as a result of reduced labor supply, lower savings rates and perhaps less
entrepreneurial innovation. Thus, reforms and growth levels in the next decade or so will determine
whether Indonesia will climb the income ladder and become “rich” before starting to get “old”. That
is, whether Indonesia will be able to mimic the experience of Japan, Hong Kong SAR, China,
Singapore and South Korea, all of which became “rich” before becoming “old”. World Bank
calculations show that reaching high-income status by 2030—i.e., a per-capita income of USD
12,000—requires growing by 9 percent annually over the next 16 years.16 Short of this exceptionally

high rate of growth, growing at least above the current 5 percent “trend” growth rate would be
required to position the country well to move onto the next level.
With China shifting away from commodity-intensive investment, the commodity tailwinds
that have supported Indonesia’s growth are morphing into headwinds and the authorities’
focus is both on the short-term and the long-term agendas. While implementing structural
reforms for shared prosperity, Indonesia has been managing the macro-fiscal impacts of the end of
the commodities boom to safeguard hard-won gains in poverty reduction and maintain macro-
stability. The exchange rate has depreciated by more than 30 percent since mid-2013; monetary policy
has tightened; fuel subsidies, a key source of fiscal risk over the past few years, have been dramatically
reduced. This response has achieved the goal of maintaining stability at the cost of adding to the
slowdown in domestic demand. This brings to the fore the two cross-cutting pre-requisites discussed
above. Policy measures to strengthen tax and non-tax compliance and the removal of expenditure
execution constraints are both crucial if growth is to rebound in the near term and the proceeds are
to be focused on the shared prosperity agenda in a less supportive global environment. The country
can do it as its impressive long-term growth and poverty reduction trajectory attests. But the clock is
ticking.

                                           I. Introduction
Indonesia is the largest economy in Southeast Asia, fifteen largest in the world and a member ASEAN
and the G20. With a GDP per capita of USD 3,510 (current prices), it ranks slightly above that of
Guatemala, but significantly behind neighboring Malaysia (USD 10,452).
Indonesia is a vast nation with a population of over 250 million, the fourth largest in the world. While
it is the world's largest Muslim-majority nation, its population includes 300 distinct native ethnic
groups with over 700 languages and dialects. It is the world's largest archipelagic state and
encompasses an estimated 17,508 islands, of which some 6,000 are inhabited. Indonesia extends 5,120
kilometers from east to west and 1,760 kilometers from north to south, straddling the equator and
located along major sea lanes from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. Indonesia has the most
volcanoes of any country in the world and is plagued by a number of natural hazards that include
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, floods, droughts, and forest fires. There are five main
islands, two major archipelagos, and 60 smaller archipelagos. The island of Java, where 58 percent of
the population lives, is the most densely populated island in the world. Eleven cities have over one
million inhabitants. The largest is Jakarta with 9.5 million, with four other cities of over 2 million
peoples all located in Java except one in Sumatra.
Indonesia has remarkably more than halved extreme poverty since 1999 to 11.3 percent in 2014, but
another 27 percent of the population (65 million people) live between the official poverty line and less
than 50 percent more than that poverty line, i.e., they are highly vulnerable to slipping into poverty.
Infant (29 per 100,000 live births) and maternal mortality (190 per 100,000) are much higher than in
neighboring Malaysia (7 and 29) and Thailand (11, and 26). Indonesia’s maternal mortality is
comparable to India but lower than Myanmar’s (200 per 100,000). Malnutrition rates are high with
37.2 percent of children stunted, 12.3 percent wasted and 18.5 percent underweighted. These rates are
as high as in the Philippines, which has only 80 percent of Indonesia’s per capita income. Income and
geographic disparities in health are huge with for instance under-five mortality in Jakarta, Yogyakarta
and Bali almost four times lower than in Papua. Under-five mortality among the bottom 40 percent is
two-and-a-half times higher than among the richest quintile of the population.
With adult literacy at almost 95 percent, gross enrollment is 109, 83 and 32 percent in primary,
secondary and tertiary education, respectively, with the share of female enrollment exceeding that of
males at each level. While equity in access to basic education has increased across socio-economic
groups and geographically, large disparities in the quality of education received remain.
Indonesia is the world’s third most populous democracy and recently, after competitive elections, a
new President took office. Executive power is fairly balanced with a legislature and judiciary, and the
press is considered to be free. However, Indonesia ranks poorly at 107 in Transparency International’s
Corruption Perceptions Index, and is plagued by corruption and patronage practices.
Previously one of the most centralized countries under the Soeharto regime, today Indonesia is one
of the most decentralized countries in the world, divided into 34 provinces, 511 districts/cities and
some 72,000 villages. With the rapid decentralization process beginning in the early 2000s, districts
have been given significant responsibilities for infrastructure and social service delivery. Villages have

The Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) is a diagnostic exercise designed to identify the most critical
binding constraints and opportunities facing a country in furthering its advancement and making
sustainable progress toward the World Bank Group’s (WBG) twin goals of ending extreme poverty
and boosting shared prosperity. The exercise is conducted in close consultation with national
authorities and other stakeholders and is based on the current available body of knowledge. A greater
analytical understanding of these priority areas will help to inform the preparation of the World Bank
Group.
In this SCD for Indonesia, we analyze past trends in growth, poverty and shared prosperity to
understand their “deep” drivers, identify the key channels for reducing poverty and increasing the
prosperity of the Bottom 40 percent, and highlight the key policies priorities, challenges and
opportunities to support these two goals.

                                   II. Trends in Economic Growth
Indonesia rebounded strongly from the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and enjoyed solid growth
until 2012. Following a 13 percent contraction in 1998, output growth recovered strongly, grounded
on gradually increasing private sector investment and robust domestic consumption. Real GDP
growth averaged 4.7 percent in 2000-05, 5.7 percent in 2006-10 and 6.0 percent in 2011-12,
demonstrating Indonesia’s resilience to the global economic downturn in 2008. The country’s GDP
almost doubled from USD 580 billion in 2001 to USD 1.1 trillion in 2012, making Indonesia the 15th
largest economy in the world and member of the G20.17 Remarkably, healthy growth has gone hand-
in-hand with low fiscal deficits (average 1.4 percent of GDP in 2000-12), a sharp decline in the debt-
to-GDP ratio (from over 100 percent in 2000 to just 25 percent in 2012) and external surpluses until
mid-2013, when a current account deficit opened for the first time since 1997.
The growth slowdown experienced since 2012 suggests however that growth is strongly
influenced by global commodity markets.18 Indeed, since 2012, weaker global commodity prices
and demand, and tighter domestic financing conditions, have reduced growth momentum (5 percent
in 2014). Indonesia has been managing the macro-fiscal impacts of the end of the commodities boom
to safeguard hard-won gains in poverty reduction and maintain macro-stability. The exchange rate has
depreciated by more than 30 percent since mid-2013; monetary policy has tightened; and fuel
subsidies, a key source of fiscal risk in the past few years, have been dramatically reduced. This
response has achieved its goal of stability but at the cost of adding to the slowdown in domestic
demand.

2.1. Growth during the Commodities Boom
The significant rise in commodity prices in 2003-11 led to massive income and wealth effects
and a rise in aggregate demand. From 2003 to 2011, the world went through one of the greatest
commodities booms of all time. Rapid growth in China, India and other emerging economies
translated into rapid increases in demand for many commodities and a sharp rise in prices. Benchmark
international prices for coal, crude palm oil, rubber and crude oil—all important export commodities
for Indonesia—each rose threefold, in real US dollar terms, between 2000 and 2010. Indonesia, one
of the most commodity-abundant countries in the world, benefited substantially from this boom. As
summarized by the table below:19

     •   The terms of trade and net exports increased sharply. Indonesia’s terms of trade doubled
         in 2003-11 leading to a tripling of annual export earnings to USD 203.5 billion in 2011, thanks
         to a sharp rise in commodity exports. Indonesia’s trade surplus then reached record levels
         (annual average USD 19 billion) and significantly contributed to the surpluses in the current
         account (0.2 percent of GDP in 2011) and balance of payments (gross reserves jumped to
         USD 110 billion from USD 34.7 billion in 2005).

     •   Investment recovered to its pre-1997 Asian financial crisis level. The boom filtered into
         corporate revenues and led to a big increase in investments. After falling dramatically after the
         1997/98 crisis, Indonesia’s investment-to-GDP ratio recovered strongly a few years into the
         commodities boom, moving up to 32 percent in 2012 (compared with ratios of 27 percent in

            South Korea, 30 percent in India and an extremely high 46 percent in China, for example).
            While much of this increase has been due to rising investment prices, real investment growth
            has averaged an annual 8.4 percent over 2008-12 (up from 7.6 percent over 2003-07), and has
            tracked commodity prices. Econometric analysis shows that terms-of-trade gains contributed
            around one-third to investment growth over 2005-11.

       •    Household incomes increased, boosting private consumption. The direct rise in the
            value of resource assets, as well as that of other assets purchased on the back of commodity
            incomes or commodity wealth, significantly encouraged consumption against these assets. As
            seen in Section 2, thanks to robust job creation, Indonesia’s consumer class grew at 11 percent
            a year between 2002 and 2014, and now makes up 18 percent of the population (43 million).
            Real private consumption growth averaged 4.5 percent per year over the period 2003-12, with
            peaks of 5.3 percent in 2008 and 2012, and private consumption now accounts for 55 percent
            of nominal GDP (2012).

The commodities sector directly and indirectly contributed to the strong recovery of GDP
growth following the 1997/98 crisis. Commodity-related sectors accounted directly for around one-
fifth of real GDP growth between 2002 and 2012 (around one-tenth each from primary and secondary
commodities sub-sectors). Given the rise in commodity prices, these sectors’ contributions to nominal
GDP have been much greater (around two-fifths). Indeed, as Figure 2.2 shows, Indonesia’s overall
GDP has become highly correlated with growth in the commodities sector. In part, this reflects the
second-round effects from commodity-related activity on GDP via demand for other goods and
services.20




20   These effects are hard to quantify but using the 2008 Input Output table (the most recently publicly available data),
     a one unit rupiah rise in final demand for the commodity manufacturing sector increases total economic output by
     2.14 units (with a direct effect on own commodity manufacturing sector output of 1.37 unit and indirect effect on
     the output of other sectors of 0.77). The mining sector multiplier is lower at 1.31 (primarily direct effects).

A key feature of the commodities boom was the rise in the (largely non-tradable) services
sector reflecting in part a sharp appreciation of the real exchange rate (RER). The services
sector, broadly defined, contributed an average 3.3 percentage points (pp) to total GDP growth,
against 1.8 pp for industry and 0.6 pp for primary sector in 2003-12. The expansion of the services
sector was associated with the appreciation of Indonesia’s RER, following more than two decades of
overall sharp depreciation, during which investments into manufacturing export industries boomed
(Figure 2.3). In contrast, the appreciation of the RER in 2002-12 led to a decline of investments
flowing into these sectors and a rise of investments in domestically-oriented sectors, chiefly services.
There is also evidence that the liberalization of the retail trade in 1998, telecoms from 1999 and air
transport in 2004 contributed to the rise of investment and growth in these sectors.21 Between 2001
and 2010, the share of transport and communications, financial services and retail trade, hotel and
restaurant in total foreign investment flows almost doubled to an average of 63 percent in 2010. A
large part of the services sector is composed of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises
contributing around 57 percent to GDP and 47 percent of total employment. As shown in Section 3,
more than 80 percent of the new jobs created in 2001-11 were in the services sector.22
In agriculture, exported estate crops expanded in contrast with food crops, which faced
significant challenges responding to rising domestic demand. Agriculture grew by an annual
average of just 0.6 percentage points in 2003-12, contributing only 10 percent to aggregate growth in
that period. This performance reflects the net impact of lackluster growth for most food products,
largely offsetting the rise in palm oil and rubber production. The high prices of these products on
world markets have supported investment, production and yields. The OECD (2012) finds that
diversification away from food staples into palm oil production and other high-valued commodities
drove agricultural total factor productivity in the past decade (explaining 60 percent of agriculture
growth in that period).23 This structural transformation within agriculture, combined with rapid

domestic demand for food driven by rising per capita incomes and urbanization, has led to a rapid rise
in imports of horticultural products and a movement of labor from agriculture into urban services.
The rise in services and relative decline in agriculture, albeit while both sectors faced high
consumer demand, is consistent with “Engel’s Law” effects in consumption. This “law”
stipulates that demand for services tends to increase more with income thanks to higher income
elasticity of demand of services relative to agricultural products (Chenery, Robinson and Syrquin,
1986).24 In addition, supply of services to customers in urban areas is less constrained than supply of
agriculture, explaining a more rapid response of domestic production to rising demand. Indeed, while
production and consumption of services often occur simultaneously (investments are often made
where the demand is), a key challenge for agriculture and manufacturing is to remain competitive in
distant markets (e.g., urban centers), due to high transport and distribution costs in Indonesia.

2.2. Growth after the Commodities Boom
Since 2012, Indonesia has been experiencing the typical macro-fiscal effects of commodity
price declines in a resource economy. Key export commodities peaked in 2011 and dropped by
about 40 percent by the end of 2014. This sharp decline in commodity export prices, coinciding with
a rapid increase in oil imports, sharply reduced Indonesia’s trade surplus and led to the opening of a
large current account deficit for the first time in 15 years. From a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP, the
current account turned into a large deficit: 2.7 percent of GDP between 2011 and 2012. On the fiscal
side, softer export commodity prices, combined with lower production of oil, reduced oil and gas
revenues and increased fiscal pressures through 2014. Government nominal revenues growth dropped
from 22.7 to 7.7 percent, in line with the sharp decline in oil and gas revenues growth from 33.6
percent in 2011 to -20.9 percent in 2012 (non-oil and gas revenue growth decreased to 3.2 percent in
2012, from 18 percent in 2011). At the same time, due to high crude oil prices until mid-2014 and a
sharp depreciation of the rupiah in the second half of 2013 (see below), energy subsidies increased

24   Engel’s effects refer to the Engel’s Law, introduced by Ernest Engel in 1857, which stipulates that as households’
     income increases, the percentage of income spent on food decreases while the proportion spent on other goods
     and services increases.

significantly. Both external and fiscal pressures mounted sharply as a result of the softening of
commodity prices since 2011, forcing the Government to adjust the policy setting and focus on
maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Indonesia’s macro policies have been significantly adjusted since mid-2013. Bank Indonesia
(BI), the country’s central bank, tightened monetary policy up until November 2014 (a cumulative
increase of 200 basis points), contributing to a halving of credit growth, before easing its key reference
interest rate by 25bp to 7.25 percent in February. At the same time, to avoid a decline in foreign
reserves, assist the reduction of the current account deficit and absorb external possible shocks
following the “taper tantrum”, BI kept the exchange rate flexible. In the second half of 2013, the
rupiah depreciated by 26 percent. The rupiah has continued to trend lower against the US dollar by
about 8 percent in the year to March 2015. However, US dollar strength has been broad-based and
Indonesia’s domestic prices have increased at a relatively faster pace, so the rupiah has in fact again
strengthened significantly in real trade-weighted terms since mid-2014.
The fiscal sector has also had to adjust to the effect of lower oil and gas revenues and higher
energy subsidies to support macro-fiscal stability. Faced with the challenge of slowing revenues
and mounting energy subsidies, the Government increased domestic fuel prices by an average 33
percent in June 2013. However, much of the fiscal savings from this reform was lost by the end of
2013 due to the sharp depreciation of the rupiah. The fuel subsidy thus kept increasing: IDR 212
trillion in 2012, IDR 221 trillion in 2013 (despite the fuel subsidy reform) and IDR 246 trillion in 2014.
On November 2014, the new Government decisively increased fuel prices by 30 percent. This was
followed by the complete removal of the subsidies for gasoline and the capping of subsidies for diesel
through a new market-based price determination formula. The year 2015 marks the first year of
significantly reduced fiscal risk since 2011.
As a result of the softening of commodity prices and the consequent adjustment of the policy
settings, Indonesia’s GDP growth has been slowing since 2012. Weaker global commodity prices
and demand, and tighter domestic financing conditions, have weighed on the economy, with fixed
investment growth roughly halving since 2012 (up 4.1 percent in 2014) and exports contracting slightly
(-1 percent in 2014 from 13.6 percent in 2011). Consumption growth also softened in 2014, to 4.8
percent from 5.6 percent in 2013. Consistent with slower output growth since 2012, net job creation
has slowed to an annual average of 0.9 percent, only just enough to keep the share of working age
Indonesians in employment stable, at 62.6 percent (based on the most recent two labor force surveys,
conducted in August 2013 and 2014). Poverty reduction has also been slowing, with the USD 1.25
poverty rate falling by an average of 1.7 percentage points between 2011 and 2013, but slowing to 1.1
percentage points in 2014 and now sitting at 8.6 percent. This trend is consistent with the national
poverty rate, which is falling even more slowly as prices for the poor have risen even faster than the
CPI. Indonesia’s challenge in the years to come is to implement decisive structural reforms in order
to revert to a higher growth rate and reduce poverty.

2.3. Growth and Employment
2.3.1. Economic growth led to massive job creation in 2001-12
Consistent with the solid economic growth, job creation was robust in 2001-12, especially in
the services sector. Close to 21 million of the 23.8 million new jobs created between 2001 and 2014
were in the services sector. Within this sector, out of the total job growth, 31 percent occurred in
community, social and personal services (where 7.4 million new jobs were created), 30 percent in


                                                   27
wholesale, trade and retail (7.3 million new jobs) and 14.5 percent in construction (3.4 million new
jobs). Comparatively, agriculture (where 34 percent of total workers are still employed) lost 770,000
jobs as agricultural workers migrated to urban areas, attracted by higher paying but still low-
productivity jobs. The industry sector excluding construction (currently 15 percent of total
employment) created only 3.8 million new jobs, of which 3.1 million were in manufacturing.
Employment in mining, and oil and gas rose fast in line with the commodities boom, but the labor
absorption capacity of these sectors is limited.

The boom in the services sector predominantly occurred in urban areas, leading to an
acceleration in urbanization and job creation in urban areas. Total urban employment has grown
by a total of 54 percent since 2001 and has gradually overtaken rural employment over the past decade.
Furthermore, since 2008 jobs in urban areas have been growing faster than the working age population
(Figure 2.7). While the working age population continued to increase between 2005 and 2012, the
share of the employed to the working age population rose from 60 to nearly 64 percent, reaching its
mid-1990s levels, but has remained stagnant at 62.6 percent in the two following years.25 Rural dwellers
have also indirectly benefited from growth and the sharp recovery in urban job markets through
outmigration of low productivity workers to urban areas, remittances and spillover effects of growth
in proximate urban markets (e.g., on demand for rural goods and services). These factors have helped
to reduce rural poverty.26

2.3.2. Most jobs were created in low-productivity sectors
While dynamic labor markets have helped to reduce poverty, they have not reduced
vulnerability, because most of the new jobs were created in low productivity sectors.27 The
agriculture and ‘wholesale, retail, hotel and restaurant’ (‘low-end services’) sectors, which employ the
largest number of vulnerable workers (Table 2.1), have the lowest levels of labor productivity in the
economy. Agriculture and wholesale, trade, hotel and restaurant employ 35 and 21 percent of total
workers, respectively. They happen to be the two sectors with the lowest productivity and skill-content
in the economy (Figure 2.8). Furthermore, less than 10 percent of workers in these sectors have a
tertiary level of education and more than 60 percent have no formal contracts. Because of the weight
of these sectors in total employment, the overall picture of the economy is one that features a
predominance of low value-added, low-skilled, low-productivity sectors, in sharp contrast to Malaysia,
for instance (Figure 2.8 and Figure 2.9).

27   As shown in the next paragraphs, productivity in these low-productivity sectors generally did not grow fast,
     explaining sluggish real wage trends.


                                                                                                  29
Not only are levels of productivity generally low, but sectoral labor productivity growth
generally decelerated in the second half of the 2000s. Following the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis
during which productivity collapsed in all sectors, productivity growth rebounded uniformly in 2002,
but the rebound proved short-lived for most sectors (Figure 2.10). For instance, from a peak 6 percent
growth in 2004, average labor productivity growth in manufacturing dropped to only 1 percent in
2010 and close to zero in 2011. The low-end services sub-sectors experienced a similar trend as they
absorbed a large number of workers, in contrast to the transport and communications sub-sectors,
which held up well in terms of productivity growth, preventing an otherwise sharper decline of
productivity dynamics of the overall services sector (Figure 2.10). In the agriculture sector, overall
productivity increased as a result of two factors: (i) the release of low-productivity workers, and (ii)
investment-driven technology improvements in palm oil, rubber and other estate crops (see Indonesia
DPR, 2014). Productivity in agriculture remains, however, much lower that its levels in the mid-1990s.

Stronger growth will be required in the next few years for employment to catch up with growth
of the working age population and avoid raising unemployment. During the commodity boom
years, between 2005 and 2012, employment grew by 2.8 percent per year, on average, as opposed to
1.8 percent annual growth of the working-age population, generating an increase in the employment
rate. In the two last years, however, due to slower economic growth, employment grew only by 1.2
percent per year, against a 2.1 percent annual increase in the working age population (Figure 2.11).

                             III. The Contrasting Patterns of Poverty, Vulnerability and Inequality
3.1. Extreme Poverty: Reduced Sharply, but Persists
Remarkably, poverty in Indonesia was more than halved from 23.4 percent in 1999 to 11.3
percent in 2014 (about 27 million people), using the national poverty line. This performance
reflects a similar trend in urban and rural areas (Figure 3.1). However, at 8.3 percent in 2014, the urban
consumption-poverty rate is much lower than in rural areas where the poverty headcount averages
14.2 percent. Indonesia’s poverty performance has been in line with other EAP countries since the
Asian financial crisis, but has lagged that of Vietnam and Cambodia after recovery from the crisis
(Figure 3.2).

poverty rates of households whose head worked in forestry (29 percent) or fisheries (15 percent) in
2012. In sharp contrast, poverty rates for those whose head worked in industry (9 percent) or services
(6 percent) were much lower. Forest areas with the largest number of poor are located in Papua
(eastern Indonesia) where poverty rates are highest, Sulawesi (North-East) and Central Kalimantan
(North)—see map. Households living in or near forest areas derive the bulk of their incomes from
forest ecosystems. It is estimated 20 percent of income of rural population stems from natural
resources. In Papua, 50 percent of income is linked to forest activities and other natural resources.
Thus lifting the “hard core” poor durably out of poverty is tied to a more sustainable management of
natural resources and improving the rural economy broadly, not only agriculture but also non-farm
activities.

3.2. The Bottom 40 Percent: A Highly Vulnerable Group
The relative success in reducing extreme poverty has not been reflected among “vulnerable”
households, which are not officially poor but are also far from being safe and secure from
poverty. This group accounts for 27 percent of the population (65 million people) that lives between
the official poverty line and less than 50 percent more than that poverty line.29 The vulnerability rate
has stayed constant since 2002 (Figure 3.5). Together, the poor and the vulnerable amount to about
38 percent of the population (to simplify, the bottom 40 percent). Eighty percent of the vulnerable
live in Sumatra/Java/Bali and urban areas (43 percent of the vulnerable versus 37 percent of the poor).
Of note, the upward mobility of the poor and the vulnerable is slow.30 Of the poor in 2008, 75 percent
failed to exit poverty or vulnerability by 2010. While this was mainly due to lack of productive
employment (see Section III), some of it was due to shocks. Fifteen percent of the poor actually left
poverty in 2009, but were poor again in 2010 (Susenas data).31


29 The poor are those beneath the official poverty line; the vulnerable are those between the poverty line and 1.5
   times that line.
30 As seen below, the upward mobility of individuals in the bottom 40 percent is quite significant over a lifetime

   horizon.
31 The World Bank has recently conducted a study of risk and risk management in Indonesia. Drawing primarily on

   original qualitative evidence from four rural and peri-urban sites, this study explores in-depth the risks faced and
   risk management practices adopted at the household and community level in Indonesia. Preliminary findings show

The bottom 40 percent of the population are highly vulnerability to food price shocks. Food
makes up around 65 percent of total poor household consumption. Consequently, even relatively
small increases in food prices tend to have a significant effect on individual welfare, and on the national
poverty rate. It is estimated that a 10 percent increase in the overall cost of food would result in a
relative increase in poverty of 3.5 percentage points. The food item that has the greatest impact on
the poor and near-poor is rice. Rice alone makes up 23 percent of poor households’ total expenditure.
It is estimated that a 10 percent increase in the price of rice would result in the national poverty rate
being 1.3 percentage points higher than it would otherwise be. Rice prices tend to remain high and
volatile, due to high logistical costs and trade restrictions. Imports of rice are controlled by the State
Logistics Agency (Bulog), the state logistics agency, and are not effective in smoothing rice prices; too
little rice is bought too late, due to flaws in design and implementation. The Raskin program—
subsidized rice for the poor—is intended to provide food support to 15 million poor and vulnerable
households. However, due to much of the rice being lost during distribution from central procurement
to the communities, and then further dilution of benefits due to communities informally sharing out
what rice was received, the average monthly amount of rice purchased was only around 5-6kg per
household, compared with an average monthly consumption of 40kg. This program thus does
relatively little to support the poor and those on low incomes or protect them from rice price shocks.
Health-related expenditure shocks are also a key source of vulnerability for the bottom 40
percent.32 The latter benefit from an insurance program financed by the Government but, in reality,
a combination of inaccurate targeting and poor implementation has meant that only around half are
covered. Out-of-pocket spending is thus high. Overall, it accounts for 40 percent of total health
spending in Indonesia. Low insurance coverage combined with generally poor access to good quality
health care implies that over 40 million workers are at risk of lost or decreasing productivity and wages
due to ill health and prolonged recovery from medical issues. It is estimated that almost 2.3 million

   that the rural poor and near-poor face a wide variety of risks and shocks. Among these, food price and health
   shocks are the most important but they also arise from the high cost of participating in customary lifecycle rituals.
32 The latter has the worse health indicators among income groups: for instance, in 2012, skilled birth attendance was

individuals currently fall into poverty annually due to catastrophic health spending. The Government’s
goal is universal health coverage of all Indonesians by 2019, including workers in both the formal and
informal sectors, under the national social security program. As discussed in Section 5 (reforms for
inclusive growth), achieving this will require addressing a host of implementation challenges, as well
as improving the availability of health care by reducing supply-side deficiencies. 33
In terms of jobs, the bottom 40 percent is heavy concentrated in low-productivity, low-paying
activities mainly in the agriculture, and the “wholesale, retail, hotel and restaurant” sectors.
Error! Reference source not found. About 21 million of them are children from poor families;
among the 44 million vulnerable adults, about one third (15 million) do not work, 42 percent (18
million) work in agriculture and 10 percent (2.9 million) work in the wholesale, retail, hotel and
restaurant sector. The proportion of vulnerable workers within each sector is relatively high in all
sectors except communications and banking/finance/business services. For instance, more than a
quarter of workers in agriculture, construction and transport can be classified as vulnerable.
Agriculture and the wholesale, retail, hotel and restaurant sectors, which employ the largest number
of vulnerable workers, also have the lowest levels of labor productivity in the economy. Agriculture
and wholesale, trade, hotel and restaurant (dubbed “low-end services”) employ 35 and 21 percent of
total workers, respectively. They happen to be the two sectors with the lowest productivity and skill-
content in the economy and are largely informal.
As a consequence of the persistence of low productivity jobs and vulnerable forms of work,
real wages have been stagnant for the bottom 40 percent of the wage distribution (Figure 3.7).
The two lowest deciles have actually experienced negative real wage growth, and for the third and
fourth lowest deciles real wage gains have been modest (Figure 3.8). Real wage growth has been higher
and more even for medium-high deciles (from the fifth up to the ninth), ranging between 19 and 26
percent, while those in the top decile have enjoyed up to 60 percent real wage increase over the period.
Widening wage disparities over time have very likely added to the increase in overall inequality
documented in the previous section, undermining the possibility for poorer workers to achieve higher
living standards and greater prosperity.

Furthermore, most jobs provide little protection to workers and this applies both to the stock
of existing jobs and to the flow of newly created jobs. The persistence of low labor incomes and
limited workers’ protection make many Indonesians vulnerable to shocks and add to rising inequality,
undermining recent welfare gains and shared prosperity. The first challenge in addressing workers’
protection, however, relates to measurement. The current official Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS)
measure of informality, which classifies “informal” workers using a combination of questions on
occupation and employment status, is in fact overestimating de facto protection. According to the BPS
measure, 47 percent of total employment is currently considered “formal”, while according to a
number of alternative definitions, such as the share of workers with written contracts (only 23 percent
of total employment) or the share of workers covered by social security (about 12 percent of total
workers before the implementation of SJSN), de facto protection is much lower. In addition, all
potentially vulnerable forms of work (self-employed, unpaid family workers, casual workers, domestic
workers and workers paid below the minimum wages) taken together add up to nearly 80 percent of
total employment.
Women tend to be more vulnerable than men due to differences job status.34 Women constitute
most of the self-employed and unpaid family workers, making them more susceptible to personal and
financial insecurity. The gender wage gap in Indonesia is larger than in other countries in East Asia,
with women only earning about 70 percent of what men earn, in part because female workers tend to
have less secure terms of employment and are more likely to be self-employed, doing unpaid family
work or working in the informal sector.35 Being a woman increases the probability of working in the
informal sector by 24 percent.36 Women-owned SMEs are mostly self-employed by necessity.
Indonesia’s social assistance programs favor female-headed households (FHH), but as typically the
sole income earner in the household, FHHs tend to be more vulnerable to shocks and their poverty
rates tend to be more volatile. Furthermore, out of the large labor pool of 37 million working-age
Indonesians that is inactive, 86 percent of which are women.

The bottom 40 percent have benefited far Figure 3.10: The richest households have seen much

households have seen rising real consumption,
                                                     8
but it has been highest for the wealthier
households, which are pulling away from the
rest of the country. Between 2003 and 2010,          6
consumption for the bottom 40 grew at only
1-2 percent per year, while the richest 10
percent enjoyed consumption growth of 6.5            4
percent and the second-richest quintile of 5.5
percent. Growth in the bottom seven deciles
                                                     2

11. The bottom 40 percent in Cambodia,
China, Thailand, Lao PDR and the Philippines all experienced higher annual consumption growth
rates, 9, 7, 4, 1.4 and 1.4 percent, respectively. Compared with countries outside of the region, the
bottom 40 percent in Indonesia is achieving prosperity at a rate of less than half that of their
counterparts in India, Pakistan, South Africa, Chile and Thailand.
The poorest 40 percent of Indonesians account for only a fifth of consumption and their share
has been declining over time. In 2002, the average consumption per person of the richest 10 percent
of households was 6.6 times that of the poorest 10 percent; by 2013, this had risen to 10.3 times. As
a consequence, the richest 10 percent now account for nearly a third of all household consumption in
Indonesia, and the richest 20 percent for nearly half.
The income gap between rich and poor, as Table 3.1: The richest 20 percent of households
measured by the Gini coefficient, increased account for nearly half of all consumption
by almost 12 percentage points between (share of total household consumption, percent)
2000 and 2013. Historically, the Gini                               2002    2006        2010 2013

38                      Comparing Gini coefficients across time and countries is difficult, due to different welfare measures (income or
                        consumptions), different welfare aggregates (e.g., whether housing, durables and self-production are included in
                        the consumption aggregate, and in what manner), and different within-country purchasing power adjustments
                        (spatial cost of living). These differences can affect both levels and changes in levels. Moreover, the choice of
                        start and end points also affects trends over time. Work has begun on an East Asian data portal which will
                        facilitate more consistent comparisons.

Indonesian inequality is relatively high for the region, albeit average for middle income
countries. The Indonesian Gini is now over 40, behind only Malaysia, the Philippines and China in
EAP. However, it remains lower than many LAC countries (although LAC Gini coefficients are
income-based).

 Note: Latest year available, ranging from 2000 to 2012. Some coefficients are for income, some for consumption. The consumption Gini
 for a country is always lower than its income Gini.


In fact, the true level of Indonesia’s inequality is most likely even higher. Accurately measuring
inequality requires collecting data from a representative sample of all households, from the poorest to
the richest. In Indonesia, however, it appears that the richest households are under-reporting
consumption or missing from the data altogether. According to the National Socio-economic Survey
(Susenas), which is used to estimate inequality, only 5 million people (or 2 percent of the population)
consumed more than IDR 2 million per month during 2012, and 1.3 million (0.5 percent) more than
IDR 4 million per month. Meanwhile, only around half of the owners of private passenger cars
registered with the police are found in Susenas. If half are missing, then the true Gini is likely to be
significantly higher.
Education is a key factor in explaining inequality in Indonesia. Greater demand for more
educated workers has meant that they enjoy higher wages. Compared with workers with a primary
education or less, those with junior secondary education now enjoy a 20 percent premium, those with
senior secondary a 40 percent premium, and those with tertiary earn double. This premium has been
increasing over the past decade. This gap in wages between the more and the less educated influences
consumption inequality. Households whose head has more education have higher consumption, and
this gap with poorly educated households has also been increasing over time. Because jobs increasingly
require more education, since 2013 workers with primary education have fallen from a majority to a
minority. As a consequence, declining demand for less educated workers puts downward pressure on
their wages relative to those for more educated workers.

 Note: Worker wage premium represents how much higher wages workers at each level of education receive compared
 with workers with primary or less education, controlling for experience, gender, work status, location and other factors.
 Household consumption premium represents the same, for per capita consumption and head of household’s education.

The distribution of capital asset ownership across the population makes a difference too.
Since the beginning of 2002 until the end of 2013, the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) Composite
Index (a measure of all stocks) increased in nominal value by nearly 11 times, averaging compounded
returns of 22 percent per year. The corresponding property index increased in value by 12.5 times,
averaging 23 percent in annual compounded gains. Only wealthier Indonesians have benefited from
strong capital returns. However, the extent of rich households’ income rise is not adequately
captured in household surveys. Indeed, many of the rich are not included in survey data, so income in
the form of capital gains in stocks and housing is under-represented.
Finally, the increasing share of capital                      Figure 3.16: Increasing consumption inequality is being

national income. For example, the labor                                      Formal

pattern. As the poor do not own capital, an                     35
increasing capital income share goes to richer                                   All workers
households, further exacerbating inequality.
Inequality is thus increasing as labor’s share                  30

relative movement over the period,
both upwards and downwards, with no more than one third of the first four quintiles remaining in
the same place. Of those in the poorest income quintile in 1993, 65 percent had reached a higher
income quintile by 2007, with 19 percent reaching the top two quintiles. Thus, the poor have a
reasonable chance of moving into higher income levels within their lifetimes—people who start out
at the bottom of the income distribution can get to the top if they work hard, have the right skills and
enjoy a measure of good luck, while people who start out towards the top can lose their place.
However, investments to reduce inequality of opportunities are needed to reduce inequality in the
long term.
The most important factor enabling upward mobility into the consumer class is quality
education. Indonesia’s consumer class grew at 11 percent a year between 2002 and 2014, and now
makes up 18 percent of the population.39 The main pathway into the consumer class has been through
better jobs and higher wages. The majority is formal employees (58 percent) or are business owners
with paid workers (17 percent), (Figure 3.17). Very few work in agriculture; most work in
manufacturing or services. Better employment, in turn, is accessed through higher education. The
consumer class, roughly equal to the two top quintiles, differs from the rest of the population in
having, on average, high school education, while the wealthiest members of the consumer class hold
a bachelor’s degree on average (Figure 3.17). While near-universal access to primary education has
been achieved in Indonesia, new policies are needed to ensure that the bottom 40 percent continue
on to high school and further. For example, in 2012 students from the bottom 40 percent of
households in terms of income represented only 10 percent of tertiary enrolment. The needed
improvements in overall education quality will also require a strong focus on reducing learning
disparities.

In sum, members of rich Indonesian households have access to assets such as real estate and
stocks that have allowed their wealth to grow rapidly. At the same time, with better education,
they are able to find better jobs to boost their incomes. Those from poorer households, however, lack
financial assets and can only improve their income through work. Most of the jobs created in
Indonesia since 2001, and indeed most current jobs, are in low productivity sectors, resulting in low
real labor incomes, particularly for the poor and the vulnerable. In addition, these workers have limited
access to formal worker protection. Limited access to good job opportunities also undermines
Indonesia’s economic growth, since Indonesia is not maximizing its current labor force in terms of its
productive potential, exactly at the time when the demographic dividend is peaking.
3.3.3. Inequality of opportunity40
Around one-third of total inequality is due to circumstances that children are born into, or
develop soon after. Some inequality is due to circumstances that are beyond the control of an
individual, such as gender, ethnicity, birthplace or family background. This type of inequality prevents
individuals from achieving their potential, which is not only unfair to them but also lowers Indonesia’s
human capital overall, reducing growth and productivity. Equality of opportunity, therefore, aims to
level the playing field so that these circumstances do not unduly influence a person’s chance to
succeed. In Indonesia, just three of these factors—the gender of the head of the household, their
parents’ education, and where they were born (urban or rural, which region of Indonesia)—were
associated with 33 percent of total consumption inequality in 2012 (Figure 3.18). Thus education,
women’s empowerment and access to good quality services in rural areas will be crucial in reducing
inequality of opportunity and future income inequality.
Moreover, while inequality of opportunity declined in earlier periods, it is now rising once
again. For heads of households born in 1948-57, 39 percent of the inequality in their present day
consumption can be explained by these selected birth circumstances (Figure 3.19). For those born a
decade later, when Indonesia first began its economic expansion, this fell to 37 percent. For those
born a decade later again, who would be the first to benefit from Indonesia’s massive primary school
expansion of the 1970s, it fell to 34 percent. However, for those born in the late 1970s, the percentage
of current inequality due to these birth circumstances is rising once again.

 Note: Decomposition of Theil L (GE (0)) Index (all individuals) into within and between group differences. Birth circumstances are
 head of household gender, parents’ education*, province of birth and whether the birth location was fully urban (whether kotamadya or
 kabupaten). *Adults’ own education is taken as a proxy for their parents’ education, which are not in the data. However, analysis of
 IFLS data shows that parents’ education and income are important determinants of children’s educational outcomes, as are availability
 of schools, all of which are themselves birth circumstances. Non-birth circumstances include children’s effort.


The differences between the lives of children of different family backgrounds in Indonesia
can be very stark. Inequalities of opportunity can be seen by comparing a child born in Jakarta to
non-poor parents who have at least high school education with a child born in a rural area of Papua
or Maluku to a poor family with little education. The former has only a 6 percent chance of lacking
proper sanitation, compared with 98 percent for the latter child. These differences extend across all
other indicators of opportunity, such as access to clean water, having non-dirt floors in the house,
primary school enrolment, birth by skilled attendant and immunization coverage. This is true not only
when comparing Jakarta with Papua. Children from poor households in rural areas consistently lag
behind children from rich households in urban areas on almost every indicator.

In some dimensions the gap between children from rich and poor families fell between 2002
and 2011, including for most health, education and housing outcomes and opportunities. For
example, 63 percent of children in the poorest consumption decile were delivered by an unskilled
attendant in 2002, compared with just 11 percent for the richest decile, a 52 percentage-point gap. By
2011, this gap had closed to 34 percentage points. Similar the gap between rich and poor children, the
rural-urban gap is also closing on many dimensions, such as access to clean drinking water, improved
sanitation and electrification. However, the rural-urban gap is closing at a slower rate.

Substantial and sustained efforts by the Government to expand educational access to all over
the past 40 years are contributing to closing gaps in education opportunities. Enrolment rates


                                                                       44
among 13-15 year olds whose parents had a primary school level of education or less have increased
in the past decade. They are converging with children of parents who have a junior secondary level of
education or higher, who already had high enrolment rates. Closing the school enrolment gap has
provided poor children with opportunities to improve their education outcomes for many years now.
Adults whose parents had little education are increasingly likely to achieve a higher level of schooling
themselves. For example, nearly 60 percent of people born between 1952 and 1961 into a household
where the parents had no education also received no education themselves. For those born in 1962-
71, this rate dropped to 45 percent, and to just 21 percent for those born in 1972-81.
With educational mobility having increased over the past 30 to 40 years in Indonesia, children
from poorer or less educated families now have a greater chance of achieving higher
educational attainment themselves. However, the stakes are now higher, with the premium for
more education increasing over the past decade. This means that those children who do not break the
inter-generational transmission of disadvantage are falling increasingly further behind their peers.
Furthermore, measures of access and opportunity, especially in health and education, do not reflect
the quality of services received. Children in poorer or more remote areas not only participate less in
these services, but when they do, the quality is often lower.

In sum, while income inequality due to circumstances beyond the control of an individual is
rising, Indonesia’s major progress in education in an environment of rising return to
education augurs well for the future path of inequality. That said, education is only one of the
factors explaining inequality of opportunity. Other important dimensions, such as access to rural
services (health, sanitation, electricity, etc.), as well as greater empowerment of women, will need to
be addressed.

           IV. Pathways for Poverty Reduction and Boosting Shared Prosperity
4.1. The Analytical Framework: The Three Pathways
The analytical framework used here posits that reducing poverty and increasing shared
prosperity in Indonesia rests on three pillars: economic growth, access to services for all, and
the quality of natural resource governance and management. This framework is based on a
thorough analysis of the drivers of poverty in Indonesia and lessons from international experience.41
As the diagram below illustrates, a growth strategy that generates jobs is fundamental. For the first
pillar, while the private sector is the main engine of economic growth, the Government nonetheless
plays a critical role by devising and implementing policies and regulations that encourage private sector
participation and economic growth. For the second pillar, spending public money in the right areas,
and doing so efficiently and effectively, is crucial to improving opportunities for all citizens through
universal access to health, nutrition, education and basic infrastructure.
The special nature of poverty in forest and coastal areas in Indonesia suggests that pathways
1 and 2 based on the first two pillars will not by themselves be sufficient and therefore need
be supplemented by natural resource management policies, to reduce poverty in these areas.
Given the very large number of people living in these areas in Indonesia, and their high levels of
extreme poverty, a third pathway, working through the management of natural resources, is needed.
Indeed, remoteness, low population density and dispersed community locations imply that (i)
connection with, and externalities from, growth in non-resource sectors are weak; (ii) access to markets
and high quality services such as education and health is difficult; and (iii) the cost of providing high-
quality services and infrastructure (e.g., roads) is high. The fate of people living in these areas is
intimately tied to natural resource activities and man-made and natural changes in the related
ecosystems, such as deforestation, overexploitation of resources, floods and landslides.
The severity of natural resource degradation and air pollution in Indonesia warrants that
environmental sustainability needs to be addressed in its own right. Indonesia ranks among the
top greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting countries of the world. Roughly one-third of Indonesia’s GHG
emissions originate from land-use changes and forest degradation, 26 percent from peat fires and 22
percent from fossil-fuel emissions, which are also rising steeply. Overall, outdoor and indoor (cooking)
air pollution is high and generates negative health impacts that cost billions of US dollars. The increase
in Indonesia’s GHG emissions can be attributed partly to rising commodity production (e.g., palm oil)
and poor governance regarding land use and resource extraction. This is exacerbated by rapid
population growth (2.9 million additional people per year), rapid urbanization (with a 65 percent
urbanization rate projected by 2050), and rapid growth of the domestic “middle class” and aggregate
consumption (and with it rapid energy demand growth).

4.2. Pathway I: Binding Constraints to Growth and Job Creation and Reform Options
Rapid and stable economic growth is essential, in light of its impact on poverty reduction,
but it is not sufficient as the quality of growth and jobs matters tremendously for reducing
vulnerability and increasing shared prosperity. Looking ahead, Indonesia will not be able to count
on favorable commodity prices and it will take structural reforms to boost inclusive growth. The end
of the commodities boom has exposed Indonesia’s deep structural weaknesses, which will need to be
addressed if the economy is to revert to high levels of growth in an inclusive and sustainable fashion.
The structural weaknesses include: (i) infrastructure bottlenecks; (ii) a poor business environment; (iii)
labor, land and capital markets that are unsupportive to inclusive and sustainable growth; and (iv) skills
shortages and mismatches.
4.2.1 Infrastructure bottlenecks
4.2.1.1. Constraints and costs to the economy
Over the past decade, slow growth in the infrastructure capital stock, in a context of high
economic and vehicle fleet growth, has contributed to serious congestion problems and poor
logistics performance, seriously undermining productivity growth, competitiveness and
poverty reduction efforts. Problems with transportation are among the worst business constraints
for manufacturing firms: about 25 percent of Indonesian have no access to reliable power and only
16 percent of urban dwellers have access to piped water. Indonesia spends over 24 percent of its GDP
on logistics—moving goods into, out of, and around the country. If Indonesia was only as efficient as
Thailand, the economy would save USD 80 billion annually in reduced logistics cost.
The under-investment in infrastructure has been massive as energy subsidies have crowded
out public spending in infrastructure. Total infrastructure investment—that is, investment by the
central government, sub-national governments, state-owned enterprises and the private sector—has
remained at only 3 to 4 percent of GDP over the past decade. This is far below the rates of above 7
percent of GDP before the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the 10 percent and 7.5 percent spent by
China and India, respectively. In 2012, spending on energy subsidies claimed more than one-fifth of
the central government’s budget, more than three times the allocation for infrastructure such as roads,
water, electricity and irrigation networks, and three times government-wide spending on health.


                                                     47
Past efforts to increase infrastructure spending have been hampered by regulatory bottlenecks
and governance issues. For the past 10 years, the outcomes on infrastructure investment have been
unrelated to the amount invested. In roads, for example, a six-fold increase in spending resulted in
only 20 percent more kilometers of roadway (see Section III, 3.2 for more examples). A maze of poor
regulations, coupled with the use of public policy for personal gain, has made it extraordinarily difficult
to deliver on large-scale infrastructure. It takes 930 days for even the state-owned power utility (PLN)
to obtain the permits needed to begin construction of a power station. Finally, realizing return on
investment will depend on how projects are implemented with efficient and cleaner procurement,
attention to planning and project management, and tackling chronic issues of corruption.
4.2.2. Poor business environment
4.2.2.1. Constraints and costs to the economy
High cost of doing business and regulatory uncertainty
Investment in Indonesia is constrained by the fact that the processes for firms, both large and small,
to register their operations and obtain the necessary licenses are complicated, expensive and time-
consuming.42 It takes 52.5 days to start a business in Indonesia compared with only 5.5 and 2.5 days
in Malaysia and Singapore, respectively. For example, obtaining the licenses necessary to start a new
business in manufacturing takes 794 days by law, although actual implementation can be slower still.
Within the energy sector, investors report that obtaining the various permits and licenses needed to
establish a power plant can take over 4 years. Construction permits, paying taxes, and enforcing
contracts are among the bottom 40 percent’s most cumbersome procedures in the world. Obtaining
permits and licenses to operate in certain sectors can take years (e.g., more than 3 years to obtain all
the licenses needed for an independent power producer).
The weak business environment is reflected, for example, in the World Bank Group’s Doing Business
rankings. Indonesia is currently at 114th place (out of 189 economies). This performance is below the
regional average and its peer countries’ performance: the Philippines, China, Thailand, and Malaysia
ranked 95th, 90th, 26th, and 18th, respectively. Indonesia’s overall performance is only slightly better
than India and Cambodia.
Finally, regulations governing investment and trade are restrictive, inconsistent and fluctuant. It is hard
to imagine how private investment and growth can reach 6 percent if these issues are not addressed.
Capital markets
There is ample evidence that enterprises in Indonesia are severely credit constrained. The
MSME financing gap is estimated at USD 330 billion, out of which USD 240 billion is in the
agricultural sector. Firms tend to rely more on retained earnings than on bank credit for the expansion
of their activities, which in turn means that current cash flow becomes the major factor in investment
decisions. This constrains private sector investment considerably across the economy, and most
damagingly in innovative firms that would be introducing productivity-raising trends, but usually have

     Businesses in 243 Regencies/Cities in Indonesia.”, and Nurridzki, N., 2010, “Pilot Study: Mapping and

negative cash flow in the early stages of operation. In addition to the growth and productivity
implications of credit constraints, there is a poverty and shared prosperity implication of constraining
available funding to profitable and innovative micro-entrepreneurs, as well.
This state of affairs reflects Indonesia’s very under-developed financial market. In total, there
are about 120 commercial banks and more than 1,600 rural banks, which accounted for 78.6 percent
of financial system assets in 2014, with significant concentration of banking sector assets and the
deposit base in the top 20 banks and specifically in the three (state-owned) banks. Despite its size, the
Indonesian banking sector claims on the private sector stand at only one third compared with close
to 100 percent on average in Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines.
Past strong growth of bank loans and an increased loan-to-deposit ratio have not been
sustained for long enough to lift the ratio of bank loans to GDP from a relative low at around
45 percent. In the next few years unless growth of deposits picks up significantly, bank loan growth
will remain soft, spelling credit constraints for the business sector going forward. Moreover, bank
loans have been largely provided to large enterprises and not to MSMEs, which are the source of 97
percent of employment and 57 percent of value-added in the economy. The share of loans to MSMEs
over total bank loans was around 20 percent at 2014, up from 16 percent in 2013 but still low.

Indonesia also faces low levels of financial inclusion, which can undermine poverty alleviation
and affect the near-poor as well. The World Bank’s Global Findex survey found that in 2011 only
about 20 percent of Indonesian adults held an account at a formal institution. This number is only 16
percent in rural areas, and even less for the poorest 40 percent of the adult population. Exclusion
from the formal financial sector has been shown broadly to intensify income inequality, as the
“unbanked” pay higher costs for financial services or are unable to invest, consume or plan adequately
for lifecycle risks. A further feedback effect takes the financially excluded to traditional, lower


                                                   49
productivity sectors, as moving in search of a productivity-improving innovation entails risks that a
poor or near-poor household can ill afford to incur.
Geography and low levels of financial literacy are particular challenges for financial inclusion
in Indonesia. Access to financial services in regional and remote areas is poor. According to Bank
Indonesia, one bank office serves 15,992 people compared with an average of 3,745 adults per branch
in high income countries and an average of 12,000 adults per branch in the EAP region. According to
an OJK 2013 survey, only 21 percent of Indonesians have the knowledge, skills and confidence to say
they understand their financial products and services in full. But studies also found that financial
inclusion in Indonesia is a multidimensional problem, also involving a lack of physical access,
transaction costs, income level, education, lack of identification documents, and socio-economic
factors.

There is significant potential to expand financial access through digitizing social transfers,
remittances and supply chain payments, given Indonesia’s high level (80 percent or 143
million) of unbanked population. Both volume and value of annual transactions of e-money more
than doubled in 2012 and increased by over half in the following year. In 2014, the introduction of
revised e-money and branchless banking regulations created new service delivery opportunities
through agent networks, with initial data showing very promising increases by clienteles of individual
banks (an update of the national figures would only be available in May 2015). Basic uniform micro-
insurance products developed and jointly offered by groups of micro-insurance providers have also
exhibited rapid penetration rates.
Labor markets
While there are many important labor market issues that interfere with the objective of
achieving shared prosperity, there is one that imposes high costs to firms and impedes formal
employment and productivity growth: the severance pay provisions. In 2003, the Government
introduced a Labor Law that significantly improved workers’ rights and made hiring more flexible.
However, the law made it more costly to fire workers. In particular, the provision mandating that


                                                                 50
severance pay should be at least 100 weeks of wages is considered an example of the unintended
distortions in the labor market that can be caused by well-intentioned regulation. The majority of
companies adjust to the high severance pay provision by either not formally signing a contract for
workers (only 23 percent of all firms do) or resorting to short-term contracts that by law are capped
at 3 years. Hiring formal workers is discouraged. At the same time, when a worker decides to
voluntarily quit a company, only a part of the severance pay is paid. The system creates an incentive
for employers to go informal and for workers to be fired: a “lose-lose” equilibrium.
The minimum wage setting process is another critical labor market issue. Indonesia followed
a prudent minimum wage setting policy for most of the past decade or so but, since 2010, there has
been a significant departure from the moderate pace in minimum wage increases (as seen in Chapter
1). In 2013, 25 provinces increased their minimum wage by an average 30 percent and Jakarta increased
its minimum wage by 44 percent. This increase certainly significantly reduced Indonesia’s nominal
wage advantage vis-à-vis China, as China’s average labor productivity is indeed much higher than
Indonesia’s. Indonesian formal labor-intensive firms in manufacturing and services seem however
more concerned about the uncertainty surrounding the minimum wage setting process and the threat
of future high increases.
However, in practice, the percentage of workers to which the minimum wage legislation
applies is very small. This reflects three inter-related factors: (i) many workers are self-employed,
with 61 percent of workers declaring themselves self-employed in 2011; (ii) about 54 percent of
workers operate in the informal sector and over 80 percent of workers (including formal) do not have
a contract; and (iii) government capacity to enforce compliance with minimum wage legislation is
limited. Compliance enforcement requires coordination at the central level, between the Ministry of
Manpower and relevant ministries, as well as between central and local governments and relevant
actors (district heads and wage councils).
Although the labor legislation provisions such as severance pay and the minimum wage do
not affect the majority of workers in Indonesia, they can impede productivity growth and the
structural transformation through various mechanisms. For instance, workers’ movement into
formal sectors is constrained as: (i) workers who want to move are not compensated fully for severance
by employers if they leave voluntarily; and (ii) employers in the formal sectors account for the high
potential cost of dismissal and the uncertainty around minimum wage increases when making hiring
decision. As result, movement of workers occurs mostly between informal and semi-formal
companies. This may explain why agriculture still employs 35 percent of workers, while the
contribution of this sector to GDP has declined to 11 percent. It also explains why the overwhelming
majority of workers in services sector are in low-end, low-productivity, informal activities. In addition
to undermining movement of workers to formal sectors, uncertainties around the trajectory minimum
wage are a deterrent to investment in formal sectors, in particular in manufacturing.
4.2.3. Skills shortages and mismatches
4.2.3.1. Constraints and costs to the economy
Despite a major increase in public investment in education and greater coverage, the skills
gap for meeting the needs of the private sector and to enhance job opportunities to increase
incomes remains large in Indonesia. Indonesia compares unfavorably with other middle-income
economies and East Asian neighbors in learning assessments such as PISA. For instance, 15-year-old
students in Indonesia have learning levels far below their peers in Vietnam, even though per-capita


                                                   51
income is higher. Two-thirds of firms complain that finding suitable employees for professional and
managerial positions is either “difficult” or “very difficult”; and almost 70 percent of employers in
manufacturing report finding it “very difficult” to fill skilled professional-level positions (i.e.,
engineers). In order to expand workers’ entry into manufacturing and high-end services (e.g., finance,
business services, communications, etc.)—once again crucial for productivity growth—these issues
need to be addressed.
The growth payoff of skills development is large, if difficult to quantify. Because more than
60 percent of Indonesian firms report that skills are a constraint, relaxing this constraint can
help them expand and become more competitive. Today, the majority of tertiary graduates work
in the public sector. Going forward, skills development is likely to increase the flow of graduates
employable in the private sector where the focus is arguably more on specific skills than diplomas
(contrary to the public sector). This could thus increase aggregate productivity and growth through
“within sector” productivity growth (e.g., new workers in manufacturing and high-end services
equipped with more skills) and/or labor movement from low-end services to manufacturing (e.g.,
workers from low-end services moving to manufacturing thanks to adequate training). Developing
skills should also help Indonesia leverage the opportunities to increase middle-class demand and
withstand competition from ASEAN partners. Without the right skill sets among those entering the
workforce, imports may remain more competitive than domestic production in satisfying the demand
for higher quality products and services from Indonesia’s growing middle-class.
4.2.4. The constraints imposed by agricultural policies
The above constraints have severely constrained all productive sectors. In agriculture, their
effects have been exacerbated by particular weaknesses in agricultural policies. With rising
incomes and urbanization food consumption and expenditure patterns are shifting to higher value and
processed foods, posing both challenges and opportunities. Between 1998 and 2013, animal product
consumption more than doubled while the consumption of cereals declined. Over the same period,
the share of processed foods in urban food expenditures rose from 15 percent to more than 30
percent. By 2030, the value of domestic demand for fish, milk, meat and fruits (USD 47 billion) is
expected to be nearly twice the aggregate value for cereals and rice (USD 25 billion). This changing
diet poses challenges related to bio-security and logistics, yet also offers major opportunities for
Indonesian farmers, manufacturers, and service companies.
Current agricultural policies continue to focus on achieving self-sufficiency in rice, maize,
and sugar based upon fertilizer and other subsidies, a narrow focus on the country’s irrigation
infrastructure, and restricted trade. While Indonesia’s rice and maize imports have been held in
check, the wider results of this ‘food sovereignty’ policy have not been encouraging. From 2009 to
2014, Indonesian’s average rice consumer prices (USD 0.67/kg) were 30-50 percent higher than in
some regional countries (wholesale prices: USD 0.47/kg in Thailand, and USD 0.40/kg in Vietnam).
During this period, overall consumer food price inflation was considerably higher than that in the
region’s other middle-income countries. Fertilizer subsidies (accounting for one-third of central
government agricultural spending in 2008-12) have contributed modestly to cereal crop productivity,
but have had little impact on smallholder profitability and competitiveness. In 2013, profits of an
average rice farm (0.3 ha) in West Java were 13 times smaller than in an average farm (2.5 ha) in
Suphan Buri (Thailand), while production costs were 14 percent higher. And, increased cereal self-
sufficiency has not translated into improved nutritional outcomes. Indonesia faces the ‘double burden
of malnutrition’ with comparatively high rates of child stunting and child obesity, and with little
progress observed in nutrition indicators since the mid-2000s. Imports of processed and higher-value


                                                 52
foods have increased rapidly and, in 2013, at USD 8.9 billion, accounted for 70 percent of Indonesia’s
food imports.

4.3. Pathway II: Binding Constraints to Service Delivery to All
While access to good jobs is the key pathway out of poverty and vulnerability, it is not
sufficient to ensure shared prosperity. In Indonesia, a large number of households classified as
non-poor are poor in many “non-income” dimensions, including access to decent housing,
transportation, water, sanitation, health and education. Clearly, greater income and prosperity do not
translate fully into enhanced living standards as long as access to key services is not improved. This
sub-section discusses the key issues around quality of public spending in Indonesia, starting with fiscal
choices and access to key services in urban and rural areas, and then going on to look at the fiscal
incidence of government expenditure and taxes at the household level.
4.3.1. Constraints from the overall fiscal picture and composition of public spending
Prudent fiscal management has helped Indonesia maintain macro stability. Over the past
decade, stable growth has gone hand-in-hand with low fiscal deficits (1.4 percent of GDP, on average,
during 2001-14) and rapidly declining public debt (from 100 percent of GDP in 1999 to 24.9 percent
in 2014). By law, the fiscal deficit for general government has been capped at 3 percent of GDP since
2003. Prudent fiscal management, in conjunction with coherent monetary and exchange rate policies,
has allowed Indonesia to weather a range of external shocks, including the 2008 global financial crisis,
and maintain relatively high and stable growth over the past decade.
However, fiscal policy has faced important

oil and gas production, which accounted for 20
percent of the total (3 percent of GDP) revenue in 2014, are projected to decline sharply, imposing
further challenges to fiscal policy. In short, with revenue collection way below its potential and the
rule limiting fiscal deficits to 3 percent of GDP, Indonesia’s fiscal sector has remained smaller than it
should have done, implying sub-optimal levels of public expenditure (basically with a revenue-to-GDP
ratio of 15.2 percent, public spending is capped at 18 percent of GDP). As discussed in Section VI,
there is a pressing need to devise a sound medium-term strategy to collect more revenues to finance
the new Government’s ambitious development targets.

Large energy subsidies have crowded out public spending on infrastructure and social
programs, constraining shared prosperity. In 2012, spending on energy subsidies accounted for
more than one-fifth of the central government’s budget, more than three times the allocation for
infrastructure such as roads, water, electricity and irrigation networks, and three times government-
wide spending on health. The recent energy subsidy reforms have opened space for larger spending
in these long-neglected areas. With the new subsidy scheme the cost of fuel subsidies is projected to
fall sharply from 2.4 percent of GDP in 2014 to 0.6 percent of GDP in 2015. The projected fiscal
savings of nearly IDR 200 trillion, or about USD 16 billion, open the door to more productive
spending on infrastructure and health, particularly over the longer-term when rising fuel subsidy costs
would otherwise have crowded out such spending. (In the near term, the downward pressure on oil-
related revenues due to the fall in global oil space limits the increase in fiscal space.)

human capital remains largely unfinished. As Source: Ministry of Finance, Indonesia
regards     physical     infrastructure,   total
investment—that is, investment by the central government, sub-national governments, state-owned
enterprises and the private sector—has remained at only 3 to 4 percent of GDP over the past decade.
This is far below the rates of above 7 percent of GDP before the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis and
the 10 percent and 7.5 percent spent by China and India, respectively. Indonesia’s huge infrastructure
gap translates into massive congestion on the country’s roads, ports, the telecom networks, etc., clearly
constraining growth and shared prosperity.
The accumulation of human capital would have been stronger if Indonesia’s bold
constitutional decision to allocate 20 percent of the budget to education had been
accompanied by adequate funding for health. As seen above, while this commitment is paying off
in terms of enrollment and numbers of graduates, it has not yet turned around the quality of
education.43 In particular, there are significant disparities in educational opportunity in post basic
education where the labor market returns are higher and most of the recent growth in jobs has been
concentrated. The building of strong human capital is, however, more constrained by under-spending
in health and inadequate health indicators. In 2012, total government outlays for health were only 1.0
percent of GDP. This is the fifth-lowest health spending-to-GDP ratio out of the 188 countries for
which data are available: only South Sudan, Pakistan, Chad and Myanmar had lower ratios. While

indicators in many areas. As mentioned earlier, despite significant progress in infant and child

services, including infrastructure, health, and education. To date, sub-national government spending
has been excessively dominated by spending on administration over productive sectors and on
personnel over maintenance and capital spending. Improving the “allocative” efficiency of local
government budgets by reallocating more resources to front-line service delivery will be an important
step in improving the rural population’s access to basic services (see Section V, 2.2).45

4.3.2. Constraints from budget execution and service delivery
Ensuring good quality in public spending also requires ensuring that public spending inputs
(e.g., public spending on health) efficiently lead to good outputs (e.g., health clinics, nurses
and equipment) and effectively yield desirable outcomes (e.g., access to health care, low
maternal mortality rates, etc.). To achieve shared prosperity, public money should be allocated to
the right areas (e.g., roads versus energy subsidies) and effectively deployed to benefit people, which
requires an effective, non-corrupt bureaucracy. Ineffective delivery of services reduces the amount of
in-kind services received and tends to increase out-of-pocket spending, with possible impacts on
poverty levels.

A suite of public expenditure reviews (PERs) published by the World Bank in recent years
reveals a general picture of poor quality of spending in Indonesia.46 Overall, where spending has
been increased, improvements in outputs and intermediate outcomes have been disappointing. The
following provide a few examples:

     •   In the roads sector (40 percent of infrastructure spending), public spending has returned to
         the pre-crisis level, driven by investments by sub-national governments. Despite this, access
         to transport services and the quality of road networks in Indonesia remain inadequate and lag
         neighboring countries. According to household surveys, 26 percent of urban residents have
         poor access to transport services and many cities in Indonesia fail to invest enough in
         infrastructure to keep pace with the increasing demands of rapidly growing cities.47

     •   In education, a tripling of spending over the past decade has mostly gone to teacher salaries
         due to acceleration in teacher hiring (now Indonesia has one of the lowest student-teacher
         ratios in the world) and teacher certification (salaries doubled for certified teachers). However,
         this has not led to better educational outcomes as measured by student performance indicators
         such as PISA. More than half of teachers do not meet minimum competency levels and
         Indonesia’s student learning outcomes in reading, math and science remain low compared
         with other countries and have seen no improvement over the past decade. Forty percent of
         15-year-olds are below the lowest competency level in math. Examples of where local

        governments should invest more or invest more wisely include non-salary spending (e.g.,
        through greater support to teacher professional development and school grants).

    •   In agriculture, public spending on agriculture has increased substantially in recent years, but
        had gone to private input subsidies (e.g., fertilizer, seeds, credit) rather than public goods (e.g.,
        irrigation schemes, research and extension). Furthermore, fertilizer subsidies are regressive,
        with 60 percent of the subsidies benefiting the 40 percent largest farmer. These
        larger/wealthier rice farmers that use more urea therefore capture a larger share of the
        subsidies. The bottom 40 percent of farmers receive only 21 percent of the subsidy envelop.
The examples above show that intra-sectoral allocation and local service delivery issues (i.e.,
how well spending is translated into outputs and desirable outcomes in a sustainable manner)
are as important as “money” in supporting the twin goals. With the advent of decentralization
in 2001, the effectiveness and efficiency of the delivery of services has become highly constrained by
complex coordination issues, and weak management capacities and accountability frameworks linked
with the production of public services. For instance, provincial and district roads now account for
over 80 percent of Indonesia’s total road network. Thus any project cutting across district boundaries
requires lengthy consultations, discussions and coordination. For instance, in water and sanitation, the
central government’s increased spending in water resources management and water treatment plants
has not been well synchronized with local water utility companies’ investments to connect households
to the piped-water systems.

quality of spending. However, the extent to            50

acquisition for new infrastructure projects.
Execution problems constrain actual spending and in turn the achievement of development objectives
for improving the supply and quality of infrastructure services. In recent years, the execution rates of
capital expenditure, most of which is for infrastructure, have been well below budgeted levels,
averaging 90 percent of the Budget, or 86 percent of the revised Budget between 2010 and 2014. In
2014, capital spending fell far short of the budgeted amounts, disbursing only 73 percent of the Budget
and 84 percent of the revised Budget, with spending contracting sharply in nominal terms from 2013,
by 26 percent.




                                                    57
These weaknesses in inter-governmental coordination, combined with regulatory bottlenecks
and land acquisition challenges, have also strongly discouraged private sector participation
to local service delivery.
    • For instance, in the education sector, one of the biggest challenges is that regulations require
        a foundation type of legal ownership structure for educational institutions, precluding for-
        profit investors from entering the market to deliver education services.
    • In the health sector, foreign investment is not allowed for hospitals below 200 beds. At the
        same time, the deployment of private investments to build hospitals above 200 beds is severely
        constrained by a limited availability of trained domestic doctors and nurses as foreign doctors
        and medical staff are not allowed to provide services in Indonesia.
    • In the transport and water sectors, in 2009, the Government identified 58 projects spanning
        11 different areas including toll roads, maritime transportation and water resources, to be
        implemented in 2010-15 through PPP schemes. The estimated total value of these projects
        was USD 51.2 billion (PPP source book 2012). However, by 2012, only three projects were
        considered “ready for offer”, whereas 26 projects were categorized as “priority” and 29 as
        “potential PPP projects”.
4.3.3. Effectiveness of fiscal policies in reducing poverty
In Indonesia, the bottom 40 percent receives far less from government spending than the rich
in absolute terms, although the little they do receive represents a large share of their (low)
incomes. In Indonesia in 2012, the rich received far more government spending than the poor and
bottom 40 percent, although they also paid more taxes and user fees associated with health and
education (Figure 4.9). However, while the poor and bottom 40 percent received far fewer benefits
in absolute terms, the benefits they do receive represent a far greater share of their market income
(around 30 percent on average), because their incomes are so low (Figure 4.10). These findings are a
reminder that disparities in the quantity and quality of services delivered across geographical areas
affect out-of-pocket spending patterns, which in turn affect poverty levels. More and better in-kind
services (health, education, etc.) received by the poor would help them to direct more spending toward
food to improve their nutritional status, or to other areas that improve their welfare.

Despite significant transfers to the bottom 40 percent through education and, to a lesser
extent, subsidies, Indonesia’s fiscal policy does little to reduce poverty. The (few) benefits that
the poor receive from energy subsidies are offset by the indirect taxes they pay on consumption, such
as VAT and tobacco excise. Direct transfers (social assistance) do reduce the poverty rate, but only
by 1.3 percentage points.48 Nor does fiscal policy do much to reduce inequality. The consumption of
health and education spending does reduce the Gini coefficient by around 2.5 points, but this is minor
compared with countries in Latin America (Figure 4.11), which also reduce inequality significantly
through progressive income taxation, and wider and larger cash transfers.49

One of the reasons why Indonesia is less effective at using fiscal policy to reduce poverty and
boost shared prosperity is that it spends least on the programs that would be most effective
in reducing poverty and inequality. The programs that reduce the Gini coefficient by the most per
rupiah spent are conditional cash transfers for human capital (PKH) and school scholarship (BSM)
programs. However, these programs receive the least spending (Figure 4.12). At the same time, by far
the largest amount of spending—historically—has been on subsidies and education, which do little to
reduce inequality for the amount of money spent. That said, as seen in Section III, spending in
education is a key driver of lifetime mobility and a key way of reducing inequality in the long term.

     as most of the higher income households that pay income tax are missing from the household survey data.

Fuel subsidies consumed a significant share of public resources, but mainly benefited higher
income groups. Spending on fuel subsidies disproportionately benefits households at the top of the
income distribution: 84 percent of all benefits go to the top half of households by consumption, and
only 16 percent to the bottom half, while 40 percent of benefits go to the richest 10 percent of
households, and less than 1 percent to the poorest 10 percent. Moreover, around two-thirds of poor
and near-poor households do not consume any gasoline whatsoever, although the likelihood of them
consuming gasoline and the actual quantity consumed would rise if their income increased. In addition,
not only do the poor receive fewer benefits from fuel subsidies, they also are likely to suffer more
from the poor provision of infrastructure that is an indirect consequence of large energy subsidies:
they live in the areas that are most flood-prone and often have the greatest difficulty in accessing key
basic services.

4.3.4.2. Social assistance and protection
Greater social protection is needed to shield the vulnerable from shocks that push them into poverty,
while helping those beneath the poverty line to climb above it. This entails strengthening social
assistance programs and making the ongoing social security reforms effective and sustainable.
Social assistance
Since the Asian financial crisis in 1997/98, Indonesia has launched a series of safety net
programs that address a variety of risks that poor families face. Key programs include: (i) a rice
for the poor program (Raskin, see Section II, 2); (ii) a conditional cash transfer program to enhance
human capital (PKH); and (iii) a conditional cash transfer program providing scholarship to the poor
(BSM. Indonesia has a new targeting system in place to identify the poor and ensure that they receive
these benefits through a Unified Data Base (UDB), which includes both poor households and those
at the greatest risk of falling into poverty. All major programs are now using the UDB, although
continuous improvements in targeting are required. Household information needs to be appropriately
updated and validated, and a grievance and complaints system is an important next step. Still,
Indonesia lacks a formal crisis monitoring and response system with an automatic safety net that kicks
to protect households when significant shocks arise.
To enhance the impact Indonesia’s social assistance system, it is important to reform the
current system by spending more on the programs that work well, revisit the adequacy of


                                                                 60
benefit levels and fill in gaps in the net. Improving the system will likely require far more resources
than are currently spent by the Government, at roughly 0.5 percent of GDP on social assistance. Other
large middle-income countries spend, on average, three times as much on these programs. Central
government social spending is currently distributed among roughly 12 ministries, 22 programs, and
87 activities, such that oversight and coordination plays a crucial role in devising the poverty assistance
strategy, integrating poverty programs and coordinating implementation with various ministries.
Proven programs should also be expanded. The human capital conditional cash transfer
program (PKH), for instance, was introduced to 810,000 households in 2007 and has since
been expanded to cover 2.4 million households across 33 provinces. Although plans are in place
to roll the program out to 3.2 million households, PKH will only cover 5 percent of Indonesian
households. Conditional cash transfers like PKH have proven effective in reducing poverty and
inequality in Mexico (Progresa/Oportunidades) and Brazil (Bolsa Familia), but these programs cover
around a quarter of the population.
Program benefit levels need to adequately address the risks they are targeting. There is already
evidence that benefit levels for some programs are not adequate. For instance, the benefits of the
education conditional cash transfer (BSM) typically do not address many important ancillary costs
(e.g., the cost of transport or books) that are incurred by a household choosing to send children to
primary or secondary school. The Government took positive steps by increasing benefits for BSM
and PKH in 2013 as part of the compensation package tied to the fuel subsidy reform. These benefit
levels need to increase in the future in line with rising education and health costs. Assistance also needs
to be received by poor and vulnerable households at the right time. Again, consider the BSM program
as an example. Although the program gives cash assistance to the poor to help them pay for
supplemental fees and other costs associated with educating children, the cash is sometimes received
after the school year has begun. This means that the poor still have to find ways to help cover school
costs that are incurred before the benefits are received. A good way to reform BSM and other
programs is to ensure that funds are provided to families at times that make sense.
Programs such as BSM and PKH cover many vulnerable households, but do not yet
adequately cover especially vulnerable groups. The elderly population is also at risk, especially at
a time when their ability to generate income is low. Similarly, people with disabilities often require
special support to enable them to attend schools, seek appropriate health care, and become an active
part of the workforce. Building a comprehensive social assistance system will require extending cash
assistance and in-kind assistance programs to serve these vulnerable groups.
Some risks facing Indonesia’s poor are not yet covered, leaving families exposed and
vulnerable. Indonesia does not provide adequate coverage for cognitive, nutrition and
psychosocial support for early childhood. An early childhood education and development program
should be piloted to address this critical gap in coverage at the earliest stage of the lifecycle. Also, the
Government currently lacks a program to protect families from temporary or longer-term
unemployment. Workfare programs could provide temporary employment opportunities to boost
household incomes, especially during crises for urban workers and between agricultural seasons for
rural workers.
For the Raskin program (rice distributed to the poor), moving to e-money for food purchases
by the poor could be considered as it eliminates all financial costs of tying up food stocks, the
"leakage" issues common in public food distribution, etc. International experience shows that
ensuring that the e-money is usable in private stores (and not only in public distribution sites) is


                                                    61
important. One advantage of the e-money system is to allow recipients to use the money or vouchers
to purchase fruits, vegetables and dairy products (not only rice), which all would be beneficial to
nutritional balance. For many of the poor the nutritional problem may not be a calorie one. Simply
adding more rice to the diet may not be the appropriate solution.
Social security
Because only 41 percent of the Bottom 40 percent are covered, Indonesia is committed to and
putting significant effort into attaining universal health coverage (UHC) by 2019. The country
launched a National Health Insurance Program in 2014 (JKN) and is making health insurance free for
the poorest 40 percent of the population—a key policy of the administration of President Joko
Widodo (“Jokowi”).50 UHC could be instrumental to boosting shared prosperity and reducing poverty
in Indonesia, where 93 million Indonesians (40 percent of the population) live under USD 2 per day
and where inequality is also rising.
Lack of supply-side readiness is key challenge to attaining UHC, which could ultimately
make the UHC an empty promise. Health facilities are generally ill-equipped with the physical and
human resources necessary to provide the basic services required by law. In fact, there is not one
primary health facility in Indonesia (Puskesmas) that has all the required general service readiness items.
There is substantial variation in service readiness across regions with acute deficits in medicines and
diagnostics in most locations. Achieving UHC thus requires spending more in health, particularly on
supply-side readiness, and spending better by improving local service delivery. The Government only
spends 1.2 percent of GDP in health, the fifth lowest ratio in the world. This low level of spending
remains after health spending has tripled in the past decade. Results are limited and there is no
correlation between the adequacy of health services and health spending per capita across regions.
Local governments have poor capacity to deliver services and are weakly accountable to central
government and their citizens.
To be effective and sustainable, the UHC program will require appropriate benefit levels,
sound fiscal risk management, sound institutional development and management, and non-
contributory coverage of the poor and vulnerable, while at the same time collecting
contributions from those who can afford to pay. Strong leadership is required for implementation
due to the large number of stakeholders with diverging interests, the significant impact of these
programs to the social structure of the country, and the significant potential impact on the state
budget, the labor market and the macro economy. It is crucial to develop a roadmap outlining
activities, roles and responsibilities to ensure smooth, effective transformation, and to monitor the
progress of the implementation.
The Social Security Organizing Agency (BPJS) Law improves the legal, governance and
financial structure of the social insurance system by legally separating the assets of the
administrators from the assets of the social security funds that they manage. The separation of
assets into different legal entities and the use of a custodian to hold fund assets are important
safeguards for fund members and are consistent with international best practice. However, it will be
a significant challenge to ensure that the legal structure is properly implemented and the system
operates as intended. To ensure assets are managed correctly, the Government will need to issue
investment and risk management regulations defining the financial framework and governance

50   The other components of the social security reforms comprise universal employment insurance coverage by July
     2015 and an important institutional overhaul to reduce the fragmentation of the social security system.


                                                           62
structure of the new system. It should be noted that different investment policies and fee structures
are appropriate for different funds, and it will be necessary to ensure the integration of reserves,
investment policy and asset-liability management for each fund.
It is important for the Government to formulate and implement policies and procedures to
ensure the fiscal sustainability of the National Social Security System (SJSN) social insurance
funds and to ensure that the financial risks of the SJSN are properly managed. If the
contribution rates are set too low relative to promised benefits, or if the contributions and/or benefits
are not periodically adjusted, or if program funds are mismanaged, the social security funds could
become insolvent and require significant budget transfers. Above all, integrated systems and
operations for the BPJS are a must to avoid the inefficiencies of having separate ID numbers and
contributions collection processes for the same participants.
SJSN implementation creates a potentially large contingent liability for the state budget,
which is the ultimate guarantor of fund solvency. Consequently, the Government has a strong
incentive to ensure that the programs are properly managed. This will require the creation of risk
management capability within the Government and strong supervision and control of BPJS operations
to protect the rights of participants, prevent fraud and corruption, ensure proper financial
management, and control operational expenses. Good governance and oversight of the system is
critical given the huge amounts of money that will flow into the five funds and the critical role that
these programs will play in the country’s social protection system, and greater clarity in the respective
roles and functions of the various institutions is critical. The collection of contributions raises another
set of concerns. While contribution collection mechanisms for salaried workers are already available,
there is no such mechanism available for non-salaried workers. Effective collection from non-salaried
workers is needed to ensure high levels of participation from that sector, and to avoid the significant
anti-selection that will occur if only those with high risk choose to join the SJSN programs. The
Government will need to study a wide range of possible collection mechanisms, examine other
countries’ experience and pilot test possible options for collecting contributions from non-salaried
workers. Finally as noted above, the effectiveness of the universal health insurance element of the
system will require substantial upgrading of the health system to ensure supply, particularly to the poor
and vulnerable.

4.4. Pathway III: Binding Constraints to Better Management of Natural Resources
Poverty reduction in forest and coastal areas cannot be addressed solely by the first two
pathways and requires, in addition, improved governance and management of natural
resources in Indonesia. Indeed, natural resource activities directly affect local communities, through
employment generation, access to the resources and the environmental impact of operations. Over
the past few decades, the overexploitation and poor governance of Indonesia’s forests, marine and
other natural resources have had high social and environment costs. People living in forest and coastal
areas, who depend on climate-sensitive livelihoods, and live and work in areas susceptible to drought,
flooding and landslides, bore much of these costs. The high level of poverty in these areas is linked to
the poor governance of Indonesia’s natural resource sectors in past decades.
4.4.1. The poverty cost of poor forest resource management
Indonesia’s forest capital wealth is one of the most valuable in the world and yet, as seen in
Section 1, the population living in and on the edge of forests is the poorest in Indonesia.
Indonesia’s natural and planted forest area is estimated at 94 million hectares, i.e., over a half of the


                                                    63
country’s land cover. Thirty two million people live in forest areas. Of these, 6.3 million are poor. That
is, the poverty rate in these areas is 19.6 percent, the highest in the country and way above the national
average poverty rate of 11.3 percent. Populations in forest area account for one-fifth of all the poor
in Indonesia. Village surveys (PODES) show that in 2012, only 12 percent of forest villages had
maternity facilities and midwives, 38 percent of them had a primary school within 6km, and only 8
percent of them had a secondary school.
The high level of poverty in forest areas reflects many factors, including rapid degradation of
natural resources, lack of access rights to land for local communities and poor access to health
and education services. Indonesia’s strategy to manage forests through concessions and through
centralized management structures without local monitoring and ownership has resulted in
overexploitation of forest assets and uses of the resource that neither benefit the poor, nor create
economic value. Indeed, local communities’ land access rights are limited and community forestry
license programs have not achieved their targets. Traditional customary communities (adat), which
occupy more than 30 million ha of forest lands, have no formal land rights, which might now change
due to favorable constitutional counter-decisions. At the same time, the allocation of concessions for
timber, pulp and paper production and, increasingly, oil palm plantations, is opaque while the
enforcement of spatial and environmental planning is ineffective. As a result, the deforestation rate is
rapid, and is a key source of loss of livelihoods for local communities as a large part of their income
depends on forest resources. The FAO estimates that 25 percent of the forest cover was lost between
1990 and 2010, primarily in biodiversity-rich primary forests. Consistent with the FAO number, the
UNFCCC estimates that annual deforestation and degradation are 670,000 ha/year and 425,000
ha/year, respectively (UNFCCC, 2014). Deforestation results from many factors, including significant
growth in oil palm plantations, mining production and urbanization), as well as substantial governance
issues in land-use licensing and law enforcement processes. Almost 42 million ha of forest dedicated
to production are no longer under concession.
Deforestation over the past decade has also been accompanied by widespread forest and peat
land fires, with high economic, social and environment costs. Indonesia has experienced annual
large-scale forest and land fires since 1982, but with increasing scale and regularity in recent years.
These fires are triggered by land preparation for agriculture, illegal logging, insecure land tenure of the
community, and land speculation. Such forest fires impose significant economic and social, as well as
environmental, costs. The total damage and losses caused by these fires in the period between
February and April, 2014, was USD 935 million in the province of Riau.51
4.4.2. The poverty cost of poor management of marine and coastal resources
Indonesia’s marine resource wealth is one of richest in the world. Indonesia is home to the
largest mangrove and sea-grass ecosystems in the world. The country’s coral reefs span more than 5.1
million ha, representing 18 percent of the world’s coral reefs.15 Nearly a quarter of the world’s
mangrove forests (22.6 percent of global mangroves) are in Indonesia. The country totals about 3.3
million ha of sea-grass, the largest in the world. Yet, as seen in Section II, the average poverty level
of people living in coastal areas is the second highest in Indonesia even if the country’s rich coastal
and marine resources have provided local inhabitants with food and income for centuries.
The high level of poverty of individuals living in coastal areas is, to a large extent, due to poor
management of coastal and marine resources. Coastal communities depend on healthy marine

and coastal ecosystems for essential goods such as food, fuel wood, shelter and clean water, and their
fate is tied to the management of these resources. However, marine and coastal ecosystems are
deteriorating rapidly across Indonesia. Coastal deforestation, water pollution and overfishing have
reached a level that threatens the sustainable capacity of coastal and marine ecosystems to support the
future economic development of Indonesia. According to recent estimates by the Ministry of Maritime
Affairs and Fisheries’ (MMAF) Directorate of Fisheries Resources, the majority of fisheries in 7 of
Indonesia’s 11 fisheries management areas are already fully exploited. Furthermore, close to 65
percent of Indonesia’s coral reefs are considered threatened from overfishing, and almost half are
considered threatened specifically from destructive fishing practices. Finally, more than 40 percent of
Indonesia’s mangroves have already been lost. As a result of these degradations about 58 percent of
the population in Java lives in water insecure areas, as water and soil pollution levels (mercury and
lead) are among the highest in the world. These problems have been aggravated by many natural
disasters, including tsunamis, hurricanes, global warming and their concomitant effects.
Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing results in massive losses of revenues and
affects indirectly poverty levels of communities living in coastal areas. The Government
estimates that as much as USD 20 billion worth of maritime resources per year are stolen by dubious
foreign and local fishing companies, who pay bribes to relevant law enforcers to look the other way.
Compared with last year’s revenues of under USD 4 billion from vessels with a license to fish, the
magnitude of this revenue loss is huge. An estimated 4,800 foreign boats fish illegally in Indonesian
waters each year. The new Government has indicated a strong commitment to fight illegal fishing
through more effective law enforcement. Reduction in illegal fishing can in principle lead to significant
increases in domestic supply of fish, as well as increased prices, which bodes well for increasing local
fishermen’s incomes.
4.4.3. Costs and risks due with environment degradation and climate change
Indonesia ranks among the top GHG emitting countries of the world. The greenhouse gas
(GHG) emission intensity of Indonesia’s GDP remains relatively high compared with regional peers,
reflecting not only the structure of the economy but also the composition of the energy sources
available. Estimates suggest that roughly two thirds of Indonesia’s GHG emissions originate from
land use changes and peat degradation, although fossil-fuel emissions are also rising steeply. The
expansion of oil palm is responsible for GHG emissions where new plantations replace natural and/or
forest habitats, including primary forests, and are planted on deep peat which, once drained for
agricultural purposes, dries up and becomes vulnerable to fires. Eventually, those areas subside,
become flooded and lead to productivity losses. Overall, outdoor and indoor (cooking) air pollution
generates negative health impacts that cost an estimated at USD 4.6 billion per year, or about 1.6
percent of the country’s gross national income in 2008.
The increasing trend in Indonesia’s             Figure 4.14: Sources of CO2 emissions
GHG emissions, driven by commodity
expansion and poor governance, may
be exacerbated by major demographic
changes currently underway and expected

every year; (ii) rapid urbanization, with 65

in urban areas by 2050; and (iii) changing socioeconomic composition, with the middle class rising in
size and influence.
As an equatorial and archipelagic country, Indonesia is expected to begin experiencing
significant impacts from climate change over the next 20 years. However, little has been done
to date to put together a systematic approach aimed at adaptation (Box 4.1).
Box 4.1: Estimated impacts of climate change on SEA, including Indonesia
 Heat extremes: Unprecedented heat extremes are expected to 30-40 percent of land area during boreal summer by
 2040s. Strongest increase is expected in Indonesia and the southern Philippines, with roughly half of summer
 months experiencing unprecedented heat.
 Sea-level rise: For Southeast Asian coastlines, projections of sea-level rise by the end of the 21st century relative to
 1986-2005 are generally 10-15 percent higher than the global mean. The analysis for Manila, Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh
 City, and Bangkok indicates that regional sea-level rise is likely to exceed 50 cm above current levels by about 2060.
 Coral reef loss and degradation: Severe impacts for marine fisheries and tourism. Increasing sea surface
 temperatures have already led to major, damaging coral bleaching events in the last few decades. Under 1.5°C
 warming and increasing ocean acidification, there is a high risk (50 percent probability) of annual bleaching events
 occurring as early as 2030 in the region.
 “Turn Down the Heat: Climate Extremes, Regional Impacts, and the Case for Resilience”, June 2013, a report for
 the World Bank by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Climate Analytics


The changing climate will hurt the poor, especially those who live at flood threatened
degraded coastal zones, as well as potentially high-productivity sectors that create
employment, such as tourism. Coral reefs are under threat because of rising sea temperatures, while
subsiding peat domes and the destruction of mangrove forest will not only have negative impacts on
vulnerability of coastal zones to disasters, but have also impacts on livelihood of the poor. The Asian
Development Bank (ADB, 2009) projects that by the end of the century climate change will cost
Indonesia between 2.5 and 7 percent of GDP.
4.4.4. Management of disaster risks and building resilience
Finally, with high levels of vulnerability, Indonesia’s hard fought efforts to reduce poverty are
constantly under threat from shocks. Enhanced social protection can reduce the likelihood of sliding
back into poverty for the bottom 40 percent and strengthened disaster management can help to
mitigate shocks from natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, floods,
landslides and forest fires.
Given the experiences in Aceh and more recently Yogyakarta, there is broad public support
for improving preparation and response to natural disaster. Safeguarding hard-fought poverty
reduction in Indonesia calls for continuously enhancing the management of disaster risks and further
building resilience. Indonesia is indeed situated in one of the world’s most active disaster hot spots,
where several types of disaster, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, floods, landslides,
droughts and forest fires, frequently occur. According to a global risk analysis by the World Bank,
Indonesia is among the top 35 countries that have high mortality risks from multiple hazards. About
40 percent of the population is at risk, that is, more than 90 million lives. Going forward, the increase
in population and assets exposed to natural disasters, combined with the rise in the number and
intensity of hydro-meteorological events resulting from climate change, may further increase the
economic and human impact of natural disasters.



                                                             66
Indonesia’s cities’ resilience to natural disasters has weakened due to the rapid construction
of physical assets in urban areas and weak enforcement of building codes and zoning
regulations. Indonesia’s rapid and not always well-planned build-up of physical assets (buildings,
houses, etc.) in urban areas poses specific challenges to sustainability. Indonesian cities have seen a
rapid demand for urban housing and commercial space over the past decade. The private sector (real
estate and construction) has responded rapidly but rapid physical construction has often meant that
many new buildings have been built with less than ideal consideration to building codes. In addition,
in densely populated neighborhoods, site plans are typically constrained by a lack of available space to
maintain the proper functioning of urban ecosystems, such as drainage and open public spaces.
Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta, is particularly exposed, with urbanization-induced land subsidence posing
a bigger threat to the metropolitan area than climate change associated with rising sea levels.
Disaster impact on housing is a useful proxy for the degree of vulnerability. In the past 5 years,
the Government has spent between 20 and 50 percent of its reconstruction budget on housing. This
indicates not only the rise in the proportion of disaster impacts on urban assets, but also the actual
public investment for repairing assets, ideally with more stringent standards. Looking at the proportion
of the Government’s post-disaster spending between more urbanized and non-urban provinces, there
is also a tendency to spend more on more urbanized provinces. This is also an indication of the
disproportionate impact of disasters on urban versus non-urban assets (i.e., between permanent and
non-permanent structures).
While relatively low compared with the size of the national economy, the average annual cost
of natural disasters is significant at the sub-national level. Over the past 10 years, the annual
average cost of natural disasters in Indonesia is estimated at 0.3 percent of national GDP or USD 1.5
billion. The economic impact of the 2004 earthquake in the province of Aceh was estimated at USD4.5
billion i.e., 1 percent of national GDP, but that represented 54 percent of the provincial GDP.
Likewise, the 2006 earthquake in the province of Yogyakarta caused losses estimated at 30 percent of
provincial GDP. As Table 9.1 shows, the economic impact of recent disasters has been substantial at
the provincial level.
Preliminary fiscal disaster risk analysis suggests that the annual fiscal disaster losses are in the range of
USD 420-500 million and that once every 100 years these losses are close to USD 1.5-1.6 billion.
Using public spending data of past events, as estimated from the number of buildings destroyed and
damaged, to simulate possible future spending needs (or fiscal losses) related to natural disasters, it
can be estimated that in an average year the fiscal losses are estimated in the range of USD 420-
USD550. In every 10 years they could exceed USD 800-950 million, while every 100 years losses could
be in excess of USD 1.5-1.6 billion. These estimates provide indicative sizes of financial liability that
the Government may have to face should such events occur.
The rapid expansion in the physical assets of cities requires both a credible regulatory framework and
a healthy market that can translate this growth potential into preventive and risk-management
investments. Several concrete policy options can be considered to enable Indonesia to reap the full
benefits from urbanization, while leveraging growth to build more resilience. A national program on
hazardous micro-zoning providing detailed instruments for incorporating resilience into site design
and construction standards; financing framework for both urban, housing and property development
that incentivizes investment with built-in resilience linked to disaster insurance; and national program
on urban upgrading and ecosystem rehabilitation to increase the resilience of existing settlement and
urban infrastructure as part of the greening of Indonesia’s future growth.

            V. Reform Priorities and Cross-Cutting Pre-requisites
The three pathways discussed above accompanied by two “pre-requisites” provide a useful
framework to consider priority reform areas. Reforms under growth-jobs, service delivery-
opportunity for all and natural resource management pathways are complementary and mutually
supportive. For instance, reforms to boost non-commodity sector growth can indirectly help service
delivery through greater government revenues and may reduce pressure on natural resources. This
complementarity among the different pathways suggests that shared prosperity should be addressed
using a comprehensive but coherent reform agenda. Reforms under the three pathways should be
supported by two important underlying, cross-cutting pre-requisites: domestic revenue mobilization
(“collecting more”) and “governance” reforms to improve policy coordination, project
implementation and transparency.
5.1. Prioritization Criteria
In this SCD, we attempt to prioritize reforms based on impact (evidence-based),
complementarity/synergy, sequencing and feasibility:
        •   Evidence on the salience of a constraint for achieving the twin goals. The degree to which constraints to
            achieving shared prosperity through the three identified pathways are binding, based on
            existing empirical evidence;
        •   Reform complementarities and synergies. The extent to which reforms addressing the most binding
            constraints have significant impacts on, and relevance for more than one pathway; such
            reforms are considered “high priority” or “transformational”; and
        •   Reform sequencing and feasibility. Some reforms may not be feasible before the full
            implementation of higher order reforms while other reforms may be pertinent but lack the
            minimum political support needed to implement them.

5.2. Reform Priorities
5.2.1. Economic growth and jobs
Enhancing prosperity for the Bottom 40 percent rests in large part on the implementation of
structural reforms to shift the economy to a productivity-based growth path. The structural
reform agenda ultimately aims to increase the productivity in agriculture by increasing cereal yields,
reducing post-harvest waste and shifting to higher value crops, and accelerate investments in
manufacturing and services, including tourism, thereby reducing dependence on mineral commodities
for exports. Urgent actions to support this shift include reforms that can be expected to generate
“quick wins”, while recognizing that the full benefits of such a shift will accrue only over the longer
term.
Infrastructure
Large investments in infrastructure (roads, seaports, railways, irrigation and drainage) to better connect the
economy domestically, reduce logistics costs, support productive activities and improve access to
services are clear priorities.52 Investment in infrastructure is “transformative” in Indonesia in that it
supports growth and competitiveness, is crucial to providing key services to the population and is

supportive of human capital development and social inclusion. Indonesian cities are growing fast and
a key challenge for sub-national governments is to rapidly put in place the infrastructure to support economic
activities, ease urban mobility and provide water, sanitation and other services to a growing population.
Infrastructure gaps in rural areas are also large. Priority infrastructure there includes community-level
production-supporting infrastructure, irrigation investment, with complementary R&D and extension services,
and enhancing governance to increase user participation and sustainability of investments.
A special focus on energy is warranted. Demand for energy is growing by 7-8 percent annually, requiring
a rapid supply response to avoid an energy crisis in the years to come. About 35 million Indonesians
lack access to electricity. It is estimated that meeting the energy needs of the economy and closing the
access gap would require 66.8 GW of incremental generation capacity and 477 TWh power supply
capacity for a total investment over USD 200 billion. If the objective were to close the gap in the next
10 years, that would mean an investment of USD 20 billion per year. Furthermore, with energy
contributing almost a quarter of total CO2 emissions, reducing the heavy reliance on fossil-fuel sources
to meet rising demand would help Indonesia contribute to the global climate change agenda. To
improve the efficiency and sustainability of the energy sector, a reduction of the large electricity
subsidy bill (USD 10 billion in 2014) is needed to boost investments in the sector, while policy and
regulatory bottlenecks to investments by all players would need to be overcome.
Public sector financing. Total resources needed to close Indonesia’s infrastructure gap are estimated
at about USD 500 billion by the new administration (USD 100 billion a year). Of this, the State Budget
is expected to finance about one-third, made possible by a significant reduction of fuel subsidies. The
rise in infrastructure spending in the medium term is, however, contingent on reforms to increase
revenue collection and tax compliance, which are among the lowest in Asia and middle-income
countries (see Section IV). The remaining two-thirds of the financing need are expected to come
primarily from the private sector and, to a lesser extent, SOEs. To support the latter, the 2015 Budget
included a capital injection of about USD 5.3 billion (IDR 70.4 trillion) into SOEs. Most SOEs in
Indonesia have weak financial capacity, in part attributable to subsidies, and are heavily constrained in
terms of investment.
The private sector participation. The scale of investment needs in national, urban and rural
infrastructure is huge (estimated at about USD 500 billion for the next 5 years). The private sector should
thus play a crucial role since the national budget will be insufficient to finance it. With the recent
establishment of a PPP unit at the Ministry of Finance, the new Government is trying to address these
bottlenecks more effectively than in the past.53 The legal framework for PPPs has also been amended
to allow the private sector to invest in the development and operation of financially viable
infrastructure projects without being obliged to enter into a joint-venture with an SOE. Various
incentive mechanisms have been established, including the Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fund
(IGF), Indonesia Infrastructure Finance Fund (IIFF) and SMI, the Viability Gap Financing (VGF)
program. The challenge now is to make these institutional mechanisms operational and well-
coordinated.
Removing regulatory bottlenecks. Better implementation of both public and PPP operations will
require complementary regulatory reforms in many sectors to remove bottlenecks (see Box 4.1 on the
energy sector) and an effective implementation of the new land law, which will require good

53   Toll roads particularly have been targeted for PPP financing: the three “ready for offer” projects totaling USD764
     million include a toll road project accounting for 83 percent of the total (USD628 million), while the 26 Priority
     PPP projects include 13 toll roads totaling USD32.5 billion or 85 percent of the total value of the 26 projects.


                                                              69
implementing regulations. Better implementation for both public and PPP operations would benefit
greatly from effective implementation of the 2012 Land Law and relevant regulations. Without faster
and less conflict-ridden acquisition of land, implementation of infrastructure projects will remain
uncertain and costly. Finally, it is not clear whether the private sector will be willing or able to
participate in investment in some sectors. For instance, in ports, a constraint is that SOEs need to
own at least 51 percent shares for projects, which results in the playing field being weighted in favor
of SOE entities
Building “better” ex-ante. Major investment in new infrastructure presents an opportunity to drive
an overall decrease in disaster risk through growth. The flip side to this is that under-investing in
resilient infrastructure would by default result in increased risk. Indonesia faces medium to high risk
across the whole country from multiple natural hazards. Therefore, risk-sensitive planning and design
standards are essential to protect growth that depends on critical infrastructure assets. Indonesia has good examples
of “building back better” after major disasters. As a result, this is the chance to be a global leader among
MICs in “building better” ex-ante. Key approaches include risk-sensitive land-use planning, adequate
budgeting to provide sustainable operations and maintenance, and insurance options for public assets.
Box 5.2: The energy sector
 Demand for energy is growing by about 8 percent annually requiring a rapid supply response to avoid an energy crisis
 in the years to come. It is estimated that meeting the needs of the economy and closing the access gap would require
 66.8 GW of incremental generation capacity and 477 TWh power supply capacity for a total investment over USD 200
 billion. If the objective were to close the gap in the next 10 years, that would mean an investment of USD 20 billion
 per year. The new Government’s goal is to increase generation capacity by 35 GW by 2019, an ambitious goal. Of the
 35 GW capacity being targeted, 20-25 GW is expected to come from IPPs.
 Meeting these goals requires massive financing mobilization and significant reforms to improve investment climate (e.g.,
 permitting and licensing) and the capacity of PLN, the state utility company, to invest (e.g., heavy subsidy of electricity
 to residences). Lack of transparent and clear guidelines regarding the tendering process, 54 for instance, and payments
 to support or block certain bills or actions are processes that facilitate corruption schemes.55 An additional challenge is
 heavy reliance of most power generation on conventional fossil fuel sources, such as oil, natural gas and coal. To date,
 less than 20 percent of power generation comes from hydroelectric, geothermal and other renewable sources. The
 recently enacted Energy Law and Electricity Law provide a renewed legal framework for the energy sector, with an
 emphasis on economic sustainability, energy security, and environmental conservation. One constraint for the
 geothermal sector and increased private sector investment is the difficulty of sharing early stage exploration risk, and
 the stringent conditions for the existing USD 300 million fund put up by the state for that purpose. The development
 of hydro and other renewable energy sectors is also impeded by lack of standard purchasing power templates from PLN
 (except for micro hydro), lack of any private sector incentive to develop off-grid solutions and less than attractive size
 bidding by the government in the recent solar auctions.
 As of 2013, hydroelectricity accounted for only 8.78 percent of the current forty-six thousand megawatt capacity.56
 Indonesia is also the third highest producer of geothermal energy in the world but has only tapped about four percent
 of its potential.57 Until August 2014, geothermal activities were lawfully defined as a mining activity under Indonesian
 regulation, and thereby prohibited from protected forest and conservation areas (UU No. 27/2003). However, 80
 percent of geothermal reserves are located in such areas. Law No. 21/2014 now separates geothermal activities from
 other mining areas, but coordination with other policies and drafting of operation regulations will take time. As
 mentioned above, companies must bear the cost of geothermal exploration—drilling wells at several billion dollars in
 initial outlays without certainty that the well will be useable. In 2013 for example, one major foreign geothermal
 company had to drill eight wells before finding a sufficiently productive one.58

Incentive and accountability of local governments. With decentralization, local governments have
crucial infrastructure responsibilities and sub-national governments actually now do spend more than
the central government on infrastructure (1.5 percent of GDP versus 1 percent of GDP). But they
could spend much more to improve roads, water and sanitation and health infrastructure (both in
terms of new investments and maintenance) if their budgets were not tied up by excessive spending
on personnel and if they could raise more revenues themselves. Over 40 percent of sub-national
government spending is on personnel and about 90 percent of their budgets come from the central
government (fiscal transfers). Major changes to fiscal federalism that would promote greater
investment are unlikely to garner much political support in the short run, but incentives can be
improved on the margin by increasing performance-based transfers tied to spending on sectors/areas
of national priorities
Deepening the financial market. Financing sources with long-term maturities of up to 30 years, as
required to fund infrastructure projects, remain below Indonesia’s financial market current capacity.
Indonesia’s financial markets are too thin to support infrastructure investment without important
reforms. The capital market capitalization is low at 66 percent of GDP. Corporate debt markets are
thin accounting for 2.2 percent of GDP, compared with 6 percent for the Philippines, 19 percent for
Thailand and 43 percent for Malaysia. Non-Bank Financing Institutions (NBFIs) as a whole account
for slightly more than 20 percent of financial systems assets, with no significant change in this
percentage over the past decade. While a number of sectors such as insurance, mutual funds, and
pension funds are growing rapidly, they have started from a low base (compare pension fund assets at
5 percent of GDP versus 10-15 percent in the Philippines and Thailand, and 40 percent in Malaysia).
In order to enhance market depth and Figure 5.1: Funding sources to fill in the existing infrastructure

the execution regime including a
credible legal system that allows for the effective enforcement of contracts and property rights.
Investor protection would provide investors with a modicum of certainty when making long-term
financing decisions.
The ongoing reform of the social security regime further presents an opportunity to deepen financial
markets. The newly created Social Security Organizing Agency (BPJS), which replaces Jamsostek, will
be expected to cover ten times the number of workers it does now (from 12 to 110 million, at least),
which will multiply by a significant factor the amount of assets under management. A substantial
portion of Jamsostek funds was invested in government bonds and bank deposits. Given that BPJS is
set to become the largest institutional investor in the market, this presents an opportunity to widen
the choice of eligible investments, accompanied by greater transparency and accountability


                                                   71
requirements. In addition, private sector institutional investors, such as insurance companies and
private pension and mutual funds, might be encouraged to similarly widen their spectrum of
investment opportunities, including in the infrastructure bonds market. Regulatory and supervisory
frameworks for these institutions should be enhanced to improve their asset-liability management
practices, driving them toward making long-term investments to match with their liabilities instead of
only focusing on short-term returns. Figure 4.2 shows, as one possible scenario, that an increase or
redirection of by 50 percent of existing bond funding and 10 percent of equity investment to
infrastructure finance will close the existing funding gap for the foreseeable future.

Coordination issues. The availability of more resources would need to be accompanied by efforts to
overcome weak coordination and institutional capacity, which have led to under-spending of already
low budgeted capital investment. Planning has been plagued by poor selection and preparation. To
begin with, various ministries and SOEs have different project criteria and lists. The authorities might
want to consider empowering one dedicated agency/ministry to undertake project selection. This can
help ensure that selected projects respond to value-for-money and viability/feasibility rather than just
political imperatives. In addition, attention needs to be paid to cherry-picking by the ministries, which
are content to leave the more complex and less viable investments to the private sector, when the
opposite might be a more effective approach. For SOEs, strengthening financial standing would be
important for facilitating greater investment, but their planning, budgeting and procuring would also
need to be strengthened to enhance efficiency in their investments and create space for leveraging
private sector financing and investment.
Business environment
Improving the business environment is another “transformative” reform that is crucial for growth
and job creation, access to key services and better management of natural resources. The key priority
reforms in this area are as follows:
Regulatory uncertainty and inconsistency. A number of sector-specific laws and measures
announced recently significantly worsen the investment climate by placing additional restrictions on
businesses and investors. In addition, many of the sector-specific laws and measures are either
inconsistent or misaligned with existing laws and regulations, thus further increasing uncertainty. Well-
meaning attempts by the executive to support the economy in moving up the value chain can fall prey
to special interests and result in protecting uncompetitive local production. Improving business
processes can be stymied by bureaucracies seeking to hold on to opportunities for corruption. Efforts
to enhance local participation can create uncertainties in existing and future foreign investment.
Indonesia needs to strengthen the quality of the policy formation process for economic policies and
regulations. Some countries have done this by empowering one ministry or government agency to
play the function of “policy integrator” (i.e., create a so-called “Center of Government”, or CoG). A
strengthened policy formation process should help address genuine concerns of Indonesians that the
public interest be protected, and should enable the Government to push back against more narrow
rent-seeking activities and self-centered business interests.
Investment licenses and permits59. The importance of streamlining business licensing is recognized
by the government to be a major policy priority. In his first impromptu visit (blusukan) after being
inaugurated, the President visited the Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) in October 2014, and
instructed BKPM and relevant ministers to implement a central one-stop services (OSS) within three

months (i.e., by January 2015). He also emphasized that investors should need to visit only BKPM to
apply for licenses at the national level. At the time of the President’s visit, investors still needed to
apply for licenses from various ministries and agencies outside BKPM at the national level, as well as
for sub-national licenses, while BKPM itself only processed 14 licenses, including the principle license
at the start of the licensing process and the operational license at the very end of it. Once fully
implemented, a central OSS will mean the integration of all licensing processes at the national level
under one roof, simplifying the currently complex web of business licensing across the different
national and sub-national agencies. The intended result is a quick, simple, transparent and integrated
licensing service. The reform at the BKPM level should however be complemented by the
implementation of effective sub-national one stop services.
“Doing business”. Indonesia currently ranks 114th out of 189 countries in the ease of doing
business, as measured by the World Bank Group.60 Along with construction permits, paying taxes and
enforcing contracts are among the bottom 40 percent’s most cumbersome procedures in the world.
This performance is below the regional (East Asia and Pacific) average and its peer countries’
performance: the Philippines, China, Thailand, and Malaysia ranked 95th, 90th, 26th, and 18th,
respectively. The Government has begun to take note, however, and is implementing an action plan
that consists of seventeen actions across eight “Doing Business” areas (aligned to eight of the ten
indicators in the WBG’s “Doing Business” country rankings). In 2014, the Government followed up
with actual implementation improvements in the areas of starting a business, paying taxes, and getting
electricity (reducing the time required for the latter by 11 days).
Better functioning capital, labor and land markets. For capital markets, the need to mobilize
more domestic capital for infrastructure investment is well-recognized, but will require sustained
efforts to strengthen the role of the segmented banking sector and deepen non-bank lending, including
over the long term by reducing the aversion to long-term local currency lending and the psychological
impacts of the 1997/98 crisis. Labor market reforms could have relatively immediate benefits, but
negotiating the “grand bargain” necessary will be at least a medium-term effort. Moving to formulae-
based for minimum wage determination will be crucial to provide a more certain, simple and fair
minimum wage setting process. The aim is to make employers, workers and job seekers better off by
promoting a more evidence-based and less politicized wage-setting process. This is expected to lead
to more predictable annual increases, and, by introducing improvements in the governance structure,
reduce the scope for discretionary decision making. Land, and its ownership and management, is
perhaps the area in which implementation would be most arduous, requiring major institutional and
governance reforms. The benefits, however, can be cross-cutting for infrastructure development,
agriculture, urban development and environmental sustainability
Skills
Closing Indonesia’s skills gap requires a three-pronged reform strategy. First, there is a clear need to
improve access to and quality of early childhood and basic education to build a strong base of
cognitive, social and behavioral skills necessary to acquire the higher-level skills needed in the labor
market. However, even if the educational system could be perfected instantly, the first graduates would
only join the workforce in about 10-20 years’ time. It is therefore essential to find short- and medium-
term solutions for the current skills constraints: the second and third prongs of the strategy are thus

improving the relevance of feeders into the labor market (technical and vocational education, and
tertiary education) and upgrading the skills of the existing workforce (reform of the training system).
Primary and secondary education. After achieving near universal access to 9 years of education,
the Government is focused on expanding access to 12 years of education (including senior secondary)
partly in response to a growing demand for higher skills in the labor market. Expanding access to 12
years of good quality education for all Indonesians will also require: (i) improvements in the efficiency
of public education spending. Increased teacher hiring and the introduction of professional allowances
have absorbed a significant amount of recent increases in public education spending. However, the
size of the existing teacher force, measured by the student-teacher ratio, is large when compared with
international benchmarks associated with good education quality. Making better use of teachers
through more efficient school and staffing standards and improving teacher distribution have the
potential to realize significant savings. In turn, these savings can support the expansion of good quality
learning opportunities that the Government has committed to. Without these savings the system may
not be able to afford to expand services while improving education quality; (ii) raising levels of teacher
competency will be central to the success of efforts to increase levels of educational attainment in
Indonesia. Recent improvements in pay brought about through the teacher certification program have
so far not led to improvements in levels of teacher competency or student learning.61 Greater attention
is needed to improve teacher accountability and strengthen the systems that deliver professional
development opportunities to existing teachers to raise teacher content knowledge, teaching skills and
motivation.
Technical, vocational and tertiary education. In expanding access to senior secondary education,
it is vital that both general (SMA) and vocational (SMK) tracks provide graduates with a strong set of
general skills demanded in the labor market. Vocational secondary schools might provide a fast route
for training mid-level skilled workers for the immediate needs of the labor market, but they may not
provide graduates with a sufficient foundation of general skills that makes them adaptable to changes
in the needs of the labor market. On the other hand, graduates from the general track who do not
enter tertiary education likely lack sufficient job-relevant skills. It is important that as senior secondary
schooling is expanded both tracks provide the right skills mix and that there is enough permeability
between tracks to ensure graduates have a range of paths open to them for continuing their skills
acquisition (e.g., community colleges and non-university degrees).
Making vocational education and tertiary responsive to employer needs is a priority. In the absence of
the right policies, education institutions tend to be isolated from the labor market. They tend to
naturally respond to their ‘clients’, comprising of potential and current students, as well as their owners
or regulators. As a result, if students’ demands are not in line with the labor market (because of lack
of information, for example) or the regulatory framework prevents institutions from responding to
the demands of their ‘clients’ then these institutions will not respond to the demands in the labor
market.
Improving information flows and strengthening incentives improve the responsiveness of tertiary
education. Without information about labor-market trends and the quality of tertiary institutions the
choices of potential students will not be aligned with those of the labor market and institutions will
have little incentive to align their offerings to the demands of employers. But information is not
enough. Even if the right information is on hand, it is still important to provide the right incentives.

This requires autonomy and accountability, incentives for performance (especially in public
institutions) and opportunities for direct links between institutions and employers (for example
apprenticeships, staff exchanges, research collaboration).
Skills upgrading in the workforce. There is a need to address the skills shortages of those already
in the labor market. Coverage of the existing training system is very low, with only about 5 percent of
the labor force reporting having received any formal training. On-the-job training is rare, with firms
in Indonesia much less likely to report offering opportunities for training to their employees than in
other countries in the region. While the institutional set-up for the training sector is largely established,
the training system needs to be expanded and greater employer participation needs to be fostered.
More resources are needed for training but they should not all come from the public sector. Skills
upgrading is not only the responsibility of the public sector since firms and individuals also benefit
from upgrading efforts. As many other countries have done, resources should come from both public
and private sources with public funds used strategically to incentivize private spending from
employers. The quality of training offered also needs to improve by using a competency-based training
approach and to incentivizing quality improvement from training providers. Accreditation is largely
voluntary at the moment and competency-based methodologies are rarely used in training. Public
funding could be used more strategically to incentivize training providers to adopt competency-based
training and ensure that training institutions are accredited. There is also a need to accelerate the
expansion of good quality training opportunities in higher value-added skills in strategic sectors. The
current supply of training providers is concentrated on low-skilled occupations, while there is an
undersupply of training providers in strategic sectors of the economy that require larger fixed
investments to be established (food products, manufacturing). Expanding this supply will be critical
to ensure skills upgrading happens in the right sectors.
Providing demand-side subsidies to hard-to-employ groups will be crucial to ensure that training can
be accessed by all. Small and medium-size enterprises (SMAs) tend to under-invest in their workers
because of logistical constraints, since the cost of sending one worker to training means stopping
production. Hard-to-employ populations most in need of retraining may face financial constraints to
access training, even if that training is relevant and of good quality. Strategic industries may also face
short-term constraints in developing training providers. Public investment has a strong role to play in
targeting these populations on equity and productivity grounds.
Agriculture policies
The above reforms are likely to help improve the productive environment of all sectors. For the
agriculture, complementary policies are needed to modernize the sector. With rising incomes and
urbanization, food consumption and expenditure patterns are shifting to higher value and processed
foods. Indeed, there is a need to better align agricultural policies with Indonesia’s transition as a
middle-income country. Current policies have inhibited rather than facilitated the structural
transformation within agriculture and the broader agro-food system. This entails broadening policy
goals (competitiveness, nutritional balance, and environmental protection); embracing regulatory and
facilitative roles (especially related to food safety and plant and animal health); and carrying out supply-
side reforms and tackling supply bottlenecks (land, irrigation infrastructure, and agricultural
innovation systems). Enabling these growth-critical investments requires the phasing down of sector
subsidies and complementary (non-agricultural) policies to improve the competitiveness of high value
perishables subsectors and promote investments in food processing, cold chain logistics, etc. The

provision of public goods is also critical for improving the productivity and sustainable livelihoods of
the 5 million households involved in the production of oil palm, coffee, cocoa, and tea.
5.2.2. Access to key services and opportunities for all
Local service delivery
Improving local service delivery will require building the capacities of local government to deliver
services, moving toward a more performance-based transfer system, providing the tools for citizens
to monitor local service delivery, as well as differentiated approaches adapted to different types of
regions. It also requires combining the current top-down approach to reform, whereby local
governments implement national policies, with a more frontline approach, which uses the frontline
service as the entry point to develop solutions, working out from there to identify and align supporting
interventions at each levels of government. Ultimately, improving local service delivery is about
enhancing the way in which central, provincial, district, and village governments work together to
deliver results on the ground.
Transfers to sub-national governments have increased substantially over the past decade and now
make up one-half of the state budget, net of subsidies and interest payments (about 7 percent of
GDP). The sub-national transfer system is composed of four “buckets”: (i) a “block grant” component
(Dana Alokasi Umum, or DAU); (ii) a specific purpose grant (Dana Alokasi Khusus, or DAK), allocated
to certain regions with the aim of funding special activities of the region in accordance with national
priorities; (iii) a revenue-sharing (DBH) component aimed at sharing tax and non-tax natural resource
revenues with all districts with a larger proportion of revenues going to resource-rich districts where
the revenues originated; (iv) the special autonomy fund (Dana Otsus) for Aceh, Papua and West Papua
provinces; and (v) a number of small adjustment funds (Dana Penyesuaian) such as additional allowances
for teachers, professional benefits for teachers, School Operational Assistance program (Bantuan
Operasional Sekolah, or BOS), local incentive grants (Dana Insentif Daerah, or DID) and various
infrastructure support funds. In 2012, DAU accounted for 60 percent of total transferred revenues,
DBH 19 percent, special autonomy fund s and adjustment funds 16 percent, and DAK 6 percent.
Addressing the poor performance of local service provision documented in Section III will require
measures to increase incentive, capacity and accountability of LGs. On the supply-side, an overhaul
of the fiscal transfer system to provide the right incentives and measures to enhance delivery capacity
(tools, own-resource mobilization and accountability framework focused on results) are needed. On
the demand-side, enhancing the capacity of the population to hold local leaders accountable for results
is crucial.
A “second generation” fiscal transfers system is needed to:
    • Incentivize performance of LGs. Local governments receive about 90 percent of their
       budgets from the central government, but the central government has no effective mechanism
       to significantly influence the composition of local governments’ spending. The DAK,
       allocated to certain regions with the aim of funding special activities of the region in
       accordance with national priorities, only covers 6 percent of these transfers. While claiming a
       small share of the total transfer, the DAK is overly fragmented, scattered across too many
       sectors and districts, and thus unable to significantly increase the capacity to delivery services.
       Going forward, increasing the share of the DAK in the total allocation and refocusing the
       DAK’s targeted sectors to a few critical ones (e.g., water supply, sanitation, transport and
       health) could greatly support service delivery.



                                                   76
    • Tailor transfers to challenges in different ‘clusters’. There is today a one-size fits all
      approach in the intergovernmental finance system, despite the diversity of issues faced by
      regions in Indonesia. The uniform treatment of heterogeneous sub-national units in policy
      design and implementation is a problem for the proper resourcing of provinces and districts.
      Large municipalities, small- and medium-sized cities, and rural districts are all treated more or
      less equivalently from a fiscal point of view. Yet, some districts have significant gaps in access
      whereas others have simply a quality of service problem as access is not a problem. Ideally
      budget allocations and program focus should be tailored to each different situation. Also,
      from a fiscal point of view, there are strong arguments in favor of treating large municipalities
      differently from smaller ones and rural districts.

    • Eliminate perverse incentives in the grant allocation system. Perverse incentives in the
      grant allocation system have encouraged spending on salaries and administration at the
      expense of a more balanced use of resources that promotes service delivery outcomes.
      Furthermore, central government line agencies spend their own budgets on local functions,
      which reinforces LGs’ focus on salaries and administration as funds that could have been
      allocated on capital were either saved or spent on less important activities. Furthermore,
      unclear assignment of responsibilities limits the empowerment of local authorities and the
      potential involvement of civil society.

To complement monetary incentives, non-monetary forms of incentives can be crucial. For instance,
dissemination of public information on LG performance (as done in most OECD countries) or
temporary central governments’ ‘take-over’ of services (e.g., Colombia, US, UK) to restore
performance before handing the service delivery facility back to the local entity. Non-monetary
incentives include includes refocusing the bureaucracy to be accountability for results and not only for
compliance. The bureaucracy (both central and local) is highly geared towards input controls, which
focus on compliance. An accountability framework focused on compliance undermines the focus on
results and service delivery performance. The central government does monitor service delivery and
regional growth performance, but provides limited incentives to encourage or require sub-national
spending performance against those outcomes. A culture of rewarding local governments for
achieving good results can enhance competition between local governments and encourage improved
service delivery. The paradigm shift in resource management towards greater focus on results should
also happen at the central government level, which also heavily focuses on input controls and
compliance.
In addition to appropriate incentives, tools for identifying key service delivery gaps and monitoring
district performance in closing those gaps (building on KPI) are needed. These comprise:

   •   A system to ensure alignment of investments across different levels of government
   •   Tools to identify needs and build LG capacity
   •   Social accountability tools for different clusters
   •   Tools for easy reporting and monitoring of expenditures
   •   Tools to document and demonstrate good local practices.

Furthermore, developing LGs-led financing instruments, such as PPPs, municipal bonds, and
intermediary financing, could greatly enhance the capacity of municipalities to finance infrastructure.
Indeed, even with improved targeting of transfers and efforts to increase fiscal capacity an own


                                                  77
resource mobilization at the local level, financing of infrastructure needs through the budget are likely
to be insufficient. A regulation for municipal finance has been issued in 2012 by the Ministry of
Finance to enable provincial governments to tap capital markets for funding local infrastructure.
However, to date no issuances have taken place due to challenges related to institutional issues such
as audit, ratings and support of the regional parliaments.
Delivery at the village level. Beyond LGs, the new Village Law provides an opportunity to
strengthen service delivery at the village level, particularly if investments are complementary. However,
capacity and incentives may also be difficult to address.62 Indonesia has a long experience in service
delivery at the community level by communities themselves. For instance, PNPM-Mandiri Rural, the
largest of Indonesia’s community-driven development initiatives, provided small-scale public
infrastructure in local communities utilizing a community-based approach in which communities plan,
prioritize and decide their own needs; implement the projects; manage and account for funds; and
maintain the assets built. The program has financed the construction of more than 100,000 km of
rural roads; 17,000 small bridges; 28,000 clean water systems; and the rehabilitation or construction of
over 50,000 schools and health facilities. It has also supported more than 301,000 business activities
conducted by women since its inception with a total commitment of USD 3.6 billion (IDR 33 trillion)
over the period 1998-2015. The PNPM platform has also been used as a means for reaching the
marginal populations and in delivery of programs such as efforts to reduce malnutrition and stunting.
The new Village Law aims to use key PNPM institutions to continue to support village development
and improve village-level service delivery.
Box 5.3: The new Village Law and basic service delivery
 After several years of deliberations, a Village Law was approved by the House of Representatives (DRP) in December
 2013. The law was initiated by the Government as a means to address existing weak governance arrangements in
 villages and empower communities to meet their own development needs, including provision of basic infrastructure
 and oversee public spending. One of the main notions behind the law is to institutionalize PNPM Mandiri (the Bank-
 supported National Program for Community Empowerment) by enshrining community-driven development
 principles into the legal framework. As part of that, and once the law is fully implemented in 2018, villages will receive
 significant increased financial transfers: on average about IDR 1.4 billion (USD 120,000) per village. These will
 support the execution of village medium-term development plans that have been developed in a participatory manner
 by community members. This can include territory infrastructure and village-scale facilities for job creation. The law
 also provides for greater accountability of the village government to villagers, through a democratically elected Village
 Council and through annual Village Assemblies that might improve the quality of village spending. However, the law
 does not include provisions that would strengthen the accountability of district governments or front line facilities to
 village governments and communities. This needs to be addressed in the implementing regulations of Law No.
 23/2014 on Regional Administration, which replaces Law No. 32/2004 on Regional Governance.


Stronger demand-side pressure for service delivery. Improved access to information, increased
public-private sector dialogue and engagement in local political processes are improving local
economic governance and development. Although there is no clear-cut solution to organizing the
demand-side pressure for better service delivery, there exist some local success stories where
mobilizing the demand-side has helped to improve the service delivery of public goods and service
delivery. This has taken for instance the form of pressuring local leaders into passing new local policies
or implementing already existing policies. A variety of approaches can be helpful for improving citizen
engagement. These include sharing information about public service quality with local citizens (open

62   In general, incentive and capacity problems are more difficult to tackle at the village level in part because there are
      more of them, but in some ways it is easier because social accountability mechanisms are likely to be more
      effective at the village level.


                                                                78
data), including comparative studies of one locality with other similar ones. In the context of
Indonesia, strengthening of community-driven programs, which have a strong demand-side
accountability component, can help.
Social protection and social security
To achieve the twin goals in Indonesia, greater social protection is needed to shield the vulnerable
from shocks that push them into poverty, while helping those beneath the poverty line to climb above
it. This entails strengthening social assistance programs and making the ongoing social security reforms effective and
sustainable. Improving social assistance will likely require far more resources than are currently spent
by the Government, at roughly 0.5 percent of GDP. Other large middle-income countries spend, on
average, three times as much on these programs. At only 1 percent of GDP in 2012, total government
outlays on health were the fifth-lowest out of the 188 countries for which data are available: only
South Sudan, Pakistan, Chad and Myanmar had lower ratios. Because only 41 percent of the Bottom
40 are covered, Indonesia is committed to and putting significant effort into attaining universal health
coverage (UHC) by 2019. The country launched a National Health Insurance Program in 2014 (JKN)
and is making health insurance free for the poorest 40 percent of the population—a key policy of the
administration of President Joko Widodo (“Jokowi”).63 UHC could be instrumental to boosting shared
prosperity and reducing poverty in Indonesia, where 93 million Indonesians (40 percent of the
population) live under USD 2 per day and where inequality is also rising.
5.2.3. Natural resources management and environment sustainability
Removing constraints to shared prosperity include beginning the difficult task of improving
natural resources management and environment sustainability. A key priority in improving
natural resources management and environmental sustainability in Indonesia is a reform of the governance
of land allocation, land rights access and spatial planning. Good management of these is a pre-requisite for
improving the livelihoods of local communities but will also influence food production, urban and
infrastructure development, and mining and forestry resource management, environment degradation
and pollution, as well as the prevalence of social conflicts.
Unified land legislation and management. Sound and well-enforced land allocation through
unified land legislation is necessary that included clarification regarding customary land on forestry
land, recognition and a conflict resolution system. This requires:
        •   A unification of land management and titling and an acceleration of land registry;
        •   For forest management, introducing effective fiscal incentives and licensing and enforcement
            to reduce the rate of deforestation and land degradation. This includes positive incentives for
            environmental services where REDD+ could be effective, and acceleration of the
            implementation of the Forest Management Unit program.
        •   Granting land rights granted to local communities.
        •   More coherent spatial planning (only seven of the 34 provinces have a legally binding plan),
            including down to the village level will be essential to provide the framework for land
            classification and enforceability of violations. The OneMap concept will be important to unify
            mapping and information standards, but it needs revisions and urgent approval.
        •   Revision of permitting processes for timber concessions, oil palm and mining to make them
            more participatory, transparent and aligned with the spatial plans.

63   The other components of the social security reforms comprise universal employment insurance coverage by July
     2015 and an important institutional overhaul to reduce the fragmentation of the social security system.


                                                           79
     •    Upgrading of strategic environment assessments and Amdal (environmental assessment) to
          inform permitting process and spatial plans.
     •    Creating and strengthening technical institutions and management structures at the sub-
          national level in order to support participatory planning and monitoring at the village, district
          and provincial level.
A more integrated approach to planning for agriculture, energy and water management.
Almost 6o percent of geothermal production is in conservation forests, similar to the hydro potential.
Sedimentation undermines current investments in water reservoirs. At the same time coal mining and
agrochemicals are responsible for watershed pollution. Close to 75 percent of main rivers and 15
main lake systems are heavily polluted. Planning and management at watershed level and coastal
lowland level needs to be strengthened. Coordination between Ministries will be essential to avoid
sector solutions with high costs to other sectors.
Implementing REDD+ and disaster risk management. For this policy priority, accelerating
programs such as land registry and implementing REDD+ would be a good start. With land use
changes, forestry and peat fires, generating more than 70 percent of CO2 emissions, efforts in this area
could decisively increase Indonesia’s contribution to global climate change initiatives, while supporting
resilience to natural disasters, which disproportionately impact the poor. Building greater resilience to
natural hazards could be supported by the establishment of a national program on hazardous micro-
zoning providing detailed instruments for incorporating resilience into site design and construction
standards; providing a financing framework for both urban, housing and property development that
incentivizes investment with built-in resilience linked to disaster insurance; and a national program on
urban upgrading and ecosystem rehabilitation to increase the resilience of existing settlement and
urban infrastructure as part of the greening of Indonesia’s future growth.
Priorities for marine and fisheries resource management. For marine and fisheries resources,
priorities include (i) implementing control and surveillance over sovereign marine and fisheries resources to support the
eradication of illegal overfishing (IUU); (ii) improving marine natural resources and fisheries management to improve
the sustainability of the natural capital while accommodating an expansion of commercial wild capture
fisheries, and sustainable aquaculture production and tourism; (iii) improving the investment climate and
support PPP for sustainable capture fisheries and aquaculture to increase production and the sector’s
contribution to GDP, reduce poverty among fisher and coastal communities as well as improve
national food sovereignty and food security and, finally; (iv) investing in complementary electrification for
commercial fisheries cold storage and processing plants to increase overall economic value of fisheries sector,
increase exports and diversify and create jobs, particularly in eastern Indonesia.

5.3. Cross-cutting pre-requisite 1: collecting more and spending better
There is a strong political consensus that boosting reforms and investment in infrastructure,
energy, health and social protection is the right course but this needs to translate into
sustained fiscal reforms in the medium term. Indeed, even if there is no policy reversal of the fuel
subsidy reforms and that the fiscal savings will be reallocated to development priorities, additional
fiscal space is needed to fund a sustained increase in the above priority areas. Given the large
infrastructure deficit, the Government should aim to increase total government infrastructure
spending (reflected as increased capital spending) from 2.3 percent of GDP in 2013-14 to 3.8 percent




                                                           80
by 2019.64 The investment required on the supply-side to implement fully the Universal Healthcare
Coverage (UHC) program by 2019 requires public health spending excluding National Social Security
System (SJSN) spending, to increase to around 1.4 percent of GDP per year (from 1.0 percent of
GDP in 2014); this will be reflected by higher material spending. On top of the health-related increase
in social assistance spending, social assistance spending on the poor and vulnerable should double,
equivalent to an increase of 0.5 percent of GDP, by 2019 to enable expansion of programs for the
poor and vulnerable. Simulations using a medium-term fiscal framework show total expenditure will
need to increase from 17.3 percent of GDP in 2014 to 20.0 percent by 2019.65 This places reforms to
collect more revenue in intense focus. Indeed, assuming a “business-as-usual” situation with no
significant reforms on revenue policy or administration, baseline revenue for 2015-19 is projected to
stay level at between 13.3 and 13.4 percent of GDP due to expected continued moderation in
commodity prices reducing non-tax revenues from oil and gas. In other words, Indonesia is forced to
mobilize more government revenues in order to adequately finance priority development areas within
the legal fiscal limit of 3 percent of GDP.

5.4. Cross-cutting Pre-requisite 2: Governance (Implementation, Coordination and
    Transparency)
Getting the reform priorities right is a first step. Effectively implementing them to efficiently
achieve shared prosperity is a key challenge in Indonesia. Some of the systems and practices
within the public administration that have been part of Indonesia’s development process over the past
decades may not serve its future needs and could undermine future growth. Despite the substantial
changes in the roles and responsibilities of the public institutions since 1998, many of the core
elements of the pre-1998 era remain. While there are now multiple stakeholders formulating and
implementing policy at both the national and sub-national levels, there are, so far, no effective
coordination mechanisms across government. The outcome has been poor delivery of services by
government institutions, inconsistent policy settings across sectors, and a lack of responsiveness of
the administration to the priorities of the Government and citizens. The failure to adapt old
institutional arrangements and policies to reflect the new environment is an impediment to the
effectiveness of the public administration, and poses a threat to Indonesia’s future ambitions.
To support a rapidly developing economy attention needs to be given to refocusing the public
administration to establish: (i) a stronger Center of Government (CoG) to manage the policy
process and resolve policy conflicts; (ii) an enhanced selection process (including allocation between
private/public sectors) and management of major capital projects to remove obstacles to their
implementation; and (iii) a streamlined bureaucracy for enhanced accountability among other goals.
These reforms are notoriously difficult to implement. However, given the costs of not acting to the
economy, to citizens and to the country’s ambitions, Indonesia cannot afford not to consider
implementing some of these reforms in the short term. Perhaps the most urgent reform is the need
for a stronger Center of Government. In 2004, OECD/Sigma provided an outline of some of the
core functions one would expect to be effective. These functions include: (i) policy document review,
quality assurance and inter-ministry mediation; (ii) monitoring government performance; (iii)
coordination of horizontal policies/priorities; (iv) legal conformity of draft laws; (v) communication
with media and the public; and (vi) coordinating with other branches of the state.

In Indonesia several different institutions play some role in the coordination of policies
including the Coordinating Ministries, the Vice-President’s office, the delivery units (UKP4 and
TPN2K) and others. However, this fragmentation of CoG roles and functions has not, so far served
Indonesia well. On the contrary, ministries have been able to implement new policies and regulations
that conflict with other regulations. Policy management is also more difficult because of the challenges
to coordinate separate planning and budgeting processes for different parts of the budget. In the
future, Indonesian authorities may want to consider how to refine the mandates and functions of the
various institutions that support the CoG, and to empower the President’s office (or its designate), or
another institution to play a stronger role in managing the policy process.
Hand-in-hand with high quality of spending is the effort to improve transparency and
accountability so as to maximize funding flows to the most vulnerable and the areas of most
pressing need. Indonesian public policy faces governance problems that weaken its effectiveness and
delay the impact of public spending. Corruption detection and enforcement have received relatively
more attention than corruption prevention in the public sector space. The Indonesian Corruption
Eradication Commission (KPK) has been engaged in investigating, prosecuting, supervising,
preventing and coordinating efforts to combat corruption, with some palpable high-profile results.
Strengthening the KPK as a well-funded independent body is critical. Weaknesses remain in the
judiciary for establishing a viable legal system to enforce contracts and increase investment security.
In addition, more attention should be given to corporate governance, also important for improving
the overall investment climate, with issues in the enforcement capabilities of regulators, weak boards
and corporate governance culture, and little participation of institutional investors.
The table below summarizes some of the key governance challenges around some of the key reforms
needed to achieve the twin goals.

The next decade represents the most favorable window for eradicating extreme poverty and
increasing the prosperity of the Bottom 40 percent in Indonesia. The country’s ongoing
“demographic dividend” will end by around 2030, when the population above 65 years of age will
start increasing faster than the population of working age. When Indonesia reaches that point,
potential growth is expected to decline as a result of reduced labor supply, lower savings rates and
perhaps less entrepreneurial innovation. Thus reforms and growth levels in the next decade or so will
determine whether Indonesia will climb the income ladder and become “rich” before starting to get
“old”. That is, whether Indonesia will be able to mimic the experience of Japan, Hong Kong SAR,
China, Singapore and South Korea, all of which became “rich” before becoming “old”. World Bank
calculations show that reaching high-income status by 2030—i.e., a per-capita income of

USD12,000—requires growing by 9 percent annually over the next 16 years.66 Short of this
exceptionally high rate of growth, growing at least above the current 5 percent “trend” growth rate
would be required to position the country well to move onto the next level.
With China shifting away from commodity-intensive investment, the commodity tailwinds
that have supported Indonesia’s growth are morphing into headwinds and the authorities’
focus is both on the short-term and the long-term agendas. While implementing structural
reforms for shared prosperity, Indonesia has been managing the macro-fiscal impacts of the end of
the commodities boom to safeguard hard-won gains in poverty reduction and maintain macro-
stability. The exchange rate has depreciated by more than 30 percent since mid-2013; monetary policy
has tightened; fuel subsidies, a key source of fiscal risk over the past few years, have been dramatically
reduced. This response has achieved the goal of maintaining stability at the cost of adding to the
slowdown in domestic demand. This brings to the fore the two cross-cutting pre-requisites discussed
above. Policy measures to strengthen tax and non-tax compliance and the removal of expenditure
execution constraints are both crucial if growth is to rebound in the near term and the proceeds are
to be focused on the shared prosperity agenda in a less supportive global environment. The country
can do it as its impressive long-term growth and poverty reduction trajectory attests. But the clock is
ticking.

Table Notes:
2013: Actual figures. 2014: Preliminary actual figures. 2015 expenditure is the approved revised budget. 2015 revenue is World Bank
projection. 2016-2019 are World Bank projections.
Macro assumptions: For both scenarios 2016-2019 assumes an enhanced real GDP growth scenario of 5.7-6.4 percent per annum from the
big infrastructure push. Commodity prices are expected to continue to moderate, based on World Bank commodity outlook, February
2015.
Aggregate revenue is total central government revenues and grants excluding subnational own source revenues. Central government
expenditure includes transfers to regions. Fiscal balance is central government fiscal balance and is shown as unconstrained by the fiscal
deficit rule of 2.5% for Central Government i.e. expenditure is not cut back in order to stay within the rule, in order to show the
additional amount of fiscal space that is needed to fund development priorities.
Infrastructure spending is total estimated capital and current spending on infrastructure by central and subnational government. Capital
spending is approximately 85 percent of total infrastructure spending. For simplification purposes, in the above projection, increased
infrastructure spending is reflected as only an increase in capital spending.
Social assistance spending figure is central government only and includes estimated SJSN health costs from 2014 onwards. It includes
increased social assistance spending from health as well as non-health programs.
Health spending figure is total estimated spending on health by central and subnational government. Increased health spending is
reflected in increased social assistance and material spending.
Fiscal space reforms: 1) Increase tax from non-oil and gas income tax and VAT assumes a baseline compliance rate of 47% of potential
increasing to 65% by 2019 through administration improvements; 2) Assumes gradual increase in tax rates in tobacco from 44% of the
retail price to 70% to create additional 0.7 percent GDP of revenue by 2019, and reform of vehicle excise schedule to create additional 1
percent of GDP of revenue by 2019; 3) Increase tax from non-oil and gas resource non-tax revenue assumes a baseline compliance rate of
47% of potential increasing to 100% by 2019 through administration improvements; 4) Assumes that personnel spending instead of
growing at the same pace as nominal GDP i.e. 5 percentage points above CPI, stays flat in real terms i.e. grows at the same rate as CPI.

              crime and violence. Slowly stabilizing democracy that has
              developed since the ousting of Soeharto in 1998 has led to
              a steady, fairly consistent improvement. Decentralization
              laws have transformed administrative structure. The judicial
              branch has grown more independent, but at the same time
              is considered the most corrupt in Southeast Asia.

                 majority of them advocacy-based CSOs. They have
                 been relatively successful in influencing democracy
