  Box 1.1  Indigenous Peoples Demographics and Data

  Panama has a population of around four million people living in 10 provinces, 75 districts
  or municipalities, five collective and semi-autonomous Indigenous territories organized
  by ethnic groups (comarcas), and 620 corregimientos. The tenth province was created when
  the original Province of Panama was divided into two—Panama and Panama Oueste—in
  January of 2014. Due to the recent split, the analysis here looks at the original Province
  of Panama.

  Panama is home to eight Indigenous ethnic groups or “peoples,” namely the Ngäbe or
  Ngöbe (260,058), Kuna or Guna (80,526), Emberá (31,284), Buglé (24,912), Wounaan
  (7,279), Teribe/Naso (4,046), Bokota (1,959), and Bribri (1,068). The 2010 census shows
  that 196,059 indigenous persons live in comarcas, while 221,500 live in other areas. The
  comarcas and other indigenous territories enjoy significant autonomy and self-­ government
  through 10 Congresses and two Councils. The comarcas make up 22.2 percent of the
  country’s area, or 16,634 square kilometers, and comprise some of Panama’s richest natural
  resources and cultural diversity. Panama is also home to a population of Afro-descendants
  representing 9.2 percent of the national population in 2010. The majority live in Colón
  (29 percent), Darién (17 percent), and Panama City (11 percent).

      Data on the full population of the Indigenous Peoples and Afro-descendants is limited. The
      annual household survey used to measure welfare does not include an ethnicity variable.
      In most of the analysis here, the geographic variable comarca is used as a proxy for per-
      sons of indigenous origin. This has three problems: (i) this captures only the three largest
      comarcas; (ii) there are small numbers of non-indigenous people who live in the comarcas;
      and (iii) using the comarca variable excludes the half of the indigenous population that
      lives in other parts of the country from the analysis. There is also no way to identify
      Afro-descendants from the household survey because they are included in the urban or
      rural areas in which they live. The only data source that allows a comparison to be made
      of these two groups is the National Population and Housing Census carried out every ten
      years: these data are used as much as possible. Thus, the discussion of welfare of these
      groups is constrained. These knowledge gaps merit further attention in Panama.

  Box 2.1  Regional Integration in Central America

  The integration of markets and infrastructure networks has extraordinary power to
  stimulate growth through efficiency gains, technology spillovers, and investment.
  However, despite several notable bright spots in economic cooperation, the promise of
  greater regional integration among the Central American countries has remained largely
  unfulfilled.
  Central America’s efforts at forming greater regional economic ties have been ongoing for
  decades, most notably on the trade side stretching from the establishment of a Central
  American Common Market in the 1970s to the Dominican Republic–Central America
  Free Trade Agreement and the EU–Central America Free Trade Agreement. But there
  have also been several significant integration successes outside of trade, including in the
  energy sector with the Sistema de Interconexión Eléctrica de los Países de América Central
  (SIEPAC), a transmission line project which came into being in June 2013 and connects
  the electricity grids of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and
  Panama. That interconnection could enhance investment opportunities for large-scale
  renewable energy projects, as well as improve the efficiency and the security of electricity
  supply in Central America. Financial interconnectedness is also on the rise, with almost
  all the banks in the region expanding operations into neighboring countries, although
  differences in legal and regulatory frameworks have limited greater connectedness.
  But by and large, Central America has not realized the gains expected from integration
  efforts. Exporters have not experienced appreciable growth in either export lines or
  markets since the signing of the regional free trade agreements. Bilateral trade in Central
  America remains an agenda of largely untapped opportunities, as evidenced by the
  negative elasticity of bilateral trade to different factors including adjacency and time-ad-
  justed distance. This untapped potential can be attributed to deficiencies in infrastructure,
  burdensome processes, and congestion at the border crossings limiting trade, even where
  distances are short. Poor road quality, particularly on secondary and unpaved rural roads,
  has led to road transport prices averaging 17 cents per ton-kilometer in Central America,
  one of the highest road transportation costs in the world. Burdensome customs proce-
  dures, lack of regulatory harmonization (for example in terms of phytosanitary standards
  for agricultural exports), few established trade links, an atomized shipping industry,
  sparse information sharing on cargo and backhaul in trucking, and relatively few options
  and competition for shipping also limit the gains from free trade agreements. Transport
  and logistics costs can surpass 50 percent of the final price of goods traded, and it has
  been estimated that intraregional exports in Central America could have doubled if the
  region achieved the adjacency and time distance factors of a truly integrated region.

  Box 3.1  Institutional Challenges of the Energy Sector

  The governance system in the energy sector has been criticized for its lack of proper planning
  and weak or limited staffing and institutional capacity. Slow and rarely transparent decision
  making is a key factor in the slow pace of investments in energy infrastructure expansion and
  strengthening in recent years. Further, existing policies, legislation, and regulations—the rules
  of the game—need to be revisited to meet the needs of a modern, expanding, and diversifying
  power system that is developing in Panama.
  The sector is also characterized by a multiplicity of agencies that are not coordinated. Four
  primary institutions constitute the government’s role in the energy sector. (First, the National
  Energy Secretariat is the lead national agency that coordinates the actions in the energy and
  power sector across ministries and agencies. Second, the National Electricity Transmission
  Company (ETESA) is the only participant in the transmission sector. It was created by Law 6
  and is the remnant of the Institute of Water and Electrification (IRHE) responsible for manag-
  ing the state monopoly on the energy sector since 1997. It has the responsibility for expanding
  and operating the transmission system, as well as operation of the energy market. Third, the
  National Dispatch Center (CND) coordinates the participants in the distribution market. And,
  fourth, the National Public Service Authority (ASEP), besides ensuring compliance with
  regulation in the electricity sector, is responsible for regulation related to telecommunications,
  water delivery, and sewage. In the distribution sector, three private companies control power
  distribution: ENSA, Edemet, and Edechi. The Panamanian state owns about 40 percent of the
  shares of ENSA, while Edemet and Edechi belong to the Spanish group Unión-Fenosa.

  Note: Poor is defined as having income below the national poverty line, middle class as having incomes of US$10–50 a day per capita, and
  rich as having incomes of more than US$50 per day. In this analysis, the vulnerable are those whose incomes are above the poverty line but
  below the middle class and thus face a danger of falling back into poverty.

      Box 4.1  How Institutional Challenges Affect Service Delivery in the
      WSS Sector

      Three main actors are responsible for policy setting, service provision and regulation: (i)
      the Ministry of Health through the Directorate of Water and Sanitation (DISAPAS),
      responsible for sector policy, coordination, and long-term planning, as well as smaller
      towns and rural areas; (ii) the National Water and Sewerage Institute (IDAAN), responsi-
      ble for urban areas and rural communities with over 1,500 inhabitants; and (iii) the
      National Authority for Public Services (ASEP), which supervises and regulates service
      provision in urban areas. Multiple other actors play a role in the sector, including the
      National Environmental Authority (ANAM) for water quality standards, Autoridad del
      Canal de Panama (ACP) for selling bulk water to IDAAN, and the Ministry of the
      Presidency for high priority Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) service infrastructure.
      On the organizational side, unclear roles of the different agencies hamper effective
      regulation, and having multiple implementing agencies for infrastructure provision

  impedes coordination. Specialized rural water boards do not receive appropriate technical
  support to allow them to run their small systems with adequate cost recovery to ensure
  sustainability. Sector policy setting remains disjointed, with DISAPSAS unable to exercise
  its full mandate in strategic planning and oversight. This is due to other agencies executing
  infrastructure investments in parallel, with no single investment plan for the sector,
  leading to overlaps and the lack of a coherent vision. Finally, the regulatory function of
  the sector is clearly lacking, compared to other sectors in Panama, such as electricity and
  telecommunications. Water tariffs applied by IDAAN are very low and have not been
  revised since 1982, which means that if adjusted for inflations tariffs have actually
  decreased by about 50 percent since then. With a flat rate for high minimum consump-
  tion, even in metered areas, the tariff structure does not encourage water conservation,
  resulting in a significant gap in both operations and maintenance as well as investment
  needs, making IDAAN highly dependent on budget transfers. This state is further exacer-
  bated by high levels of nonrevenue water (54 percent in the City of Colón) and high
  staffing levels (5.3 per thousand water connections) that often lack the technical capacity
  for effective service provision and management.
  Note: With regard to the regulatory function, in 2014 ASEP drafted only 371 resolutions for the WSS sector, compared to 5578 and
  7834 for the electricity and telecommunications sectors respectively. Http://www.asep.gob.pa/.

  Box 7.1  La Purisima

  In December 2010, Panama experienced the longest rainstorm in the history of the Canal.
  La Purisima—so named because it took place near the day of the Immaculate Conception,
  December 8—posted a record 760 millimers of rainfall in 24 hours. The intense rain led to
  500 landslides that impacted approximately 9,000 people and caused a surge in turbidity
  of the water source to 700 NTU, causing the principal potable water plant for Panama City
  to collapse. As a result, parts of Panama City were left without water for 50 days. Canal
  operations were stalled for 17 hours; and for the fourth time in its history, the Autoridad
  del Canal de Panama (ACP) had to open the lock drains to lower water levels. In addition,
  the company charged with operating the Bayano Dam had to open its gates because the
  basin nearly reached its maximum capacity. This action resulted in the flooding of the
  town of El Llano in Chepo. Residents had to be evacuated and lost approximately US$6
  million in agricultural production and household structures. The total cost of La Purisima
  was estimated at US$150 million.

Panama has made significant progress in reducing poverty in recent years, progress that compares positively to
that of the rest of the Latin America and Caribbean region.

This report takes stock of this progress and reflects on the constraints and opportunities that Panama faces
in continuing on its path of shared prosperity and poverty reduction. The education and skills agenda, energy,
public sector reform, the inclusion of indigenous peoples, and water management are identified as areas that
will require attention to ensure the sustainability of Panama’s success story.

                                                                                                      factors—
Following a detailed analysis of poverty—recent trends, drivers of poverty reduction, and demographic ­
the report provides foundations to answer three main questions:

•	   What has driven growth in Panama in recent years?
•	   To what extent has this growth been, or not been, inclusive?
•	   How sustainable is the growth and more generally, the development model of Panama?
