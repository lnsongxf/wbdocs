BOX 1.1  Common Features of PIM in Donor-Dependent Countries

Public investment management (PIM) systems in donor-dependent settings tend to exhibit the
following distinctive features:
Investment guidance, project development and preliminary screening: government strategy docu-
ments, such as a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), tend to be directed towards the donors,
rather than covering both external and domestic investment in an integrated and coherent manner.
They are at a level of generality that limits the extent to which they can provide a basis for prelimi-
nary screening of projects, and are often not supported by effective sector strategies.
Formal project appraisal: there is a reliance on donors to conduct appraisal, with a serious lack of
appraisal capacity within government; and a lack of guidance on defining the project preparation
process and on how to appraise domestically-financed projects and PPPs. Donor capacity-building
on appraisal tends to be agency-specific, with little or no domestic training capacity.
Independent review of appraisal: reflecting reliance on donors, there is a lack of capacity for inde-
pendent review, either of donor projects or domestically-financed projects.
Project selection and budgeting: the budget is divided into a recurrent and a development budget,
with weak integration between the two and substantial off-budget aid. The use of Public Investment
Programs (PIPs) remains quite common, but these can be poorly connected to fiscal policy and the
budget. In practice, a PIP tends to be more a coordination tool than a tool to manage the project port-
folio strategically or to help enforce review of individual project proposals before they can be consid-
ered for budget funding. Agreement by a donor to finance a project is tantamount to the project being
included in the budget—subject to basic screening for consistency with a PRSP (which is not difficult
given their generality) and any required counterpart financing being affordable.
Project implementation: unpredictability of donor funding (especially budget support) interrupts
project implementation due to lack of alternative financing. Weak project management capacity
induces donors to set up multiple Project Implementation Units (PIUs) within implementing
agencies that initially help to speed implementation and compliance with fiduciary standards,
but which cut across and negatively impact on in-line capacities and accounting and reporting
systems. Procurement is undertaken by PIUs or donors to donor standards rather than national
procurement standards.
Project adjustment: reliance on donors to trigger review of any projects that are off-track. No simi-
lar mechanism for domestically-financed projects.
Facility operation: formal hand-over procedures on completion of donor projects, but inadequate
asset registration systems; and inadequate funding for operations and maintenance, in part due to
weak integration of recurrent costs of donor projects in fiscal policy and budgets.
Basic completion review and evaluation: reliance on donors to undertake reviews and evaluations of
their projects. Otherwise, little or no systematic basic post-project review, let alone evaluation, and
little systematic use made of findings from donor evaluations to ­ improve future project design and
implementation.

  BOX 1.2  Product Market Concentration Analysisa

  An analysis of product market concentration was conducted jointly between the World Bank and
  the Ministry of Economy and Finance of the Republic of Haiti with the collaboration of a team of
  researchers from Harvard and Columbia Universities.
  The analysis was based on Herfindahl-Hirschman indices (HHI), calculated using customs im-
  port data based on the Harmonized Coding System (HS) disaggregated at a four-digit level. The
  HS is a multipurpose international product nomenclature developed by the World Customs
  Organization.
  The HHI is a commonly accepted measure of market concentration based on market share esti-
  mates for each firm in the market. It is calculated by squaring the market share of each firm com-
  peting in a market (showing the relative space they occupy in the specific market being analyzed),
  and then summing up the resulting numbers for the fifty largest firms (or overall firms if the indus-
  try counts fewer than fifty companies). The HHI is preferred to other concentration measures (such
  as concentration ratio) because it accounts for the heterogeneity in the size of the firms in the mar-
  ket, giving more weight to larger firms.
  The HHI can range from close to zero to 10,000. The closer a market is to being a monopoly the
  higher the HHI. If, for example, there was only one firm in an industry (a monopolist), that firm
  would have 100 percent market share, and the HHI would be equal to 10,000 (100^2). Conversely,
  if there were thousands of firms competing in an industry, each firm would have nearly 0 percent
  market share, and the HH index would be close to zero.
  For the purpose of this analysis, the concentration levels based on the Horizontal Merger
  Guidelines (U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission) were used. As such, three
  HHI levels help identify the characteristics of product market concentration:
  •	 Unconcentrated Markets: HHI below 1,500.
  •	 Moderately Concentrated Markets: HHI between 1,500 and 2,500.
  •	 Highly Concentrated Markets: HHI above 2,500.

  BOX 2.1  Gender Inequalities in Haiti

  Women and girls in Haiti still face greater obstacles to attend school. Despite progress in school en-
  rollment among younger cohorts, adult women are still worse educated than adult men and are more
  likely to be illiterate. Adult men have, on average, two more years of education than women and are
  over 10 percentage points more likely to be literate. Early withdrawal from school can have lifelong
  consequences. Underage marriage and teen pregnancy, for instance, represent additional risks for
  girls who do not attend school: 17 percent of Haitian women are married in adolescence, compared
  with 2 percent of men, this number dropping among girls with higher education (Cicmil 2013).
  They deal with greater health challenges. Maternal mortality, at 380 deaths per 100,000 live births, is still
  five times higher than the regional average (WHO 2014)a, partly because a high percentage of birth de-
  liveries take place outside a health care facility (65 percent). Poor nutrition is a threat for both children
  and mothers: according to the MSPP, IHE, and ICF International (2013), 22 percent of children are
  stunted or too short for their age, while nearly half of women aged 15–49 have anemia. The prevalence
  of HIV/AIDS is higher among women (2.7 percent) than men (1.7 percent), reflecting both knowledge
  differentials among other factors: only 15 percent of young women have correct information on how to
  prevent sexual HIV transmission compared to 28 percent of young men (Boesten and Poku 2009).
  Women are significantly disadvantaged in the labor market. Holding constant several social and de-
  mographic characteristics, one finds that women are 20 percentage points more likely than men to
  be unemployed and, if working, 6 percentage points more likely to be in the informal sector. Wages
  among women are also 32 percent lower than wages among men. Over two-thirds of this difference
  is unexplained by observable characteristics, suggesting that discrimination could play a role.
  Gender-based violence is widespread. Gender-based violence is a chronic problem: according to the
  MSPP, IHE, and ICF International (2013), 13 percent of Haitian women have experienced sexual vio-
  lence, and 29 percent of women who have ever been married have experienced spousal violence,
  whether emotional, physical, or sexual. Vulnerability is particularly high among internally displaced
  people in camps and areas affected by the 2010 earthquake: a survey in 2011 indicated that 64 percent
  of interviewed pregnant adolescent girls had become pregnant after being raped (PotoFi 2012).
  Female participation in the public sphere is low. Only 4 percent of all parliamentary seats were occupied
  by women in the most recent legislature, placing Haiti well below the regional average of 26 percent and
  among the countries with the lowest rate (136th out of 142 countries). At the national level, as of April
  2014, 8 of 23 ministers and 3 of 20 secretaries of state were women.b At the local level, women account
  for only 12 percent of all mayors. The government has taken steps to expand women’s representation,
  including by creating the Gender Equality Office in Parliament and amending the Constitution to stip-
  ulate a quota of at least 30 percent women in all public offices, but enforcement is problematic.

BOX 3.1  Petrocaribe and Haiti

The Petrocaribe initiative, created in 2005, has 18 members.a The agreement aims to promote
cooperation among state energy operators, in terms of technology, energy policy, joint exploration,
refining, sales and investment in the energy sector. The most relevant aspect of the Petrocaribe
agreement is the stable supply of oil from Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela to other members,
at favorable financing conditions. Through the agreement, Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela
commits to providing oil to the members based on quotas established bilaterally at international
market prices. Haiti joined the initiative in March 2007 and started benefiting from the agreement
in October 2007, with a quota of 14 thousand barrels per day (b/d). However, only a fraction of the
bill needs to be paid in cash, the remaining is financed on concessional terms.

The sale of these oil products in the domestic market creates considerable resources for
the government. Since 2008, the Petrocaribe flows have amounted cumulatively to
25 percent of GDP. An autonomous agency of the Ministry of Finance (the Bureau de
Monétisation du Programme d’Aide au Développement, BMPAD) manages these resources
on behalf of the Haitian government. BMPAD plays an intermediary role between Haitian
fuel purchasers and the Venezuelan supplier.
Petrocaribe resources have been used to finance investment and social projects, as well as
support the electricity sector. Whenever the government decides that new projects will be
financed using these resources, it publishes a resolution listing these projects and the
amounts to be financed in the official gazette. Disbursements into the projects are re-
ported in BMPAD’s webpage on a regular basis. These projects suffer nevertheless from
the same shortcomings than the rest of the Public Investment Program, notably a lack of
proper assessment, prioritization and monitoring (see box 1.1). A recent audit of these in-
vestments by the CSCCA highlights serious shortcomings in the procurement and super-
vision of contracts, including over-priced infrastructure and abandoned projects.

  BOX 4.1  Drivers of Conflict in Haiti—An Empirical Analysisa

  In order to understand better the role of various socio-economic factors in explaining the ebbs and
  flows of conflict across Haiti in the 2000s, a cross-sectional analysis across the 42 Haitian arron-
  dissements was run. This strategy has the advantage of allowing us to control for national level fac-
  tors that may not be properly observable in cross-country analyses and may be endogenous to
  conflict. In addition the within-country analysis relies on a more homogenous definition of con-
  flict events than a cross-country analysis, although coming at a cost of not allowing for the investi-
  gation of the role of factors that do not vary across spatial units or over the period of analysis, such
  as the political regime and the oligopolistic nature of the economy.
  We used data on conflict events from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) Project,
  which collects and codes media reports on civil and communal conflicts, militia interactions, vio-
  lence against civilians, rioting, and protests across various countries since 1997. In the case of Haiti
  the data is available between 1997 and July 2010. We aggregated the individual conflict events at the
  department and sub-department (“Arrondissement”) level to construct time varying conflict inten-
  sity measures at our unit of analysis.
  We complement these data with data on crimes collected by MINUSTAH mainly on the basis of
  Haiti National Police (HNP) reports. These data are more recent, covering the period 2010 to
  September 2014, although not strictly comparable with the conflict events data as they include a
  broad variety of criminal activities, such as robberies, thefts, homicides, rapes, illegal possession of
  firearms. Most of these events are not related to political violence or political actions as it is the case
  for the events recorded by ACLED. Nevertheless, they provide a useful additional dimension and
  allow us to gauge the latest developments in violence in Haiti.
  The results of our analysis suggest that violence in Haiti in the last decade tends to be predomi-
  nantly an urban phenomenon. Both political violence and criminal activities are concentrated in
  urban centers. A higher share of immigrants from other areas of the country is also associated with
  higher conflict intensity. This result is mainly driven by the fact that a higher migrants’ share is as-
  sociated with a lower presence of social networks (measured as extended families and kinship),
  which reduce conflict. The analysis would also indicate that past conflict and land ownership are all
  important correlates of violence.
  In addition, the results suggest that economic shocks matter a great deal in explaining the pattern
  of conflict in Haiti. In particular, increases in remittances are associated with a reduction in conflict
  intensity, consistent with the idea that by raising incomes they raise the opportunity cost of partici-
  pating into violent activities. Finally, the evidence suggests that election periods amplify the effect
  of economic shocks on conflict.

  BOX 4.2  Electricité d’Haïti (EDH)

  Due to poor management, the performance of the national, vertically integrated electricity utility
  Electricité d’Haïti (EDH) has deteriorated over time. Worsening commercial performance has led
  to a lack of infrastructure maintenance and has rapidly deteriorated the quality of electricity ser-
  vice, including frequent service interruptions and large voltage fluctuations. The sector’s institu-
  tional framework is obsolete (e.g., not allowing EDH to tap into important renewable energy
  potential), sector policies are out of date, planning and monitoring of sector activities is inade-
  quate, and vested interests have hampered reform efforts. The effect of the earthquake on power
  generation, transmission, and distribution further aggravated EDH’s weak performance by delay-
  ing key modernization activities (e.g., new billing system and the rehabilitation of the Peligre hy-
  dropower plant). In 2015, EDH’s losses stood at 57 percent of the electricity generated (of which
  commercial losses represented nearly 35 percent).
  EDH’s weak grid infrastructure, poor commercial performance, and inadequate controls over sub-
  contracted electricity generation by independent power producers (IPPs) have led to a financial
  drain on government resources. Due to its inability to meet electricity demand and in an attempt
  to expand electricity availability, EDH has subcontracted part of the production of electricity to
  IPPs.a Unable to cover its operating expenses, including fuel costs and power purchases in part be-
  cause of low bill collection rates, EDH has relied on fiscal transfers from the Treasury averaging
  US$200 million annually in recent years (equivalent to 10 percent of the national budget and 1–2
  percent of GDP).b
  Past governance reforms to preserve the integrity of public resource management in the electric-
  ity sector have produced modest results. Achievements to-date include: (a) EDH Commercial
  Recovery action plans (2012–2013; 2013–2014; and 2014–2015); (b) a National Directions Paper
  (endorsed by Cabinet on September 15, 2013); and (c) a government Energy White Paper (in
  draft). Since 2014, an active dialogue on the management and reform of the energy sector has
  been initiated within the government’s Energy Commission and with the strategic partners in the
  sector.
  a. IPPs provided 60 percent of total electricity generation in 2011.
  b. Electricity transfers are unbounded due to their dependence on international oil prices, electricity supply, unsanctioned theft and
  bill non-payment, inter alia.

   BOX 5.1  Benchmarking the Drivers of Shared Prosperity: An Application
   to Haitia

   We estimate economic magnitudes for key correlates of income growth at the mean, the bottom 40
   and 20 percent of the income distribution across a set of about 100 countries. While econometric
   exercises investigating determinants of GDP growth have been numerous, less is known about fac­
   tors influencing household incomes at different segments of the income distribution. Empirical
   work by Dollar and Kraay (2002) and Dollar, Kleineberg, and Kraay (2013) broadly rejects the
   idea that other factors than mean income growth would influence incomes of the poor, thus sug­
   gesting that growth would be mostly distribution neutral, whereas other studies have attempted to
   outline key drivers of pro-poor growth (e.g., Bourguignon 2003; Ravallion and Chen 2007;
   Christiaensen, Punam, and Sanoh 2013). Our results add to this discussion and suggest that some
   factors indeed allow growth to be more beneficial for the bottom 40 or 20 percent of the income
   distribution.
   Our data set is mainly based on Dollar, Kleineberg, and Kraay (2013). The data covers household data
   from the World Bank’s POVCALNET and the Luxembourg Income Study databases. Household
   income data is organized in “spells,” i.e., income changes between two survey years, calculated as
   average annual log differences.b These are calculated for average income, income at the bottom 20
   percent or the bottom 40 percent. We focus on those non-overlapping spells that are at least five
   years long, providing 299 spells for 117 countries with a median spell length of 6 years, which is
   also the preferred sample of Dollar, Kleineberg, and Kraay (2013). To this data, we add macroeco­
   nomic variables, especially measures of political stability or institutions that are of particular inter­
   est for Haiti.
   Based on a fixed effect estimation, the results confirm that the income at the bottom 20 and 40
   percent grow with mean income. The estimated effect is a little smaller than previously thought, al­
   though the estimated elasticity around 0.85 is statistically not significantly different from one. We
   also find that better health and education outcomes, as well as lower political instability, have an
   economically relevant effect for income growth that goes beyond the effect via mean income (i.e., it
   is stronger at the bottom of the distribution).

Azam (2001) observed that “the occurrence of civil conflict is intimately related to the failure of gov­
ernment to deliver the type of public expenditure that people want; i.e., with a strong redistributive
component such as health and education.” Governments could thus foster their legitimacy, and thereby
reduce the risk of conflict, by signaling that they care about their population. This could be done in a
variety of ways, such as increased spending for water sanitation, securing basic health needs, or provid­
ing a strong system of education (Stasavage 2005).

(2006) suggests that education promotes social cohesion by encouraging students to cultivate interper­
sonal skills and thus learn how to resolve disputes peacefully.
Our empirical analysis covers 148 countries over 1960–2009 and uses a random effects logit model
with regional dummies and a set of standard control variables to predict the probability of conflict.
To measure the onset of violent conflict, we used the Armed Conflict Dataset (ACD) from the
Uppsala Conflict Data Program PRIO for years 1960–2009 (Gleditsch et al. 2002, Version 4.1.) to
generate a dichotomous variable that takes the value of one in years with a new conflict onset and
zero otherwise. This dataset has become the standard reference for cross-country analyses of con­
flict determinants. The onset of conflict was defined with those above a threshold of 25 battle
deaths per year.
The results suggest that higher welfare expenditure (education, health and social) is associated with
lower risk of conflict. In order to simulate the effects for Haiti, the coefficients of the cross-country
regression were taken and all variables in the model set at their average for Haiti with the exception
for welfare spending that we let vary. The Figure above illustrates the reduction in the risk on con­
flict onset associated with higher welfare spending.

   BOX 5.3  Bank-Sponsored Competition of Academic Papers

   In order to foster research and debate, a call was issued for research papers identifying the most
   critical constraints and opportunities facing Haiti in accelerating progress toward the goals of end­
   ing extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The competition was
   open to all Haitian scholars and was intended to provide a Haitian perspective to the debate, as well
   as identify any issue that the existing literature may have over-looked.
   This proposal and the rules were prepared with the Deans of the universities present in Port-au-
   Prince. The competition was widely advertised in academic circles and in regular newspapers, and
   submissions were received from Haiti (Port-au-Prince and Cap Haïtien), Canada and the United
   States. The papers were reviewed by a panel of World Bank researchers and leading Haitian figures,
   including the Presidents of the Association of Haitian Economists, the Haitian Arbitration and
   Mediation Division, and the North-East Chamber of Commerce, as well as professors from the
   American University and the Autonomous University of Mexico.
   The three winners were awarded cash prizes for their contributions and presented their work at a
   conference at the State University of Haiti in November, 2014. The event was attended by represen­
   tatives from academia, civil society, government, and the international community. This was an
   opportunity to discuss issues related to inequality, inadequate competition and economic opportu­
   nities, and the absence of a social contract between the State and its citizens which, among other is­
   sues, were identified by the participants as impediments to growth.
   More particularly, while the papers submitted varied in approaches and emphases, they converged
   on a common set of themes underscoring Haiti’s scarcity of human and institutional capital. Most
   authors agreed that Haiti’s history of violence, exclusion, and foreign interference explained the
   country’s difficulty in developing a shared national vision for its future, as well as the needed insti­
   tutions and social capital to implement it. All papers argued that aid dependence and the interfer­
   ence of external governmental and non-governmental actors continued to prevent Haiti from
   developing home-grown solutions and institutional capacity. In this regard, authors stressed the
   State’s ineffectiveness in fulfilling basic functions, such as enforcing the rule of law, collecting taxes,
   and delivering services. Poor outcomes in education were seen by most as a principal cause of
   Haiti’s poor governance, lack of competitiveness, low productivity, and high unemployment.
   Urbanization and population growth were identified as major contributors to vulnerability, and the
   need for a more balanced spatial organization of the country was underscored.
