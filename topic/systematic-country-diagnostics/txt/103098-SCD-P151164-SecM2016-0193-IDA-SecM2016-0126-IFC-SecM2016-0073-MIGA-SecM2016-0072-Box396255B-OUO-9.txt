                                 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.      This document presents the Systematic Country Diagnosis (SCD) for Cameroon. It
identifies how to achieve the twin goals of ending poverty and improving shared prosperity by
2030 in a sustainable manner. These objectives are considered to overlap because the incidence of
poverty, using the national poverty line, is 38 percent. The document thus focuses on reducing
headcount poverty. The objectives of the World Bank are closely associated with those of the
Government of Cameroon which aims in its Growth and Employment Strategy (DSCE) to achieve,
by 2035, higher middle income status and to reduce poverty to 10 percent.

2.      Cameroon is rich in natural resources and has a population of approximately 22.8
million relatively well educated people. With a per capita Gross Domestic Product of US$1,429
(current prices) in 2014, Cameroon is a lower middle income country. However many social
indicators reflect those of a low income country: life expectancy is 54 years and levels of
malnutrition are high for instance. Twenty-eight percent of children under five are stunted.

3.      Cameroon is culturally and geographically diverse. The country can be divided into five
agro-ecological zones each with a different agriculture production system. The northern, Sudano-
Sahelian zone extends into the Sahel and comprises largely the North and Far North regions.
Pastoralism is widespread here along with the cultivation of relatively drought tolerant crops such
as sorghum, millet, maize and cotton. The same holds for the Adamawa region, which falls in the
Guinea-Savanah zone. In the forest zone of the South rainfall is more favorable. The area has low
population density and many of the country’s cash crops (oil palm, cocoa) are grown here. A
distinction can be made between the bimodal rainfall zone of the coast and the unimodal rainfall
in the South and the East. Finally the Plateau in the North West of the country is characterized by
an agro-pastoral system. Coffee is the main cash crop grown here.

4.      The analytical framework combines a micro-economic approach with an exploration
to discern which macro-economic pathways to economic growth and development might be
most appropriate. The core analytical framework is based on the notion that to reduce poverty,
household consumption has to increase. This can be done, for given income, by ensuring that
consumption goods –and particularly food become cheaper. Alternatively, the household budget
constraint can be alleviated by increasing the incomes of self-employed households, by enhancing
opportunities for wage employment, or by redistributing income from the non-poor to the poor.
The document also explores the relevance of two pathways to economic development: the classical
one of economic transformation which starts with generating higher incomes in agriculture, and
an accelerated pathway whereby the economy jumps to industrialization or high value added
service delivery through import substitution, export promotion or open-economy policies.

5.      The first aspect that is explored is the nature of poverty and the opportunities to raise
the incomes of poor households. Poverty is found to remain high. In 2014, 38 percent of the
population lived below the national poverty line. Poverty incidence is much lower in urban than
in rural areas (10 versus 57 percent) and 90 percent of all poor people live in rural areas. Even
though there is a rapid pace of urbanization, without changes in the levels of rural poverty, poverty
is expected to remain mostly a rural phenomenon.

                                                 ix
6.       Poverty is increasingly concentrated in the northern parts of the country. The number
of poor in the North and Far North regions has more than doubled between 2001 and 2014 from
2.1 million to 4.5 million, representing 56 percent of all poor in the country in 2014. People living
in the northern regions are affected by multiple poverty traps including an unfavorable climate,
exposure to shocks, degrading soils, low levels of education (particularly for women), inadequate
nutrition, isolation and limited market access, inadequate productive asset ownership and high
fertility. Many of these factors reinforce each other: low female education contributes to high child
mortality and high fertility, which in turn increases pressures on land. A short and variable rainy
season and few capital lead to low levels of production, indebtedness and malnutrition. These in
turn limit opportunities to invest in tools and productive assets, human capital or improved farming
technologies. For those who do invest, limited market access reduces the incentives to produce a
surplus.

7.      Northern Cameroon is also the area where Boko Haram is active. Since 2014 poverty
is likely to have increased rapidly as a consequence of the associated insecurity, the closing of
markets, roads and borders and the large numbers of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and
refugees. The insecurity and harm caused by Boko Haram is tremendous: one consequence is that
many development efforts have come to a halt until the security situation improves.

8.      Poverty has been on the decline in the central and coastal areas, creating a north-
south divide that is deepening over time. The contrast between northern and southern Cameroon
is stark. Whereas in the northern part per capita consumption declined since 2001 (by about 15
percent), it increased in the south (by approximately 50 percent). The commensurate decline in
poverty in the southern part of the country is attributed to favorable world market prices for export
crops, artisanal gold mining, and an urbanization process that creates positive spillovers to rural
areas through increased demand for produce, transfers and opportunities for work.

9.      The north-south cleavage also holds for social services. Relative to other lower middle
income countries the public sector spends little on health and education. Moreover the public
resources are used inefficiently and inequitably. Relative to comparator countries, the outcomes
achieved, given the level of spending, are limited. Additionally, there are grave disparities in per
capita spending between the north and the south. As a consequence a large variation in outcomes
exists. While overall there have been improvements –access to education increased significantly
for instance, the gap between north and south is widening. Illustrative is the difference in the
median years of female education: this is zero years in the North and Far North regions and almost
10 years in Yaoundé and Douala.

10.     The economy remains predominantly rural and informal: 47 percent of the population
resides in rural areas; 90 percent of jobs are in the informal sector. The formal sector is largely
located in Yaoundé and Douala, respectively the administrative capital and the largest port city,
and is highly concentrated. Less than 1 percent of all registered firms generate 68 percent of all
revenues. Exports comprise almost exclusively primary products: revenue from petrol makes up
43 percent of all export proceeds followed by timber, 13 percent.

11.    Cameroon has experienced positive rates of economic growth ever since the major
collapse of the economy in the late 1980s. Since 1994 and in no small part thanks to prudent
macro-economic policies and the overall stability of the country, growth rates have been positive.

                                                 x
Recently they have been accelerating thanks to favorable terms of trade and a large public
investment program. Despite a long period of growth and macro-stability the levels of per capita
income attained in the 1980s have not yet been recovered. Cameroon reached the Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) completion point in 2006, but debt levels are increasing rapidly and
unsustainably, creating for the first time in 30 years concerns about macro stability.

12.     Opportunities for rapid growth and poverty reduction are huge thanks to favorable
initial conditions. These include a location on the coast, a favorable climate, natural resource
wealth, a relatively skilled population, and a qualified administration. However, opportunities for
poverty reduction can easily be lost. A distinguishing feature between rich and poor countries is
not the fact that rich countries grow faster (they don’t), but that they tend to be able to avoid deep
recessions of the type Cameroon experienced in the early 1990s and from which the country is still
recovering. Economic stability requires cautious public financial management, prudent public
investment planning and careful debt management. Security is a sine-qua non for economic growth
and eliminating the threat posed by Boko Haram is a priority. Political stability needs to remain
assured, a major challenge in the face of multiple elections, a restless young population and a
pending presidential transition.

13.     The economy does not yet show signs of transformation other than through
urbanization as a result of which people move from low productivity agriculture into more
productive informal tertiary sector activities. The technical knowledge embedded in the
economy, assessed by the kinds of goods that are being exported, suggests that the degree of
economic complexity remains very low. The knowledge embedded in the economy is far from
what is needed for large scale industrialization or successful export promotion. Meanwhile an
unattractive business climate does not put the economy in the right place for leapfrogging by
embracing an open access approach. An import substitution approach is not a good option either
given the fact that political considerations tend to trump economic ones as evidenced by the many
loss making state owned enterprises that continue to be supported.

14.     A growth strategy rooted in structural transformation has a lot of potential for rapid
poverty reduction. In this transformation process agricultural and livestock output grow by
expanding the area under cultivation and through productivity gains, powered by the adoption of
new technologies. As the share of food consumers relative to food producers grows though
urbanization, markets become more important, the non-farm and agribusiness sectors grow and
the food value chain and rural-urban linkages are strengthened. As incomes grow, second order
effects are likely to emerge over time: the stock of human and physical capital increases as
households invest part of their increased incomes. This leads to further productivity gains, and to
migration of (now better)-educated people to urban areas, which supports the realization of
positive agglomeration effects. It also unlocks demographic transition, in part because women
marry later. Cameroon is well placed to follow such a process and has already embarked on it in
the south of the country. Cameroon has comparative advantages in agro-processing and livestock
production and is well placed to serve a sub-region that has high purchasing power and is
structurally deficient in food. Rapid urbanization, in addition, is likely to increase the demand for
high-income elasticity goods such as fruit, meat, eggs and milk.

15.    A growth strategy that starts with increased agro-processing is more likely to be pro-
poor than the growth process observed to date. The pattern of growth between 2001 and 2014
was such that the poorest 40 percent of households got worse-off, while the top 60 percent got

                                                 xi
better off. The process of growth did not favor the poorest. A growth strategy that focuses on
products cultivated by the poorest has a greater likelihood of successful poverty reduction. As the
majority of the poor can be found in the rural areas of northern Cameroon, a poverty reducing
growth strategy would focus on the value chain development of coarse grains (maize, millet, and
sorghum) but also livestock, beans and cotton, which is the main cash crop grown in this zone.

16.    Low farm productivity and limited market access are identified as main constraints
to increased incomes throughout the country. In northern Cameroon inadequate female
education is found to be another major constraint to poverty reduction. It is worth noting that
technologies to increase farm productivity readily exist. There is much knowledge in Cameroon’s
multiple farm research institutions on how to increase productivity of smallholder farmers in
climate smart ways. The main issue is the adoption of these technologies by farmers.

17.     Redistribution is another effective way to reduce poverty of the most vulnerable and
to increase productivity. Simulations demonstrate that, depending on the growth scenario, a
social safety net that redistributes 1 to 3 percent of GDP could bring the poverty targets of the
DSCE and the World Bank within reach. This amounts to less than is currently spent on ill-targeted
food and fuel subsidies and import tax exemptions. Moreover, productive social safety nets have
been found to contribute to income growth for the poorest households, because the proceeds of the
safety net are used for income generating activities. Conditional transfers have been found to be
efficient ways of changing practices relevant to improving human capital, such as sending girls to
school, ensuring child vaccination, and promoting breast feeding.

18.    For a structural transformation strategy to succeed, but also to unlock opportunities
for export led growth, the business environment will need to improve. A high cost of doing
business and a continued reliance on a state-led model of economic growth, create an unattractive
investment climate for private entrepreneurs – domestic as well as foreign. The costs of doing
business are high as roads are inadequate and poorly maintained. Electricity is costly and
unreliable. Port services are expensive and inefficient. Telecom services are costly and inadequate,
as are access to water and banking services. The business environment is affected by a high
regulatory burden, a complex tax system and a plethora of direct state interventions in the economy
varying from import tax exemptions, to price caps, to loss making state owned enterprises.

19.    To attain higher middle income status by 2035, growth needs to accelerate further,
requiring a substantial increase in the level of investments from 20 to 32 percent of GDP.
The public sector alone cannot bring this about, necessitating much more private investment.
Doing so requires major improvements in the business environment, to increase the efficiency of
the economy and its ability to innovate. An improved business environment would also ensure an
acceptable rate of return on the ongoing public sector investments in ports, roads, and energy
generation and distribution.

20.    Cameroon’s political settlement circles around a dominant leader. It has ensured the
nation’s stability and has allowed its growth performance. However, it has also contributed to
the poor business environment, the state-led growth orientation and the inadequate service
delivery. In this settlement the President has forged stability by co-opting a large number of
powerful elites from the economic, traditional, administrative, political and military spheres. This
co-optation has been inclusive and representatives from all major ethnic, religious or other
groupings are represented. It helped create a stable nation in an otherwise restive neighborhood.

                                                xii
The ‘price’ paid for this is unmet economic and development potential. High levels of corruption
and economic inefficiency, limited transparency and accountability, a fragmented bureaucracy, a
bloated public enterprise sector, and inertia in decision making limit the scope for economic
growth and poverty reduction.

21.    Many policy reforms needed to unlock the potential for poverty reduction, touch the
core of Cameroon’s political stability and may affect the interests of those sustaining the
balance of power. This poses a dilemma for accelerated poverty reduction. Governance is a core
constraint for poverty reduction, but improvements in governance may come at the expense of the
nation’s stability which is equally critical for poverty reduction.

22.     Opportunistically exploiting reform opportunities and investing in increased
resilience and local development approaches are the most realistic way of dealing with this
complex policy environment. Opportunities for reform do arise, as has been demonstrated in the
power sector, where private investors now finance the latest hydro-dam, the railway sector or with
the introduction of performance based pay in the health sector. Local approaches need to be
explored more widely to do justice to the great diversity of Cameroon’s physical environment and
because stronger local organization –whether production oriented farmer organizations, or
community based organizations for social accountability, can strengthen risk coping mechanism,
increase sustainability, and act as barrier to elite capture.

23.    The binding constraints presented below stress the measures to preserve stability and
unlock Cameroon’s potential for poverty reduction. They are informed by in-country
consultations and pay particular attention to the plight of people living in the northern parts of the
country. These binding constraints were endorsed by the country team and follow from the
evidence presented in the report. They are:

   Low rural productivity, particularly in northern Cameroon
   A non-conducive business environment for the formal and informal private sector
   Fragility and poor governance of the public and private sector

24.     To address the low rural productivity constraint (i) climate smart farming technologies
and livestock management systems; (ii) improved human capital –particularly for women;
(iii) improved market access; and (iv) productive safety nets were considered the top
priorities in terms of contribution to poverty reduction and political feasibility. Greater
selectivity could be obtained by focusing on value chains that are most relevant for poor farmers,
food crops, livestock but also cotton.

25.      To address the non-conducive business environment constraint (i) reforming higher
education to give more attention to skills training; (ii) reducing the cost of transport; (iii)
reforming the financial sector; and (iv) improving the energy supply were considered top
priorities; followed by (v) investments in sustainable cities, reforming (vi) the telecom sector
and (vii) the urban water sector were considered top priorities to promoting poverty
reduction. The ability to implement these reforms is affected by politically feasibility. It is
noteworthy that investments in the energy sector, ranked fourth in terms of contribution to poverty
reduction, was considered most feasible, a reflection of the success of past reforms in this field.
Reforming the financial sector, ranked 3rd in terms of contribution to poverty reduction, was ranked
5th in terms of political feasibility. The presence of a disconnect between political feasibility and

                                                 xiii
contribution to poverty reduction combined with the fact that in many areas policy reforms need
to precede investments, reinforces the notion that an opportunistic approach is critical.

26.     To address the fragility and governance constraint (i) improving public financial
management; (ii) strengthening the business environment; (iii) reforming public sector
incentives; and (iv) improving the security of land tenure were found to be the main priorities
to poverty reduction, followed by (v) improving transparency and accountability, (vi) a
greater analytical capacity to identify and argue for reforms and (vii) improving the legal
system. Even more than in the previous cluster there is a disconnect between political feasibility
and contribution to poverty reduction, so selectivity will need to happen by opportunistically
identifying reforms that have the greatest likelihood of success. At times reforms may have to be
partial: for instance, reforming incentives in the civil service as a whole was ranked 5th for
feasibility, but results based financing has already been successfully introduced in the health
sector. There may be potential to build on this for example in the education sector.

27.     Measures to address fragility were not prioritized because addressing the many
causes of fragility was considered a pre-condition for any developmental activities. A number
of measures that would contribute to reducing fragility have already been identified: better road
connectivity between north and south Cameroon; productive safety nets aimed at the nation’s most
vulnerable; support to targeted value chains and the cotton sector which is in financial difficulties
and Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms to improve debt management and to bring about
more equitable and efficient public spending. A number of cross cutting measures were also
identified: relying more on decentralized, local, participatory approaches to strengthen resilience
and empowerment, strengthening the compact between citizen and state and improving the
coordination between development and humanitarian partners were considered particularly
important. Many of these measures can be implemented within existing programs. For instance
increasing productivity can very well be done using local, participatory, approaches.

28.     The particularly precarious situation of people living in northern Cameroon is
addressed throughout the three areas of constraints. The first area of constraints focuses
specifically on northern Cameroon. Spatially blind policies promoted in constraint areas two and
three imply that northern Cameroon, which presently is underserved, will benefit particularly from
a catch up effect as measures assuring equal treatment with respect to budget allocations, reducing
transport costs or improving access to rural financial services, energy and telecommunication
services take effect.

29.      Tropical forest preservation is not identified as priority for poverty reduction but it
is important from a perspective of (global) environmental sustainability. Low population
density in Cameroon’s tropical forest zone imply that preservation of biodiversity in the Congo
Basin Forest does not feature amongst the binding constraints for poverty reduction. However, the
unique biodiversity of this area, its contribution to climate change mitigation and the unique habitat
it offers for people dependent upon the forest makes forest preservation an important global public
good.

                                       1.    CONTEXT


Cameroon is a lower-middle income country with social indicators and levels of poverty which
are below those for comparator countries. Large and rising inequalities between north and south,
inefficiencies in public resource allocation and an adverse business environment explain this.
While insecurity due to Boko Haram activities and rapidly rising public debt constrain efforts at
poverty reduction, there exists a huge potential for economic growth and poverty reduction. This
potential remains mostly untapped. Realizing it will require far reaching reforms, particularly
with respect to the business environment and public financial management, and require politically
courage to accomplish.

1.1    Introduction

1.       Cameroon is in many ways defined by its location, diversity and an abundance of
natural resources. Cameroon’s territory stretches as far as Lake Chad in the north, an area mostly
suited for extensive livestock rearing, to the plantation agriculture and dense tropical forests of the
south, with in between the lush, fertile cropping systems of the center. Cameroon is the custodian
of important global public goods in the form of a rich and disappearing biodiversity, especially,
but not only, in the Congo basin rain forest. The country links a densely populated West Africa
(about 300 million inhabitants) with a forested and less densely populated Central Africa (about
150 million strong). Cameroon is home to approximately 250 ethnic groups. In certain areas in
northern Cameroon the largely Muslim Fulani community is dominant, while Christians (Catholics
and Protestants) dominate the south. A number of traditional beliefs and practices are also present.
Two regions are Anglophone (North-West and South-West regions, bordering Nigeria), while the
rest of the country is Francophone.

2.      As the meeting point of two Africas and at the heart of the Gulf of Guinea, Cameroon
is at once the gateway to the economy of Central Africa and a trade route between the
economies of West and Central Africa. The port of Douala plays a decisive role in the economy
as do the road and rail networks that radiate toward its hinterlands. Cameroon controls the flow
of exports and imports out of and into the Central African Republic (CAR) and Chad and the north
of the Republic of Congo. The pipeline built to export Chadian oil at the beginning of this century
passes through Cameroon on its way to Kribi. Niger will be linked to the Chad-Cameroon pipeline
and is expected to begin exporting oil by 2016. Ninety percent of goods destined for Central Africa
pass through the port of Douala, so delays there have a disastrous impact not only on Cameroon’s
economy but also on the economies of the neighboring CAR and Chad. Cameroon dominates the
Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) with 44 percent of the
community’s GDP, 39 percent of its exports, and it maintains a trade surplus with all of its partners
except Equatorial Guinea. Nigeria has long been Cameroon’s most important trade partner and,
sharing a 600-mile common border, is now Cameroon’s most important security problem as well.

3.     Cameroon has great growth potential. A lower middle income country with a population
of 22.8 million people, vast natural resources, and a capable bureaucracy, Cameroon has great
opportunities for rapid economic development. Indeed over the last decade the country has been

                                                  1
characterized by positive economic growth. Spurred by large public investments in infrastructure,
the last years showed an increase in economic growth—with growth reaching 4.6 per cent in 2012,
and an estimated 5.6 to 5.9 per cent between 2013 and 2015. This is, nevertheless, not enough to
achieve the middle income objective, as formulated in the DSCE, nor is it necessarily sustainable:
Cameroon’s debt levels have increased markedly and in November 2015, a Debt Sustainability
Analysis prepared by the Bretton Woods institutions put the country at high risk of debt distress.

4.       Cameroon is urbanizing rapidly. According to the United Nations (UN) population
statistics almost 11 million Cameroonians lived in rural areas in 2015 and 13 million in urban
areas.1 By 2030 the number of Cameroonians living in rural areas is expected to increase by
approximately 2 million, whereas the number of urban dwellers is expected to increase by 8
million.2 Rapid urbanization creates challenges for city planning as demands on urban land
increase. This gives rise to a new set of social tensions, as more people from diverse backgrounds
live close together and as the absolute number of disenfranchised citizens in one location increases.

5.      Poverty remains a rural phenomenon and is increasingly concentrated in northern
Cameroon. In 2014, and using the national poverty line, poverty incidence was 38 percent.3 Less
than 10 percent of the poor live in urban areas; more than 90 percent in rural areas. A combination
of high population density and high rates of poverty imply that 56 percent of all poor are located
in the north of the country (North and Far North regions). This reflects a rapid increase as in 2001
‘only’ 34 percent of the poor lived in these two regions.

6.      The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have not been achieved. With 38 percent
of the population living below the poverty line in 2014, the MDG objective of 25 percent poverty

Prospects: The 2014 Revision, CD-ROM Edition.

  The national poverty line is slightly higher than the international US$1.90 poverty line. Using the latter poverty line,
poverty incidence in Cameroon is estimated to be 27 percent in 2014.

                                                            2
by 2015 remained unattained. Most of the other MDGs were not achieved either. The mortality
rate for children under five had to fall to 45/1,000 by 2015 but was 103/1,000 in 2014. The maternal
mortality rate had to fall to 108/100,000 live births in 2015 but was 782/100,000 live births in
2011. The incidence of underweight children had to decrease to 9 percent by 2015 to achieve the
related MDG but the actual figure was 15 percent. Even with respect to education, an area in
which considerable progress was made, Cameroon failed to meet the MDGs. In 2014, 74 percent
completed primary school, 26 percent shortfall of the MDG objective.

7.      Unity plays a critical role in Cameroon’s political settlement. Initially a German colony,
it was divided after World War I into a British protectorate and French Equatorial Africa. The
period leading up to the creation of an independent state not only featured a struggle between the
nationalist movement and the French colonial power, but also a territorial issue—whether
Anglophone Cameroon should be integrated into Francophone Cameroon. When the territory
controlled by the British was divided in 1961, the northern part voted to join Nigeria and the
southern part was joined with Francophone Cameroon. Ever since, the desire to unify the country
has been an important aspect of Cameroon’s political landscape.4 For instance since President
Biya, who is from the south, assumed power in 1982, and until 1992, the prime minister has been
a northerner and the president of the National Assembly has been an Anglophone. After 1992, the
prime minister has been an Anglophone, and the president of the national assembly a northerner.5
Other divisions, based on ethnic affiliation or religion, are also carefully balanced within the
administration.

  Cameroon, for instance, celebrates its Unity Day on the day that the Anglophone regions decided to join Cameroon
instead of Nigeria, but does not celebrate an Independence Day.

  The recent creation of the Senate in 2013 added another southerner to the triumvirate—ensuring the balance of
power is preserved in a transition Government if the President were to pass away.

8.       Easy access to natural resource rents helped finance a governance system6 in which
the President has a firm grip on power through centralization of decision making, co-
optation of elites and reliance on loyal security forces. Cameroon is one of the most centralized
states in Africa. Decision-making powers lay more within the Presidency than in individual
ministries whose mandates are fragmented and overlapping. The President, who is above the fray
and who is widely respected,7 has broad powers of appointment and job-transfers as well as great
control over the state’s finances, which are used to co-opt the elites. The political opposition is
fragmented with 291 officially registered political parties in 2013 (INS, 2013). The ruling party,
the Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement (CPDM) is strong – it currently occupies 148 out
of the 180 National Assembly’s seats, and electoral rules favour the party in power.8 Public interest
in politics is very low, as demonstrated by low voter turnout, estimated at 30 percent based on the
2014 Afrobarometer Survey.9 Civil society is diversified but fragmented and mostly ineffective in
demanding accountability. There is a large number of media outlets, but their technical and
financial capacities are low. The judiciary is weak and largely dependent on the executive. The
anti-corruption agency (Comité National Anti-Corruption, CONAC), is fully dependent on, and
accountable to the Presidency.

  Gautier and Zeufack (2009) argue for instance that it's possible that only about 46 percent of total oil revenues
accruing to the Government between 1977 and 2006 were implemented into the federal budget, while remaining
revenues went unaccounted for.

  At the same time, an overwhelming majority (74 percent) supports a two-term constitutional limit on the presidency.
8
  For instance, the Senate comprises of 100 members, 10 from each region. Of these 10, three are presidential
appointees and the seven others are elected. So to attain a majority in the senate the presidential party only has to win
three out of the seven seats up for a vote in each region. In practise the CPDM holds 82 seats in the Senate.

  According to the same survey engagement in political processes is very low. More than 50 percent of respondents
reported having no trust or little of trust in key institutions; above 80 percent has never been in contact with the
president, public officials, or a local councillor to express an opinion; and more than 70 percent replied "no" to all
questions related to vote and political engagement (e.g. did you vote, do you convince others to vote for this or that
etc.).

9.      After a period of rapid growth following the start of the exploitation of Cameroon’s
oil reserves, the economy plummeted between 1985 and 1994. Following Independence in
1960, the public administration was the largest formal employer, and the main actor in an economy
which was structured along a state-led development model. Large profits from export-agriculture
and oil exports following high international commodity prices financed this strategy. From the
early 1980s on, Cameroon’s economy suffered a period of rapid decline, marked by lower terms
of trade, a decline in oil production, and an appreciation of the real effective exchange rate.

10.     A recovery started in 1994, yet 20 years hence, in 2014, per capita income has not yet
recovered its 1984 peak. Faced with a deepening economic crisis, the Government opted in 1993
for a painful structural adjustment program, privatizing and liquidating state companies and cutting
wage and nonwage spending. The devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994 led to a large increase in
the debt service, putting the country in debt distress. In April 2006, Cameroon reached the
completion point of the Initiative for HIPC, which allowed it to reduce its debt ratio to 12.1 percent
of GDP in 2008.10

11.     The quality of service delivery is less than what can be expected from a lower middle
income country. As part of the structural adjustment program, public servants saw their nominal
salaries cut significantly. This massive income loss was aggravated by high inflation rates

  The trauma of the Structural Adjustment Program has been such that to date Cameroon does not have a program
with the IMF, nor does the World Bank have any Development Policy Financing.

                                                                                                  5
following the FCFA devaluation. As a result, average real salaries declined by 51 percent between
1991/92 and 1995/96, entailing a severe decline in living standards and social status for most
civilian public employees. A commensurate decline in the quality of service delivery followed due
to increased corruption, reliance on allowances to top up salaries and the hiring of poorly paid
contract workers for front line service delivery.

12.     Political stability, an abundance of natural resources and a culture of education have
allowed Cameroon to reach lower middle income status, but at the price of an unmet growth
potential and limited reductions in poverty. The co-optation of elites has led to stability, but
also to a system of governance that weighs down the economy with monopolies, state enterprises,
exclusive (import) rights, and corruption. Continuously shifting coalitions block most reform
proposals and lead to bureaucratic inertia. Within the administration, an allowance and per diem
culture prevails. It obfuscates priorities, and promotes uncritical loyalty to one’s superior (who
decides on the allocation of financial privileges) instead of a focus on performance. A state led
development model and a hostile business environment act to the detriment of attracting foreign
and domestic investments.

13.     For the DSCE objectives to be achieved, economic inefficiencies need to be addressed.
Achieving higher middle income status by 2035 – the Government’s status ambition, requires an
acceleration of growth. This in turn requires increases in investment which will largely need to
come from the private sector as the public debt burden has already risen to unsustainable levels. It
also requires improvements in economic efficiency, to attract private investment and to ensure a
good rate of return on public investments.

14.     Stability is challenged, as Boko Haram has thrown Cameroon into the midst of the
war on terror. Initially posing a threat at provincial, then at national levels in Nigeria, Boko
Haram has extended its operational area from northern Nigeria to include the entire Lake Chad
basin. Since the beginning of 2014, Boko Haram has carried out violent attacks in Cameroon. Over
a period of just a few months, clashes between Cameroon’s armed forces and Boko Haram
militants escalated into what is virtually a small war in the Far North region. Insecurity has led to
a considerable contraction of the regional economy as exchanges with Nigeria and Chad stopped,
as security measures hinder economic activities and as the implementation of several development
projects has been interrupted. Meanwhile, an increasing flow of refugees from Nigeria (almost
20,000 registered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR) and IDPs
(82,000 in 2015) intensifies social tensions in host communities.11

15.     Piracy and the crisis in CAR pose additional security threats. Some 382 acts of piracy
were reported in the Gulf of Guinea from 2007 to 2013, posing a significant economic drain on
West Africa and especially its oil economy. Cameroonians have been victims directly as well,
notably in the form of attacks on the towns of Bakassi, Douala, Limbé, and Kribi. The perpetrators
were seaborne armed groups working out of neighboring Nigeria, with its 500 miles of coastline
on the oil-rich Gulf of Guinea. The eastern border is also a troubled zone. The crisis in the CAR
has spilled over the country’s borders in the form of incursions by armed groups and a flow of
refugees, who number about 234,000. The anti-balaka (“anti-machete”) militias, which formed as
self-defense forces in villages of western CAR, and the FDPC (Democratic Front of the Central

African People) have caused security problems. As a response and also because there are concerns
of the anti-balaka militias linking up to Boko Haram, the Cameroon Government has deployed
troops along a section of its country’s eastern border, while also contributing to the peacekeeping
mission in CAR.

16.     The religious extremism advocated by Boko Haram, cannot be considered
independent of the high levels of deprivation in northern Cameroon. The mix of radical Islam
with high levels of poverty and unemployment, low levels of education, a lack of economic
opportunities, particularly for the youth and exposure to the world through the media, presents a
breeding ground for disgruntlement and encourages membership in violent organizations that live
off chaos and violence, such as Boko Haram. The heavily-armed and well-organized group is
directly challenging the stability of the nation. To date, however, the violence has helped
consolidate the sense of national unity: a widely attended peaceful march to support fighting troops
was organized in February 2015, for instance.

17.     Social discontent is widespread fueled by frustration about governmental ineffectiveness,
high levels of corruption and a lack of economic opportunities, the allocation of public resources
based on loyalty rather than needs, high levels of poverty, rising (regional) inequalities, low quality
of service delivery and an overall lack of attention to developmental issues.12 The average age of
the population is 19, and youths are enduring difficult living conditions and high rates of
unemployment. With few channels to express legitimate discontent,13 the youthful population
renders the situation inflammable. The political opposition has little to offer and civil society
organizations that could demand accountability are weak, fragmented, and discredited.

18.     Thanks to its enormous economic potential, achieving the ambitions formulated in
the DSCE remains feasible. Yet its realization will require challenging some of the interests that
lie at the basis of Cameroon’s political settlement as it necessitates improving the business
environment. It also requires avoiding any major crises, financial or otherwise. Already high levels
of spending to finance public investments, security and the ‘Plan d’Emergence’ in the face of (oil)
revenue shortfalls put pressure on public finances. Rising insecurity and economic hardships in
northern Cameroon put new dimensions to Cameroon’s north-south issues as do questions raised
about the behavior of the security forces14. A premature presidential departure –not implausible
given the President’s age15, is another possible source of instability as a peaceful transition is no
certainty given that there is little succession planning within the ruling party. Despite these
pressing problems that require urgent attention most are in a holding pattern, waiting for the next
election during which the President may, or may not decide to stand for another 7 year term.

19.    This SCD is thus prepared at a time when Cameroon finds itself at a critical
crossroads. The country has a historical opportunity to achieve the ambitions formulated in the

1.2    Organization of the document

20.     The remainder of this document explores how to achieve the twin goals of ending
poverty and improving shared prosperity by 2030 in a sustainable manner. The document
identifies a limited number of binding constraints which would need to be lifted to achieve the
poverty objective.

21.     The next four chapters present background material to chapter 6, which presents
binding constraints to poverty reduction. The micro-foundations to poverty reduction are
discussed in chapters 2 and 3. Chapter 2 discusses poverty, equity and vulnerability. Chapter 3
discusses human capital and its role in poverty reduction. Chapter 4 considers poverty reduction
from a macro-economic perspective. It discusses opportunities for growth and economic
transformation as well as the status of various cross-cutting economic services. Chapter 5,
considers governance, fragility and the institutional environment.

22.     Binding constraints to sustainable poverty reduction are identified in chapter 6. To
arrive at these constraints a four step process has been followed. First an analytical framework has
been developed and used to explore pathways to poverty reduction. Based on these pathways and
the descriptive analysis presented in the earlier part of the report areas of binding constraints are
identified (step 1). In-country consultations were then used (step 2) to assess the relevance of these
constraints. The next two steps in the prioritization process were a country team retreat during
which specific binding constraints were identified and prioritized (step 3) and a consistency check
of the identified binding constraints with the long term objectives of financial, social and
environmental sustainability (step 4).

                      2.        POVERTY, EQUITY AND VULNERABILITY


In 2014 headcount poverty reached 38 percent, a slight decline relative to 2001, when poverty was
40 percent. Poverty has been on the rise in rural areas and northern Cameroon is becoming
poorer. This part of the country is affected by multiple poverty traps associated with insecurity,
high rates of population growth, environmental degradation, malnutrition, isolation and low levels
of productivity. By contrast, living conditions in the southern parts of the country, and especially
the coastal area and the largest urban areas, are improving.

2.1        Poverty and poverty trends

23.    Despite more than a decade of economic growth, national poverty incidence has
remained almost unchanged. Poverty decreased from 40.2 percent in 2001 to 37.5 percent in
2014. Poverty incidence declined in urban areas from 17.9 percent in 2001 to an estimated 8.9
percent in 2014. In rural areas, on the other hand, the percentage of poor increased from 52.1
percent in 2001 to 56.8 percent in 2014.

24.     The absolute number of poor increased since 2001. Even though urban poverty declined
significantly, the absolute number of urban poor declined only slightly, by 300,000, on account of
the fact that the urban population increased by approximately 4.1 million since 2001. In rural areas,
the increase in the incidence of poverty resulted in 1.1 million additional poor people. Overall, the
absolute number of poor in Cameroon increased by approximately 800,000 since 2001 to reach
6.6 million people in 2014.

25.    The economic growth that Cameroon experienced was not inclusive. The poorest
households became poorer between 2001 and 2014. This is illustrated by the growth incidence
curve which shows that for the poorest 35 percent of households net consumption growth was
negative. Most of the growth dividend accrued to the wealthiest people.

26.    Changes in poverty between 2001 and 2014 show an unambiguous regional pattern,
with northern Cameroon becoming poorer and southern Cameroon becoming better-off.
Poverty declined continuously in the center-west of the country, in the Littoral, Center, West and
South-West regions, as well as in Douala and Yaoundé. By contrast, poverty continuously rose in
the North and Far North regions. The regions of Adamawa, North-West and South are
characterized by stagnation while the East region initially experienced an increase in poverty
followed by a sharp decline.

27.     The rapid increase in poverty in northern Cameroon occurred before Boko Haram
started creating havoc. The deterioration of the security environment in northern Cameroon
occurred largely after the completion of data collection for the ECAM4 survey. The poverty
estimates for the northern regions should, thus, be considered lower bounds, since the
consequences of the increased influx of refugees, IDPs and the closure of markets, roads and
frontiers has not been taken into account.



                                                                                                                   10
28.     Changes in per capita consumption mirror the observed changes in poverty. On
average real per capita consumption increased by 1.6 percent per year between 2001 and 2014,
with large differences between rural (0.5 percent) and urban (1.8 percent) areas. As is the case for
poverty, there are large variations between regions, with the Center being, by far, the most dynamic
with an almost 50 percent increase in per capita consumption since 2001, followed by West and
South-West. Consumption in the North and Far North is deteriorating with a 15 to 17 percent
decline in per capita consumption since 2001. The increase in insecurity in the northern regions,
since 2014, is likely to have led to a further deterioration of consumption in these areas.

29.     The pattern of consumption growth exacerbated pre-existing regional inequalities.
Regions with the highest initial levels of poverty (North, Far North, North-West) experienced
further increases in poverty (and declines in consumption), whereas regions and locations with
more favorable initial conditions (Doula and Yaoundé, Littoral, West, South-West) saw their levels
of poverty decline rapidly. As a consequence, inequality increased rapidly. In 2001 the Gini
coefficient was 40.4; in 2014 it was 44.0, implying that the 20 percent poorest consume less than
5 percent of all consumption, whereas the 20 percent richest consume almost half.

30.     Lower levels of consumption in the North and Far North regions are associated with
higher levels of inequality. The reverse holds for Littoral and Doula and Yaoundé where
higher levels of consumption are associated with lower levels of inequality. Remarkable, and
of concern, is the increase in inequality in rural areas and in Adamawa in particular. The enormous
differences in per capita consumption between the poorest and wealthiest, and the rapid increase
in inequality, particularly in rural areas can easily be a source for social tension.

31.      The depth of poverty increased in northern Cameroon and decreased in the coastal
zone and the center. The depth of poverty16, thus, increased in areas with the highest levels of
initial poverty and decreased in areas with lower initial levels of poverty. Cameroon is developing
at opposing speeds. Living standards in the coastal areas, the largest urban centers and their

                                                                                                                                                            11
surrounding regions improve, while living standards in the northern regions deteriorate (Figure
2.2). This cleavage is likely to get worse as the increased depth of poverty in the north makes
poverty reduction increasingly difficult. The contrary holds for the coastal zones, where the depth
of poverty is on the decline, making poverty reduction relatively easier.

32.    The decline in poverty in urban areas and rural-urban migration were the most
important drivers of poverty reduction since 2001. A sectoral decomposition of the 2.7 percent
decline in national poverty incidence between 2001 and 2014 shows that it is explained by the
reduction in poverty in urban areas in combination with rural/urban migration. The reduction in
poverty would have been significantly larger, had poverty not increased in rural areas from 52
percent in 2001 to 57 percent in 2014. Other factors associated with a reduction in poverty were
favorable world market prices for cash crops, such as oil palm, coffee, cocoa – crops predominantly
grown in southern Cameroon. In east Cameroon, the rapid growth of artisanal mining contributed
to poverty reduction.

2.2        Poverty reduction and urbanization

33.      Generally speaking, increased urbanization is positively correlated with economic
development. The top left graph of Figure 2.4, based on the World Development Indicators 2014,
illustrates this relationship between the percentage of urban population and the log of GDP per
capita. Cameroon lies just below the regression line, suggesting that its per capita income is slightly
less than expected based on the rate of urbanization.

34.     Within Cameroon, urban and rural poverty rates are positively correlated, suggesting
positive spillovers between urban and rural areas. Regions with higher (lower) urban poverty
rates tend to have higher (lower) rural poverty rates. This association (illustrated in the top right
corner of Figure 2.4) hints at a potential linkage between urbanization and rural poverty reduction.
Positive spillover effects from increased urbanization could come from increased demand for local
agricultural products; urban to rural remittances; downward pressure on the rural land/population
ratio; upward pressure on agricultural wages; increased opportunities for rural non-farm
employment or lower transportation-induced transaction costs.17 The relationship is not
necessarily only positive: when urban areas attract the most entrepreneurial, best-educated people,
the capacity for rural growth diminishes.

35.     Since 2001, the disparity in rural poverty rates has widened, as poverty has been
rising in the northern part of Cameroon, while it fell in other regions; conversely the regional
disparity in urban poverty rates has narrowed across the country. Rural poverty rates in Far-
North, North, and North-West have been rising since 2001. The opposite is true for Center, East,
Littoral, West, and South-West. Urban poverty rates in some regions, such as Adamawa, Far-
North, North, and West used to be quite high but these regions successfully reduced urban poverty
since. In fact, as urban poverty rates have been converging across the country, rural poverty rates
have started diverging. One implication is that urbanization in the south may have contributed to
poverty reduction in rural areas, whereas this was not the case in the north.

36.      Rural-to-urban migration rates in northern Cameroon are relatively low, but when
people do migrate they migrate to urban areas. Rural to urban migration rates tend to be highest
in Littoral (2.2 percent) followed by the Center (0.6 percent), West (0.7 percent), South (0.4
percent) and Adamawa (0.3 percent) regions. Migration rates are lowest for the East (0.2 percent),
Far North (0.2 percent), North (0.1 percent), and North-West and South-West regions (<0.1
percent). This suggests that proximity to a large urban center (Douala or Yaoundé) is an important
pull factor. Ninety-one percent of the migrants from Far-North and North regions migrated to
urban areas, while only 41 percent of the migrants from North-West region moved to urban areas
(i.e. 59 percent migrated from rural to rural areas in other regions).

 Urbanization and per capita income are positively correlated across sub-Saharan Africa. Within Cameroon
 regions with lower rates of urban poverty also have lower rates of rural poverty, suggesting mutual beneficial
 effects.

migrate and those who do not, in that the well-educated people tend to migrate to urban areas.18
Another finding is that a large portion (62 percent) of migrants are Muslim. Migrants also tend to
be fluent in English or French. There is no substantial difference observed in the average age and
gender composition. The main reasons for migration are work (59 percent), health (14 percent),
housing (3 percent), and others (25 percent). It suggests that the most capable in terms of human
capital migrate to urban areas whereas the most deprived rural residents in the northern Cameroon
are left behind.

educated, live in large families with many dependents and are physically and socially
isolated. A typical poor household lives far from public schools, clinics and access points for
electricity and is not a member of (informal) associations. Poverty increases with distance to the
large urban centers and poverty incidence is lowest in Douala and Yaoundé and the regions in
which these cities are located (Littoral and Center).

39.     Most poor reside in rural areas where they operate as pastoralists or cultivate small
plots. Farms in Cameroon are generally small in size, approximately 0.5 to 2 hectares per family.19
Smallholder agriculture remains characterized by limited mechanization, low use of fertilizer
inputs, high labor inputs, limited soil conservation strategies and the general absence of enabling
infrastructure for agricultural development. Farmers rely heavily on the use of simple tools (hoes,
cutlasses, and spades) and techniques (manual weeding, hoeing and harvesting). Farmers with
access to animal traction tend to cultivate larger areas but the advantages of doing so are dissipated
by the fact that ‘successful’ farms attract additional family members (Table 2.1). The majority of
farming households possess some form of livestock, mainly poultry and small ruminants that are
poorly integrated into the farming system.

40.    Land-use pressures are growing, sustained by an annual population growth rate of
about 2.8 percent. Land pressures manifest themselves as conflicts, often between farmers and
pastoralists, between new settlers and existing farmers but also between those seeking land for
mining, forestry and plantation agriculture and those wanting to preserve Cameroon’s biodiversity.

41.     The livelihoods of rural households vary widely across the country. In the southern
regions, where it rains regularly, agricultural production flourishes. But in the progressively dry
and arid north, where evapotranspiration is high, agricultural output largely depends on the amount
of rainfall received. Globally five agro-ecological zones can be distinguished: (i) the Sudano-
Sahelian zone in the north, where pastoralism is common and animal production the main
agricultural activity, along with the cultivation of millets, sorghum, maize, beans and cotton; (ii)
the high Guinea Savanah in Adamawa, where cattle production is less important and maize,
manioc and millet are the main crops; (iii) a cattle (pastoralism) and coffee-based system in the
plateau of the Western Highlands with maize, beans and plantain as the main food crops; (iv) a
humid forest with a mono-modal rainfall at the coast; and (v) a humid forest with bimodal rainfall
in the center and the south, where bananas, cassava and tubers are cultivated. In this latter zone
slash and burn is still a common technique for cultivation. In the humid forest one also finds
plantation agriculture (oil palms, cocoa, tea, rubber, bananas, and pineapples).

42.     Between 2001 and 2014, the number of poor in the Sudano-Sahelian zone more than
doubled to 4.5 million people. The large number of poor people living in the Sudan-Sahelian zone
is the combined effect of a high incidence of poverty (72 percent) and relatively elevated levels of

                                                      15
population density (72 people per km2). Many poor people can also be found in the Western
Highlands. The concentration of poor in the Western Highlands is due largely to high levels of
population density (122 people per km2), in combination with relatively elevated levels of poverty.
The reverse is the case for Adamawa in the High Guinea Savanah where low population density
combines with high levels of poverty.

43.     The mixed farming-livestock system of the Sudano-Sahelian zone is not only where
most poor are found, it is also the most environmentally fragile zone in Cameroon. With a
Sahelian climate and vegetation, problems with crop cultivation, livestock, wildlife and fuelwood
are pronounced. Erosion is a dangerous threat to agriculture in this part of Cameroon and, as
agriculture is expanding and more land is being brought under cultivation, tensions between
pastoralists and crop farmers are common. The gathering of fuelwood, annual bush fires and the
high population growth rate all contribute to deprive this fragile environment of the vegetation
cover it needs.

44.     The northern zone is particularly vulnerable to climate variability and change. 20 The
Sudano-Sahelian zone already faces high hydrologic and rainfall variability, with heavy rainfalls
alternating with a six to seven month-dry season, and significant sporadic floods and droughts.21
Climate change will exacerbate such trends and is expected to further affect water resources in the
Lake Chad and Niger basins in northern Cameroon. It is expected to increase vulnerability of areas
prone to water scarcity and lead to changes in the types of crops cultivated, towards grain crops or
cereals which require less rainfall and have a short growing season. Maize cultivation may dwindle
in favor of sorghum and millets, which are hardy plants, with relatively low water requirements.
The overall decrease in the quantity of the water would further exacerbate the ongoing crisis with
water availability, storage and supply crisis in many rural areas of the north. An increase in the
length of time for the recharge of groundwater, due to the prolonged dry season, could cause a
drop in water tables and a drying up of wells and springs that constitute the main sources of water.
The quality of water in most areas in the north will be affected too. An increase in temperature
together with an increase in dryness is likely to result in net capillary movement and the
salinization of both soil and water resources.

45.     As climatic conditions get drier, the future will be marked by an increased demand
for water, both for domestic purposes and for the agricultural sector. Reliance on rain-fed
agriculture would have to give way to more irrigation and improved water management and
services. Strategies and approaches to increase water availability and storage, combined with
improved land management, could therefore be effective to sustain livelihoods in rural poor areas
and reduce risks from extreme water events like flooding, which have devastating effects on both
crops and human settlements, productive and domestic assets. It would also contribute to improved
access to safe and affordable water supply services for the population.

2.4        Poverty traps

46.     The poorest, and particularly those in northern Cameroon, are likely to be affected
by multiple poverty traps. Households may end up in a poverty trap because they ‘inherited’ too
few assets (human and physical capital), or because of exposure to uninsured shocks. In the face
of low incomes and given the de-facto exclusion from financial markets, a poor household’s only
option to avoid chronic poverty is an autarkic savings strategy to invest in the necessary assets.
This requires substantial medium-term sacrifices in the form of diminished consumption, which
many very poor households cannot afford, as their consumption levels are already low. There are
various ways in which poverty traps can occur.22

47.    Inadequate productive assets. An asset-based poverty trap occurs when asset holdings in
the form of human capital, land, livestock and transfer income are below some critical minimum
needed to withstand a macro-, community (drought, flooding, insecurity) or household shock

22
   Presented is an adaptation of a taxonomy by Erik Thorbecke (2013): The Interrelationship Linking Growth,
Inequality and Poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa," Journal of African Economies.

                                                          17
(illness, death in the family). Such shocks would force affected households to dispose of some of
their assets, or to indebt themselves and be pushed into a state of chronic poverty. For instance, it
may occur that a poor households loses its seeds and then fails to have the means to purchase new
seed. It may also happen that households lack the means (animal traction) to bring a sufficiently
large area under cultivation; or they may be indebted and forced to first work on other people’s
farms to repay their obligations before they can tend to their own fields. The likelihood that asset
traps are prevalent can be seen from the fact that the poorest households plant the smallest areas
per capita (Figure 2.7), have least productive animals, few productive assets and are most likely to
have acutely malnourished children (a sign of food shortages).

48.     A temporary shock can lead to a nutritional poverty trap (a specific type of asset trap)
as malnutrition amongst adults reduces their productivity, translating into lower incomes, leading
to poverty and inadequate food consumption, further lowering their productivity and creating a
vicious spiral into a destitute state.23 Alternatively malnourished children may suffer long-term
cognitive consequences and have trouble learning and building up their own human capital. Poor
quality drinking water and the lack of adequate sanitation facilities affect mostly the poorest
households and contribute to the nutritional poverty trap.

49.      Demographic traps occur in poor families with practically no assets, in environments
characterized by the absence of old-age social security programs and high infant and child
mortality rates. In order to help ensure that at least some children survive to take care of their
parent in their old age, or to ensure that a minimum of labour is available, the family opts for a
strategy of high fertility. An additional child becomes a form of insurance against old age
destitution. In turn, the consequent increase in the household size reduces per capita income,
increases dependency ratios and reduces the ability to save and invest. In these circumstances, the
impact of family planning and contraception schemes, by themselves, are unlikely to alter the
fertility rate. A preference for high rates of fertility may also occur in areas where labour markets
are absent and where seasonal demands for labour are high (typically in low population density
arid zones) 24.

50.     Social and gender based traps may result from long-standing cultural values, such as
attaching less value to the education of girls than of boys, the custom of marrying girls young,
customs prohibiting women to inherit upon the death of their husband, or customs that lead women
to cultivate food crops while men cultivate cash crops. Even when men and women grow the same
crops, yields from male-managed plots tend to be higher than those of female managed plots.
Challenges faced by women in Cameroon’s agriculture include holding fewer agricultural assets
such as farm tools and equipment, as well as having to split their time between farming and
household chores. Where men dominate cash crop production, their ability to invest part of the
income in their farms is also greater than that of women. Gender and social based traps could
gradually become less binding, particularly as more emphasis is put on girls’ education.

     Children from the poorest households are much more likely to be affected by acute malnutrition, a clear sign of
       food shortages. The prevalence of acute malnutrition is particularly alarming in the North and Far North
          regions, where levels exceed the threshold of 10 percent indicating a serious nutrition emergency.25

51.      Soil fertility trap. When low-input sedentary subsistence farming replaces the natural
vegetation, the stable natural biogeochemical processes of nutrient cycling are disrupted and the
root zone (the upper 10 to 50 cm) becomes rapidly depleted of plant nutrients. Particularly ferrasols
that make-up 55 percent of Cameroon’s territory26 are susceptible to this kind of erosion. Lower
productivity as a result of soil degradation limits the economic means to restore soil fertility, leads
to extending the area cultivated, and further reduces fallow periods thus reinforcing declining soil
fertility.

52.     Spatial development traps may occur in settings where a disproportionate number of poor
is located in areas where arable land is scarce or of relatively bad quality, or where insecurity,
droughts, floods and other environmental shocks generate relatively high levels of community-
wide risks. One characteristic of regions affected by these kind of poverty traps is that poverty has
a clear spatial pattern and that it tends to increase with the distance from major cities and the coast,

since transaction costs tend to rise as a function of distance to urban agglomerations. Northern
Cameroon and the Western Highlands are prone to such spatial poverty traps. Interventions that
improve farm-to-market access (roads; means of transport; fewer road blocks; farmer associations
to aggregate produce and attract traders) can play a key role in reducing transaction costs and
overcoming spatial poverty traps.

53.     The prevalence of multiple poverty traps implies that successfully attacking poverty
requires a multi-faceted development strategy. The combined effect of multiple, reinforcing
traps is to deepen the magnitude of poverty. For northern Cameroon, where poverty is deepening
and increasing over time, this certainly seems relevant and many of the aforementioned poverty
traps hold simultaneously as poverty has a clear spatial dimension, stocks of human and physical
capital are low, malnutrition is prevalent, fertility rates highest and gender roles most explicit. In
other regions –where poverty is lower and trends point towards a reduction of poverty, poverty
traps seem less relevant. In areas with more than one poverty trap, rather than attacking each trap
separately to break its vicious cycle, multiple cycles have to be broken at the same time in order
to create a more virtuous cycle.27 Single interventions may address multiple traps at the same time:
improved female education can be expected to reduce traps associated with gender, the lack of
assets (human capital) and high levels of fertility. Irrigation could address nutrition, productive
asset, spatial and soil fertility traps simultaneously, by lengthening the growing season and
increasing yield.

Box 2.1: Gender based traps vary by location
  Women in Cameroon are particularly disadvantaged. Women are more likely to be illiterate, and they marry on
  average seven years younger than men. The median age of first marriage is 19 for Cameroon and 16 in the North
  and Far North. Thirty percent of women state that they have experienced physical violence in the past 12 months
  (DHS 2011). While gender differences can lead to poverty traps “one-size fit all” approaches may not be optimal,
  as the role of women differs between locations and ethnic groups. Below follow three examples.

  The Moghamo are a mostly agrarian society in the Northwest region. The Moghamo consider women as less
  intelligent than men. “A good Moghamo woman is expected to be submissive and quiet in public places, especially
  in the midst of men, to speak only when asked to do so, and to be obedient, caring, receptive to visitors, and
  tolerant.” Women are not allowed to control assets as long as a man is present in the household. Women reported
  that “men can own everything including their wives and children, and can dispose of what they own as desired,
  even without their wives’ knowledge.” The extent to which Moghamo women engage in economic activities
  depends on their marital status. At first glance it seems that unmarried women are better-off, since they are allowed
  to control assets and to earn income. However, being unmarried is associated with being unsuccessful, and
  participation in the economy, a crucial element for empowerment, is sought less than the status assigned to
  marriage.

  Like the Moghamo, Bafaw women (living in the South West region) are considered inferior to men. When asked,
  Bafaw men were unable to visualize women in positions of authority, leadership, or power in a man’s presence.
  Unlike the Moghamo, Bafaw women (married or not) are allowed to partake in economic activities of their choice,

                                                          21
     without the consent of their spouse. Bafaw women hold personal bank accounts, keep the profits of their labor and
     own land. Nonetheless, some Bafaw women have reported that their economic independence, while providing
     power and status, comes at a price, as their economic activities were a source of tension in the household. In some
     cases it even led to the dissolution of their marriages.

   The Fulbe are originally a nomadic Muslim society specializing in cattle rearing in northern Cameroon. The Fulbe
   language, Fulfulde, has no word indicating gender and does not have separate personal pronouns for ‘he’ and
   ‘she’. Still, men and women live highly segregated lives, especially those that have not adopted a sedentary
   lifestyle. Fulbe women enjoy high levels of respect due to their economic activities and their role within the
   household. Fulbe women are not allowed to cultivate land, even though settled Fulbe men have started doing so.
   Women are expected to churn milk and to sell it in the market, an activity which might require walking long
   distances, depending on their place of residence. Fulbe women are responsible for preparing food, conducting
   household chores –including bringing water and fuel- as well as child rearing. Husbands, in turn, are not allowed
   to appropriate the money earned by women. Fulbe women typically marry in an arranged marriage, often when
   they are very young, and without the consent of the girl. 28

2.5        Chronic poverty, vulnerability and safety nets

54.     The existence of multiple poverty traps and the increasing depth of poverty in
northern Cameroon points towards high levels of chronic poverty. Panel data to assess whether
households move in an out of poverty, or whether they are stuck in poverty is not available, but
with a poverty incidence of around 80 percent in the rural areas of the Sudano-Sahellian zone it is
clear that a large fraction of households is chronically poor with few prospects for moving out of
poverty in the near future.

55.     In addition to widespread chronic poverty, vulnerability is high. Especially,
households earning their income through subsistence agriculture and pastoralism are vulnerable to
shocks as they typically are poorly connected to markets and their incomes are heavily dependent
on rainfall. Poor households and particularly those in urban areas are vulnerable when food prices
rise and (casual) labor opportunities are absent. For pastoralists, the worst possible combination is
one of falling livestock prices and rising food prices, a combination that typically occurs when a
covariate shock (drought, insects, insecurity) affects an area.29 In recent years, severe flooding
events have affected urban and rural areas, impacting productive assets, living conditions and
livelihoods. Poor health is another source of vulnerability aggravated by the fact that most health
service providers require large out-of-pocket contributions.

56.     Building resilience to shocks is of paramount importance. When households and
communities are repeatedly hit by shocks and lack the means to respond, they have difficulty
accumulating the human, physical, and natural capital needed to lift themselves out of poverty. For
this reason, building resilience to shocks is not necessarily a goal in itself, but it remains an
essential pre-condition for achieving higher-level development goals, such as poverty eradication,
sustainable improvements in living conditions, and food security. Increasing resilience will not
lead automatically to poverty eradication. For poverty to be eradicated, a number of additional

actions will have to be taken, for example improving health services, strengthening educational
systems, and improving access to markets for inputs and outputs. But, while increasing resilience
is not a sufficient condition for poverty eradication, it is most likely a necessary one, because it is
hard to imagine how households that are unable to cope with the impacts of drought, flooding and
other shocks can save enough to augment their endowment of productive assets and increase their
income-generation potential.

Box 2.2: Social exclusion
 Social exclusion is typically rooted in discrimination based on some personal trait, ethnicity, age, migration status,
 health condition or disability. It aggravates issues of poverty and vulnerability for those affected but also reduces
 the productive capacity of society as a whole. In Cameroon, a number of groups are at particular risk of social
 exclusion.

 Mbororo
 The Mbororo is a pastoralist ethnic group comprising over one million people. They inhabit territories close to the
 border with Nigeria, Chad and CAR and are related to the Fulbe though the latter tend to consider the Mbororo
 pagans, not practicing true Islam. Mbororo lead secluded lives, preferring to live just with their close family in
 small dispersed communities away from rural centers. Mbororo tend to be reserved and exclusive as their traditional
 code of conduct (pulaaku) dictates.

 Mbororo have been an easy prey for exploitation and extortion due to their relative (cattle) wealth, their preference
 to solve matters amongst themselves and their inclination to resolve issues with the administration by paying bribes.
 They have been particularly vulnerable with respect to issues of grazing rights and the Jangali tax. The Mbororo
 claim the latter is discriminatory as it affects them disproportionately. The Jangali tax is levied annually based on
 the ownership of livestock (cattle and horses) and is unrelated to the sale or use of animals for profit. Finally, 90
 percent of the refugees in the Eastern and Adamawa provinces belong to the Mbororo ethnic group. These refugees
 are fleeing CAR, but increasingly also Nigeria, where their cattle is an easy target for Boko Haram raids.

 Refugees
 Cameroon has an open door policy for refugees - asylum seekers and the state has demonstrated significant efforts
 to protect this vulnerable population. This includes access to health facilities, to schooling and the right to be legally
 employed. The Government has created seven refugee camps in the East and Adamawa regions, which mainly host
 refugees from CAR and the Minawao camp in the Far North which hosts people fleeing Boko Haram in Nigeria.
 An additional 314 smaller camps and sites linked to villages also host a large number of refugees. According to the
 UNHCR (July 2015) Cameroon hosts 276,265 refugees as well as an estimated 12,000-17,000 unregistered refugees
 mostly located in the Far North region.

 Refugees experience social exclusion. While the Cameroonian state has been accommodating, local authorities
 often do not share this welcoming attitude. They tend to view the facilitation of the integration of refugees as a
 negative development and fear that it will function as a “pull factor” turning their localities into refugee settlements.
 The Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) “Réfugiés sans frontières” reports that “there is still the idea that a
 refugee is someone who is a criminal, someone who came to steal the work of the Cameroonians.”

 Apart from issues of social exclusion, refugees face the same practical problems that plague other disadvantaged
 groups in Cameroon. They often suffer from poor health as a result of malnutrition, unsanitary living conditions
 and unsafe drinking water. Since many of them do not have any source of income, finding shelter is an issue. It has
 become common practice for urban refugees to resort to living in unfinished houses in exchange for a small rent to
 the owner. Refugees who are located in one of the UNHCR administered camps receive shelter, free healthcare and
 a monthly food allowance. However, even those groups are faced with the overcrowding of the camp facilities,
 which often creates social tensions that sometimes lead to violence.

 Pygmies
 Pygmies are a “hunter-gatherer” society living in the forests near the borders with Gabon, CAR and the Republic
 of Congo. They comprise around 0.4 percent of Cameroon’s population. They self-identify as indigenous peoples

                                                            23
and can be divided in three ethnic groups: the Baka, the Bakola - Bagyeli, and the Bedzan - Medzan. Traditionally
these groups were isolated clans that used to lead a nomadic lifestyle with migratory patterns that matched the
change of seasons in the forest to hunt animals, and to collect plants and other non-timber forest products.

These ethnic groups have always been discriminated. According to NGO surveys, local farmers view Pygmies as
“savages, inferior beings or thieves that possess supernatural powers.” The partial-sedentarization, which was part
of a Government effort to “integrate the Pygmies to the modern economy”, aggravated these groups’ poverty and
vulnerability.

Much of the poverty and vulnerability that the Pygmies are experiencing is the result of land rights issues, loss of
livelihoods as well as the lack of political representation, legal rights, and access to education, healthcare, and
services. Even though 4 percent of Cameroon’s forest has been designated as “community forests” these areas are
often not the traditional lands of the Pygmies. Moreover Pygmies are not entitled to compensation when projects
affect their livelihoods because compensation requires identifications cards and because the authorities consider
Pygmies as merely occupying the forest. The semi-nomadic lifestyle and the language barriers further prevent
Pygmies from accessing education, health care and other services. More recently the authorities have taken some
steps to improve the situation such as the revision of the Law on Forest and Fauna, the recognition of two Baka
“chefferies” and an effort to provide free identification documents.

                          3. HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT

Human capital outcomes are less than what might be expected for a lower middle income country.
There exist large spatial differences, with people, and especially women, living in northern
Cameroon lagging behind. These differences have become larger over time. Public spending on
health and education is relatively low and inefficient. To reduce poverty and realize opportunities
for growth there is a need to improve access to primary and secondary education and primary
health care in areas that lag behind and more attention should be paid to education quality and to
providing skills demanded by the private sector.

3.1      Human capital

57.      The ability to work is one of the main assets of poor people. In those parts of the
economy where subsistence agriculture remains dominant, and where the main pathways out of
poverty are productivity increases in agriculture or migration to town, additional investments in
health and basic competencies are needed to break a vicious cycle of poverty and poor quality of
life that may otherwise persist from generation to generation.30 To serve the needs of an
increasingly modernizing economy it is equally critical that people are equipped with advanced
skills. It allows citizens to contribute to the structural transformation that is necessary to achieve
the higher middle income status to which the country aspires.

58.    There is a long way to go to ensure that all Cameroonians enjoy basic education and
health services. Health outcomes, for instance, are similar to those of lower income countries. In
2013, every 100,000 live births resulted in the deaths of 590 mothers.31 This is higher than the
average of 510 in sub-Saharan African countries (SSA), more than twice the average of 240 per
100,000 in lower-middle-income countries and more than 10 times the average of 57 per 100,000
in upper-middle-income countries. Consequently, given a fertility rate of about 5 children per
woman, approximately 4,800 mothers die each year in childbirth.

59.     Children suffer from high mortality rates, lack of vaccinations, experience high
incidence of malaria and are affected by chronic malnutrition. Eighty eight out of every 1,000
live births end in death of the child before the age of five.32 This is higher than the average of 83
per 1,000 in SSA countries, more than 1.5 times the average of 53 per 1,000 in lower and middle
income countries, and more than 4 times the average of 19 per 1,000 in upper middle income
countries. Less than 65 percent of under-two children receive a full set of vaccinations, 30 percent
of under-five children test positive for malaria, and 20 percent of under-five children suffer from
diarrhea. The nutritional status of many children is worrisome, especially in terms of deficiency in
height for age or stunting - the most irreversible form of malnutrition. As of 2014, about 13 percent

30 See for instance Barro & Lee 2010; Krueger & Lindahl 2000; Gyimah-Bremponga & Wilson 2004; Becker et al.
1994. The direct relation between education and agricultural productivity is more tenuous among the poorest countries
(Reimers & Klasen 2013), but there are reasons to believe that education will have a positive impact in agricultural
growth. Education through extension services is important for improve farming techniques. Generally better education
would matter also for managing the business of running a farm.

   Some discrepancies exist between these data coming from the World Development Indicators (WDI) database, and
the data of Table 3.1 because of different data sources.

stunted.

             Cameroon still lags behind.                                                                              Cameroon still ranks near the top of Francophone

60.    Limited access to sanitation is a serious health issue. In 2012, only 45 percent of the
population had access to adequate sanitation facilities. In rural areas, 54 percent of the population
could only access unsanitary latrines and 12 percent still practised open defecation. In urban areas,

                                                        27
sewerage systems and wastewater treatment from municipal and industrial activities are quasi
inexistent. On-site sanitation is the norm. People rely on manual and sometimes mechanical pit
emptying services, which dispose fecal sludge, with no treatment, in unprotected sites. Health
impacts as well as environmental degradation, extreme flooding and groundwater pollution pose
serious health risks in densely populated areas.

61.    With respect to education, even though significant improvements have been achieved
since the early 2000s, Cameroon’s performance still falls short of that of other low middle
income countries. As of 2014, more than 85 percent of children aged between six and 11 were
enrolled in primary school. At the secondary level, gross enrolment is about 66 percent and net
enrolment 53 percent, suggesting a low rate of transition between primary and secondary
education. Indeed, the transition rate from primary to secondary increased from 31 percent in 1999
to 65 percent in 2011 but this still trails the performance of other lower middle income countries
which achieve 91 percent on average. Similarly, the lower secondary completion rate almost
doubled from 22 percent in 2003 to 40 percent in 2011, but falls short of the lower middle income
average of 49 percent.

62.     Cameroon’s total fertility rate (TFR) of 4.9 remains very high,33 with minor reductions
over the past 25 years (the TFR was 5.8 in 1991). The unmet need for contraception among married
women is high (18 percent). Because of its persistently high fertility Cameroon has a population
age structure that is concentrated towards dependent children (42.9 percent of the population is
less than 15 years old), which negatively affects its prospects for human development and
economic growth.

63.     The adolescent fertility rate is high with 11 per cent of female adolescents aged 15 to
19 giving birth each year. In 2011, 42 percent of girls had had their first childbirth before the age
of 20. Regional disparities are significant: in the East and Far North, respectively, 46.8 percent and
34.4 percent of young women 15 to 19 years of age had already become pregnant in 2011, while
in Yaoundé this rate was only 18 percent. Education and poverty explain these differences (see

also Figure 3.7): 55 percent of adolescents aged 15 to 19 without any education were pregnant or
already had a child, a rate that is six higher than among girls with a secondary education (9
percent). Similarly, 37 percent of young women aged 15 to 19 in the poorest quintiles had begun
their reproductive life, whereas only 14 percent of young women in the richest quintile had done
so.34

3.2          Human capital inequalities

64.     Regional inequalities in health and education outcomes are significant. Irrespective of
the health or education indicator selected, those living in northern Cameroon are worse off.
Malnutrition for instance, measured as height for age is 45 percent in the Far North region, whereas
for Yaoundé and Douala it is approximately 13 percent. Under-five mortality in the Far North and
North regions is 3-4 times higher than in Douala and Yaoundé. In the Far North only 30 percent
of children under-two receive a full set of vaccinations, as opposed to 75 percent in the South-
West region and 82 percent in the North West region. The net enrollment rate for primary
education in 2014 was 63, 74 and 74 percent in the Far North, the North and Adamawa regions
respectively, versus 85-95 percent in the other regions. At the secondary level, in 2011 gross
enrollment was 22 and 29 percent and net enrolment only14 and 18 percent in the Far North and
North regions, respectively.

65.     The poorest wealth quintiles and people living in rural areas have the worst human
capital outcomes. The contrast is enormous and much higher than in comparator countries. Four
percent of children from the top wealth quintile are underweight, as opposed to 27 percent of those
in the poorest wealth quintile. Under-five mortality is 55 per thousand amongst those in the top
quintile and 166 per thousand for those in the bottom quintile. Compare this for instance with Côte
d’Ivoire where 20 percent of the children from the poorest quintile are underweight as opposed to
10 percent of the children from wealthiest one. In Ghana, 10.6 percent of the urban and 16 percent
of the rural children are underweight, while for Cameroon the corresponding figures are 7 percent
of urban children compared to 20 percent of rural children.

66.     Girls remain discriminated particularly those from socioeconomically disadvantaged
groups and from northern Cameroon. While overall gender parity in secondary schooling is
around 0.9, implying that girls enroll in secondary school at a rate only slightly lower than boys,
only about 30-40 percent of gross and net enrolment in the poorest quintile is female, and only 30
percent in the Far North and 32 percent in the North region. These inequities in girls’ education
are then reflected in inequities in women’s education and ultimately, maternal and child health and
mortality. Consequently, the median number of years of schooling of women of ages 15-49 in the
North and Far North regions and in the poorest quintile is zero, implying that the majority of these
women have no schooling. Meanwhile, the median number of years of schooling of their peers in
other regions is more than five years; it is nine years in Yaoundé and 9.5 years in the wealthiest
quintile. Only 25 and 33 percent of childbearing women in the Far North and North regions get
qualified delivery assistance. The North and the Far North are the only two regions of Cameroon
that feature single digit rates for the use of any contraceptive method by married women as only
3.7 percent use contraception in the Far North and 4.9 in the North region.

67.      Over time many of these disparities have worsened despite overall improvements. The
chances of a child in the North-West region receiving a full set of vaccines in the first two year of
its life are 2.6 times higher than the chances of a child born in the Far North. Even though infant
vaccinations rates increased by 22 percent in the South-West between 2004 and 2011, these rates
decreased by more than 7 percent in the Far North. Disparities in secondary schooling widened
between northern Cameroon and the other regions, as well as between the bottom wealth quintile
and the other wealth quintiles. Even though every region experienced increases in secondary
school enrolment between 2004 and 2011 the North and Far North regions experienced less of an
increase. At the secondary level, gross enrolment is only 22 and 29 percent and net enrolment is
only 14 and 18 percent in the Far North and North regions. This implies a negative gap of about
80 percentage points in gross enrolment and a negative gap of about 50 percentage points in net
enrolment, compared to Douala and Yaoundé. The North and Far North are the only two regions
in which gross enrollment rates for secondary education grew by less than 10 percent during 2004-
2011. At the same time, the North-West, the West and the South-West demonstrated an increase
of around 30 percent. Virtually no change in secondary school enrolment was registered in the
poorest quintile despite increases of more than 15 to 30 percentage points in gross secondary
school enrolment and increases of about 10 to 20 percentage points in net secondary school
enrolment in the other quintiles.

68.    Within-region socio-economic disparities (at the detriment of the poorest in the
poorest regions) and rural-to-urban migration contribute to some of the observed patterns.
Some of the poorest regions saw increases of two years in men’s median years of schooling
between 2007 and 2014, but the poorest two quintiles saw no change. This suggests significant
increases in schooling among the richer in the poorest regions. While the poorest in these regions
became less educated over time, on average these regions saw increased educational attainment.
Almost no change in men’s years of schooling is observed in the rural population, while it
increased by one year in urban areas. This could be, partly, due to migration of more educated
individuals from rural to urban areas.

3.3            Quality and relevance of human capital for growth and poverty reduction

69.     A healthy labor force is key to any growth and poverty reduction strategy. The
capacity to work is a main source of capital for most Cameroonians. Sicknesses have high costs
for the poor, not in the least because private outlays to fund health care are high, but also because
they affect the ability to work. Reporting to have been sick over the past two weeks is associated
with a reduction of 18 percentage points in men’s personal income in urban areas and 13

percentage points in rural areas.35 Malaria transmission, for instance, generally coincides with the
planting and harvesting seasons, making the illness particularly damaging for the rural poor.
Estimates of days lost to malaria vary across Africa and across studies, but are generally high: up
to a month per year36 and in one case 64 days37. Days lost to other diseases like tuberculosis and
HIV-AIDS can be even higher. These estimates are very relevant to Cameroon, where malaria is
the disease with the highest incidence reported by about 30 percent of individuals.38

70.     Poor health and malnutrition impair the ability to invest in and benefit from
education. Both child and parent health problems affect education. Sick or hungry children miss
school or cannot learn.39 Early interventions, such as better nutrition earlier in life, lead to greater
work capacity, especially for boys, and are shown to be linked to better education outcomes. Iron
supplementation and deworming drugs have been shown to increase weight and reduce
absenteeism, especially among children who were most anemic. Studies show that better nourished
people earn higher wages. Overall, children receiving better post-natal care are shown to be
healthier and more productive as adults.

71.    Like health, education is key to building skills and enhancing labor productivity. At
the individual level, education increases earning potential and reduces the risk of falling into
poverty. Literacy is a basic tool to gain knowledge, advanced skills and good income; yet large
shares of the adult population are illiterate, especially in the more socioeconomically
disadvantaged regions and segments and among women. In 2011, about 42 percent of adult women
and 27 percent of adult men in Cameroon could not read at least an entire phrase; 29 percent of
adult women and 16 percent of adult men could not read any word at all. In 2014, Cameroon’s
women literacy rates had increased to about 74 percent but were still significantly lower than for
men. These high rates of illiteracy imply important barriers to economic and social progress,
especially for women. Adult illiteracy is skewed towards other socioeconomically disadvantaged
groups: it is significantly higher in the rural areas (57 percent), in the Far North (76 percent) and
North (66 percent) and much more prevalent amongst those in the poorest wealth quintile (81
percent).

72.    Basic mathematics and reading comprehension are skills needed to advance
economically and socially, but Cameroon’s performance is on the decline. Although still
ranking the highest of the francophone countries in 2005, grade-five PASEC results decreased
between 1996 and 2005 for both mathematics and French. Another round of testing was completed
in 2014 and the results show further declines. Fifty one percent of children in grade six have not
acquired the desired level of competency in reading. Results are worse for math: 65 percent have
not acquired the desired level of competency.

73.   The decline in learning at school coincides with improvements in primary enrollment,
completion and transition to secondary school. The expanded access to schooling by children

   In Tanzania a recent World Bank study estimated the productivity losses due to anemia to be US$167 billion per
year or 0.86 percent of GDP.

from more disadvantaged backgrounds may explain the drop in the quality of education. Other
reasons could equally apply. For instance, teacher motivation may be limited following the decline
in salaries experienced in the early 1990s and due to the fact that many teachers do not have a full
civil servant status but are on a short term (four years) contract and are not entitled to any pension
or other benefits.

74.     Secondary and higher education do not offer job-relevant competencies for private
sector growth. Education and training programs that directly support the development and growth
of priority sectors enroll few students. For instance, enrolment in engineering programs that train
students for large infrastructure projects, in line with the country’s investment plans, represented
only 5 percent of total tertiary enrolment in 2010. Less than 0.4 percent of students study
agriculture despite agriculture being a main source of growth and livelihood in the country. By
contrast, about 70 percent of total tertiary enrolment is in economics and management, law, and
social sciences; studies that train students more for a public rather than a private sector career.
Even in pre-tertiary Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), the distribution of
enrolment in agriculture programs or fields relevant to agriculture is very low.

75.     Enrolment in non-formal TVET programs is skewed towards basic manual work as
well as towards secretarial and office management work, while higher levels of technical and
professional training are largely ignored. Consequently there is a mismatch in technical skills

                                                                                                        33
taught and those required, as well as a lack of basic skills reported for some sectors. Enterprise
survey data collected in 2010 indicate that the technical skills mismatch is the most prevalent
constraint regarding the workforce. Another indication of skills mismatch is the coexistence of a
fairly high unemployment rate for tertiary education graduates (about 25 percent) and, as will be
shown below, a fairly high rate of return for those graduates, pointing to scarcity of the right
qualifications. Youth unemployment as a result of skills miss-match is also an important source of
fragility (chapter 5). Going forward, basic skills and technical skills need to go hand in hand, as
basic skills will provide the foundation for the development of technical skills, while technical
skills will lead to enhancements in productivity.

3.4     Benefits from investments in human capital

76.     Well-targeted and well-managed spending on health, education and training
contribute to boosting economic growth and reducing poverty over the shorter and longer
terms. Direct channels include improved labor productivity and employment opportunities, and
increased earnings, consumption, savings and investment in the economy. Indirect channels
include more extensive and effective transmission of knowledge, skills and technologies, reduced
vulnerability to shocks and welfare-enhancing household and social behavior. There are important
complementarities between health and education40. For example when people expect to live longer
they tend to invest more in their productivity. Better education increases and improves adoption
of healthcare services. Moreover, while earlier investments in education and health may be more
cost-effective and sustainable, later investments in life could bring significant benefits and help
reverse earlier negative shocks or missed investments.41

77.     Schooling and training contribute to higher welfare. According to Figure 3.6, primary
school completion brings, on average, a gain of 53 percentage points in income from main
employment. Lower secondary completion brings a gain of 74 percentage points and more than
doubles income, and tertiary completion close to triples income, relative to those without any
completed level of education. Among those with some schooling,42 an additional year of schooling
increases income by 10 percentage points.43 A similar, though lower, effect is found for per capita
expenditures. Given that the cost of primary and secondary schooling is relatively low, these
results suggest that those education levels are potentially a highly cost-effective investment for a
lower-middle-income country like Cameroon. Tertiary education in certain fields is also a
potentially highly cost-effective investment.

78.     Returns to each level of education are reduced when training and literacy are
accounted for, due to overlap in effect of these variables. As Figure 3.6 shows literacy brings
about the same benefits as primary school completion in terms of personal income and about twice

   Due to a large share of the population with no schooling (especially among women, as discussed above), the
distribution of years of schooling is highly skewed towards zero and those with no schooling are excluded from
estimation specifications where years of schooling is expressed as a continuous variable, instead of levels.
43
   Estimations undertaken on ECAM3 2007 data show a rate of return of about 14 percent (see Skills Development in
Cameroon, 2015, mimeo).

the benefits in terms of per capita household expenditures. In other words, all else equal, an adult
who has completed primary school and is adequately literate earns on average a 54 percentage
more than an adult who did not complete schooling and who is not literate, whereas for an adult
with only primary school completion the gain is 28 percentage points. All else equal, an adult with
lower secondary school completion who is literate and trained earns about twice as much as an
illiterate adult with no completed level of school and no training. Estimates undertaken on ECAM3
2007 data show that technical secondary and tertiary education have a 50 percent higher return
than general education, pointing to the importance of investing in technical fields.44

79.     The economic benefits of education are especially high for women and for people
living in rural areas. Figure 3.6 shows that, among income-generating women of ages 24-60 in
rural areas, primary completion brings a gain of 28 percent in income from main employment;
lower secondary completion brings a gain of 45 percent, upper secondary completion more than
doubles income, and tertiary completion more than triples income, relative to those without any

higher levels of education for women in urban areas. These results further confirm the high value
of investing in the education of women and those in rural areas – the educationally disadvantaged.
Similar patterns of returns to education and training are found for household per capita
consumption. One pattern that stands out in comparing the 2007 rates of returns with the 2014
rates of returns is the increase in returns to education gradient at all levels as well as in returns to
training for women in rural areas.45

80.    Beyond its high economic return, women’s educational attainment is a strong
determinant of fertility, access to reproductive health services, as well as child survival and
health. Figure 3.7 shows that women who completed secondary school have almost one child less
than those who did not complete any education; women who completed tertiary education have
approximately two children less. While women with higher levels of education are associated with
substantially lower fertility, the effect of the mother’s education on under-five mortality, prenatal
care and stunting rates is relatively small. This suggests that except for fertility (which may be
considered as more of a choice than the other indicators), basic education is most critical to key

81.    Government spends relatively little on education and health in relation to GDP. With
Government spending 3.3 percent of GDP on education and 1.7 percent on health, Cameroon trails
behind SSA (4.4 and 2.5 percent respectively), as well as other lower middle income countries (4.4
and 1.5 percent respectively). Low levels of spending translate into low levels of service: the
student-teacher ratio is 46 in primary schools, higher than the averages for SSA or lower middle
income countries (of 43 and 30 respectively). The number of doctors per thousand residents is
extremely low, at 0.08, trailing far behind the average for SSA (0.20) or for lower middle income
countries (0.75).

to three times more than that of the regions with the lowest numbers - and barely receive more
investment per student from the Government.

83.     Households bear a large share of healthcare and schooling expenditures, which
exacerbates socioeconomic inequalities due to relatively greater financial burden on poorer
households. As illustrated in Figure 3.8, Cameroon has among the highest shares of private
spending, at over 60 percent of healthcare expenditures. Moreover, according to Figure 3.8, as of
2011, households paid over 40 percent of national expenditures on education. Figure 3.8 shows
that poorer households are much more likely to have to sell goods and livestock to cover the cost
of health services. The poorest also have little savings to draw from.

84.    Comparisons with other middle income countries provide evidence on inefficiencies
in spending on health and education. As shown in Figure 3.9 (right panel) Cameroon has public
per capita health expenditures of US$48 in PPP terms, similar to the level of several other middle-
income. Yet under-five mortality is the fifth highest overall, at 94.5 per thousand live births.
Similarly, in education, Figure 3.9 (left panel) shows that Cameroon has the very lowest rate of
lower secondary school completion, at 40 percent. While two other countries have lower public
spending per lower secondary student and five other countries also have public spending per lower
secondary student at less than US$1,000 PPP, Cameroon trails them by 23-57 percentage points

                                                                                                         38
in lower secondary completion rate. Given that the majority of healthcare expenditures in
Cameroon are borne by households, data on private expenditures demonstrates even more severe
inefficiencies. At US$90 PPP per capita spending exceeds that of 23 of the 100 other middle
income countries; yet under-five mortality is worse in Cameroon than in 22 of those countries. In
other words, large private spending does not result in good health for households, indicating a
severely ineffective healthcare system. 47

85.     Underlying the lack of public resources for the health and education sectors, as well
as their poor allocation and use, are a lack of accountability and transparency. A recent report
by the GAVI Alliance on results from in-depth audits of management of funds in donor-funded
health sector projects reveals serious corruption and poor governance.48 In 2010, in an effort to
address widespread corruption, the Ministry of Public Health set up an anti-corruption unit, which
by 2013 had reviewed about 400 reports of corruption, with sanctions applied in most cases to
lower level staff. The most common issues reported were supplementary payment for laboratory
services, sale of illegal drugs, falsification of statistics, work in a private clinic during public
service hours, and double billing for services.49 However, this is only a first step in addressing a
deeply rooted system-wide problem.

86.     In education, Cameroon was ranked 130 out of 168 countries in the perception of
corruption index published by Transparency International in 2015. In 2010 Cameroon had
the second highest share (more than 35 percent) of surveyed individuals reporting having paid a
bribe in education. Moreover, primary schools were found to have a 15 percent teacher
absenteeism rate, meaning teachers are paid for at least three days per month that they do not work.
Basic equipment provided by the Government to guarantee proper school functioning usually
arrives late, is of poor quality or is unsuited to school needs. These findings are corroborated by
findings from a study on governance in the education sector in Cameroon, which highlighted
pervasive issues of lack of accountability and poor governance capacity.50 There is an absence of
public information on financial and material resources at all levels.

87.      Lack of accountability and transparency is enabled by a lack of quality standards,
poorly designed and implemented human resource policies, and performance measurements
which do not focus on outcomes. The current management system in education is fragmented,
with each of the five ministries51 responsible for their own sub-sector. No unified system of
collection and management of data and information exists to inform policy design and
implementation. Standardized learning assessments are also lacking. Moreover, there is extensive
attrition of teachers in remote and rural areas. Regular civil servant teachers in Cameroon are
evaluated via generic confidential reports, which are unaligned with educational activities. Even
contract teachers, who are closely monitored, do not perform better because of lack of performance

but then appointed to administrative positions. Moreover, while access to higher education is
inadequate, there is no autonomous agency for accreditation of new institutions and programs
(Skills for Development in Cameroon, 2015 mimeo).

88.    The health sector also lack strategies to stimulate workers to offer health care services
in disadvantaged areas. No comprehensive harmonized Health Information System exists to
support tracking of outcomes, personnel and resources and inform effective and timely
management and decision-making. The current regulatory framework provides many loopholes
that may act as performance disincentives. The revenue-sharing system being one example. At the
same time, mechanisms for internal control and auditing in hospitals and facilities are missing.53

89.     There is a dearth of policies, mechanisms and resources to empower officials,
personnel, and communities at the local level. Such approaches could improve the adequacy
and quality of service delivery in health and education at the frontline. The poor outcomes in
maternal and child health, especially in socio-economically disadvantaged and hard-to-reach areas,
point to important gaps in engagement with local communities to help raise awareness and promote
best practices. Moreover, facility-based services are critical to remote areas, but health facility
managers are not equipped with management capacities and not given autonomy to make decisions
to tailor service delivery to local needs. No mechanism exists for information dissemination and
feedback communication, so that communities can exercise social control.54

90.     Parents and communities barely have a voice with regards to the quality of their
children’s education, due to lack of information and mechanisms for communication and action,
as well as lack of resources.55 Schools’ parents’ associations or management councils often exist
but have very limited functionality. Additionally, although there are local inspectorates to monitor
school operations, they are seriously understaffed and do not have the means of transport to reach
many schools.56 In technical and vocational training and in higher education, the offering of
programs and courses is not linked with strategies for economic growth, industrial development
and job creation, and it is not coordinated with the private sector either. This gives rise to low
employability and low productivity, undermining the cost-effectiveness of public and household
investment.57

Box 3.1: The demographic transition and demographic dividend in Cameroon

 Demographic dividend refers to a period – usually 20 to 30 years – when fertility rates fall due to significant
 reductions in child and infant mortality rates. As families realize that fewer children will die during infancy or
 childhood, they begin to have fewer children thus reducing the proportion of dependents. This fall is often
 accompanied by an extension in average life expectancy that increases the portion of the population that is in the
 working age-group. This cuts spending on dependents, increases means available for productive investments and
 spurs economic growth. A country with both increasing numbers of young people and declining fertility has the
 potential to reap a demographic dividend.

 According to the 2015/2016 Global Monitoring Report, Cameroon is a pre-demographic dividend country. The
 demographic dividend refers to the potential for accelerated economic growth made possible by opportunities
 created by changes in the age structure of the population that occur when countries go through their demographic
 transition.

   Four groups of countries can be identified based on the opportunities for growth and development that
                                       demographic change presents

 Two distinct phases can be defined. The first dividend can be captured as the demographic transition speeds up and
 the population age structure becomes more concentrated around working ages. Everything else being equal, a larger
 share of working age citizens delivers higher per capita growth. The second phase comes later when countries are
 able to increase savings and investments (in physical and human capital) as a result of fewer dependent children,
 more disposable income and prospects for longer lives.

 During the initial part of the demographic transition, the rise in the ratio of working-age to dependent population
 produces an automatic demographic dividend, but the dividend is even greater if young workers are employed
 productively. This may be difficult in the early part of the transition, when the absolute numbers of youth are rising
 and the economy might not be able to absorb the cohort into productive employment. However, there is scope for
 higher productivity in the formal sector, the agriculture sector, and the nonfarm informal sector.

 To harness the demographic dividend, policies are required that hasten the transition and enable the ability of people
 to be productive. Policies in three key areas would help to accelerate the fertility transition and increase the
 demographic dividend: reductions in child mortality, increases in female education, and improved access to
 comprehensive family planning services. Improvements in these three areas are desirable regardless of the potential
 economic payoffs, but they should receive even higher priority than they do today.

      4. ECONOMIC GROWTH AND CROSS CUTTING ECONOMIC
                         SERVICES


Cameroon is a lower middle income country but its economy remains oriented towards the primary
sector. Opportunities for rapid growth are ample but require investments in economic
infrastructure and an improved regulatory framework to be realized. To grow the economy will
need to attract more domestic and foreign private investments, which in turn requires a friendlier
business environment.

4.1     Introduction

91.     Cameroon is a small sized economy ranking as the world’s 98th largest by nominal
GDP. The economy is largely driven by its primary sector, agriculture and mineral resources and
benefits from its location in the Congo Basin, the world’s second largest tropical forest zone which
provides an exceptional ecological diversity. The country’s mineral wealth includes deposits of
oil, natural gas, gold, iron, manganese and uranium. Crude petroleum is an important resource. It
accounts for 10 percent of GDP and is the main export product by value. Timber is the second
largest export product. Imports are dominated by manufactured goods and come mainly from
Europe, Africa and Asia. Cameroon is a member of the Central African Economic and Monetary
Community (CEMAC by its French abbreviation). CEMAC countries (Cameroon, Central African
Republic, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon) share a common currency, the
CFA Franc which is pegged to the Euro and which is overseen by the Bank of Central African
States (BEAC).58 Within CEMAC Cameroon is the largest economy, making up approximately 30
percent of its GDP and hosting about 50 percent of its population.

92.     Two complementary perspectives on Cameroon’s economy can be put forward. One
is that the economy is well-managed. Since the crisis that started in the mid-1980s and the
devaluation of 1994 the economy has grown steadily (see Figure 1.3). The country has remained
a haven of stability in an otherwise unstable region and managed to avoid major macro-economic
problems. The debt to GDP ratio is low (thanks to HIPC) and prices tend to be stable. These are
major achievements, particularly when one considers that a key characteristic distinguishing rich
and poor countries is not that they have higher positive growth rates when they grow (they do not),
but that rich countries experience fewer years of negative income growth and smaller declines
when negative growth occurs.59 So the fact that Cameroon has managed to avoid negative growth
altogether for almost 25 years is noteworthy.

93.    At the same time the economy operates well below its potential. This view is
underscored by the observation that despite the potential offered by natural resources, access to
the sea, a capable bureaucracy and a stable macro-economic environment, the country is not
growing very rapidly. Growth has been reasonable over the last five years (3.1 percent per capita

58
   The CEMAC countries maintain a common external tariff on imports from non-CEMAC countries. In theory, tariffs
have been eliminated on trade within CEMAC, but full implementation of this has been delayed. Movement of capital
within CEMAC is free.

per year) but this is mostly attributable to large public works and favourable rains. The natural
resource boom has bypassed the country and growth is not driven by increases in total factor
productivity. The share of the industrial sector (excluding oil) is stagnant, while the tertiary sector,
a sector in which the country has no international comparative advantage is expanding. Economic
opportunities are limited and many educated Cameroonians who have the opportunity, prefer to
leave.

 The economy does not show signs of economic transformation. The tertiary sector is expanding at the expense of
         while the oil sector is declining and most employment remains confined to the informal sector.

    Changes in total factor productivity do not contribute to growth; instead growth has been driven by public
  investments and increases in the size of the labor force. Meanwhile a large number of small and informal firms
 generate as much employment as a very small number of large (modern) firms. The latter generate most revenue.

94.     The outlook for the future is uncertain. The end of the oil boom and a rapid increase in
debt (from a low base) create macro-economic uncertainty. The increase in debt is the result of
large outlays to deal with the security threats in the north and a boom in public investments –for
which it is not clear whether the necessary returns will be generated. While these risks are
manageable –inflation, for instance, remains below 3 percent- they do raise questions as to whether
Cameroon will be able to uphold its reputation for prudent macro-economic management or
whether much of the progress made over the last two decades may be lost during a recession
induced by unsustainable public spending, as happened in the 1980s.

4.2     Structure of the economy

95.    The structure of Cameroon’s GDP has remained relatively stable since 1995. The
primary and secondary sector (excluding petroleum) each contribute 25 percent to GDP. The
contribution of the tertiary sector has been gradually expanding, from 36 to 45 percent of GDP at
the expense of the petroleum sector which declined from 15 percent of GDP to 5 percent in 2012
(Figure 4.1).

96.     The primary sector is dominated by the production of food crops grown almost
exclusively by smallholder farmers. This is followed by livestock production and export
agriculture (cocoa, bananas and cotton) but the contributions of these sectors to primary GDP are
five to eight times smaller than that of food production. The contribution of forestry to primary
GDP is surprisingly low, given the abundant availability of this resource. However, wood products,
raw as well as sawn wood, made up 13 percent of all exports in 2013.

97.     Within the secondary sector, manufacturing and extractives are the dominant
activities. The extractives industry is dominated by the petroleum sector which made up 43 percent
of Cameroon’s exports in 2013, followed by gold with less than 2 percent of exports in 2013. Agro-
food industries are the third most important sub-sector within the secondary sector.

Figure 4.3: Core economic indicators
 The contribution of the primary sector to the overall economy is more than what is reflected in its contribution to
 GDP, as this sector has important linkages to the secondary sector (agro-food and manufacturing) as well as to
 the tertiary sector (trade, transport). Primary sector products dominate Cameroon’s exports.

98.     (Retail) trade and food services are the largest subsectors within the tertiary sector.
The large share of the (retail) trade sector is reflected in the presence of a large non-farm informal
sector in the economy. Within the tertiary sector, the telecommunications sector is surprisingly
underdeveloped –at least relative to other countries such as Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya or Tanzania.

99.     The expansion of the tertiary sector is also reflected in changes in the composition of
the labor force. Between 2005 and 2010 the fraction of the labor force (those aged between 15
and 65) engaged in the primary sector fell by more than 2 percent, while the fraction engaged in
the tertiary sector increased by almost 4 percent. In absolute terms, the number engaged in the

                                                        45
secondary sector remained constant at 1.6 million people, while those engaged in the primary and
tertiary sectors increased from 6.3 to 6.9 million and from 3.5 to 4.4 million people respectively.

100. Cameroon has yet to enter the world market for processed goods. In 2012 182 products
were exported60 to 77 trading partners, 66 percent of these exports were raw materials, 18 percent
consumer goods and 14 percent intermediate goods. Exports comprise largely of unprocessed
primary goods. This is plausibly the consequence of the resource curse brought by the dominance
of the oil sector.61 It is also the result of an unattractive regulatory business environment and high
transport, energy and telecommunication costs. The top export products are petroleum with 43
percent of 2013 total exports, food products (17 percent) and wood (13 percent). The only niche
market of transformed goods that Cameroon seem to have been able to exploit is that of the
maintenance of oil rigs that operate in the Gulf of Guinea. It is registered under passenger and
cargo ship in Figure 4.3.

101. The economy remains dominated by the primary sector and non-tradeable services.
This dominance is reflected in the country’s low ranking on the economic complexity index. In
2013 Cameroon ranked 118th on this index, seventh from the bottom. The complexity index62
measures the total amount of productive knowledge that is embedded in an economy. It is
calculated by accounting for the number of different types of products a country produces, and the
complexity of these products as measured by the number of other countries that are also able to
make these products. A country should plausibly seek a development path that builds on the
knowledge already captured in its existing product mix, and aim to gradually increase the
complexity of the products produced. Countries don’t ‘jump’ from exporting cotton or gold to
exporting cars, but build their productive capacities over time until the economy possesses the
knowledge required to move into a complex product area like cars.

102. The trade regime needs to be liberalized. Cameroon has one of the highest average trade
tariff rates in the world. According to the Global Competitiveness Report of 2014-2015, when
compared to other countries Cameroon ranks 132 out of 144 in terms of weighted average tariff
rates. According to the World Trade Organization (WTO), agriculture is the most protected sector
in the CEMAC countries with an average tariff rate of 23.6 percent. On the other hand, the sector
comprising the extractive industries is the least protected, with most of the tariff lines
corresponding to a 10 percent tariff rate. Cameroon applies some exceptions to the Common
External Tariff (CET) including exemptions to the trade of live animals, animal products, and
vegetable products. The country has 107 tariff lines that have higher rates than those of the CET.63
Many products face an excise duty rate of 25 percent, the maximum rate provided in CEMAC
agreements.64

61
   Other signs of the resource curse affecting Cameroon’s economy are the fact that prices for non-tradeables are high.
Yaoundé, for instance, is the city with one of the highest per diems, only to be surpassed by capital cities in other
natural resource rich nations, such as Angola, DRC, Nigeria and Gabon. Other capital cities ranking higher are Dakar
in Senegal and Victoria in the Seychelles. Also on the Mercer 2015 Cost of Living Index Yaoundé appears amongst
the most costly African capitals (rank 12).

103. Exports dominated by natural resources, make the country vulnerable to price
shocks. This was the case in the run up to the crisis in the 1980s, which was driven by a decline in
oil revenue at a time when public spending had increased. History may currently be repeating itself
in that public spending (and particularly public investments) have increased significantly at a time
when oil revenues have declined,65 contributing to large deficits on the trade balance.

104. Low levels of exports (25 percent of GDP in 2015) limit aggregate demand and
diminish growth prospects. Growth in Cameroon is driven by domestic consumption and public
investment with active implementation of major public infrastructure projects in energy, transport
and Information and Communications Technologies (ICT). Since independence, Cameroon’s
export to GDP ratio has exceeded 30 percent only during the oil boom and in 2007 and 2008.
Given Cameroon’s rich natural endowment, this is in stark contrast with a country like Côte
d’Ivoire that has experienced export to GDP ratios higher than 35 percent since independence and
exceeding 50 percent since 2005. Furthermore, it appears that the trends of GDP per capita and
exports per capita became decoupled in 2000, with the latter gradually declining while per capita
GDP increased.

105. Cameroon’s economy is characterized by an active public sector involvement. State-
owned enterprises (SOEs) are many, as are companies with Government participation. 66 State

snuff, other manufactured tobaccos, foie gras, caviar and its substitutes, salmon, precious stones and metals, and
jewelry, are subject to a 25 percent excise duty.
65
   The decline in oil revenue is somewhat mitigated by the fact that production has increased.
66
   According to the Product Market Regulation database used for the analysis in this sector, an SOE is defined as a
company in which state or provincial governments (not including local governments or municipalities) hold, either
directly or indirectly through a government-controlled company, the largest single share of the firm’s equity capital.
Public ownership is measured by the extent to which the government participates and intervenes in markets through
the scope and scale of its SOEs. Publicly controlled firms also include government entities that are not organized as
companies, but operate in business activities.

                                                                       47
owned enterprises range in size from a few employees to Cameroon’s second largest employer—
the Cameroon Development Corporation—which employs over 22,000 workers.67 They are
relatively important in agricultural exports and hold monopolies in key network infrastructure,
notably in energy, transportation, and telecommunications. Cameroon Telecommunications
(CAMTEL) holds a monopoly in national telephone landlines, the international gateway, and
internet infrastructure. In the oil and gas sector state companies dominate extraction, refinery,
storage, and distribution. SOEs collectively employ about 40,000 workers, with an annual average
total wage bill equivalent to about 0.8 percent of annual average GDP in 2009-2013. This compares
to 6 percent for the public sector, and 4 percent for the formal private sector, highlighting the
importance of SOEs for formal employment.68

of which are exported unprocessed

106. SOEs contribute to an inefficient allocation of resources. Many SOEs are loss-
incurring, draining scarce budget resources. Between 2009 and 2013 net subsidies to the sector
varied from 0.4 to 1.1 percent of GDP. The debt of SOEs stood at 12.6 percent of GDP in 2013.
In addition, SOEs have amassed significant contingent liabilities—of nearly 15 percent of GDP in
the form of debt and arrears, which suggests increasing fiscal risks for the state. Weak corporate
governance is a key factor in poor SOE performance. Symptoms include politicized boards and
managements, weak accountability for results, ownership arrangements prone to conflicts of
interest, limited transparency, and inefficient oversight and capacity in key functions such as
procurement.

107. Douala and Yaoundé demonstrate their economic dominance by hosting the majority
of non-farm enterprises. Cameroon’s two largest cities host 24 percent of the country’s
population who enjoy 45 percent of all consumption in the country. It is not uncommon for
economic development to be concentrated in cities. It is easier to grow and develop in areas of
high population density and income per capita. The ability to trade goods is also important, which
is why the coastal zones tend to perform better. Cameroon is no exception to this pattern, although
relative to other African Coastal zones, its GDP per km2 is not particularly elevated; another hint
at Cameroon’s unmet economic potential (see Figure 4.6).

108. Less than 10 percent of the labor force is formally employed. Even in urban areas less
than 20 percent of the labor force is formally engaged. Because of this low share, even rapid growth
rates in the formal sector is unlikely to keep pace with the number of new entrants in the labor
market. Improving labor productivity and earnings of those employed in the informal sector, in
addition to creating new jobs, is therefore key in making Cameroon’s economic growth more
inclusive.

109. Informal enterprises abound in a non-conducive business environment. According to
the results of the second Survey on Employment and the Informal Sector (EEIS 2), more than 40
percent of non-farm informal sector units don’t have any dedicated space in which to carry out
their activity with about a third operating simply out of their private homes. Access to public
services such as electricity, telephone, or water supply and sanitation is very limited. Access to
finance is reported to be the most important constraint. The difficulty to get greater market access
and build a client base ranks also high on the list. Few operators, however, make an active effort
to reach out and gain new clients. Most of them prefer waiting for a client to come to them or using
social networks. Excess regulations, taxes, or the availability of skilled staff do not seem to rank
high as constraints. However, when asked what could be done to help develop their business, non-

information.

 It is not uncommon for economic development to occur at the coast. While this also holds for Cameroon it poses
 enormous challenges for economic integration.

4.3     Cross cutting economic services

110. The quality of the economic infrastructure is an important determinant of the cost of
doing business and consequently, opportunities for growth. Economic services include
transport services, financial services, telecommunication services, water supply and energy
services. They are critical in determining whether an economy is competitive internationally and
in creating economic opportunities domestically. For instance, where transport costs are high,
farming becomes less profitable as the cost of inputs is higher and the price for products lower.
Moreover, consumption goods that can be bought with the profits made are more expensive. This
creates a wedge that can make production increases unattractive, since the rewards for extra effort,
expressed in additional goods that can be bought, is so small. Transport costs can, thus, explain
why many rural households participate only to a limited degree in the market. Similarly, absence

                                                         50
of reliable electricity or limited access to finance will have negative consequences for business
development.

111. The economic infrastructure is underdeveloped. On the 2015 Global Competitiveness
index Cameroon ranks low on the indicators related to economic infrastructure. Out of 140
countries, Cameroon ranks 115th on transport infrastructure, 124th on electricity and telephone
infrastructure, 127th on ICT use and 98th on financial market development. Access to and the cost
of finance, infrastructure and transport, energy and water are consistently ranked as main obstacles
to growth.69

112. The road infrastructure is in poor condition. As much as 48 percent of the paved road
network and 85 percent of the unpaved road network in Cameroon is in poor condition. Despite
heavy investments the portion of roads in poor condition is increasing. Only 27 percent of the rural
population have access to an all-season road within 2 km of their home.70 Road conditions tend to
be worse in northern Cameroon. Moreover, the poor condition of the north-south corridor
exacerbates the relative isolation of the northern regions and reduces the international role
Cameroon could play as a transport hub connecting Chad and the Central African Republic to the
Port of Douala. This is illustrated in the right hand panel of Figure 4.7, which shows the presence
of an integrated economic cluster in the Coastal-Center region and another one in the Far North
region. The connectivity between these two clusters is limited, reducing the scope for trade and
specialization.

113. Prices for road transport are high. They are in the order of US$0.13 per ton-kilometer,
compared with US$ 0.05 per ton-kilometer in southern Africa and well above the US$0.04 per
ton-kilometer in much of the rest of the developing world. 71 Lack of competition is a key
determinant of high transport costs. High freight charges can be attributed to the combination of
lack of competition between freight-forwarders with a few dominant firms, and high information
asymmetry leaving the space for brokers to extract rents.72 In the trucking industry itself,
competition is actually high. Yet, this does not translate into lower transport prices because the
large number of small informal trucking firms (‘artisans’) lacks the capacity and collective action
to solve information asymmetry issues on the corridors.

114. Railway services have been concessioned and perform well. CAMRAIL operates the
1,000 km line from Douala to Ngaoundéré as well as 245 km of secondary lines. The railway
service plays a critical role in serving northern Cameroon, Chad, and the Central African Republic
(CAR). The initially obsolete rolling stock and deteriorated rail track infrastructure are gradually
being renewed. CAMRAIL competes directly with road operators in both domestic and
international freight. The share of rail freight to total freight between Douala and Ngaoundéré is
about 39 percent. More than two thirds of Chad’s imports and a large share of CAR exports
(especially timber) are transported by rail between Douala and Ngaoundéré for Chad and between
Belabo and Douala for the CAR. Rail-road competition is driving down road transport costs and

the corridor and its maintenance costs. In 2013, tariffs per ton-km and per container were
approximately 20 percent lower by rail than by road.

115. The port of Douala is affected by congestion. An efficient Port of Douala would be a key
source of growth, as it would ensure that imports including intermediate goods for domestic
production are cheaper in the domestic market and exports are more competitive on foreign
markets. However, the port ranks amongst the least efficient in Africa. The cost of importing a
container in Doula is high and dwell times are long, causing congestion. This makes Douala an
unattractive location for export oriented manufacturing companies. For these companies to be
economically profitable cargo dwell time should be less than five to six days on average. One
reason for the long dwell times is that many economic operators, including the Port Authority of
Douala have limited incentives to ensure the port functions efficiently. Many traders use the port
as a cheap place of storage. The daily storage fee has been set at a very low level of CFAF 600/day
(around US$1 per day) making it economically interesting for importers to keep cargo within the
port as external storage is more costly.73 This “rent”, is actively sought. For instance, in 2005, rice
importers convinced the Government to allow an exceptional 90 days free storage time for rice
(the normal free time is 11 days) as this commodity is the main imported food consumed in
Cameroon (about 700,000 tons per year). This decision has not been reversed since.

116. To help decongest Douala, the ports of Kribi and Limbe are being developed. The
thinness of the Cameroonian economy and the existence of similar ports in the region raise doubts

73
  This is particularly true for the dwell time of refrigerated containers for which the daily fees per container is
CFAF 10,000 (around US$15) while the cost for the terminal operator is twice higher (CFAF 24,500) due to the cost
of electricity. World Bank, 2015. Cameroon Economic Update.

about the economic viability of three ports, certainly in the short run. Moreover, new port
developments, managed by the same Port Authority, are unlikely to address the competiveness
issues that affect the Port of Douala.

117. Air transport is seriously underdeveloped. The public air-company CAMAIR-CO has
the monopoly on domestic flights. The company is in financial difficulties as a result of inadequate
management, poor investment decisions (large planes only) and overstaffing. As a result, internal
air transport is erratic and limited to a few routes between the main cities.

118. Power supply and reliability have long been important impediments to economic
growth in Cameroon. According to the World Bank’s 2007 Investment Climate Assessment, two
thirds of manufacturing firms cite power deficiencies as a constraint to doing business, leading to
losses as high as 4.3 percent of annual sales. About half of the small and medium enterprises and
90 percent of the large enterprises own generators74 and a third of the country’s installed generation
capacity is met by high-cost, high-polluting back-up generation, at US$0.46/kWh.

119. Cameroon’s public electricity tariffs are comparatively high but still do not cover all
costs. The country’s low and medium voltage power tariffs – between US$0.15/kWh and
US$0.18/kWh – are slightly above the regional average of US$0.14/kWh, but significantly above
the regional average of US$0.10/kWh for countries with hydro-based power systems. This is due
to high losses, in large part attributable to an outdated transmission and distribution system.
Despite relatively high energy tariffs, these do not recover all production costs, in part because
certain producers, such as ALUCAM, the Cameroonian metal scraps and ores manufacturer, get
electricity at subsidized rates. Even though the sector has a functioning pricing mechanism in
which the regulator sets the tariff at which the sector breaks-even, in recent years the authorities
have opted to not to pass on cost increases, but to subsidize the sector instead.

120. Important progress has been made to address the energy shortfall, including the
commissioning of the 216-MW Kribi Gas Power Plant, as well as the construction of the Lom
Pangar hydropower dam. Nonetheless, electricity demand exceeds supply (especially during the
dry season) by 80 - 100 MW and with an annual increase in demand of approximately 7 percent,
the supply for electricity will need to continue to increase. Cameroon’s vast hydropower potential
offers an important opportunity and could become the basis for a regional power pool.

121. The main constraint to the sector’s performance is investor uncertainty. The
electricity sector has benefited from major policy reforms, including the unbundling of
transmission and generation and the setting of the electricity tariff by an independent authority.
This has paid off, as suggested by the fact that the new Nachtigal hydro-dam will be mostly
privately financed. Yet, the sector needs to do more to gain the confidence of investors and attract
PPPs. The automatic adjustment of tariffs would be an important signal to foreign investors. In
addition, the Government’s needs to come through on its commitment to rely on equitable and
transparent competitive processes, and avoid sole sourced commercial agreements or ad hoc
Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs).

122. Access to water supply has progressed significantly, but remains below standard.
Between 1990 and 2012, the percent of the population using improved water sources has increased
from 51 percent to 74 percent. In urban areas almost 94 percent uses water from an improved
source, but only 28 percent has domestic connections. Others rely on collective standpipes and
vendors. While recent investments helped rehabilitate and expand water production capacities
(mostly in Yaoundé and Douala), distribution networks are insufficient to address a demand
fuelled by urbanization. Service provision is intermittent and of unreliable quality. In rural areas,
progress in access has been higher; yet only 52 percent of the rural population has access to
improved water sources from communal standpipes or protected wells.

123. Lack of coordinated and strategic planning constrain water and sanitation
development in rural and urban areas. While MINEE holds the overall coordination on the
sector, limited capacities and institutional fragmentation have hindered progress in these sub-
sectors. Expanding access to rural water relies mostly on external financial sources and on NGO
interventions. The implementation of the urban water sector reform and the PPP that started in
2007. It established a public asset holding company (Camwater) and a private service provider
(Camerounaise des Eaux, CDE). Progress has been limited due to governance issues and the
sector’s financial equilibrium is yet to be restored. There is a need to strengthen the PPP
governance and to rationalize ongoing and future investments in order to expand and improve
service delivery to cities and small towns.

124. The ICT sector is hindered by policy and regulatory bottlenecks. Although a new legal
and regulatory regime was adopted in 2010 and a third mobile license was granted in 2012, the
process of liberalizing the fixed line and broadband sectors has been slow. CAMTEL maintains a
monopoly on the access to international networks and the operation of national backbone. As a
result, competition dynamics do not play their role in improving the quality of services and
reducing prices for users, in fostering innovation, and in boosting cross synergies with the
financial, transport, energy, agriculture, education or health sectors.

125. Eleven percent of Cameroonian adults had bank accounts in 2014.75 Only 4.5 percent
receive a loan from the formal financial sector, even if between 2008 and 2013 banks increased
the number of branches by more than 90 percent. Financial inclusion through non-banks is quite
important. At the end of 2013 there were 1.9 million accounts in banks, 1.5 million in microfinance
institutions (MFIs), and at least 3.1 million in electronic money accounts. Unfortunately less than
7 percent of the e-money accounts are used in practice.76 Similarly, whereas only 8 percent of the
adult population saves at a financial institution, 35 percent participate in a savings club. These
savings clubs are used more by women (38 percent) than men (32 percent), and more by the better-
off (40 percent in the richest 60 percent) than the poor (27 percent in the bottom 40 percent).77
Savings clubs come in all shapes and sizes and some involve very significant amounts of money.

126. The formal banking system, dominated by commercial banks, is underdeveloped.
With liquidity estimated at US$1.5 billion, the banking sector provided credits to the private sector
to the tune of 13.7 percent of Cameroon’s GDP as of August 2013. This figure is well below the
roughly 20 percent average in the West African Economic and Monetary Union. It confirms the
difficulty of enterprises in getting loans. The banking sector is concentrated and competition is
relatively low. The three largest banks hold about 70 percent of total assets of all commercial
banks. These three banks dominate the banking landscape and could be seen as market setters in
terms of pricing of financial products and services. Spreads are high, at 10 percent, making credit
unattractive and reflecting the lack of effective competition among commercial banks.

127. Investment banking is underdeveloped. The role of investment banks is carried out
mainly by licensed commercial banks which act as “universal” banks. Because the traditional
banking activities of these banks are in competition with less lucrative investment banking
activities, there is limited promotion and development of financial markets. This in turn
substantially limits the capacity to mobilize long-term resources. This is aggravated by the co-
existence of two stock exchanges, one regional and one Cameroonian, the low rate of savings, the
limited core of institutional investors such as insurance companies and pension funds, and the
absence of demand from corporations to be listed.

128. Financing constraints thus remain acute for private enterprises, formal as well as
informal. In the 2009 Enterprise Census, access to credit is listed as a critical constraint to growth,
irrespective of the sector in which the firm operates. The 2009 Enterprise Survey digs deeper into
this issue and finds that almost 70 percent of all investments are financed internally by firms and
only 13 percent by banks. Collateral requirements are high, 213 percent of the loan amount. Access
to credit is also one of the top constraints in the informal sector.78 At times questions are raised
about whether firms are truly credit-constraint or whether banks are simply not able to assess the
credit-worthiness of firms. In Cameroon the latter is not relevant as more than 80 percent of formal
firms have audited accounts. 79

129. The private sector faces significant regulatory constraints. In addition to the constraints
associated with expensive and inadequate economic services and the presence of a many state
owned companies (often with local monopolies), doing business is made more complicated by a
large number of regulatory and other constraints. This is well illustrated by the cost of doing
business survey, and the world competiveness rankings, which show that Cameroon belongs to the
worst performers. This is particularly true in aspects like paying taxes (180th out of 189 – it takes
more than 600 hours to file a tax return), registering property (175nd) or trading across borders
(185th, it costs US$2,267 to import a container in Cameroon as opposed to US$1,190 in Togo or
US$1,360 in Ghana). These inefficiencies are reflected in the poor score on the ease of doing
business index and low total factor productivity. It also shows up in very low levels of FDI – in
fact there is a net outflow of FDI.

                                  As a consequence: FDI is low and the diaspora fails to return.

 Relative to other countries with comparable levels of income, firms in Cameroon indicate to be most constrained
  by governance constraints (tax administration and corruption, customs) followed by infrastructure (electricity)
 and access to finance. Access to land, macro-economic stability, crime, a shortage of labor and labor regulation
                are not the most pressing constraints. Firms do indicate a shortage of skilled labor.

130. The challenges brought about by the ambition to become a middle income country by
2035 are enormous. As formulated in the Vision 2035 Cameroon is expected to become an upper-
middle income country with a Gross National Income per capita (in 2013 Atlas US$) of above
US$4,125. Cameroon’s level of income (measured in the same terms) was US$1,290 in 2013, thus
requiring a growth of around 5.4 percent per capita over 2013-2035 to achieve the objective. As
population growth is about 2.5 percent per annum, real GDP must grow by around 8 percent for
over 20 years. Just how ambitious this is, is illustrated in Figure 4.12, which shows the path of real
GDP per capita for the Vision investment scenario. Even with an unprecedented increase in the
investment share of GDP (to 32 percent, requiring a level of domestic savings that was only
achieved during the height of the oil boom) Cameroon will miss its goal of becoming an upper
middle income country unless productivity growth is at least 1.5 percent per year. With 0 percent
Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth - the average achieved over 2001-2010, Cameroon would
only achieve less than half the increase in GDP per capita needed to reach upper middle income
status by 2035. In other words, if, and only if Cameroon manages to increase the efficiency of its
economy, and only if Cameroon manages to attract significant amounts of foreign direct
investment, which are, in turn, dependent on improvements in economic governance, can
Cameroon’s growth ambitions be achieved.

131. The scope to increase the economy’s efficiency is huge: it requires investments in the
economic infrastructure and accompanying policy reforms. The analysis has demonstrated the
cost imposed on the economy by unreliable electricity, pricy transport services, inadequate
telecommunication services, and an overall poor business environment. Investments will be
needed to address the most pressing bottlenecks, including rural access, the road to the north of
the country or the electricity transmission network. But equally important are policy reforms.
Roads need to be maintained, roadblocks abolished, transport cartels broken, inefficient ports
restructured, and competition in telecom and air transport improved. Electricity tariffs need to
reflect costs, regulatory obstacles to starting a business removed, the tax system overhauled, city

                                                                                                 59
planning improved and informal sector activities considered important to the country’s overall
growth. Without accompanying policy reforms, the effects of the new investments in public
infrastructure will be limited and powerful elites will capture most of the rents.

132.     PPPs would be an appropriate financing investment for infrastructure, yet policy
reforms are necessary to attract the private sector and ensure a sufficient return. The right
policy environment will free public resources, as certain investment projects become privately
financed. Energy is a case in point. As long as energy tariffs are insufficient to recover cost, private
investments are unlikely and the authorities will need to allocate scare investment resources in
sectors that could otherwise benefit from private capital flows. With the right policy environment,
private investors can be expected to be ready to invest in energy generation in the form of PPPs or
otherwise. A comprehensive strategy to crowd-in international and domestic private investors for
the financing of infrastructure PPP projects and SMEs could include the development and
implementation of a Strategic Investment Fund (SIF).

133. A better developed financial sector is equally critical for the development of a range
of financial services available in other low and middle income economies such as ATMs,
mobile banking, e-wallets, and microenterprise loans that have not yet been fully developed.
The absence of these services has direct implications for the ability of poor households to generate
an income. Absence of access to credit or crop insurance forces farmers to opt for low risk, low
return crops like sorghum and millet, and limits the use of modern inputs which have to be
purchased using cash. Following a shock, people rely on friends and family (44 percent) or own
savings (32 percent) for emergency funds. Assets lost can only be rebuilt through a process of
savings and self-accumulation as credit opportunities are largely unavailable. In the absence of a
warehouse receipt system, poor farmers are often forced to sell at low prices to repay debts. The
absence of leasing services for basic equipment other than vehicles and heavy machinery, hinders
access to services such as plowing.

134. The opportunity cost of these missing financial services is significant.80 The
availability of mobile financial services has been transformative in reducing levels of the unbanked
funds across Africa, but has not yet reached Cameroon. For SMEs and rural non-farm businesses,
financial products such as factoring, leasing, and warehouse receipts could mean increased
productivity and competitiveness, particularly in manufacturing and agriculture sectors. Factoring
plays an important role for SMEs and new firms in emerging markets that have difficulty accessing
bank financing.81 Similarly, for farmers and rural businesses, warehouse receipt systems can foster
higher productivity, higher producer prices, greater access to financial services, and better quality
crops. 82 For example, following the introduction of a warehouse receipt system in Tanzania for
cashew nuts, farmers doubled both prices and output over a two year period.

   A warehouse receipts system can allow rural farmers to delay sales of recently-harvested crops by providing them
with credit, storage space and market information until the market has stabilized and prices have increased.

135. Food and animal products present a potential growth sector in the short run.
Cameroon has already shown promise with the export of cereals, bananas, livestock, coffee, cocoa,
and cotton, and the markets for these products are far from saturated. An existing food grain deficit
(Table 4.3 - about a quarter of Cameroon’s food needs are imported), rapid urbanization and an
emerging middle class ensure a good domestic and regional market. This is particularly true for
products with a high income elasticity like meat, rice and milk. Logistics to serve the regional
market, mining83 and sustainable forest products present other growth opportunities.

Box 4.1: Increasing economic complexity by participating in global value chains
 The proven potential of raw materials (mines, timber, agricultural products) and production factors (electricity,
 arable land) have shaped Cameroon’s participation and positioning in global value chains. The raw material-
 producing sectors (timber, agriculture and mining) and high voltage electricity-consuming sectors (basic metals
 and cement) are most involved in global value chains. Various services sectors are also integrated into global chains:
 ship repair and maintenance, information technology and transport.

 Cameroon’s participation is limited mainly to activities at the ends of the chains in lower value sectors and little
 benefit for the rest of the economy. At the top of the chains, Cameroonian businesses simply supply raw materials,
 or at best supply products that have been through primary processing. At the bottom, Cameroonian firms act as
 intermediaries for foreign industries, providing, for instance, packaging, assembly and distribution to the local
 market or the Central African region. In some industries, however, the Government has adopted measures to
 encourage increased local processing of raw materials. This timber industry has moved towards primary and
 secondary processing. Moreover, strong demand from CEMAC and ECOWAS countries is attracting more and
 more agro-industries (processing of palm oil, cocoa, etc.). Sluggish global demand for some raw materials has
 forced manufacturers to look towards domestic and sub-regional markets. These changes should gradually lead to
 a shift away from commodity exports and towards the production of finished goods. Capacity-building in ship
 repairs has, for example, enabled Cameroon to participate fully in this global value chain, at least within the Gulf
 of Guinea region. Sectors that have increased their participation in global value chains have contributed to economic
 growth, created jobs, developed capacities and improved infrastructure.

 However, Cameroon’s position in the value chains (at the extremes of the chains) exposes it to fluctuations in
 commodity prices and global economic cycles. The recent global financial crisis highlighted this vulnerability,
 especially among export-oriented industries. These industries have a large number of small operators that are often
 poorly equipped and largely disorganized. Their integration into clusters will allow them to regroup and upgrade
 more effectively.

 Analysis of geographical distribution identifies opportunities for participation in global value chains in the north of
 the country, thanks to the concentration of livestock farming and cotton cultivation. SODECOTON produces cotton
 fibers and refined cottonseed oil. The enhancement of livestock farming, meat products and leather is held back by
 a lack of coordinated action. The southern part of the country enjoys a tropical climate, making it ideal for
 developing agricultural industries (cocoa, palm oil, natural rubber, cassava, fruit and vegetables, etc.). On the coast,
 the potential development of hydroelectricity and gas-based thermal electricity and access to the sea offer
 Cameroon opportunities to participate in global value chains (ship repairs, shipping, light metals, etc.). Furthermore,
 Cameroon’s strategic position as a country of transit towards several countries in the sub-region provides
 opportunities to develop global value chains at the borders with neighboring countries.

136. In the longer run the economy will need to move to greater economic complexity. By
gradually expanding the complexity of products that are produced, and by improving human

83
  For lack of private investment, there has been little or no exploitation of most of Cameroon’s the natural resources,
apart from oil and timber. Yet the mineral wealth includes deposits of oil, natural gas, gold, iron, manganese and
uranium.

capital in general, productive knowledge is expanded and the foundation for economic
transformation is laid. Cameroon should preserve its stable macro-economic environment and
capitalize on its developed human capital, capable bureaucracy, coastal location, and availability
of natural resources. Doing so successfully will require addressing the constraints that also hold
back the domestic market development: costly transport, a poorly functioning port, inadequate
energy supply and pricey telecommunications.

      5.        GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT

The political settlement offers unity and stability in exchange for access to rents. The consequence
is an ineffective public sector that adheres to a personalized, clientelist model of state-led growth
characterized by high levels of corruption and fragmentation. Such a public sector is unable to
realize opportunities for growth, poverty reduction and adequate service delivery. Opportunities
for change exist but may be hard to realize as vested interests defend their benefits. Openings for
change are likely to arrive opportunistically or as a result of stresses on the regime. Debt distress
could, for example, be a catalyst to enhance the efficiency of public spending, and fragility in the
north could spur improved public service provision.

5.1        Governance

137. Cameroon ranks poorly on most governance indicators (Figure 5.1). The country rates
amongst the bottom 25th percentile for all governance indicators tracked by Kaufman and Kraay
over the last ten years, and ranks 144th out of 177 countries on the 2013 Transparency International
Corruption Perceptions Index. Corruption is pervasive - 62 percent of respondents declared having
paid a bribe over the past 12 months.84 Moreover, scores on the CPIA sub-categories
"transparency, accountability, and corruption in the public sector" and "property rights and rule-
based governance" were both 2.5, compared to an average of 2.9 among IDA borrowers. The 2016
Doing Business report, ranked Cameroon 172th out of 189 economies.

138. Poor governance outcomes can be traced to the political settlement. Colonialism did
not foster the emergence of a large national capitalist middle-class. It did, however, establish a
state-wide bureaucracy, paving the way for a clientelist political system with dominant leaders,
who successfully centralized power. These elites, following a low intensity civil war in the late
1950s, and a failed coup in 1984, gained legitimacy by offering unity and stability in exchange for
an environment in which political, justice85 and economic relations are personalized, as opposed
to institutionalized and anonymous. In this environment, elite members benefit from rents earned
through the misappropriation of revenues, such as oil and tax revenues, from favorable treatments,
for example jobs or tax exemptions, or from exclusive arrangements, such as monopolies or import
licenses. This weights down the economy and comes at the expense of service delivery.

139. Cameroon, thus, fits the description of a limited access order.86 Limited access orders
can be described as political settlements in which a relatively small elite of politicians,
businessmen and those in charge of the institutions exercising legitimate state violence (police,
military) provide stability to a country in return for access to rents. The outcome is a situation with
high levels of corruption, occasional state repression against citizens claiming their rights, and
stunted growth. However, this outcome is generally more acceptable to the population than a state
of generalized violence, which would be the alternative. It illuminates the regular public references

civil service appointments is largely a function of regime loyalty. A plethora of public institutions
and “best practices” laws related to audits, decentralization, or mining provide the impression of a
functioning administration. The reality is different with form being privileged over function. As a
consequence, the public administration is inefficient. Public services are poorly targeted and of
low quality, hence the large fraction of people opting for privately provided services. The business
environment is skewed towards elite interests and stacked against new entrants, hence the high
degree of informality. There is significant leakage of resources and inertia delays decision-making.

141. Broadly speaking, the public sector plays three roles vis-à-vis the private sector:
regulator, business-promoter and actor. As regulator, the public sector sanctions anti-
competitive behavior and oversees markets characterized by natural monopolies or other market
failures. As promoter of competition and private sector participation, the public sector ensures that
procedures related to doing business are simple, predictable, accessible and universal. A
government can also intervene in specific markets directly as an economic actor, through state-
owned enterprises or via participation in firms; or indirectly through measures affecting market
functioning, like price setting, import quotas, licensing, etc. There is a lot of potential for the state
to improve its performance in each of these three roles.

142. Inefficient regulator: the judicial system needs to improve is reliability and speed.
While laws have been adopted to protect investors and contractual rights, courts often fail to follow
the law and create the impression of acting corruptly. The judiciary lacks independence as all

                                                                               66
magistrates and judges are appointed by the President. The legal system is painstakingly slow in
adjudicating matters. Hearings can be delayed multiple times due to the failure of one party to
appear. The court often takes no action to end disputes, stretching them out for years. Plaintiffs
can use delay tactics as a method of harassment and can cause their opponent to incur significant
legal fees by delaying the hearings dozens of times. A common tactic involves bringing frivolous
criminal charges against an opponent in a commercial dispute. Judges can be swayed by bribes or
by political clout. The enforcement of judicial decisions is slow and fraught with administrative
and legal bottlenecks.87 Unsurprisingly, one out of three managers believes that the functioning of
the legal system is a major obstacle to business, nearly three times the complaint rate of the rest of
Sub-Saharan Africa (Doing Business 2015).

Box 5.1: Products subject to price and import controls.88
 Price controls
  Food products: sugar, milk, crude palm oil, imported frozen fish, wheat flour, maize flour, imported rice, table
     salt, edible oils;
  Building materials: imported portland cement, and iron bars;
  Other products: domestic, industrial or medical gas, medicines and hospital supplies, books and textbooks;
  Services: water, electricity, ancillary maritime transport services, services provided by Ports Autonomes du
     Cameroon, public passenger transport (road and rail); and services offered by hotels and tourist facilities, social
     housing, school and university accommodation.

 Import controls
  For palm oil and oil, imports are approved during periods of shortage. To import refined petroleum products a
    "shortage certificate" drawn up by the fuel price stabilization fund has to be obtained.
  In the case of sugar, rice and cement importers have to obtain import licenses. Discretion in granting the
    licenses can also limit the number of importers and import volumes.
  Sugar imports are subject to valuation determined at the administrative level (CFAF 458,000/ton in 2012),
    which in combination with customs duty of 30 percent, may reduce the competitiveness of imports.
  Some companies have access to reduced import tariffs in case of a shortage in the market determined by the
    Ministry of Trade. In the case of sugar SOSUCAM and other companies in the subsector can import at a 10
    percent tariff instead of the 30 percent CET. Similarly, the Special Program for imports of fast-moving
    consumer goods such as petroleum products, palm oil, sugar, biscuits, beverages or confectionery allows
    operators in sector to import goods at a lower tariff if there is a "shortage".
  In some cases imports are completely banned. For instance, since 2006, the import of frozen chicken has been
    banned by MINEPIA. Currently the Government is evaluating the establishment of an import ban on cement
    to protect the domestic industry.

143. Promotor of competition: the legal environment relevant to foreign investment needs
to be made transparent. In 2002, with the intention to attract investors, the investment code of
1990 was replaced with the Investment Chapter of 19 April of 2002, permitting 100 percent foreign
equity ownership. In practice, the Investment Chapter has not been fully implemented. Decree No
2009/001 of May 2009 postponed the deadline for implementation, setting the new date for 2014.
In 2013, in order to promote and attract productive investment, the Investment Code was
supplemented by Law No 2013/004. This created confusion regarding which law prevails. In
certain sectors, restrictions on foreign ownership still apply, including: mining (95 percent of

foreign ownership is allowed), power transmission and distribution (foreign ownership is not
allowed), railway freight, domestic air, international air, airport and port operations (49 percent of
foreign ownership is allowed), television broadcasting and newspapers (49 percent of foreign
ownership is allowed). Meanwhile, the Investment Code of 1990 establishes a requirement of, at
least, 35 percent Cameroonian equity ownership for enterprises under the small and medium
enterprise regime. This kind of confusion is illustrative for the policy environment and explains
the limited readiness of foreign direct investors to enter the market.

144. Economic actor: market interventions through price controls. In response to a hike in
international food prices, the authorities reinstituted, in 2008, a price control policy initially
enacted in 1972 to reduce inflation. In addition, import bans were set to shield local producers
from increasing imports of certain products, such as frozen chicken, sugar and cement. In other
cases, imports are subject to licenses that are only issued when the Government determines that
there is a shortage in the market. These controls suppress market forces and distort an efficient
allocation of resources.

145. There is no clarity on the way price controls are applied. There is no publicly available
list of maximum prices. There are some services whose tariffs have never been approved by the
Ministry of Commerce, mainly due to the existence of sector agencies in charge of regulating
electricity, ports, and hospitality services. For goods for which a maximum price has been set (for
instance in sugar and cement), no specific methodology for calculating the price is published. The
maximum price has resulted from discussions between the Ministry and firms operating in the
sector. In some cases, firms were granted import permits under the condition that they respect an
agreed maximum price. The Ministry of Commerce (which sets the maximum prices) is also in
charge of ensuring compliance. Penalties can be up to 50 percent of the realized profit or 5 percent
of the sales of the merchandise. In periods with no inflationary pressures, controls are non-binding
but still present a business risk and an administrative regulatory burden, especially for
supermarkets that are usually the target of inspectors.

146. While the previous examples illustrate the distortionary and costly impact of the
political settlement on the economy, some improvements have been achieved. The
Government introduced, in 2014, tax-related reforms that improved the total tax rate and simplified
and accelerated payments. Still, as a rule of thumb, policies are frequently inconsistent, not
approved, or when approved not implemented or when implemented not properly executed.

Box 5.2: Patronage and public enterprises and entities
 Public enterprises and establishments offer opportunities for patronage. There are 120 such entities in Cameroon89
 putting the country in the same league with China in terms of state involvement in the economy First there are the
 opportunities to allocate favors by appointing staff. The President appoints, for instance, the managing directors of
 the largest SOEs on the recommendation of the responsible line ministries. In a sample of 33 board chairmen, 66
 percent were found to combine this function with a Government function, despite this being against the law; 70
 percent are or were members of the Central Committee of the ruling Party. Patronage extends beyond board
 members. For example, Camair Co, the public airline company employs about 800 staff for a fleet of three aircraft,
 whereas 70 staff per aircraft is the norm. In addition, each state-owned enterprise has a board that tends to be very
 well remunerated.

 These patronage opportunities are an important reason for the continued and active involvement of the public sector
 in the economy, despite the fact that the combined losses generated by the sector amounted to more than US$100
 million in 2013, and irrespective of the fact that these enterprises carry a level of debt equivalent to 17 percent of
 GDP. Below, for instance the remuneration of the board of the Société Immobilière du Cameroun (SIC), a real
 estate company that lost US$6 million in 2013.

5.3     A fragmented and inert bureaucracy

147. The political settlement has led to bureaucratic inertia. The Government often fails to
come to a decision, to stick to its stated policy course or to implement agreed policy decisions. For
example, it took 17 years to operationalize the Senate. It was created through an amendment to the
constitution in 1996. However, the power to convene the Electoral College and call elections
remained with the President, who signed the necessary decree to do so only in 2013. On the other
hand some decisions are made swiftly. When a group of soldiers protested in September 2015 the
non-payment of their allowances for peace-keeping work done under UN auspices, the issue was
resolved within 24 hours. Three reasons for the inertia can be identified: institutional
fragmentation; patronage and a low wage policy.90

148. The administration is unusually fragmented. The bureaucracy is characterized by a large
number of line ministries, a large number of cross-sectoral committees and a “shadow cabinet” of

89
   i.e. 19 Mixt Economy Enterprises; 21 Public Capital Enterprises; 80 Public Administration Establishments; seven
Special Public Administration Establishments; approximately 30 companies in which the state has minority interests
and which does not fall into any of the above categories.

ministerial rank within the Office of the President. One consequence is a plethora of Members of
Government: 70 for 36 line ministries. Institutional fragmentation and overlapping responsibilities
lead to conflicting decisions, lack of accountability, policy indiscipline and poor cohesiveness. The
fragmentation hinders steadfast, consistent and effective actions. It also constitute a major obstacle
to cross-supporting or integrated actions, especially in the area of structural reforms and service
delivery.91

149. A patronage-based promotion/demotion system contributes to low civil servant
morale and ineffectiveness. Initial personnel decisions are usually merit-based, as most civil
servants enter after passing the civil service entry exam, yet favoritism and political patronage in
appointments and promotions/demotions are widespread. The regional balance remains important,
whether in civil service recruitment or Government reshuffles (‘un frère remplace un frère’).
Given the general lack of accountable and transparent performance standards and processes,
patron-client relationships and personal and factional loyalties permeate the system. In this
climate, decision-makers tend to become excessively timid, risk-averse and ultimately self-
serving. The outcome is administrative bottlenecks, mismanagement and very slow decision
making.

150. A policy of low wages, disconnected from productivity and responsibilities
undermines the emergence of a stable technocracy within the administration. Low wage
levels and a reliance on contract workers reduces incentives for service delivery. Following the
economic downturn and devaluation of the early 1990s, civil servant wages were reduced by more
than half in real terms, a decline from which they have not recovered. Moreover, in the wake of
structural adjustment, many new civil servants, who constitute a third of the work force, often
those employed as teachers, have been hired as contract staff, while existing civil servants have
been promoted. This has led to a situation in which the number of managerial positions (Grade A)
is almost as high as that in technical positons (Grades B and C). Hence, low wages, an inverted
salary structure and the high reliance on poorly paid contract workers without clear career
prospects, explain low morale and widespread corruption. This is reflected in accounting
irregularities and reduced productivity within the administration. For example, many government
employees see no fault in insider-trading, “selling” influence, and profiteering from public work
contracts. Ultimately, these problems translate into the misappropriation of public funds and the
ineffective execution of key programs.

151. Performance incentives are distorted by a widespread reliance on allowances to top
up wages. The authorities have attempted to respond to the challenge of low wages by creating
special assignment committees, which generate significant salary top-ups for their participants
(Figure 5.3). This has had the unintended consequence of exacerbating the proliferation of
committees. The practice has distorted work incentives within the administration, unduly bloated
the institutions of public administrations, and worsened the problem of overlapping of mandates.
It also compounded the problems of patronage.




91
  The institutionalized fragmentation may well be intended as it does enable power-sharing between competing elites,
under the arbitrage of the Presidency.

152. Frustration about the absence of meritocratic human resources management and the
inadequacy of incentives facing civil servants emerged from a perception survey. The survey,
administered in January 2015, with 245 respondents, was randomly distributed amongst civil
servants in different grades and categories, and across the administration. It found that 90 percent
of respondents felt that the base salary is very low (all respondents requested to reevaluate the
salary scale) and 80 percent felt that the criteria for promotion were unclear. Eighty percent of
respondents are aware of the indemnities and benefits which they may be entitled to, yet 20 percent
are not aware of the allocation criteria. Ninety percent indicated not to benefit from fuel allocations
and 99 percent are unaware of the criteria used for their allocation. The survey found a latent desire
for professional growth and a greater attention to performance; 43 percent of respondents hope to
get professional training and 28 percent support the introduction of merit-based and performance-
based evaluations and promotions.

5.4         Public financial management

153. Major deficiencies exist in public finance management. Public expenditure tracking
surveys consistently showed leakages in the 2009 transfers from central level to frontline provider,
in education and health. The 2007 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) report,
the only one to date for Cameroon, shows that deficiencies are substantial. A D-score was
attributed to 12 out of the 28 categories, a C-score to nine, a B-score to five and only two
categories, namely budget classification and transparency of taxpayer obligations and liabilities,
received A-scores.

154. Some technical improvements have been made, however. Cameroon passed a PFM Act
in 2007 to transition from the traditional, input-based line item budget to a multi-year program-
based budget. Starting in 2013, the budget has been approved on a programmatic basis. Progress
has also been made in the reliability of the accounts, as evidenced by: (i) the production of a full
set of financial statements, including a balance sheet, profit and loss statements, and cash flow




                                                                     71
statements, for the first time ever in FY 2012,92 and (ii) the elaboration of a new chart of accounts,
including accounting instructions.

155. The intended benefits of the reforms have yet to materialize. Despite the move to
program budgeting, traditional annual line item budgeting persists in budget execution, due to
weaknesses in the upgrade of the newly developed budgeting system (PROBMIS). Moreover,
program performance indicators continue to be essentially activity and output-based, with no real
foray into outcomes. As a consequence, the benefits and flexibility of multi-year program-
budgeting are not leveraged. Improvements in the reliability of accounts are limited by non-
compliance with standard budget procedures and the statutory grace period, which is designed to
allow for a timely closing of accounting records (journées complémentaires). This translates into
a significant use of suspense accounts (about 23 percent of transactions in the 2012 and 2013
budget transited through suspense accounts) and the poor comprehensiveness of in-year
accounting reports.93

156. Procurement processes are also problematic. Procurement data from 2007 demonstrated
how 10 companies won 51 public bids, representing 56 percent of the total contract value going
through the public procurement process. An important share of the contracts was awarded through
non-competitive bidding: sole sourcing represented 24.7 percent of the total amount of the contract
value.94 To address weak performance in the areas of budget execution, service delivery, value
added by public spending, and widespread corruption in the line ministries, public procurement
was assigned to a dedicated new Public Procurement Ministry. The reform has left the Ministry of
Public Works (MINTP) responsible for management of most public procurement processes for
high value contracts, and with a key role in monitoring of execution and payment. Yet, the legal
and institutional framework remains inconsistent and fragmented and capacity is not aligned. This
has led to institutional confusion, overlapping mandates, increased inefficiency and delays in the
procurement system, affecting the budget execution rate for capital expenditure.

157. The core problems identified in the 2007 PEFA remain unsolved. The execution of line
ministries’ capital budget remains low (Figure 5.4), with (i) an absence of coherence between
procurement plans and commitment plans, and delays in their availability; (ii) duplication of
controls in the expenditure chain between financial controllers and accountants, which creates
delays in the processing of vouchers with no commensurate improvement in the compliance with
rules and regulations; (iii) in-year cash rationing which affects budget execution and results in an
increased use of exceptional budget execution procedures (mises à disposition, dépenses non
ordonnancées) towards the end of the fiscal year.

158. PFM problems extend to the revenue side. Revenue collection by the Customs
Administration and Taxation Directorate has improved, but without concomitant improvements in
tax payer’s experience or dwelling times at the port. To reverse a downward trend of domestic

   Budget preparation procedures are not always respected either. The 2015 program budget was overhauled at the
very last moment to accommodate the President’s Emergency Plan for the North. At the start of the 2016 Parliamentary
Budget Session, the draft budget had not yet been submitted to Parliament, undermining its ability to scrutinize what
it had received for approval.

revenue mobilization,95 both entities developed strategies and associated action plans. As a
consequence, interactions with users reduced the time of customs clearance and improved customs
revenue (Figure 5.4). However, tax collection remains one of the worst scoring aspects in the
Doing Business indicators. Any positive impact from more efficient customs on the dwelling time
in the port of Douala was undone by increased inefficiencies elsewhere. All in all, the main impact
of the customs reform has been an increase in transparency, demonstrating clearly how much
revenue is foregone by offering tax exemptions.

159. Audit committees lack independence and reach. Cameroon has two supreme audit
institutions. Of these, the Audit Chamber has relatively stronger independence from the executive,
but its mandate is limited to the judgment of accounts and does not include the actual performance
of public spending. The Ministry of State Oversight (CONSUPE) has a broader mandate but
reports to the Presidency, which limits its independence. As a consequence, most of its audit
reports are not publicly available, or followed up in terms of sanctions. In addition to these
weaknesses, the reach of both institutions remains limited: less than 50 percent of the state-owned
enterprises are audited every year.

5.5                   Conflict and (in)stability

160. Borderland areas in the north and east, already poor and fragile, are particularly
affected by insecurity in neighboring countries. With almost 300,000 refugees from Nigeria and
CAR, these conflicts have a significant impact on these already impoverished regions, particularly
in terms of service provision, social stability and access to livelihoods. The social and economic
consequences of insecurity caused by Boko Haram in the Far North region are also far-reaching.
Already this was the region with the highest incidence of poverty in the country, subject to greatest
climatic variability and the most adverse weather. The economic impact is serious. Trade between

localities in the North and with Nigeria, one of the most important markets for products from the
Far North, has virtually come to a standstill leading to a sharp economic downturn. This is
aggravated by the disruption of public investments and donor activities as the security situation is
too dangerous to operate in. Businesses in tourism and construction in the Northern regions are
affected directly by the conflict.

161. The insecurity caused by Boko Haram has a destabilizing potential. Boko Haram was
founded in 2002 by a charismatic religious leader, Mohammed Yusuf, to oppose the Nigerian
secular education and legal system, which according to him was leading Muslims away from the
true faith and a pious way of life. This is reflected in the name that the group chose for itself, which
in Hausa means “Western Education is a sin”. Initially, Boko Haram was a non-violent movement,
which held on to a puritanical view of Islam, propagated the introduction of the Sharia legal code
and demonstrated a strong disdain for western institutions which were perceived to support the
inequitable political and economic system. Boko Haram members saw themselves at odds with the
secular authorities, whom they came to view as representatives of a corrupt, illegitimate, Christian-
dominated federal government. Their peaceful approach changed in 2010, after Nigerian security
forces killed Yusuf, and violence escalated exponentially. Boko Haram is active in isolated areas,
with particularly weak state presence, creating a serious challenge for Cameroon’s security system.
96
   Because of its violent and indiscriminate attacks and the important displacement they generate,
Boko Haram has deep impacts on the social fabric and the overall development outcomes of the
affected communities. This situation poses a significant risk of deepening existing divisions
between the North and South, Christians and Muslims and the center and periphery. High levels
of poverty and unemployment, low levels of education, low productivity and lack of economic
opportunities particularly for the youth, characteristic of the Far North, provide a breeding ground
for recruitment and mobilization of youth by violent organizations. While the bulk of the group’s
activity takes place in Nigeria, there are major spillovers in Cameroon. Moreover, Boko Haram
may not have started in Cameroon, now that it has spilled over into the country and a situation of
widespread violence has emerged, it creates its own self-sustaining vicious cycle of violence and
deprivation, with deprivation in turn offering a base for the recruitment of new fighters.

162. In Cameroon, Boko Haram has been perpetrated violent incursions all along the
Nigerian border, in the Far North region, including its capital, Maroua.97 According to a July
2014 announcement by Cameroon’s Ministry of Defense, Boko Haram, has 15,000-20,000,
members but journalistic sources claim that this figure could be as high as 50,000. 98As a result of
the escalation, the Cameroonian Government has stepped up the efforts against Boko Haram and

   According to the International Crisis Group report, in the end of 2013 Boko Haram has sent extortion letters to the
authorities of Mayo-Sava, the administrative department where Kolofata is situated, demanding that the Far North
authorities impose Sharia law and cease all collaboration with the West.

163. Boko Haram tests the stability and unity of the state. Boko Haram activity has brought
attention to the disenfranchisement of the population living in the north, to the sub-standard levels
of service delivery and poor governance in general. In the short run the security situation has the
effect of fostering patriotism and mitigating criticism against the authorities. The trend is
confirmed by the improved perception of the Presidency and the Army in Afrobarometer since the
violence broke out. But as the conflict lasts (or spreads), or as more resources are allocated to the

north this improved perception may not last and could even become another reason for popular
discontent.

164. Internal stresses also affect stability. Historic grievances rooted in real or perceived
identity-based injustices continue to simmer (e.g. Anglophones, Bamilekes, Northerners). Land
related conflicts, such as pastorals versus farmers, large scale agriculture versus communities, or
displaced and refugees versus indigenous population, could intensify. Also, generational (youth
‘cadets sociaux’ versus seniors) or religious issues (Muslims versus Christians; orthodox versus
liberal) issues could ignite. This multiplicity of grievances could be harnessed by political
entrepreneurs and used either narrowly, leading to society’s fragmentation, or nationally by
transcending ethno-regional identities. This is not just a theoretical scenario. In 2008, the rapid rise
of food prices combined with a politically tense context following the elimination of the
Presidential two-term limit. Violent protests emerged in Douala, Yaoundé and other urban centers.
A scenario of unrest becomes increasingly plausible as the spoils of growth are unequally
distributed. The urban educated middle class have higher expectations for service delivery. Youth
have expectations for jobs and political inclusion, are progressively less influenced by traditional
authority, and have lower opportunity costs to violence. All these pose risks to stability and the
prevailing political settlement.101

165. Fragility is reinforced by the weak social contract between citizens and the state. Even
though civil liberties are ensured since 1991, the right to demonstrate is shrinking and access to
information necessary to hold politicians and policymakers accountable is, de facto, not provided,
leading to little functional oversight of the Government. Grievance redress mechanisms and
dialogue are weak,102 while organized collective action questioning the performance of the state is
suppressed. The absence of space for a constructive political contestation or for the venting of
social frustration lead to a disengagement of citizens, particularly as the perception takes root that
wealth depends on luck and political connections and is no longer associated with talent and hard
work. The social contract between citizens and the State is very weak. The State does not deliver
services, nor does it rely on broad-based taxation. It relies mostly on a few large formal firms for
tax revenue, as well as import/export taxes mostly from timber and the oil sector. Consequently,
the state apparatus does not need to be highly responsive to citizens’ needs and a virtuous circle of
state-building is not triggered.

166. The institutions that support the stability of the nation are highly personalized,
fragmented and dependent on the President. This limits their capacity to respond and to
accommodate demands of enhanced inclusiveness and efficiency of the political system.103
Cameroon is thus experiencing an increasing tension between a society that longs for change, and
a system that cannot accommodate this desire without perturbing the delicate equilibrium upon
which the unity of the nation rests. The taboo of political transition – even though inevitable –
adds a layer of risk, given the President’s age and the electoral calendar. Already, the pending
uncertainty erodes trust between different elite factions needed to negotiate and secure the overall

101
    Afrobarometer data demonstrate that overall perceptions of the Government are low (at the exception of the
Presidency and the Army). Specifically urban populations tend to have lower perceptions of the system compared to
rural populations, despite urban lower poverty and higher access to services.

happen, internal and external stresses could undermine the existing equilibrium and throw the
country into chaos.

5.6      Opportunities and constraints to improving governance

167. Generally speaking, the scope for governance improvements in a limited access order
is limited. A mistake that is often made is to introduce institutions from open access orders
(typically the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development -OECD- countries) into
limited access orders (typically developing countries). As a consequence, anti-corruption agencies,
business environment initiatives and even democracy are introduced, but often with disappointing
results. This is unsurprising, as it is not clear why the ruling elite would allow its power to be
undermined.104 Institutions only assimilate their OECD counterparts in form and not in function
(isomorphic mimicry, as coined by Lant Pritchett).

168. There are many areas where reform could improve performance significantly, but
which are nonetheless unlikely to succeed. For example as a market regulator the Commission
Nationale de la Concurrence (CNC) controls and sanctions anti-competitive behavior by state
enterprises. The legislation guiding CNC is in accordance with best practices, but its actions have
little impact because CNC faces serious human and financial resource constraints. Other regulators
dealing with sectors with natural monopolies – such as telecom, rail, energy, air, and port – also
perform poorly, as funding is inadequate and their independence and neutrality are not guaranteed.
While the importance of regulatory agencies is undisputed, addressing these shortcomings is
extremely difficult, because doing so would negative affect core elite interests.

169. What holds for the regulators also holds for changes in the business environment:
reforms are critical but unlikely to materialize. The authorities have passed legislation for a
number of reforms to improve the ease of doing of business, but implementation has been partial,
slow and largely unmonitored. As reform has been slow, the business environment worsened and
Cameroon dropped even further on the Doing Business Index between 2014 and 2015. Many state-
owned companies generate negative value added (i.e. Cameroon would be better off if these
companies did not produce anything) and absorb large state subsidies. Nonetheless, there is no
strategic vision regarding the costs and benefits of direct State participation in the economy and
regarding ways of handling companies that impoverish the nation. Similarly, the costs and benefits
of direct interventions in markets are not systematically assessed.

170. This does not mean nothing can be achieved. Long-awaited large infrastructure projects
are now well advanced (Lom Pangar dam, Kribi power station, Kribi deep sea port, Douala-
N’djamena-Bangui corridors, Wouri Bridge, etc.) and a second generation of Grandes Réalisations
is under preparation. The execution of these first and second generation transformational
infrastructure projects, is one of the highest priorities of the Presidency. The new PFM Act and the
2012 procurement system reforms have laid the ground for structural change, related to public
finance and human resource management. Lastly, the ongoing deployment of an integrated

   In a limited access order, elections are rarely free and fair and anti-corruption agencies typically become places of
corruption themselves, as well as vehicles to deal with political enemies (viz. operation “Epervier”).

HR/Payroll system (SIGIPES II) is expected to create more transparency in the personnel file, and
control over the wage bill.

171. Fear of instability and a constricted fiscal space may provide incentives for reform.
High levels of violence in northern Cameroon put the legitimacy of the state at risk, but also offer
an opportunity to bring to the fore the need for poverty reduction. The reduction in oil revenue and
the rapid deterioration of the country’s debt status may increase the interest to identify alternatives
for revenue generation- including from a vibrant private sector- and create an appetite for reforms
in Public Financial Management. Public Financial Management reforms may also improve the
legitimacy of the state by increasing transparency, accountability, and efficiency.

172. Reforms in the health sector suggest that bottom-up successes can be achieved. The
pilot project of Performance Based Financing (PBF) in the health sector has shifted health
financing from centralized and input-based financing to financing based on performance. As a
consequence, service delivery outcomes have improved significantly. The PBF project provides
performance bonuses, based on the quantity and quality of health services provided. Results are
verified and users’ feedback105 is integrated in the performance assessment, which dictate the
levels of bonuses provided. In addition, through contractual arrangements, health facilities are
granted greater management autonomy in return, i.e. allowing them to make local decisions on
how to use PBF revenue to improve service delivery and motivate their health personnel. Four
years into the project, both the utilization and quality of health services have improved, as has the

173. Cameroon has institutionalized an innovative procedure to allow citizens’ budget
oversight over the capital budget. Since 2006, multi-stakeholders committees exist at the local
level in which citizens (through civil society) and mayors are invited to review quarterly, the
physical and financial execution of the Public Investment Budget. The quality of information, with
regards to physical execution, greatly improved as a result of this, both at local and national level,
enhancing the efficiency of the Control Brigade and reducing the number of ghost projects. It also
contributed to improvements in investment execution. Finally, in districts where Civil Society
Organizations (CSOs) were actively engaged in monitoring, not only the execution rate, but also
the quality of execution improved.

        6. POVERTY REDUCTION OPPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINTS


Achieving the twin goals is feasible with a pro-poor growth strategy. To unlock growth and boost
poverty reduction, three areas of binding constraints will need to be addressed: (i) low rural
productivity; (ii) a non-conducive business environment, and (iii) fragility and poor governance.
Within each of these areas, concrete policy actions have been identified and prioritized.

6.1    Pathways to achieving the twin goals by 2030

174. The typical pattern of growth and poverty reduction starts with growth in the rural
sector.107 In this ‘classical’ transformation process agricultural (and livestock) sector output grows
by expanding the area under cultivation and through productivity gains, powered by the adoption
of new technologies, such as improved varieties and techniques or irrigation. As the share of food
consumers relative to food producers grows through urbanization, markets become more
important, the non-farm and agribusiness sectors grow and the food value chain and rural-urban
linkages are strengthened. As incomes grow, second order effects are likely to emerge. The stock
of human and physical capital increases as households invest part of their increased incomes. This
leads to further productivity gains, and to migration of now better-educated people to urban areas,
which supports the realization of positive agglomeration effects. It also leads to demographic
transition, in part because women marry later.

175. Countries can also leapfrog agricultural development and seek labor intensive
industrialization through import substitution. To do so countries can use protective tariffs,
promote export-oriented industrialization using targeted firm–level subsidies, or embrace open-
economy industrialization inviting foreign direct investments in domestic industry.

176. In the short run opportunities for rapid industrialization are limited. A colonial
history, in which Cameroon was exposed to the worst form of predatory capitalism, and a political
settlement that requires the careful balancing of many interests, have contributed to an
environment in which the state, as opposed to the market is seen as the trusted partner for economic
progress. It has brought peace and stability but at the cost of a distorted business environment with
many exclusive rights (import licenses, monopolies), a direct involvement of the state in many
economic activities, a regulatory environment that is hostile to doing business and high cost of
doing business as a result of poor infrastructure. As a consequence the scope for leapfrogging is
constrained.

177. A low ranking on the economic complexity index also makes the economic
environment less ready for rapid industrialization in the short run. A low ranking on the
economic complexity index108reflects that the economy is mostly capable of producing basic
products. The knowledge needed for rapid export promotion or import substitution is largely
absent and will need to be built over time. The limited size of the economy (reducing scope for
specialization) is another constraint to a poverty reduction strategy rooted in rapid, labor intensive

industrialization. This leaves ‘classical transformation’ as the more viable route to poverty
reduction in the short run. As economic governance improves, export-led rapid industrialization
may become a viable strategy in the medium to long run.

178. The adoption of new technologies and the development of new, irrigated areas are
sources of agricultural growth with immediate positive consequences for poverty reduction.
Different groups of poor people can be expected to benefit from increases in agricultural
productivity. Poor farmers will benefit from higher incomes brought about by productivity gains
while non-farmers in rural areas benefit from spill-over gains. When increased agricultural
productivity leads to increases in food production, lower food prices will benefit the urban poor
and net food buyers in rural areas, often the poorest.. This is not inconsequential. High
transportation costs make food an imperfectly tradeable commodity. An important transmission
mechanism from agricultural productivity to aggregate growth is through the price of food, as it
allows sustaining lower labor costs in the rest of the economy.109

179. Agriculture, livestock management and agro-forestry are not only sectors in which
the majority of the poor are engaged, they are also sectors of competitive advantage. This is
based on three observations. The first is that Cameroon has factor endowments rich in unskilled
and semi-skilled labor and natural resources. Cameroon has a unique bio-diversity and is the
custodian of global public goods such as the rainforest in the Congo Basin. Only 29 percent of
arable land is cultivated, and below 3 percent of irrigable land is irrigated. It thus has a comparative
advantage in primary products, agriculture, environment and mining. The second is that high
indirect costs on doing business are less limiting on agriculture, pastoralism and agro-industry than
they are on more sophisticated manufacturing or high-tech, tradeable services. The third is that
Cameroon does not meet the internal nor regional demand for cereals, meat and animal products
and the agricultural trade balance is negative.

180. The various pathways to poverty reduction in a ‘classical’ economic transformation
are presented in the analytical framework summarized in Figure 6.1. It brings to light the core
pathways to poverty reduction and demonstrates that to reduce poverty, the budget constraint of
poor households needs to be pushed outward, or, while keeping incomes constant, food prices need
to be reduced, as food represents a large fraction of poor households’ consumption. The pathways
to shifting the budget constraint outwards are by increasing the productivity of self-employed
households, by increasing opportunities for wage labor, or through redistribution of income from
the better off to the poor. They are discussed in greater detail below.


                       i. Improving household production

181. Chapter 2 demonstrated that the vast majority of poor households are self-employed,
either in agriculture or in the informal sector, while relatively few people are engaged as wage
laborers. Increasing household income by increasing productivity of these self-employed is one
important pathway to poverty reduction in the short run.

182. Improving the functioning of value chains for staple food crops is particularly
important for poverty reduction. Poor households spend a larger share of their budget on food
than non-poor households do. Moreover households in the two poorest wealth quintiles ‘specialize’
in the cultivation of food crops like maize, millet, sorghum, yams, banana, cassava, and beans.
These crops are also the staple foods for the poorest households, implying that improvements in
production and commercialization for these crops would have the double benefit of increasing
farm incomes and reducing food prices for the urban poor who rely on food purchases. Many rural
poor will benefit from lower food prices as many are net food purchasers. Good results are already
being achieved by linking farmer cooperatives producing millet and sorghum with large industrial
enterprises like Guiness. The value chain for milk similarly offers great opportunities, as does the
value chain for poultry, meat, eggs or chickenfeed.

Box 6.1: Sustainable forest products
 Cameroon is the custodian of considerable global public goods in the form of a rich but disappearing biodiversity.
 The Congo basin rainforest is the second largest after the Amazon. The forest’s significance for biodiversity, the
 environment as well as global world heritage is enormous. The 22 million hectares that constitute the country’s
 tropical forest, are the habitat of over 9,000 plant species, 910 bird species and 320 mammal species. It is also the
 home of indigenous peoples, like the Baka pygmies and other forest communities.

 Since the forest covers around 40 percent of the country’s available land area, sustainable forest management is
 vital. Forest exploitation, some of which is sustainable but a lot of which is predatory, as well as mining, and large
 scale agriculture, all compete in the neighborhoods of protected areas. Providing up to 13,000 formal and perhaps
 150,000 informal jobs, the forest sector is an important employer and the second largest source of export revenue.
 Nonetheless, despite efforts to promote sustainable forest management, 3,300,000 ha of Cameroon’s forests have
 been cleared since 1990, representing an area approximately the size of Belgium. This has an important impact on
 the environment, as deforestation is the second most significant cause of global warming. The loss can also be felt
 at the household level, since the forest directly provides about 8 million rural and poor Cameroonians with
 traditional medicines, important complements to the staple diet, domestic energy, construction materials and a
 source of income.

 Forest exploitation needs to be realized in a more sustainable manner with the aim of capturing as great a share of
 the profit produced by the raw materials as possible. For instance, rough timber constitutes 4.1 percent of
 Cameroon’s exports. Yet, rough timber only fetches US$50 per m3 while sawn timber fetches US$125 per m3,

                                                          82
 indicating lost added value when exporting the rough product. Additionally, the value of timber has dominated
 perceptions of the forest’s value, but this is not fully accurate. The total value of forest products for which trade
 statistics or estimates exist—timber, charcoal, okok leaves (Gnetum spp.), gum arabic, and Prunus africana bark—
 is about US$580 million. Of this, US$120 million is derived from products other than timber. Yet many non-timber
 forest products are not formally traded, and their overall value has not been quantified. The value of domestic
 energy alone is US$130 million, however, and if bush meat, fruit, thatching, and medicinal plants are considered
 along with the value of biodiversity conservation and environmental services, the total value of non-timber forest
 products will well exceed that of traditional products.

 Timber and non-timber forest products, alike, are subject to illegal exploitation, and the consequences can be just
 as socially and environmentally devastating. Facilitating sustainable development of these resources through strong
 land use management and regulation, while also protecting the biodiversity and mitigating the contributions to
 climate change, are a priority for Cameroon, even if the direct or immediately contribution to poverty reduction is
 limited.

183. There is significant potential for the (domestic and regional) markets to absorb
increased food production. Already the demand for food stuffs in Cameroon exceeds supply as
evidenced by the large amount of food that is imported (see chapter 4). Also the high levels of
chronic malnutrition –particularly in the north of the country, point in the direction of an unmet
demand for food. Moreover, there is a large demand for food in the region. Nigeria is a huge market
and rice, maize and onions already find their way to markets in Nigeria, but also in Gabon and the
Democratic Republic of Congo. But even domestically the demand for food will rise rapidly due
to an annual population growth rate of 2.8 percent and increased urbanization. However, the
formation of a middle class will be accompanied by the demand for food products with a high
income elasticity such as rice, milk and milk products, eggs and meat.

184. In some zones, area expansion offers a means to increasing smallholder production.
In the low density areas, in the forest zone with a unimodal rainfall and in the High Guinea
Savanah, there is scope to increase production by bringing virgin land under cultivation110 – arable
lands currently account for only 64 percent of the agricultural lands, which represent only 21
percent of the country area. Doing so would require enhanced mechanization because low
population density is associated with labor constraints. It would also require better land use
planning as currently rights given to mining, agriculture, grazing or forestry create overlapping
claims resulting in conflicts.

185. The presence of significant yield gaps for the most popular crops suggests scope for
productivity increases. Assessing actual crop yields against maximum attainable levels offers
important insights into the performance of agriculture and the potential for yield growth and
expected productivity gains from agricultural investments and policies, including land and water
resources management. The yield gap for Cameroon is substantial.111 The largest differences are
for sweet potato, rice and cassava, with yield gaps of 78, 75 and 73 percent. Sorghum, maize and
potatoes also have sizeable yield gaps of respectively 63, 67 and 64 percent.

    From an environmental sustainability perspective, this is not a very attractive option and where feasible preference
should be given to increasing productivity and improving degraded land.

186. A multitude of factors constrain yields. Declining soil fertility, climate change, limited
and inadequate use of fertilizer, limited adoption of high yielding varieties and the lack of
application of improved farming techniques are among the core reasons for constrained yields.
Techniques and approaches to address these constraints exist.112 Cameroon is blessed with a
multitude of high quality agricultural research institutions. Unfortunately, the adoption of
improved practices remains limited, as evidenced by the size of the yield gaps.

187. Solutions to address these constraints vary by location. Agriculture is location specific
and what constrains production in one area, does not necessarily constrain it in another. What
works in one location, does not necessarily work somewhere else because micro-climates are
different, cultural habits, gender roles and tastes vary or because the availability of inputs differs.
Yields can be substantially improved if interventions are provided in carefully designed packages
that address constraints for particular crops under specific local or regional conditions. Experiential
approaches to learning have proved to be effective at successfully introducing new techniques, but
they require significant upfront investments in training ‘master’ farmers, who demonstrate new
techniques to their peers. They also require adaptability, since what is offered, in terms of
improvements, varies between locations.

188. One factor specific to the Sudano-Sahelian and to the High Guinea Savanah (where
the majority of the poor live) is that the growing season under rain-fed farming is short
(Figure 6.3). Improved water storage, water harvesting, and irrigation are critical to
improving farm production. Improved water management reduces dependence on rains,
enhances the ability to withstand climatic shocks and is commensurate with a strategy whereby
the production of staples is promoted in rain-fed systems and production of high value cereals (e.g.
rice), horticultural cops, and industrial crops in irrigated systems.113 Other strategies well suited
for this zone include improved animal husbandry (pastoralism but also small ruminants and poultry
owned frequently by the poor) and an improved integration of animal husbandry and crop farming,

opportunities for animal feeding and fertilizing the soil.

189. Poor market access affects agricultural production but more roads are not always the
most efficient solution. In the absence of access to the market, to buy inputs or to sell one’s
surplus, opportunities for production increases are limited. Improved market access requires
infrastructure, but this alone is insufficient. This is because farmers who produce limited surpluses
do not generate a large demand for transport services and infrastructure to be connected to markets.
Improving the road would reduce transport cost a bit, but probably not enough to attract additional
traders. Instead, better market integration of rural households depends on a differentiated mix
between investments in infrastructure, aggregation at the village level (through collaboration
between farmers), improved access to (price) information, storage and support for trading services
with quality standards and traceability.114 Improved access to credit to allow small traders and
farmers (or farmers’ associations) to purchase motorcycles or tricycle are another way to improve
access in rural areas.

Box 6. 2: Improving smallholder production
 Considerable differences in yield output exist among individual small holder farmers. A paper prepared by Yengoh
 (2012) investigates what might explain these differences. Data were gathered on various aspects of farmers’
 agricultural activities: use of inorganic fertilizers, animal droppings, compost, improved seeds and their associated
 problems and challenges; the role of factors such as gender, age and education in the choices of crops cultivated,
 sizes of farms, access to farm inputs, overall farm management and yields; factors affecting farm management
 practices such as intercropping, farm residue management, farm clearing and choices of crops cultivated; and the
 yield of maize (in tons per hectare) for individual farmers. The influence of biophysical factors was controlled by
 sampling farmers within the same environment.

 The analysis distinguishes three clusters of factors with which food crop yield differences can be associated: the
 input, management and socio-cultural clusters. In the input cluster, the use of basic inputs such as animal droppings
 and improved seeds do significantly improve yields. However, there are constraints at farm and household levels
 that may have to be overcome to optimize the availability and use of these inputs. In the farm management cluster,

                                                         85
 the method of residue management and the control of pests and crop diseases are important in determining yield
 differences. Issues of gender rights and access to agricultural production resources dominate socio-cultural clusters.

 The main conclusion from the paper is that small investments that are properly targeted to improve basic techniques
 of farming can make an appreciable difference in food crop yields and food security at the local level. Investments
 in services, such as extension, may contribute significantly to propagate the use of some technologies such as
 composting, residue management and manure use. Others technologies such as advanced seed development and
 improvement, and the production of inorganic fertilizers, would need to be addressed at higher policy levels.

 Women are found to play an indispensable role in smallholder production. Addressing constraints to their access
 to production resources, whether of a physical, financial, cultural or legal nature, is found to be a vital step towards
 sustainably improving production levels.

190. Cotton is a non-food crop that is nevertheless important to poor households. Cotton is
almost exclusively found in Adamawa, North and Far North, where it is a popular crop grown by
25-40 percent of all households. Cotton is a labor intensive crop and when poor farmers do not
grow cotton themselves, they often work on cotton farms as wage laborers. The sector is led by a
parastatal enterprise, SODECOTON, founded in 1974. The company has a mandate to purchase
all seed cotton grown in Cameroon at a fixed price which gives the company a monopoly on both
purchasing and processing of seed cotton. SODECOTON sets the initial producer price in
consultation with the cotton farmer union (OPCC) and in profitable years can add a bonus premium
at the season’s end, which is deposited into an account of the union of cotton producers. Cotton
farmers are organized in associations (some 1900 in all) which are member of the union.

191. The integrated value chain of the cotton sector brings many advantages to farmers
but the sector is in financial distress. Farmers have access to inputs on credit, to be repaid when
the cotton is sold and benefit from guaranteed prices and marketing. In a context where public
extension services are weak, farmers also benefit from extension offered by SODECOTON.
Farmer associations form groups of two or three in order to recruit and pay for their own extension
staff. As such, cotton is key to livelihoods in the poorest regions. Unfortunately the sector is
challenged by a precarious financial situation (30-35 percent of farmers have not been paid for last
year’s harvest) caused by poor management and the isolation of the northern part of the country
which adds cost and marketing delays.

Figure 6.4: Sources of income by wealth quintile and agro-ecological zone
 A key distinction between the poorest and wealthiest households is not that wealthier households derive more
 income from agriculture but that the poorest households depend on wage labor to make ends meet (i.e. they are
 unable to earn a sufficient amount from farming alone). Unlike poor households, better off households have access
 to non-farm income sources and transfers, mostly from other households residing within the country.

Box 6. 3: Rain-fed or irrigated agriculture: small reductions in poverty for many, or large
reductions for few
 In seeking to improve the productivity, stability, and sustainability of drylands’ agriculture, policy makers face a
 fundamental question: Should attention be focused on improving rain-fed production systems, expanding irrigated
 production systems, or both?

 Currently, more than 90 percent of the staples produced and consumed in sub-Saharan Africa is produced in rain-
 fed systems, and only 5 percent is produced under irrigation. Using realistic assumptions about future area
 expansion and yield growth, FAO projects that rain-fed agriculture can continue to meet 90 percent of incremental
 demand for decades to come. Noting that investment in irrigation is economically justifiable only when irrigation
 facilities can be used to produce high-value cash crops, FAO projects that even by 2050, irrigated production is
 unlikely to contribute more than 10 percent of staples production.

 The FAO vision, which is shared by many analysts, suggests that African policy makers and development partners
 should follow a strategy of promoting production of cereals and grain legumes in drylands, and rice and horticultural
 crops in irrigated zones. Investments should be tailored accordingly. In zones deemed unfavorable for irrigation,
 efforts should focus on promoting adoption of improved technologies that can improve productivity and stabilize
 production of rain-fed agriculture, with an emphasis on reducing risk and increasing resilience among vulnerable
 households. In zones deemed favorable for irrigation, efforts should focus on developing irrigation and promoting
 production of high- value crops, with an emphasis on increasing revenues, improving food security, and reducing
 poverty.

 Deciding an appropriate balance between these two complementary objectives will not be easy. From a public
 policy perspective, given a fixed amount of resources, there is a clear trade-off between investing in small
 improvements for the large number of households that engage in rain-fed production in the drylands, and investing
 in large improvements for the relatively small number of households that could take advantage of irrigation
 technology. Investments that target rain-fed production systems will not promote highly visible results, but because
 they can benefit so many households, they have the potential to improve the livelihoods and increase the resilience
 of the large majority of the population. The policy choice thus pits small reductions in poverty for the many against
 large reductions in poverty for the few. And given the vast discrepancy in the numbers of households falling into
 each category, as well as the high cost of irrigation development, targeting drylands agriculture is likely to be the
 better choice.

Creating (informal sector) jobs through urbanization and structural transformation

192. In the present economic environment growth is brought about by increases in human
and physical capital and less by increases in total factor productivity. To the degree that there
are increases in total factor productivity, it is less due to economic innovation (Cameroon scores
very low on this) and more due to labor shifting from the unproductive primary sector, where
underemployment is a major issue, to urban areas and the tertiary sector were underemployment
is less an issue. One immediate benefit from moving to urban areas is that one can be productive
year round. In rural areas, and certainly in the northern parts of the country this is much more
difficult, particularly for farmers depending on rain-fed agriculture. This is reflected in the value
added per worker for someone self-employed in agriculture and self-employed in the urban
informal sector. It is more than double for those in the urban informal sector (FCFA 300,000 versus
FCFA 750,000, see also Figure 6.5).

  The majority of people in urban areas are employed in the informal non-agricultural sector. In rural areas this
 sector employs a significant fraction of the workers as well. Agri-business, retail trade, and clothing are the core

193. The shift out of agriculture towards the urban (informal) sector is likely to continue.
Since 2000, the service sector has been the main contributor to growth. The sector expanded by
more than five per cent in 2013, with transport, communications, and financial services being the
most dynamic. At the same time exports per capita have been steadily declining which suggests
that the increasing share of the services sector comes mainly from non-tradable services and
informal activities. Continued urbanization is thus an essential element of a poverty reduction
strategy. The process is relatively slow, but over time, urbanization can significantly contribute to
poverty reduction, even when the immediate effect may be a displacement of poverty from rural
areas to urban slums.

194. Investments in health and education will help the poor to migrate successfully. Better
educated, healthier people are not only more likely to be more productive in rural areas, they are
also more likely to migrate successfully and end up as a non-poor person in an urban area. Investing


                                                         89
in human capital, particularly in areas like northern Cameroon which are currently deprived of
many education and health services, is an important element of a poverty reduction strategy.

195. In the DSCE the Government aims to slow urban growth, but from the perspective of
poverty reduction continued urbanization is important, given the positive linkage between
urbanization and rural poverty reduction. This can easily be discerned by considering a
counterfactual without rapid urbanization. We consider two scenarios in which the speed of
urbanization is reduced. In the first scenario urbanization is successfully brought to a halt (zero
growth). In the second scenario urban areas grow at the same rate as the overall population growth.
To consider the impact on the number of poor, it is assumed that rural and urban poverty rates
remain unchanged at 57 and 9 percent respectively. Results are presented in Figure 6.6. They

196. demonstrate that if poverty rates and the speed of urbanization do not change, one can
expect 7.8 million poor people in Cameroon. If the rate of urbanization slows down, or if
urbanization is stopped altogether the number of poor would increase to 8.9 or 10.7 million people.

197. Moving to urban areas alone is insufficient, the business environment has to improve
as well for formal and informal enterprises. Those working in the industrial sector generate
about FCFA 1.4 million in value added per worker. This is almost twice as much as those working
in the tertiary sector, illustrating the importance of promoting a business environment that ensures
jobs are created in high value added activities. Presently the majority (75 percent) of non-farm
enterprises is very small, informal and located in the two largest cities. While these enterprises are
numerous their contribution to overall employment is limited (31 percent), and less than the
contribution of large enterprises which represent only 0.8 percent of all enterprises. Also in terms
of contribution to total firm revenue the role of very small enterprises is limited (6 percent): almost
70 percent of all firm revenue is generated by the small fraction of large firms. This composition
of the non-farm enterprise sector summarizes one of the key challenges to poverty reduction in
Cameroon: how to increase productivity in a sector in which many of the poor engage, while also
unlocking the potential transformative contribution that a small number of large firms can make.

                       ii. Redistribution
198. A third pathway to poverty reduction identified in the analytical framework is
through redistribution. Targeted safety nets and transfer programs can increase household
wellbeing and investments in both human capital and productive activities. Safety nets can be seen
as strategic investments for directly increasing the share of growth generated by the poorest
(making growth more pro-poor). In countries such as Brazil targeted safety net programs that
provide limited but regular support to the poorest households have been found to contribute to the
significant reduction in extreme poverty and inequality rates over the last decade. A large number
of impact evaluations of targeted transfer programs in Africa also point to knock-on effects where
direct transfers to the poorest produce positive economic multiplier effects, increase economic
activities and help poor households diversify livelihoods and contribute to the economy. Often
these programs also boost investments in human capital, which in turn can improve future labor
market outcomes and economic activity. Well-designed safety nets, thus, not only alleviate poverty
in the short run by increasing consumption, they are also instrumental in assisting chronically poor
households build their productive asset base. In so doing, safety nets enhance income growth and
alleviate poverty in the medium term.

 Large amounts are spent on food subsidies which are poorly targeted. The poorest 40 percent benefit between from
 2 percent (chicken) and 27 percent (wheat) of the total subsidy spending.

199. Cameroon invests less in resilience and safety nets than most other African countries.
There is no national social protection strategy, nor are there any coordinated mechanisms for
providing targeted support to the poor. A 2011 review of social safety nets confirmed that existing
safety nets are not designed to address either chronic or transient poverty. Cameroon has a number
of small-scale and ad hoc safety net programs ranging from school feeding and fee waivers to
small cash transfers as well as some temporary food emergency assistance. Targeted programs
(excluding universal subsidies) cover only one percent of the population. Because coverage of
existing programs is low and its targeting to the most disadvantaged groups is weak, these
programs have had only a very limited impact in terms of reducing household vulnerability and
overall poverty. These programs accounted for only 0.23 percent of GDP and averaged 0.76
percent of total public spending between 2006 and 2011. Around 80 percent of this was spent on
emergency programs implemented in response to shocks such as droughts and floods.


                                                            91
200. Meanwhile costly and poorly targeted subsidies do not benefit the poorest. In an effort
to mitigate the negative effects of the 2008 rise in food and fuel prices, the Government launched
a universal subsidy program (food and fuel), which by 2011 was costing the Government around
2.7 percent of GDP. In 2013 more than US$100 million was spent to subsidize fish, wheat and rice
alone. These subsidies benefit the urban middle and upper class and only very small amounts
(between 2 percent and 27 percent depending on the food item) benefit the poorest 40 percent
(Figure 6.7). These persistent subsidies and the attempts to stabilize the market through
interventions act as a disincentive for local food production and not only aggravate rural poverty,
they also sustain the country’s dependency on food imports.

percent.
                                  A well targeted redistribution program has the potential to reduce poverty to 3 percent at a cost that is
                                     comparable to what is presently spent on import tax exemptions and poorly targeted subsidies.

201. There is great scope for a well-designed safety net program to have a major impact
on poverty reduction. This is illustrated in Figure 6.8. The amount of transfers (expressed as
percent of GDP) needed to reduce poverty to 3 percent can be estimated using poverty projections.
Presented are three projections, which assume that the population will grow at the same rate as
during the period 1987-2005 (5.5 percent on average in urban areas, 1.9 percent in rural areas and
2.6 percent at the national level) and which employ two GDP growth rates: (i) the average growth
rate registered between the last two surveys (2007-2014) and (ii) the average growth rate forecasted
by the Ministry of Planning for the period 2014-2020. Three projections are presented. The first
one uses the historical growth rate (3.9 percent) and the assumption that the poor realize half of
this GDP per capita growth (2.0 percent). This is already an improvement over the past pattern of
growth (section 2.1) necessitating the implementation of pro-poor growth policies to be attained.
For the second simulation an accelerated growth rate (7.1 percent) is used with the same
assumption about the pass through of growth (half). The last simulation uses the accelerated
growth rate (7.1 percent) and the hypothesis 90 percent of growth also benefits poor households.
In all three simulations poverty decreases, but at different rates. In none of the simulations is the
objective of reducing poverty to 3 percent attained. This is illustrated in the left panel of Figure
6.8. The right panel demonstrates how much would be needed if a perfectly targeted, transaction-

                                                                                                                     92
cost-free redistribution scheme would accompany the growth efforts. It demonstrates that the
amounts needed to virtually eliminate poverty are between 1 and 3 percent of GDP by 2030. This
is surprisingly little, particularly when compared to the amounts already spent on ill-targeted food
and fuel subsidies.

6.2    Binding constraints

202. The analysis has revealed the enormous potential for rapid poverty reduction in the
short run. With ample natural resources, a fortunate geographic location, climatic diversity, a
large demand for food products, a committed civil service and economic and political stability
Cameroon is well placed to unlock its potential in the rural sector where most poor people are
engaged. With the right policy reforms, particularly reforms which reduce the cost of doing
business, the country is uniquely positioned for rapid poverty reduction and economic
transformation by increasing the productivity of agriculture, capitalizing on the rapid urbanization,
the emerging demographic transformation and the opportunities offered by serving the domestic
and regional markets with goods and services produced in Cameroon.

203. For long term growth, the domestic market alone is unlikely to suffice and an export
orientation will be needed. The domestic market is limited in size and to reap the benefits for
economies of scale the country will need a greater orientation towards foreign markets. To do so
successfully the economy’s efficiency will need to increase significantly to counter the effects of
Dutch disease associated with large natural resource exports. The business environment indicators
show that it is extremely challenging to open and operate a business in Cameroon. Hence, an
ambitious institutional reform, targeting the simplification of administrative procedures,
improving the effectiveness of public administration and fighting corruption should be envisaged.
Cities will need to be transformed into centers of endogenous growth and the education system
may have to be reformed to put less emphasis on general intellectual development and more on
skills demanded by the economy.

204. The political settlement constrains the scope for economic transformation. Cameroon
is not an attractive destination for new investors –whether domestic or foreign. The politically
connected dominate the formal economic sphere and use their position of influence. The challenge
is to enhance competition, while remaining within the confines of the political settlement. After
all, poor governance is the price Cameroonians pays for political stability. A critical element of
the political settlement is that the regime has forged stability by co-opting a large number of
powerful elites from the economic, traditional, administrative, political and military spheres. This
co-optation has been inclusive and representatives from all major ethnic, religious or other
groupings are represented. It helped create a stable nation in an otherwise restive neighborhood.
The price paid for this is unmet economic and development potential. The challenge is that many
policy reforms needed to unlock the potential for poverty reduction, touch the core of Cameroon’s
political stability and may affect the interests of those sustaining the balance of power.

205. In the absence of change, opportunities for poverty reduction may remain elusive for
a long time to come. The quality of education is declining with dire consequences for future
growth and poverty reduction. Avoiding crises – whether economic or political is of paramount
importance. A distinguishing feature between rich and poor countries is not the fact that rich

                                                 93
countries grow faster (they don’t), but that they tend to be able to avoid deep recensions of the type
Cameroon experiences in the early 1990s and from which the country is still recovering. Economic
stability requires more cautious public financial management, prudent public investment planning
and more careful debt management than is currently the case. Security is a sine-qua non for
economic growth and eliminating the threat posed by Boko Haram is a priority. Political stability
needs to remain assured, a major challenge in the face of multiple elections, a restless young
population and a pending presidential transition.

206. Rapid poverty reduction requires more attention to the plight of people living in the
northern and eastern parts of the country. Not only do 5.1 million out of a total of 8.2 poor
million poor people live in the three northern regions (Far North, North and Adamawa) the people
living in northern Cameroon are disadvantaged in many respects. They have less access to health
and education services. The median years of education of adult women in the northern regions is
zero years. They live far from markets, children are less likely to be vaccinated and more likely to
be malnourished. Off-late people in the northern regions have been seriously affected by the
insecurity created by Boko Haram.

207. The binding constraints presented below stress the measures to preserve and unlock
Cameroon’s potential for poverty reduction in the short and longer run. The process to arrive
at prioritized binding constraints involved three steps. The first was to agree on the SCD process
itself and the analytical approach. A desk review considered pathways to economic development
and poverty reduction, on the basis of which the analytical approach presented in section 6.1 was
formulated. This approach was discussed and endorsed in May 2015 during a country team mini-
retreat, along with the process that would be followed to identify and prioritize the binding
constraints. This retreat was also used to discuss an emerging storyline for the SCD.

208. During the next step, additional evidence was collected and three areas binding
constraints were identified and endorsed. These are:

   Low rural productivity, particularly in northern Cameroon
   Non-conducive business environment for the formal and informal private sector
   Fragility and poor governance of the public and private sector

The constraints were discussed during a country team retreat in September 2015 and during
informal consultations with representatives from Government, CSOs and the academic
community. It was recognized that they follow from the analytical approach in that they reflect (i)
the nature of poverty (mostly rural and especially serious in northern Cameroon where people are
affected by multiple poverty traps) and (ii) the necessity to increase incomes in rural and urban
areas through labor intensive private sector led growth and increases in productivity. The third set
of core constraints reflects the evidence that poor governance is a major obstacle to achieving
better development outcomes.

209. With guidance from the retreat additional supporting evidence was collected and
reflected in chapters 1-5. This led to a refinement of the storyline. During formal, in-country
consultations, held between November 16-21, 2015 in Yaoundé and Douala, the SCD storyline
and the three areas of constraints were presented and discussed at length with different

                                                 94
stakeholders: CSOs, academics, authorities, private sector, parliamentarians, donors and youth
representatives.

210. The final step involved prioritizing the policy actions needed to mitigate the binding
constraints. During a two-day country team retreat, held on December 1st and 2nd 2015, the three
core binding constraints were reconfirmed and mitigating policy actions identified and prioritized.
To this end, a voting procedure was used, in which each country team member was invited to
prioritize the binding constraints, within each cluster, along two criteria: contribution to poverty
reduction and political feasibility.

211. In the final set of constraints presented below the different pathways to poverty
reduction, identified in the analytical model, are reflected. The model suggested that to
alleviate poverty, the household budget constraint should be loosened through either
improvements in productivity of the self-employed, increased demand for wage labor or enhance
redistribution. The first two pathways are addressed in the areas of constraints 1 and 2, which focus
on improving the productivity of rural households and improving the business environment. The
redistribution avenue to poverty reduction is captured in constraint 1.4 (safety nets) but also 3.1
(improve PFM systems) as a better functioning PFM system, is a prerequisite for a safety net.

Figure 6.9: Process of identification and prioritization of binding constraints




212. The particularly precarious situation of people living in northern Cameroon is
addressed throughout the three areas of constraints. The first area of constraints focuses on
northern Cameroon. Improving security (constraint 3) is of greatest relevance to northern

                                                 95
Cameroon. Spatially blind policies promoted in constraint areas 2 and 3 imply that northern
Cameroon will benefit from measures assuring equal treatment with respect to e.g. budget
allocations (3.1), improvements in public sector incentives (3.3) reducing transport costs (2.2),
rural financial services (2.3), access to clean115 energy (2.4), city development (2.5) or access to
telecommunication services (2.6).

213. To meet the demand for selectivity, alleviating the constraint to rural productivity
focuses on value chains for crops and livestock that are relevant for poor households, while
the measures under constraints two and three focus on reducing the cost of doing business
and complementary governance measures.

214. Tropical forest preservation is not identified as priority for poverty reduction within
Cameroon, but it is a priority from a perspective of (global) environmental sustainability.
Low population density in Cameroon’s tropical forest zone imply that forest preservation does not
feature amongst the binding constraints for poverty reduction. However, the unique biodiversity
of this area, its contribution to climate change mitigation and the unique habitat it offer for people
dependent upon the forest makes forest preservation a global priority from a perspective of
environmental and social sustainability.

215. The remainder of this chapter presents the binding constraints and prioritized policy
actions.

Area of constraints 1: Low rural productivity, particularly in northern Cameroon

216. Low rural productivity is a major constraint, as evidenced by the high levels of
poverty that persist in rural areas amongst people who are largely self-employed, both on
and off the farm or as pastoralists. Poverty is concentrated and worsening in northern Cameroon.
If this is unaddressed, it is likely to worsen with time. By 2030, the number of people living in
northern Cameroon may increase between 50 and 80 percent, depending on the fertility and
migration scenario. Increased population pressures will further intensify competition for resources.
Environmental degradation and exposure to droughts and extreme events such as floods are likely
to intensify as a result of climate change.

217. Human capital remains one of the main assets of the poor, a portable asset no less which
facilitates successful rural to urban migration. Levels of education are particularly deficient in
northern Cameroon and especially amongst women: the median number of years of education for
women was found to be zero. Other human capital indicators such as vaccinations, malnutrition,
access to safe water and sanitation were also found to be very bad. To improve people’s ability to
be productive, but also to reap the demographic dividend an overall increase in spending on social
sectors is necessary, as will be discussed in the last area of constraints. At the same time, the
disadvantaged position of women, and the strong association of female education with higher
levels of household consumption, lower fertility, lower child mortality and lower levels of
intergenerational poverty, justifies a particular focus on girls’ education.

115
   Cameroon experiences more than 11,000 premature mortalities each year associated with household air pollution
(or more than 600,000 disability-adjusted life years, including household air pollution related illness and death),
making it the 4th leading cause of death.

                                                        96
218. To alleviate poverty, productive safety nets should accompany efforts to increase
agricultural productivity. Not only have safety nets proven to contribute substantially to poverty
reduction, they are also a good instrument to address poverty in the most disenfranchised zones
which are affected by multiple poverty traps. Well-designed safety nets have demonstrated to have
a positive effect on income growth amongst the poorest. As such they make the process of growth
more inclusive. Through conditionality they can also address other factors that hold back
development, such as low levels of girl education, low levels of vaccination or poor nutritional
practices.

219. To increase rural productivity, the focus should be on agricultural and livestock
productivity as these are the main sources of livelihood for the poorest households. Increases
in agricultural and livestock production also translate into increased off farm activities. Where
multiple poverty traps simultaneously affect households, increasing productivity necessitates an
integrated approach that addresses multiple obstacles at the same time. Nonetheless, the focus
should not exclusively be on northern Cameroon, as productivity increases are also needed
elsewhere such as in the Western Highlands where a large number of poor people live.

220. Policy interventions need to take into account differences among the agro-ecological
zones. Adamawa, in the High Guinea Savanah, varies greatly from the North and Far North
regions, where a Sudano-Sahelian climate prevails. In the North and Far North, the livelihood
system is focused on livestock rearing (23 percent of households in Adamawa keep livestock as
opposed to 64 percent in the Far North) and the main crops grown are maize and manioc as opposed
to millet, maize and cotton in the Far North. Keeping these differences in mind is critical when
considering policy interventions.

221. A core constraint is the short length of the cropping season in the northern region and
soil degradation. This is aggravated by exposure to weather variability and climate risks. Thus,
improved water resource management is a priority, as it would lengthen the growing season and
reduce dependence on the weather alone. This requires climate smart investments. It also requires
more attention to extension services, which need to accompany productivity-enhancing
investments, so as to close the gap between the knowledge that exists at research level, and what
is applied by farmers. Doing so would help regenerate degraded soils and allow closing the yield
gap. It would also allow farmers to adapt more easily to climate change.

222. Developing value chains and improving market access to southern Cameroon and to
regional markets is critical. The economic isolation and backwardness of northern Cameroon
poses a great developmental challenge. As increased production will need to find an outlet,
developing value chains and improving market access is a sine-qua-non for poverty reduction. The
selection of value chains needs to take into account that poor households tend to grow and consume
certain crops such as coarse grains like maize, millet, and sorghum and beans. Many also grow
cotton. Being selective by focusing on these crops, which also have great market potential, would
benefit poor households in three ways: (i) it would raise incomes; (ii) it would increase demand
for wage labor, since manual labor is the means through which many of the poorest households
make ends meet; and (iii) to the degree that there is a focus on food grains, it would reduce food
prices. The productivity of pastoralists also needs to increase. Like food grains, livestock products

                                                 97
have great market potential, particularly in a rapidly urbanizing country. So developing the value
chain for livestock products is another priority.

223. Stronger farmer organizations strengthen value chains, facilitate extension and offer
a way to address local elite capture. Stronger producer organizations at village level facilitate
access to inputs, credit, storage, quality control and marketing. As such, they are a critical part of
any value chain, as is highlighted by the example of the cotton sector, which has actively developed
local producer organizations. These groups can also be instrumental to making extension service
more effective, for instance by organizing farmer field schools. By organizing farmers, producer
organizations empower farmers and can help prevent capture by local elites.

224. Value chain development creates opportunities for local product transformation and
off-farm employment. The farming season in northern Cameroon is short and the demand for
labor seasonal. Off-farm employment opportunities are important to lengthen the time during
which the rural labor force is gainfully employed. Such opportunities can come from labor
migration or through off-farm employment opportunities in transformation activities. Access to



                                                                           98
electricity, to finance and to markets, along with skills development are instrumental to realizing
such opportunities. These are all discussed under the next area of constraints.

225. Specific actions to alleviate binding constraints and their ranking by importance of
poverty reduction and feasibility are presented below. Climate smart farming technologies and
livestock management systems; improved human capital, particularly for women; improved
market access and productive safety net systems are the top priorities in terms of contribution to
poverty reduction and political feasibility.

Area of constraints 2: Non-conducive business environment for the formal and informal
private sector

226. Cameroon has ample opportunities for growth if it were to capitalize on its many
competitive advantages associated to its natural resources, climate, location, relatively educated
work force and capable bureaucracy. The non-rural formal and informal private sector need to
expand to accompany agricultural and livestock productivity growth and to absorb an increasing
number of rural-to-urban migrants. Moreover, for poverty to be reduced, a pattern of growth is
needed that is more pro-poor. Where possible labor intensive production and the informal sector
need to be supported.

227. To unlock Cameroon’s growth potential, the cost of doing business needs to be
reduced and the quality of and access to basic economic services improved. Transport costs
are very high because of cartels, poor maintenance, corruption, and weak management. Telecom
services are expensive and of poor quality. The internet is hardly accessible. Piped water is
unavailable to most urbanites most of the time and electricity is unreliable and costly. Addressing
shortcomings in these basic economic services requires major investments. New infrastructure has
to be constructed; the port of Kribi developed; the telecom sector coverage expanded; electricity
generation increased and the distribution network upgraded; the functioning of cities has to be
improved. Much of these investments should come from the private sector. Yet private investors
will only be attracted if a favorable rate of return can be expected. To achieve this policy reform
is a prerequisite. The electricity sector presents a model to be emulated as the reform agenda that
has been set in motion has already attracted private investors ready to finance important
investments. Even when investments are publicly funded, they will need to be accompanied by
policy reforms to ensure an acceptable return to scarce public funds.

228. To better facilitate private sector led growth, both the financial sector and the
education sector need to be reformed. The financial sector is ill-developed and insufficiently
dynamic to facilitate private sector led growth. In the education sector greater attention needs to
be given to skills development. Students need to be prepared for careers in the private sector. This
requires a change in mindset amongst students and a much greater focus on the skills and
competencies sought by firms.

229. The state-led development model has demonstrated its limits. The business
environment is crippled by inefficient state-owned enterprises, many of which are loss making.
The country’s debt burden increases rapidly and unsustainably. Public investments should be
limited strictly to economically viable investments and should be used to crowd-in private
investments and to support areas with evident market failures. Instead of using public investments
                                                99
to replace private investments, which are not forthcoming because of policy failures, policy reform
should be used to attract private investors.

230. Addressing constraints in this area requires an opportunity-driven approach.
Cameroon’s centralized and slow decision-making as well as a fragmented bureaucracy limit the
scope for reform. Technical assessments showing the desirability of a given reform alone are not
sufficient. Flexibility, adaptability and, above all, opportunism are needed to identify and pursue
reforms for which a coalition for change exists and for which high-level authorization has been
obtained.

231. Increased private sector growth will not automatically be pro-poor. Given the pattern
of growth in the past and the structure of the economy, it is likely that a more attractive business
environment will largely benefit the center and coastal areas of the country. A specific focus on
integration of the north and the south of the country is critical, as was already highlighted in the
previous constraint. Where relevant, for instance in the selection of value chains, preference should
be given to sectors with strong backward linkages to areas in which many poor households are
active (agro-processing; livestock), to labor intensive sectors (construction; sustainable artisanal
mining) and to non-agricultural sectors employing many poor people (the informal sector).

232. Specific actions to alleviate binding constraints and their ranking by importance of
poverty reduction and feasibility are presented below. They are, in order of contribution to
poverty reduction, (i) reforming higher education to give more attention to skills training; (ii)
reducing the cost of transport; (iii) reforming the financial sector; and (iv) improving energy
supply; followed by (v) investments in sustainable cities; (vi) the telecom sector; and (vii) the
urban water sector. It is noteworthy that investments in the energy sector, ranked fourth in terms
of contribution to poverty reduction, was considered most feasible, a reflection of the success of
past reforms in this field. Reforming the financial sector, ranked 3rd in terms of contribution to
poverty reduction, was ranked 5th in terms of political feasibility. The presence of a disconnect
between political feasibility and contribution to poverty reduction combined with the fact that in
many areas policy reforms need to precede investments, reinforces that an opportunistic approach
will be critical.

Area of constraints 3: Fragility and poor governance of the public and private sector

233. Throughout this document, governance emerges as a critical constraint. Cameroon
continues to adhere to a centralized, state-led approach to economic development. It is unable to
deliver public services in a manner that would be expected of a lower middle income country. Core
public services such as health, education, water and sanitation are underfunded, of poor quality
and are delivered in an inefficient and inequitable manner. Regulatory burdens are high, oversight
is weak, the tax system is cumbersome, the public financial management system lacks transparency
and the budget lacks credibility. Basic economic security services (land tenure; justice) are weak
or offered in a non-transparent manner. As a consequence, conflicts between pastoralists and
sedentary farmers increase, Cameroon’s unique tropical forests are exploited in an unsustainable
manner, artisanal miners operate in a legal vacuum and banks and private investors are deterred
from making long-term investments. As the state is unable to meet the expectations of its citizens,
and as citizens are unable to freely express themselves, the social contract between citizens and
state is fragile.

234. Governance was frequently mentioned during the consultations and emerged as one
of the core obstacles to development and poverty reduction in the 2013 World Bank Client
Survey. A total of 388 people from NGOs (25 percent), ministries (21 percent), project
management units (6 percent) and media (5 percent) responded to the survey. Asked to identify
which is the most important development priority in Cameroon, improving governance emerged
as top priority. Similarly, when asked “which of a listed number of development areas contributes
most to reducing poverty in Cameroon”, governance reform and anti-corruption featured amongst
the highest priorities.

235. The state has considerable capacity but the political settlement has led to
fragmentation and bureaucratic inertia. Regularly the state has demonstrated its effectiveness,
particularly when regime survival is at stake or when clear orders are given by the Presidency.
Bureaucratic decisiveness when regime survival is at stake and inertia in other circumstances are
two sides of the same coin, however. The administration is organized such that accountability is
mostly upward. Improving service delivery and unlocking private sector led growth will require
greater decentralization of decision making powers (including through civil service reform) and
strengthening downward accountability. Where this has occurred, impressive results have been
achieved, as was the case with Results Based Financing for the health services for instance.

236. Public financial management reform, economic management reform and civil service
reform are needed. There are many interlinkages between these areas of reform. For instance, to
facilitate peace and stability more resources may have to be channeled to the military.
Notwithstanding, a military strategy alone is not sufficient. Higher spending on education, health,
and safety nets, have for instance, been associated with a lower risk of small scale conflict. 116

   An empirical analysis (148 countries over 1960–2009) shows that higher levels of military and social spending are
associated with lower risk of conflict onset in countries rich in oil and gas. Higher spending in education, health, and
social protection is associated with lower risk of small scale conflict. While unable to prevent full-scale wars, higher
spending on public services for which citizens care could be enough to reduce grievance, foster a government’s
legitimacy, and reduce the risk of small-scale conflict. Finally, higher levels of general public spending are not robustly
associated with lower risk of conflict. Singh, R., C. Bodea and M. Higashijima 2014. Oil and Civil Conflict: Can
Public Spending Have a Mitigation Effect? World Bank. Policy Research Working Paper No. 7100.

                                                           102
237. While the rationale for all these reforms is clear, the feasibility for wholesale reforms
is less evident, justifying more opportunistic, partial approaches. Entrenched interest are huge
and going against them may not be the most effective approach to reform. A more opportunistic
going with the grain approach, where reforms are pursued when the opportunity arises, seems more
appropriate. Maybe the entire health system cannot be reformed, but incentive-compatible
approaches to improve service delivery by front line providers can be introduced. Identifying
where such possibilities exist, or helping create such opportunities will be important, which is why
it is critical to invest more in analytical work that engages the authorities on the opportunity cost
of not-reforming, in enhancing transparency and in strengthening accountability mechanisms.

238. Peace and stability are a precondition for development. The current situation is
precarious in large parts of the country: the north and the east are clearly fragile and restive youth
in urban areas may also pose a risk. Avoiding future instability and restoring security in areas
already affected by instability is critical for any successful development effort. Once security is
assured in areas that are presently not safe, the focus can switch to stabilization and developmental
activities. A critical first step is to find ways to engineer a rapid economic revival that can increase
employment and economic opportunities. It requires improved collaboration between security,
humanitarian and development actors and a greater focus on decentralized approaches. By
involving local communities more actively and more directly, such approaches can play a key role
by supporting poverty-reducing investments, avoiding elite capture (Figure 6.10) and
strengthening resilience.

239. Certain aspects may have to be addressed as matter of urgency, such as the
approaches to enhance local resilience. Presently, the financial situation of the cotton industry
is precarious. A collapse of the company would have serious economic and social repercussions

                                                                 103
in an already impoverished area, which forms a ‘vault’ against the extension of Boko Haram
southwards. The country cannot afford the loss of a source of livelihood that is critical to stability.
More generally, approaches that increase resilience and which empower local communities need
to be embraced. Strengthening these local systems, either in the form of municipalities, producer
organizations, or community-based organizations for social accountability will strengthen risk-
coping mechanisms. It can also act as barrier to elite capture.

240. Investments in statistics and beneficiary feedback will facilitate transparency,
accountability and the analytical agenda. Very little direct beneficiary feedback information is
being collected, even though such information is of critical importance to the design and successful
implementation of development activities. While the quality of statistics that are produced is
generally of good117 there are important data gaps that need to be addressed. Household surveys
and censuses tend to be carried out irregularly. Data will also need to be made publicly available
and, more data relevant to policy makers will need to be collected. No information, for instance,
is available to assess whether people living in urban slums are in transitory or chronic poverty.
Such information is critical for the question as to whether urban slums are areas of opportunity for
newly arriving migrants, or poverty traps that need to be addressed. Employment statistics are not
collected on a regular basis nor is information to assess productivity in agriculture. The last
agricultural census was carried out in 1992 and annual production surveys are not carried out.

241. Specific actions to alleviate binding constraints and their ranking by importance of
poverty reduction and feasibility are presented below. Main areas for poverty reduction are (i)
improving public financial management; (ii) strengthening the business environment; (iii)
reforming public sector incentives; and (iv) improving the security of land tenure; followed by (v)
improving transparency and accountability; (vi) greater analytical capacity to identify and argue
for reforms; and (vii) improving the legal system. Even more than in the previous cluster there is
a disconnect between political feasibility and contribution to poverty reduction, so selectivity will
need to happen by opportunistically identifying reforms that have the greatest likelihood of
success. At times reforms may have to be partial: for instance, reforming incentives in the civil
service as a whole was ranked 5th for feasibility, but results based financing was already
successfully introduced in the health sector. There may be potential to build on this in other sectors.
Primary education, ranked second in the first cluster of constraints, and secondary and higher
education, ranked first in the second cluster of constraints, are candidates for this.

  There are important exceptions though: the definitions used for urban areas differ between the INS and the Census
Bureau making it very difficult to come up with consistent information about the speed of urbanization.

6.3        Additional research suggested

242.   The preparation of this document has allowed identifying some knowledge gaps to
formulating and implementing an effective poverty reduction strategy. They are listed below:

243. Public expenditure reviews are urgently needed. Public expenditure reviews have not
been carried out for some time and the most recent one dates to 2010.118 Important issues exist in
the expenditure chain, from budget formulation, approval, execution, public procurement, and
reporting, to issues with the allocative and technical efficiency of spending as well as issues with
debt management. Increasing expenditures at a time of decreasing revenues leads to expenditure
constraints, rapid indebtedness and a crush in social spending. A public expenditure review is a
high priority to guide a dialogue aimed at reducing macro-economic risks and improving public
finance management.

244. Public expenditure reviews will need to go beyond narrow PFM issues alone. Other
issues deserve to be investigated including the functioning of state owned enterprises, value for
money in public procurement, expenditure adequacy, efficiency and tracking in social sectors, and
civil service reform. With respect to the latter there are many aspects to be clarified: the size of the
civil service, the delineation of different public institutions, the adequacy of the grade system, the
overall pay system – including benefits, allowances, other non-statutory revenue, and the
functioning of the performance management system.

245. It is important to investigate what is needed to arrive at a more efficient logistics
system. Low transport cost and access to all-weather roads seem critical for growth and poverty
reduction yet a better understanding of the impact of improved logistics on poverty reduction, and
the conditions under which reduced transport costs are most effective to reducing poverty is
pertinent. To develop an efficient transport system the various costs and benefits need to be better
understood so that informed trade-offs can be made between different transport modalities (air,
rail, roads) and within modalities between types (trunk, feeder and rural roads). In addition more
evidence is needed to identify where investments are justified, where transport costs can be
reduced through policy reforms alone, or where a combination of both investment and policy
reform is needed.

246. The land question needs attention. Land in Cameroon is still relatively abundant in many
areas: at the same time land conflicts are many. During the consultations, security of tenure was
frequently identified as a critical obstacle to growth and poverty reduction. Security of tenure is
important for various reasons: to protect against land-grabbing and displacement; to ensure
sustainable forest management; to increase foreign and local private investment; to avoid
speculation; and to address conflicts between pastoralists and farmers. The land issue is multi-
layered and varies by geographical location. A study to assess these aspects, and the adequacy of
the legal framework and options to address any eventual shortcomings therein, is recommended.

247. Selected aspects of poverty deserve to be explored. Livestock and poverty is one such
area. Many of the poorest in Cameroon are pastoralists or agro-pastoralists, yet relatively little is
understood about pastoralism per se or the integration of livestock into agro-pastoralist livelihood

systems. Similarly little is known about the economic and social impact of Boko Haram. Another
area to investigate is urban poverty. Urban poverty rates are surprisingly low and little is known
about the dynamics of poverty and migration of those living in slums. A third topic is
understanding the contribution of rural to urban migration to poverty reduction. Those who migrate
tend to be better educated, suggesting that less poor people tend to migrate while leaving rural
areas deprived of better educated people.

248. How to effectively and at scale transfer scientific knowledge to farmers is an areas
that needs investigation. The SCD has pointed out the disconnect between knowledge present in
Cameroon’s research stations and what farmers practice. How to close this knowledge gap in a
context where extension services are understaffed and underqualified (skills), and where practices
differ between agro-ecological zones and within agro-ecological zones between villages deserves
to be investigated. Greater citizen engagement in combination with the use of new technologies
may offer opportunities for effective innovation – as evidenced by successful extension work by
e.g. digitalgreen which uses ICT and active community participation to spread information about
new farming technologies and practices.119 The potential to adapt and adopt such innovative
approaches to Cameroon’s context deserves to be explored.

249. Cotton sector. An estimated 300,000 households in northern Cameroon depend directly
on cotton production for their revenue. The sector also offers employment to numerous employees
and subcontractors, transporters as well as traders of by-products and breeders who use oil cakes
for cattle-feeding particularly important for the northern cities of Garoua, Maroua and
Ngaoundéré. Presently the financial situation of SODECOTON is alarming and many farmers have
not been paid for their last harvest. A collapse of the company would have serious economic and
social repercussions in an already impoverished area. A dedicated study would assess the
importance of an integrated cotton sector for poverty reduction, consider the causes of the
precarious financial situation of SODECOTON, and, drawing from international experience,
present options for a sustainable resolution.

250. How do stronger local organizations contribute to poverty reduction? It has been
argued that stronger local organizations improve resilience to conflict and climate change and can
be instrumental to overcoming market-access constraints. Local organizations can be vehicles for
literacy programs, or social safety net interventions and could strengthen local accountability. How
local organizations could do so, what type of organizations might be supported (NGOs; school
committees; faith based organizations; farmer groups; savings groups) and how best to support
these organizations in ways that avoid elite capture or accountability towards donors instead of
members, needs to be investigated.

Annex 2: Key Messages from SCD Consultation

1. Consultations to inform the preparation of the Cameroon SCD took place from 16-20
November, 2015, in Yaoundé and Douala. Meetings were organized with different
stakeholder groups, including: education sector; academics and intellectuals; agricultural
sector; private sector; youth and NGOs; parliamentarians, mayors and senators, representatives
of donor agencies, the Ministers of Finance and of Planning and Economy, as well as other
representatives of the Government of Cameroon. The team participated in the review of the
2014 DSCE progress report, organized by the Comité Technique de Suivi (CTS) DSCE, and
presented and exchanged with the Committee’s members on the draft SCD results.

2. The consultations confirmed the preliminary SCD analysis, which identified
governance, agricultural productivity and high cost of doing business as core binding
constraints. During the course of the consultations, it became increasingly clear that this last
binding constraint would be better formulated in terms of constraints to private sector
development. Whereas this reflects largely constraints identified beforehand, related to
infrastructure, it also covers the lack of skills and puts emphasis on the importance of moving
towards a private sector led model of growth, as opposed to a state led model.

3. Elite capture, land issues, the importance of women education and the fragility of the
cotton sector were highlighted in several meetings. Frustration about the lack of private
sector development, bureaucratic inertia and fragmentation were regularly voiced, as
exemplified by the stock exchange, which exists for over ten years now, but in which only
three firms are listed. This despite the fact that many public enterprises could be listed and
despite the widespread perception of difficulties to access finance for investments. Regularly
it was pointed out that much of the bureaucratic inefficiency and corruption should be
attributed to the precarious financial situation of civil servants who had their salaries slashed
by 70 percent in the early 1990s, and whose salaries remain low.

4. The consultations made clear that the Government’s growth and development
strategy (DSCE) and the priorities, as expressed in the draft SCD are well aligned, though
some differences exist. The DSCE is formulated in terms of attaining middle income status
by 2035 and focuses on income growth – with poverty reduction a secondary objective. For
the World Bank, poverty reduction is a primary objective and income growth an instrumental
variable to attaining it. Consequently, the SCD analysis puts more emphasis on growth of
smallholder productivity, redistribution and bridging the gaps in primary and technical
education and rather less on large-infrastructure-investment-led growth.

5. Specific feedback from the various sessions is presented below:

6. The education session put much emphasis on the need to fill education gaps by
providing more budget; improve quality of education and focus more on skill
development by boosting efficiency. There was consensus amongst participants that there is
a large disconnect between skills needed by the economy and what students learn at school.
Multiple sources of inefficiency were pointed out, including schools being constructed without
teachers or materials; the existence of school training programs not relevant for the geographic

                                            109
area in which they are located; the existence of parallel training courses organized by the
private sector; and diploma inflation because students fail to find jobs. Greater coordination
and collaboration with the private sector was deemed desirable, as was creating a culture in
which not all students vie for public sector jobs. The inability to coordinate and the absence of
incentives to pursue reforms were identified as key reasons for the limited progress made to
identify these issues to date. Stronger leadership, including from the World Bank was identified
as highly desirable, as it could help solve coordination issues.

7. During a dinner with intellectuals and academics, the limited scope for policy reform
was highlighted. Governance was identified as a key obstacle to policy reform, while private
sector led growth was deemed to be both inevitable and desirable. It was recognized that in the
current environment there are too many vested interests blocking reforms, including reforms
that would mostly benefit poor households. “Everything in Cameroon is politics, even
poverty”, summarized well the overall sentiment, by alluding to the fact that in certain
instances politicians appear to have an interest in keeping people poor (for instance because it
makes vote buying easier and cheaper).

8. The meeting with MPs, Senators and Mayors emphasized the need for greater
empowerment and they shared the SCD’s emphasis on poverty reduction, as continued
high levels of poverty were considered to undermine state legitimacy. The effectiveness of
typical governance reforms was questioned, and greater empowerment was offered as
alternative. This could come in the form of decentralization, strengthening the role of the
Parliament, women’s education, improved information provision and more private sector led
growth. A wide range of topics was discussed, including the importance of land issues; results
based financing in health; tax reforms; the importance of big investment projects to attain
middle income status; the need to invest in roads to strengthen Cameroon’s regional logistics
function and reduce post-harvest losses; as well as the low capacity of civil servant working at
the commune level and its implication for attracting investment projects from FECOM.

9. Specialists from the agricultural sector pointed out that vast knowledge exists on how
to increase agricultural productivity, but that this knowledge does not reach farmers.
This disconnect (which is less pressing in the cotton sector because of the integrated nature of
its supply chain) will need to be addressed to increase productivity at scale. The need to define
a package of technical and social interventions to increase production by smallholder farmers
was broadly shared, but what such a package should consist of was not evident. Beyond the
importance of irrigation, fertilizer and improved seed, many other aspects were brought
forward, including the importance of communications, climate-smart-farming and the need to
restore degraded soils. The importance of avoiding large scale deforestations was stressed, in
view of the country’s expansion of cocoa and oil palm production. So was the importance of
nutritionally improved varieties, city-gardens, the high cost of fertilizers, land issues and the
advantages of an integrated cotton supply chain. There was consensus on the need for different
interventions by agro-climatic zone.

10. Donor representatives subscribed to the three axes of constraints identified by the
SCD. They confirmed the importance of private sector development and the difficulty to
assessing political feasibility of reforms; lamented the unfinished decentralization agenda and

                                            110
while in support of a much greater emphasis on northern Cameroon, they warned for absorption
problems. The importance of women’s education in the northern Cameroon, was stressed,
along with the risks associated with the rapid increase in debt. Improved donor coordination to
follow up on public finance issues and to coordinate activities in the northern Cameroon were
highlighted by various donor representatives. In a separate meeting, the financial difficulties
of the cotton company were brought to the attention of the team, along with the liquidity
problems that the authorities are presently experiencing.

11. Civil society representatives suggested that there is scope for citizen engagement at
the local level, while stressing that scaling up local initiatives is very difficult and actively
prevented by the authorities. They highlighted that the convening power of the World
Bank could act as catalyst to ensure a better dialogue between civil society, Government
and the private sector. Even for local interventions, reaching the poorest remains difficult
due to elite capture. Still, there exist ample successful examples from which useful lessons can
be learned. As in the meeting with intellectuals, it was pointed out that poverty is politics and
that some powerful people seem to have limited interest in reducing poverty. Without making
the connection directly, questions were asked about why the many interventions in northern
Cameroon are yielding so poor results. The directives of the CEMAC, for instance, with
regards to the creation of a Supreme Audit Institution, were identified as a means to strengthen
oversight and accountability. And so were more participatory approaches, strengthening
university research and completing the decentralization agenda. Civil society indicated that
they could play an active role in project supervision and generating beneficiary feedback.

12. It was acknowledged that youth is deeply frustrated by a lack of economic
opportunities and representation. This gets reflected not so much in opinion polls (youth
tends to be uninterested in politics) but in anti-social behavior (drugs; violence) and many
youths trying to move abroad. Whether the youth’ frustration will lead to widespread protest
is not obvious. A culture of repression effectively suppresses protests. This does not mean
violent protests cannot occur: it already happened, for instance in 2008. In fact, the absence of
an outlet for their frustration may make the youth a tinderbox waiting to be ignited.

13. A meeting with private sector representatives identified bureaucratic inertia,
corruption, poor road infrastructure, land issues, difficulties with contract enforcement,
due to an overextended judicial system and hostility towards the private sector as main
constraints to doing business. The participants lamented the (re)-centralization of decision
making in Yaoundé (moving customs away from the main port and center of economic
activities) and the decline of many economic services (CAMAIRCO; road quality) because of
a lack of attention, lack of funds, poor maintenance, mediocre leadership, etc. Participants also
noted the distrust of the private sector towards the Government, since the private sector is
apparently wary of a “Berlusconi syndrome”. This has led to the Government only
halfheartedly backing an indigenous private sector development. This distrust is further
exemplified by the rather limited indigenous participation in the privatization process, as well
as the limited appointment of private sector cadres to ministerial positions. A moment of soul-
searching brought out that the business community itself is quite fragmented and that if they
were to appear more unanimous in their interactions with the Government, the likelihood of
being heard would probably improve. The meeting also identified low civil servant wages as a

                                            111
reason behind much of the corruption and inertia. There was broad support for fewer but better
paid civil servants. Ample business opportunities exist in Cameroon, as well as in the region:
particularly the Nigerian market is attractive but unlocking this potential requires improved
road connectivity.

14. The members of the CTS DSCE noted the close alignment between the DSCE and the
three axes identified in the draft SCD. They questioned the team on the sustainability of a
system of redistributive transfers, while offering suggestions on how the disincentives, caused
by high per diem levels could be presented in a more politically palatable manner (low civil
servant salaries; need to address inequalities in the bureaucracy; need to avoid a bureaucracy
that operates at two speeds). CTS members pointed out that there should be no doubt about
the political will for policy reform. “The country has been in reform mode since 2000.”
However, they agreed that certain reforms were taking time to come to fruition. Finally, it was
pointed out that spatially blind service delivery might not be sufficient and that compensatory
measures might be necessary to address the needs of lagging regions.

   Annex 3: Key Messages from SCD Retreat: December 1-2, 2015


1.    The Cameroon country team met during December 1 and 2, 2015 in Washington DC
and Yaoundé to discuss the draft SCD. Key results of that discussion are summarized below.

2.      The team supported the overall storyline of the SCD. In particular, although growth in
per capita GDP in Cameroon, has been broadly positive since 1994, it has been too slow to deliver
a rapid reduction in poverty or the transformation expected under Vision 2035. In fact, during
2001-2014, poverty increased in rural areas, and especially in the North, both in absolute and
relative terms. Human development indicators are poor. For example, maternal mortality rates are
higher than the average for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole and median years of schooling for
women in the North is zero. In addition, there is a risk that rising debt levels will soon become
unsustainable.

3.      There was broad agreement within the country team on how to address these
challenges: it will be necessary for the country to: 1) accelerate its average rate of economic
growth; 2) redistribute the dividends of this growth more equitably; and 3) strengthen the
efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of governance systems in order to enable these
changes. Reflecting these challenges, the country team agreed that key constraints facing
Cameroon could be grouped in the following three clusters:

          Reducing vulnerability and increasing rural incomes by addressing multiple poverty
           traps, particularly in northern Cameroon.
          Facilitating private sector-led growth by both the formal and informal sector.
          Reducing fragility and improving governance of the public and private sectors.

4.      The team also agreed on the following: first, although governance cuts across both of the
first two clusters of constraints, it is of sufficient importance to merit consideration as a separate
organizing theme. Second, it was right to highlight the particular needs of the North and Far North
under the first cluster of constraints, while noting that some issues, such as insecurity and climate
change also affected other parts of the country. Third, it was important that the SCD avoid ‘picking
winners’ by specifying particular sectors to be supported, although sectors that were relatively
labor-intensive could contribute disproportionately to the goal of redistributing income.

5.     The country team emphasized the following points with respect to the first cluster of
constraints:


          In order to adapt to the effects of climate change, it was important to encourage climate-
           smart irrigation and other farming technologies, as well as to take into account the water
           footprint of cotton in the context of diminishing water supplies.
          Pastoralism and livestock management are important sources of livelihood for people
           in the North. These require support services that are distinct from agriculture. Tensions
           between pastoralists and other inhabitants in the region are a source of insecurity.


                                                 113
          There is clearly scope to increase social protection in Cameroon. For example, an
           efficient cash transfer scheme could reduce the share of the population in poverty to 3
           percent, at a cost of 2.7 percent of GDP. A well-designed social protection scheme can
           also be a means of promoting productive livelihoods, improved social indicators etc.
           Developing an effective social protection system in Cameroon, however, will need to
           recognize that, currently, social protection barely exists in the country.
          Improved sanitation is an important additional aspect of rural development. It has an
           impact on school achievement, health and safety particularly for women and girls, and
           overall productivity. This should, therefore, be considered as part of the package of
           measures to increase human capital.
          Vocational skills training at secondary school level is an important aspect of
           strengthening human capital among rural communities.

6.     The following issues were discussed by the team under the broad heading of private sector
led growth in the formal and informal sectors:

          Housing is a key priority for the Government. There is an overall deficit of about 1
           million homes. As highlighted in the World Bank’s recent report on housing, however,
           tackling this deficit should be done incrementally. In addition, improved housing would
           be best treated in the SCD as an outcome of reforms in relevant markets, notably land
           and finance.
          Agri-business was also acknowledged as an important priority for the Government and
           a potential means of linking rural and urban areas. The team agreed that agri-business,
           and potentially other linkages between rural sector outputs and manufacturers in urban
           areas, were best captured under the concept of value chains (located under the first
           cluster of constraints, but linking to the second cluster).
          Urban development was acknowledged as the source of significant current and
           potentially further economic growth. The team agreed, therefore, that sustainable and
           inclusive city development should be included as a means of contributing to economic
           growth.
          Desired financial sector reform includes capital market development and non-bank
           finance, as well as reforms in the banking sector. Examples of non-bank financial
           products would include products suitable for use via mobile phones.
          The team also agreed that further focus on improving the efficiency of border controls
           and encouraging openness and competitiveness in key sectors, such as telecoms and
           urban water, were also important.

7.     Under the third cluster of constraints the country team emphasized the importance of:
        Security measures, particularly though not exclusively, in the North, as well as
          structural measures to enhance local empowerment and state accountability to citizens.
        Increasing the share of public spending allocated to the social sectors and improving
          the technical efficiency of expenditures including capital expenditures.
        Enforcing regulations that apply to state-owned enterprises.
        Strengthening the functioning of the legal system.
        Improving land tenure security.
