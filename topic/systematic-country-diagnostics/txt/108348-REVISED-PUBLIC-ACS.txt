FOREWORD
                                             Vietnam Systematic Country Diagnostic 2016        ix


Vietnam’s development success over the last 30 years has been truly remarkable. One of the
poorest countries in the world just a generation ago, Vietnam has emerged as a thriving middle
income economy. Largely isolated from international trade at the beginning of its transition,
Vietnam is today an export powerhouse and major destination of foreign direct investment.
Most importantly, this economic dynamism has dramatically improved peoples’ lives. Incomes
have not only risen exceptionally fast, but also broadly across the entire income distribution
with only modest increases in inequality. Extreme poverty fell dramatically from 50 percent in
1993 to less than 3 percent today. Key human development outcomes and access to basic
infrastructure have also improved substantially.

Looking ahead, Vietnam’s development prospects remain bright. As presented in this report,
Vietnam has every potential to sustain its remarkable success. In recent years, growth has
proven resilient, despite the subdued global recovery. Real incomes continue to rise broadly
and poverty continues to fall. With abundant human and natural resources, strong economic
fundamentals and a keen focus on leveraging global and regional integration, Vietnam is well
placed to continue to deliver high growth, more and better jobs and greater prosperity for all.

Yet, Vietnam will face new and complex choices in order to reach its full potential. Persistent
welfare gaps among the country’s ethnic minorities, stagnant productivity growth and
growing environmental vulnerabilities all pose challenges that will require bold action. The
reform agenda is necessarily complex and comprehensive. It encompasses steps to further
strengthen economic governance and build more effective market institutions, to develop the
country’s infrastructure (especially power, transport and urban infrastructure) to meet the
demands of a rapidly growing economy, to modernize agriculture and use of natural assets,
to improve public service delivery and enhance climate change resilience.

As a long term development partner of Vietnam, the World Bank stands ready to support the
country in tackling these emerging challenges and meeting its own ambitious goals for the
future. This report will serve as the analytical underpinning to identify priorities for the next
chapter in the evolving partnership between Vietnam and the World Bank. Its purpose is
to systematically understand Vietnam’s opportunities and constraints in eliminating poverty
and realizing further gains in shared prosperity in a sustainable manner and to help both
the World Bank and Vietnam direct financial and knowledge resources to the most pressing
development challenges. As such, it will be a key input into the upcoming Country Partnership
Framework for 2018-2022 which will lay the foundation for the World Bank’s support over the
coming years.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
                                              Vietnam Systematic Country Diagnostic 2016          1


Vietnam is a leading case of a country that has achieved rapid growth, poverty reduction,
and shared prosperity. Apart from China, no country in the world has undergone such a rapid
transformation in recent decades. In 1990, Vietnam was one of the poorest countries in the
world, still scarred by decades of conflict and with an economy stifled by a central planning
system. Today, extreme poverty has been all but eliminated, and the benefits of growth have
been widely shared, both over the long haul since the launch of the Doi Moi reforms in the
late 1980s and in recent years. Vietnam has been and continues to be the envy of developing
countries around the world.

Vietnam’s past achievements came through a combination of different developments.
Growth in the 1990s was principally a product of agricultural productivity gains which came in
the wake of decollectivization and the creation of individual land usage rights. In the first decade
of the new millennium, growth continued with the emergence of private sector enterprises
after severe constraints on business registration were relaxed in 2000. Job creation was
driven by strong growth in the service sector and export oriented manufacturing with the
latter being propelled by decisive steps at trade liberalization and in particular Vietnam’s
accession to the WTO in 2007. Capitalizing on its comparative advantage in labor intensive
manufacturing, Vietnam attracted a significant and steady inflow of foreign direct investment
(FDI). Growth was also underpinned by a significant demographic dividend in the form of a
growing labor force as well as investments in productive and inclusive infrastructure, effective
basic health care and education.

The purpose of this Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) is to identify priorities for
supporting Vietnam in sustaining its past success and reaching its own ambitious goals
for the future. In many respects Vietnam’s future looks bright. Growth has proven resilient,
despite the subdued global recovery. Real incomes continue to rise broadly and poverty
continues to fall. Numerous important trade agreements offer expanding opportunities.
Nonetheless, coasting along the current path will not lift the country to achieve its aspiration
of following the great success of economies such as South Korea and Taiwan, China. To
reach its very high potential Vietnam will need to overcome a series of emerging constraints.

First, Vietnam’s current model of inclusive growth and job creation will eventually
face limits. Economic growth-while more resilient than elsewhere-has moderated in recent
years compared to earlier years. Perhaps more importantly, the sources of growth have
shifted. Productivity growth, the major driver of GDP growth in the early years of Vietnam’s
transition, has diminished over the past decade. Labor productivity growth has stagnated.
The rate of return to investments have deteriorated, partly reflecting diminishing returns,
but also pointing to inefficiencies in the allocation of capital. Structural transformation - a
major source of productivity growth in earlier years-has slowed since the global financial
crisis. Meanwhile, within sector and firm productivity growth is dampened by a combination
of incomplete restructuring of state owned enterprises and a still infant domestic private
sector, dominated by small firms that lack the scale, access to technology and competitive
pressure needed to boost productivity. Moreover, as wages inevitably rise, Vietnam’s current
comparative advantage in low skill, labor intensive industries will start to dissipate.
2    Sustaining Success


Second, Vietnam faces both an unfinished agenda and new challenges for inclusion
and service delivery. Vietnam differs from many countries in that the poverty challenge
is now largely separate from that of shared prosperity. After a quarter century of poverty
reduction driven by broad-based growth, the remaining poor by the national poverty line will
soon be almost exclusively ethnic minorities, who make up only 14% of the population but
are projected to comprise 84% of the poor by 2020. Most ethnic minorities have historically
been detached from the country’s greater economic success and face social exclusion due
to discrimination and lack of ability in the Vietnamese language. A further inclusion challenge
is building on Vietnam’s relatively strong record on gender equality. Across broader issues
of service delivery, the country faces new challenges generated by the by the country’s
demographic and economic evolution. Rapid aging will place new demands on the social
assistance and health systems, while the growing middle class has higher expectations for
public services. Specifically while the basic education system is a worldwide standout, the
upper secondary and tertiary systems are not equipping students with the skills they need to
drive the next phase of inclusive growth.

Third, Vietnam needs to reinforce its rapid growth with productive use of its natural
assets and environment, and minimize the cost of pollution, unsustainable resource
use and climate change on growth. Unsustainable exploitation of water, land, fish, and
forests results in missed opportunities to more efficiently and competitively use and add
value to these natural assets and agriculture for growth, resilience, and household wellbeing.
This impacts 25 to 30 percent of the population for which agriculture is expected to remain
the primary source of income and livelihood. Furthermore, the current growth model, with
its increasing consumption of energy and limited enforcement of environmental regulations,
is imposing hidden costs from air and water pollution. More than 83 percent of the country’s
population is exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution, and current levels of water pollution
are a cause of water borne illnesses and deaths. Maintaining the current energy generation
and use trajectory (with growing reliance on coal) will substantially worsen air pollution.
Vietnam is also one of the most vulnerable countries to extreme weather events and long-
term climate change (e.g., sea level rise). The former has already resulted in 0.4 to 1.7
percent of GDP being lost over the past 25 years.

Finally, governance weaknesses are likely to become a drag on future growth and
social outcomes. By international measures, Vietnam performs reasonably well in terms of
government effectiveness, control of corruption, and rule of law but lags behind other lower
middle income countries in regulatory quality as well as voice and accountability. Vietnam’s
transition to modern market and government institutions remains incomplete. Private firms
compete on a playing field tilted by the heavy role of state owned and politically connected
enterprise. Weaknesses in public administration management and fragmentation hamper the
government’s ability to meet the public service demands of an increasingly complex economy.

Against this backdrop, Vietnam faces opportunities and risks for poverty reduction,
shared prosperity and environmental sustainability. On the one hand, persistent
ethnic minority poverty, rapid population aging, macroeconomic vulnerabilities, a growing
environmental footprint, and climate change all pose risks to Vietnam reaching its full
potential. On the other hand, key opportunities include reinvigorating structural transformation,
leveraging global integration, and reaping the benefits of rapid urbanization.

Mitigating risks and making most of the opportunities will require concerted actions
on a broad set of priorities. This broad agenda reflects the complexity of Vietnam’s
development challenges and opportunities. It posits that investments in a broad set of
productive endowments are needed for Vietnam to reach its aspirations. Effective market
institutions and good governance (institutional capital), quality infrastructure (physical
capital), a productive labor force with relevant skills (human capital) and sustainable use
of Vietnam’s abundant natural resource asset (natural capital) are all critical ingredients
of future growth and prosperity. While broad in terms of the areas covered, the analysis
suggest focused efforts within individual priority areas.

The first priority is targeted and tailored efforts to reduce poverty among ethnic
minorities. Defying worldwide trends, their rates of infant mortality have increased in recent
years, and malnutrition and secondary school dropout levels continue to be high. Targeted
efforts are needed to address the interlaced weaknesses in upper secondary education,
nutrition, health, and sanitation access for ethnic minorities. Given the strong dependence of
ethnic minorities on agriculture and natural resources, they will benefit from efforts to improve
resilience and productivity in these areas, including effective targeted approaches. Efforts can
employ successful behavioral approaches and rely in part on experimentation and evaluation
to determine what works. Enhancing ethnic voice can also make interventions more effective.

The second priority is delivering productive infrastructure and competitive cities.
Emerging infrastructure bottlenecks threaten to become a constraint to growth and job
creation, especially in high value added manufacturing and service sectors. Another key
challenge is to put in place the infrastructure to support economic activities, ease mobility,
and provide services in the country’s rapidly growing cities. Faced with these significant
needs on the one hand and tight financing constraints on the other hand, more efficient
public investment management coordination across levels of government are becoming
more critical. Integrated urban planning, effective land use management and coordinated
investments in municipal infrastructure are crucial to maximizing the economic benefits
of agglomeration while mitigating risks of congestion and costly urban sprawl. In addition,
Vietnam needs to create an enabling environment for more private sector participation in
infrastructure financing and delivery.

The third priority is strengthening economic management and market institutions.
While Vietnam has maintained macroeconomic stability, rising public debt and remaining
financial sector vulnerabilities need to be addressed to solidify macroeconomic stability and
resilience. Structural reforms also remain important to lift the medium term growth potential
of the economy. Institutional legacies, incomplete market institutions and a cumbersome
investment climate have become impediments to productivity growth, especially of the
domestic private sector. Firm surveys conducted in Vietnam confirm that a majority of firms
perceive government conduct to be uneven and favoring connected firms in the enforcement
of regulations, government procurement, and allocation of land use rights. These policy
distortions undermine efficiency and provide incentives to firms to engage in rent seeking
rather than productive activities. More efficient factor markets for capital and land, deeper
reforms of the state owned sector and a more levelled playing field and enabling environment
for the domestic private sector are important in this regard.
4    Sustaining Success


The fourth priority is transforming agriculture and use of natural assets. Agriculture
and natural assets will remain an important part of Vietnam’s development in the future. The
agriculture sector, however, needs to be transformed to enhance the influence of markets,
improved practices, and modern technologies on farmers’ decisions. A tighter link should be
formed between farmers and the expanding agro-food system. Vertical integration of value
chains, quality improvements, and investments in food processing will help create better
jobs and enhance rural livelihoods. Converting forest assets to higher value products, and
ensuring the sector responds to market signals for sustainable forests management will also
have positive economic and environmental impacts. In the water sector, the focus must be on
optimizing the use of water through better integrated planning and institutional coordination
over water management. All these transformations will require the government to play a
more facilitative role. Institutional arrangements that foster broad based innovation will also
be necessary. The public sector will have to encourage households to maximize economies
of scale, incentivize product, crop and species diversification, and reward environmental
stewardship.

The fifth priority is adapting service delivery in health, social protection, and education
to new expectation and an aging population. The health system needs a series of reforms
to upgrade the quality of care, deal with the rise of non-communicable diseases among the
aging population, and reduce high out-of-pocket costs. The pension system needs reforms to
stay fiscally sustainable while expanding to prevent rising poverty as the old-age population
doubles in size. Most critically, the education system needs to move to towards universal
upper secondary completion while at the same time making upper secondary and tertiary
more relevant to the job market and the country’s human capital needs. In regards to gender,
action is needed in three areas, starting with efforts to reduce the extremely high sex ratio at
birth which is a consequence of selective abortion and strong son preference. Other areas
for action on gender are reducing levels of domestic violence and boosting the participation
of women in leadership positions in both the public and private sectors.

The sixth priority is augmenting resilience to climate change and generating mitigation
benefits while reducing environmental pollution. Current and projected climate change
can set back development gains unless there is a concerted effort to enable climate smart
investments and plans. The effort must include reforms that reduce the vulnerability of
income and human capital to climate change, scale up approaches for disaster preparedness,
response and recovery, support climate smart investments, and promote coordinated
planning. Vietnam should also put in place measures that lower emissions from energy
production, reduce reliance on coal, and mitigate pollution from transport and industry. This
will reduce the significant costs of pollution and the irreversible damage from environmental
degradation that often accompanies rapid growth. These are all no regret measures as they
assist Vietnam to meet its nationally determined contribution to GHG emissions reduction
without compromising growth.

Finally, attention needs to be given to modernizing Vietnam’s core government
institutions to enable them to continue to support a rapidly developing middle income
economy. An effective government and public administration is an essential prerequisite
for delivering the other six priorities identified in this report. It requires capabilities to
mobilize resources, implement public investment and spending programs, promulgate
quality regulations and provide fair and transparent enforcement. Modernizing Vietnam’s
                                             Vietnam Systematic Country Diagnostic 2016        5


governance system will hinge on a continued evolution of the respective roles of the state
and the market to ensure independent regulation of product and factor markets and to
institutionally separate state and commercial functions. Issues of coordination, including
steps to strengthen the center of government and enhance intergovernmental fiscal and
administrative relations also remain critical to address fragmentation within and across levels
of government. Reforms of core, cross-cutting government systems, including public financial
management, revenue administration and public administration management are also critical
for enhancing state capabilities. Finally, transparency and voice in decision making, resource
allocation, regulatory reform and service delivery could be strengthened further to provide
the foundation for more accountability.

There are important synergies and linkages between these different priorities. For
example, education and skill development are an important prerequisite for economic growth
and especially gains in labor productivity. Closing the education gap between the poor and
non-poor is also a central element of the inclusion agenda, given the sharp drop in enrolment
rates among children of poorer households and ethnic minorities, in particular at secondary
and tertiary levels. But a skilled labor force can only be productive if there are a sufficient
number of quality jobs. Job creation in turn hinges on functioning market institutions, including
sound fiscal management, a stable and efficient financial system, and functioning markets for
land use rights that ensure the most productive firms and farms have access to the resources
they need to flourish and expand. At the same time, ensuring environmental sustainability
and mitigating climate change and disaster risks is key to preserving productive assets and
jobs, especially in natural resource-intensive sectors, including in agriculture, which remain
a key livelihood source, especially for the poor and bottom 40 percent.

INTRODUCTION
                                                                  Vietnam Systematic Country Diagnostic 2016                                         9


      Vietnam is a remarkable success story of rapid growth, poverty reduction and shared
      prosperity. Beginning with the launch of the Doi Moi reforms in the late 1980s Vietnam has
      sustained rapid economic growth rates that catapulted the country from the bottom ranks
      of poor nations to middle income status in one generation. With GDP growth averaging 5.5
      percent annually, real per capita GDP more than tripled between 1990 and 2014, and more
      than 40 million people were lifted out of poverty, using the national poverty line. Extreme
      poverty has been nearly eliminated.1 Unlike other fast growing economies, Vietnam has not
      experienced major increases in income inequality, with its income Gini coefficient (0.39 in
      2012) remaining substantially lower than China, Indonesia and Thailand. The country has
      achieved widely shared prosperity: average consumption of the bottom 40 percent of the
      consumption distribution (bottom 40) grew 6.8 percent annually over the period 1993-2014.
      Social indicators have also greatly improved, underpinned by wider access to basic services
      including broad access to primary education, health care, and vital infrastructure such as
      paved roads, electricity, piped water, and sanitation.

Past success has naturally led to ambitious goals for the future. According to the Socio-
Economic Development Plan (SEDP) for 2016 - 2020, the government aims to achieve a per
capita GDP of US$ 3,141 - 3,261 by 2020. This translates into 6.5 - 7 percent annual growth
over the next five years. The SEDP also lays out an ambitious agenda for inclusion and
service delivery which provides for continued drops in the poverty rate by 1.3-1.5 percent
point per year, expanding health insurance coverage to 80 percent of the population and
reducing child malnutrition rates to below 10 percent. The SEDP agenda for sustainability
consists of expanding clean water access to 95 percent of the urban population and 90
percent of the rural population, maintaining forest coverage of at least 42 percent, and a
series of goals associated with pollution control and waste management. The plan goes on
to reconfirm the government’s key priorities: macroeconomic stability, strengthened market
institutions, and investments in modern infrastructure and a skilled labor force.

While Vietnam has great potential to meet these ambitions, success cannot be taken for
granted. Vietnam now faces a new set of challenges to achieving further poverty reduction,
shared prosperity, and sustainability. The poverty reduction agenda now largely revolves
around the need to close the gap in poverty and living conditions among marginalized
groups, more remote populations, and, particularly, ethnic minorities, which constitute only
14 percent of the population, but 60 percent of the poor. The slow rate of poverty reduction
among ethnic minorities in recent years suggests that advances in overall growth will not be
sufficient to eliminate poverty among ethnic minorities. The poverty agenda is substantially
distinct from the broader agenda around shared prosperity. Vietnam’s employment-driven
economic growth model is expected to continue to drive shared prosperity at least in the near
term. However, relative to earlier years, the pace of economic expansion has moderated,
reflecting a cyclical slowdown, but also emerging structural constraints on a growth model
that has become increasingly reliant on growth in capital investments and the labor force
rather than productivity. Enhancing the prosperity of the Bottom 40 percent rests in large part
on the implementation of reforms to return the economy to a productivity led growth path.
In addition, there is a broader agenda around the sustainability of broadly inclusive public
service delivery in a context of the rapidly aging population and the rise of the middle class. In
parallel, ensuring sustainable growth will require improvements in the productivity of natural
resource - based sectors that, while accounting for a declining share of overall GDP, are
significant in some regions, where they represent slightly less than 50 percent of the income
among the rural poor. It will also require adapting to and mitigating climate change and
reducing the impact of pollution and degraded natural assets on labor and human capital.

The purpose of this Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) is to identify priorities for
supporting Vietnam in sustaining its past success and reaching its own ambitious goals
for the future. The SCD assesses achievements and emerging constraints and opportunities
for Vietnam. The SCD is designed to inform the upcoming Country Partnership Framework
by informing a set of focus areas to help accelerate progress toward the World Bank Group’s
twin goals of reducing poverty and achieving share prosperity in a sustainable manner.

The SCD is divided into two main parts. The first part provides the main diagnostic.
This part starts with an analysis of trends and patterns of poverty reduction and shared
prosperity. It then moves into discussing both accomplishments and emerging challenges
for Vietnam around three main themes: 1) inclusive growth and job creation, 2) inclusive
service delivery, and 3) sustainable management of natural assets and the environment. The
second part outlines and motivates the proposed priority areas for Vietnam. This second part
first identifies a set of risks and opportunities Vietnam faces in terms of progress towards
the twin goals in a sustainable manner which is recasting the main diagnostic results. It
then proposes six priority areas to mitigate the risks and make most of the opportunities
presented. The second part concludes with short section summarizing key governance
challenges that emerge as cross-cutting issues.

For cross-country benchmarking, a group of structural “peers” is used. The peers are
used to consider Vietnam’s performance in comparison to countries that share some of
Vietnam’s main characteristics. The criteria used to select the peers are as follows:

	    	 lower or upper middle income
	    	 not a fragile state
	    	 not classified as a commodity exporter
	    	population of at least 35 million. (This population cutoff corresponds to the 80th
        percentile among all countries, and Vietnam’s population of 90 million places it at the
        93rd percentile.)

Countries in this peers group are as follows: Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Mexico,
Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey. Due to varying data availability, not all the peers
are included in all comparisons.

The SCD rests on a foundation of a variety of recent analytical work, most importantly the
recently completed joint Government of Vietnam- World Bank Vietnam 2035 Report. While
the net was cast widely to encompass existing relevant analytical work, emphasis has been
given to World Bank sector studies and reports. In particular, the SCD builds upon the Vietnam
2035 report, which is a joint product of the World Bank and the Government of Vietnam.

1.	Trends and patterns of poverty reduction and shared prosperity
	
Over the long term, poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Vietnam has been driven
by a combination of inclusive economic growth and effective delivery of basic services.
Among the most important early reforms under Doi Moi was the de-collectivization of agriculture
in 1988 and the creation of tradable land use rights in 1993. The relatively equitable allocation
of land rights provided the basis for broad-based growth and a surge in poverty-reducing
agricultural production during the 1990s. In the 2000s, inclusive growth continued with the
rise of labor-intensive export-driven manufacturing and expanding employment opportunities
in service sectors. Equitable service delivery in health, education, and social protection as well
as widespread provision of water, sanitation, and electricity access has been a key element of
Vietnam’s shared prosperity story.

                    Vietnam has achieved tremendous poverty reduction

Vietnam has been a celebrated success in terms of poverty reduction. In 1993, shortly
after the start of the Doi Moi period, half of the population lived on less than $1.90-a-day (in
2011 PPP terms). By 2014 the fraction living in extreme poverty by this measure had fallen
to 2.8 percent. By the $3.10-a-day poverty line, 77 percent were poor in 1993, falling to 10.7
percent in 2012. Although comparisons over time are complicated by periodic changes in
measurement and survey methodology, these international poverty measure as well as the
MOLISA and GSO-WB poverty measures all show the same pattern of consistent, large
drops in poverty over time.2 Using the $3.10-a-day poverty line, poverty rates are Vietnam
are substantially below those of most peers.

Overall poverty reduction has been paired with a record of broadly shared prosperity
over the long term. The World Bank’s measure of shared prosperity is the income (or
consumption) growth of the bottom 40 percent of the population. By this measure, Vietnam
is one of the most outstanding cases of long-term shared prosperity worldwide. The average
consumption level of Vietnamese in the bottom 40 percent grew by 6.8 percent annually over
the period 1993-2014.

Shared prosperity has resulted in modest increases in inequality over time. The Gini
coefficient for 2014 is estimated to have been 34.8 in 2014 compared to 32.6 in 1993.
Vietnam’s Gini coefficient is substantially below the average among its peers. It is well-
known that household surveys often fail to capture the wealthy, and consequently survey-

the EAP Economic Update, and the EAP Poverty Portal. Due to small changes in methodology, they differ slightly from the
figures that will appear in PovcalNet and the World Development Indicators.

         based estimates may understate the true level of inequality and its growth over time. The
         number of super-rich nearly tripled over the period 2003-2013. This expansion of the ranks
         of the wealth is in line with that of other countries that have experienced similar levels of
         growth, and the prevalence of super-rich is no higher than in other countries at similar levels
         of income.3

         Large gains in both poverty reduction and shared prosperity have continued in recent
         years even in a context of lower economic growth. Over the period 2010-2014, the
         overall poverty rate (using the GSO-WB poverty rate) fell from 20.7 percent to 13.5 percent,
         corresponding to approximately 6.5 million people exiting from poverty in this period. Mean
         consumption of the bottom 40 percent and median consumption each grew by 5.5 percent,

         surveys and growth of the super-rich population was conducted for the Special Focus of the World Bank’s July 2014 Vietnam
         Taking Stock.
         4	The growth in mean consumption observed in the household survey 2010-14 is lower than that of both GDP per capita
         growth and private consumption growth in the national accounts. Deaton (2005) notes that a similar pattern is seen in most
         countries, and Ravallion (2003) observes “It is evident that when the levels or growth rates from these two data sources differ,
         there can be no presumption that the NAS is right and the surveys are wrong, or vice versa, since they are not really measuring
         the same thing, and both are prone to errors.”

While poverty reduction has continued in recent years, the nature of the poverty
reduction challenge is changing. The table above summarizes poverty information from
the most recent surveys for 2010-14 and reveals several points:

	 	The poverty headcount fell sharply over this short period, from 20.7 to 13.5 percent,
     meaning that more than 6 million people were lifted out of poverty.
	 	Poverty has become increasingly concentrated among ethnic minorities, with the share
     of the poor who are ethnic minorities rising from 47 to 60 percent.
	 	The decline of poverty among ethnic minorities stalled 2012-14.
	 	A growing share of the poor live in the Northern Mountains and Central Highlands—
     where ethnic minorities are concentrated—and a declining share are found in the Red
     River Delta (which includes Hanoi), the Southeast (including HCMC), and the Mekong
     Delta.
	 	In the face of declines in poverty in all other regions, the poverty rate has been essentially
     flat in the Central Highlands since 2010.
	 	The population is continuing to shift to shift from rural to urban areas at a rate of roughly
     1% of the overall population per year.
	 	Nine out of ten poor people in Vietnam live in rural areas.

Notes: “Major urban” areas are defined as urban communes of Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Hai Phong, Da Nang,
and Can Tho. Poverty calculations use the GSO-WB poverty line. The “near poor” population was estimated
using a near poor line is 30% higher than the GSO-WB poverty line.

The poor, the near poor, and the bottom 40 percent are found across the country but
are substantially concentrated in rural areas. The table above provides a snapshot for
2014 with a fuller breakdown of where various economic subgroups are located. The groups
shown in this table include not only the poor but also the near-poor, the non-poor, the bottom
40 percent and the top 60 percent of the socioeconomic distribution (all measured using
consumption data). The “near poor” using the definition employed here constitute 11 percent
of the overall population. Less well-off Vietnamese are substantially concentrated in rural
areas: 82 percent of the near poor and 84 percent of the bottom 40 are located there. Only
very small numbers are located in the major urban centers (urban communes of the 5 largest
cities), which are home to 2 percent of the poor, 4 percent of the near poor, and 3 percent of
the bottom 40 percent. Large portions of the near poor are found in the Red River Delta and
the Mekong Delta regions. Seventy percent of the bottom 40 are located in four regions: Red
River Delta, Eastern Northern Mountains, North Central Coast, and Mekong Delta.

District-level poverty maps from 2010 and 2014 illustrates the changing geographical
profile of poverty. It is evident in the maps that little change has taken place in poverty rates in
the Central Highlands region. The spread of dark green shades in the Red River Delta, Central
Coast, Southeast, and Mekong River Delta shows the decline of poverty to low levels in those
areas. It is important to note that because population density is also high in those areas, they
are still home to substantial absolute numbers of poor despite their low poverty rates.

Over 2010-14, nearly half the poor moved out of poverty. The table below shows movements
over the period 2010-2014 between three groups: the poor, the near poor, and those that are
neither poor nor near poor. This analysis is based on a panel of households followed over time
between 2010 and 2014. A breakdown is shown by poverty status at the start of the period.
More than half (54 percent) of the poor in 2010 were still poor in 2014, while 22 percent had
moved to near poor, and 24% had moved up out of the ranks of both the poor and the non-
poor. Among the near poor, 17 percent had fallen back into poverty, while 57 percent moved

out of the ranks of the near poor.5 An analysis of correlates of changes in consumption (not
shown) finds few variables that predict these changes. One notable exception is that ethnic
minority households saw much smaller increases on average. Controlling for region and the
household head’s baseline demographic and employment characteristics, ethnic minority
households in the bottom 40 percent had consumption growth that was 12.6 percent points
lower than that of Kinh and Hoa households.

5	An important caveat to this discussion is that the movements here are in part driven by measurement error. The impact of
measurement error is uncertain. Classical measurement error would exaggerate movements, suggesting that these results be
taken as upper bounds on the actual rate of movement across categories.

consumption that is made up of consumption of goods produced by the household.

Across all socioeconomic and geographic groups, there are diverse sources of income.
Income from family farming (agriculture excluding wages) accounts for a quarter (24 percent)
of income for the average household nationally and 46% of income for the poor. Notably,
wage income is substantial for all groups; wages constitute 34% of income of the poor, and
most wage income for all groups is for non-agricultural work. Remittances (including gifts and
other private transfers from both domestic and international sources) are a substantial share
(8-10%) of income for almost all groups, with the notable exception of ethnic minorities, who
have much lower migration rates. Public transfers constitute 6% of income for the poor and
lower shares for higher income groups. A separate calculation shows that own consumption
(consumption of goods produced by the household such as rice) constitutes a large share of
household consumption for poorer groups. Specifically, own consumption is on average 35%
of consumption for the poor and 26% of consumption for the bottom 40%.

By 2020, nearly all remaining poor in Vietnam will be members of ethnic minority
groups. Poverty-growth elasticity calculations illustrate the very focused nature of Vietnam’s
poverty challenge. In recent years—as over the long term—economic growth has been strong
associated with overall poverty reduction. This relationship is usefully summarized by the
growth elasticity of poverty. Over the 4-year period from 2010 to 2014, the growth elasticity
of poverty was reasonably high at 1.8, and over the most recent 2 year period, it was 2.3.
However, the growth elasticity of ethnic minority poverty was only 0.65 for 2010-2014 and just
0.02 for 2012-2014.6 If current patterns continue, by 2020, 84% of remaining poor, defined
using the GSO-WB national poverty line, will be members of ethnic minority groups.7

In summary, both over the long term and in the more recent period, Vietnam is a standout
in both poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Vietnam since 1990 has been perhaps
the signature case in the developing world of “a rising tide lifts all boats.” The drivers of these
achievements were a combination of rapid growth and job creation, inclusive service delivery,
especially in health and education and use of Vietnam’s abundant natural resources. In the
subsequent section these pathways and emerging opportunities and constraints associated
with them will be analyzed in more detail.

2.	Inclusive growth and job creation

Inclusive growth and job creation, especially of higher productivity jobs, has been one
of the pathways to shared prosperity and poverty reduction in Vietnam. As shown in
the previous section, wages account for the largest share of income among the bottom
forty and the poor. Overall, Vietnam’s impressive growth spurt over the past three decades
was underpinned by the creation of over 20 million new, largely private sector jobs in labor-
intensive manufacturing and services. While the vast majority, especially of the poor and
lower income groups remain self-employed or work on family farms, expanding opportunities
for productive employment and especially better-paid formal wage employment is one of the
pathways to income growth and upward social mobility.



6	The growth elasticity of overall poverty is calculated here as the percentage decline in the overall poverty rate divided by
the percentage change in GDP per capita. The growth elasticity of ethnic minority poverty is calculated here as the percentage
decline in the poverty rate among ethnic minorities divided by the percentage change in GDP per capita.
7	This figure is based on a simple projection, assuming constant growth in GDP per capita and constant poverty elasticities,
calculated separately for ethnic minorities and the Kinh/Hoa majority. A similar concentration of the poor among ethnic minorities

2.1	Drivers of rapid economic growth

Almost thirty years after embarking on the transition from a centrally planned to a
socialist-oriented market economy, Vietnam has emerged as a dynamic middle-income
economy. In 1986, Vietnam, then one of the poorest countries in the world, launched the
economic renewal program known as Doi Moi. This marked the beginning of Vietnam’s
remarkable development success story. Per capita income has more than tripled since 1990,
and during this period Vietnam enjoyed one of the highest sustained GDP growth rates in
the World, second only to China. Despite moderation in recent years, Vietnam’s growth
record remains as one of the fast growing lower-middle income countries, outperforming
all structural comparator countries, except China and Bangladesh. This rapid economic
expansion of Vietnam’s economy has been underpinned by four key transformations: 1) an
institutional transformation from plan to market, 2) a structural transformation from agrarian
to manufacturing and services, 3) a spatial transformation from rural to urban, and 4) a
transformation from a large closed to an open export driven and globally integrated economy.

First, Vietnam pursued a gradual transition from a centrally planned economy to a
socialist-oriented market economy. Initial reforms decentralized decision making, liberalized
prices and increased the autonomy of individual firms, and largely replaced central planning
with market-based resource allocation. Trade and foreign exchange controls were lifted,
setting the stage for country’s reintegration into the global economy. Early reforms of land
use rights provided the basis for renewed agricultural growth. Driven by successive rounds
of restructuring, liquidation, divestment and equitization, the number of enterprises fully
owned by the state fell from over 12,000 in 1989 to fewer than 750 in 2014. Private sector
enterprises—both domestic and foreign—sprung up since the early 1990s and especially
after enactment of the Enterprise Law in 2000 which legalized private firm creation. There
are over 650,000 domestic private enterprises registered today, compared to only 40,000 in
1999 and virtually none in 1990. The private sector has become Vietnam’s main engine of
economic growth, underpinned by a shift of productive resources to private enterprise. The
non-state sector- including private, household, collective and foreign invested enterprises-
on average contributed about 70 percent of Vietnam’s growth over the last five years. For
most years, growth rates of the non-state sector have exceeded growth in the state owned
sector. Evidence at both the macro and micro levels confirm that there has been a major
reallocation of production resources –both labor and capital- to private sector enterprises.
Private sector enterprises have absorbed a growing share of banking sector credit, they
have become more capital intensive, accounting for a rising share of investment and they
have been the prime job creators. This shift in resource allocation has underpinned the rapid
expansion of private sector.

Second, economic growth was driven by a structural transformation from a largely
agrarian economy to one based on manufacturing and services. In Vietnam, as in other
East Asian economies, structural transformation has been at the heart of Vietnam’s growth
model. The shift out of agriculture has been dramatic, with the sector’s share in GDP falling
from over 40 percent in the late 1980s to less than 20 percent of GDP today. The share of
manufacturing in GDP –after an initial dip- has been rising steadily since the early 1990s,
leveling off at slightly less than 20 percent in the 2000s. Equally, service sector share has
increased from just over 30 percent 1980s to slightly more than 40 percent today. These
sectoral trends in GDP have been broadly matched by those in employment. Rapid job
creation and rising wages in manufacturing and services has pulled an expanding share of
Vietnam’s work force away from agricultural production. This shift in employment to higher
productivity sectors contributed about 40 percent of the labor productivity growth during
1990-2010. This rise of manufacturing and services was accompanied by gains in agricultural
productivity in some regions of Vietnam which were underpinned by liberalized land use
rights, increased mechanization and use of more modern production inputs.

Third, Vietnam’s economic geography was reshaped by rapid urbanization. Coinciding
with Vietnam’s growth acceleration and structural transformation, the country has urbanized
rapidly as people moved from farming and related rural activities into more productive
industrial and service jobs. In 1986, the country had fewer than 13 million urban residents; it
now has 30 million. While accounting for only about one third of its population, urban areas—
foremost its two major cities Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City and their surrounding areas—are
estimated to account for over half of Vietnam’s GDP. By generating agglomeration economies
and fostering innovation, Vietnam’s cities and their surrounding areas have become drivers

of rapid growth and contributed to the industrialization and modernization of the country.
Labor productivity is higher in cities and especially in the two metropolitan areas, reflected in
higher wage premiums (9 percent in Hanoi and 16 percent in Ho Chi Minh City) in addition
to the 8 percent general wage premium for urban areas over rural areas.8

       Rapid export growth and diversification has been a driver of

Fourth, Vietnam has successfully integrated into the global economy. Largely isolated
from international trade and investment flows at the onset of the reforms, Vietnam has become
a major destination for inflows of foreign direct investment and a thriving export economy.
With a trade ratio (exports plus imports) of 170 percent of GDP, Vietnam is today one of
the most open economies in the World, strongly integrated in global value and production
chains. This process has been underpinned by decisive trade liberalization. Vietnam
acceded to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2007 and has signed 15 bilateral and
multilateral trade agreements. Capitalizing on its comparative advantages in labor-intensive
manufacturing, Vietnam attracted significant FDI which has expanded dramatically from 2.8
percent of GDP in the early 1990s to 14 percent of GDP in 2014. Meanwhile, exports grew
at a blistering annual rate of more than 18 percent over the past two decades with imports
trailing not far behind (reflecting high import content, significantly outperforming not only

global trade growth, but also regional peers. Perhaps more importantly, driven by foreign
invested manufacturing and growing integration in global value chains, Vietnam’s export
basket underwent a spectacular diversification. Vietnam has become the second largest
rice exporter in the world, as well as the second largest exporter of coffee, the top exporter
of pepper and cashew, and an important supplier of fish and shellfish. In manufacturing,
garment, footwear, and more recently, electronics assembly have grown at extremely rapid
rates. Manufacturing exports now account for 84 percent, up from a little more than half in
2005. The growth of electronic equipment manufacturing —largely mobile phones — has
been exponential as global companies like Samsung and LG have commenced assembly
operations. Higher value exports, namely phones, computers and related components
increased from less than 5 percent ten years ago to almost one third now. By the same token,
the share of primary commodities decreased steadily. In particular, oil exports as a share of
total exports have fallen significantly in the last decade—from nearly 23 percent in 2005 to
2.5 percent in 2015.

Finally, Vietnam’s growth performance has also been underpinned by significant
infrastructure development. Over the past decade, Government capital expenditures have
averaged almost 8 percent of GDP annually. In addition, SOEs, including large infrastructure
providers –including the electricity company EVN- have invested about 5 percent of GDP
annually. This remarkably high level of investment has resulted in a rapid expansion of
infrastructure stocks and improved access, enabling Vietnam to provide basic infrastructure
access to its fast growing industrial and manufacturing base. Power generation, transmission,
and distribution capacity has been scaled up to meet rapidly rising electricity demand
with Vietnam’s per capita electricity consumption more than tripling over the past decade.
Concurrently, the total length of paved roads also increased more than three-fold from 30,000
km in 2000 to about 110,000 km in 2012. To keep pace with rapidly growing container trade
(which expanded at a staggering average annual rate of 16.8 percent between 2000 and
2011), Vietnam also developed its seaports and marine terminals, especially around its main
industrial centers of HCMC in the South and Haiphong in the North, alongside their respective
satellite ports of Cai Mep and Cai Lan. Meanwhile, investment in rural infrastructure, foremost
rural roads and irrigation systems contributed to inclusion and poverty reduction by boosting
agricultural productivity and connecting farmers and rural communities to larger markets.
Available evidence suggests that Vietnam’s infrastructure quality is commensurate with
Vietnam’s income level and relatively few firms in Vietnam currently identify infrastructure as
main constraints to growth.9

2.2	More and better jobs

Vietnam’s impressive growth spurt created 20 million new jobs. Overall, the employment
elasticity of growth has been around 0.4 percent over the past 20 years. Every 1 percent
increase in output has been associated with roughly 160 thousand new jobs. Vietnam’s
economic transformation has been associated with dramatic shifts in labor demand. Of the
approximately 20 million new jobs about half were added in service sectors and 5 million
jobs were created in manufacturing. The vast majority of these jobs were created in the
domestic private sector which accounts for 15 million jobs while the FDI sector –virtually
non-existent in 1990- now employs 1.6 million workers. While jobs in Vietnam were once
characterized entirely by family farming, collectives, and state-owned enterprises (SOEs),
over time employment opportunities have shifted towards manufacturing and services,
household enterprises outside agriculture, and private domestic and foreign-owned firms
In 1989, 71 percent of employed Vietnamese worked primarily in agriculture, fishing, or
forestry, and private employment was almost non-existent. Today the share of agriculture,
fishing, and forestry has declined to 46 percent of jobs, and only 1 in 10 workers holds a job
with the state sector.

On the demand side, job creation in Vietnam has been driven by both entry of new
firms and expansion of existing ones. Firm level evidence suggests that net job creation
(job creation minus job destruction) in the wage sector is largely driven by entry of new firms
–including domestic and FDI firms with firm entry has accounted for more than half of the
jobs created during 2005-13. Growth among existing firms also played a role in expanding
employment opportunities but job creation is offset by incumbent firms shedding labor due
to downsizing. There is some variation across different types of firms. Jobs in the domestic
private sector firm are mostly created in small, relatively young firms, although small scale
expansion also plays a role. In contrast larger firms and large and medium sized firms are
the main job creators in the SOE and FDI sector, respectively. Overall, these patterns reflect
the structural features of Vietnam’s enterprise sector where the domestic private sector is
dominated by small and micro enterprises with relatively few larger establishments.

On the supply side of the labor market Vietnam benefited from steady labor force
growth which was compounded by early investment in human capital. In addition to the
growing working-age population which boosted labor supply by an average of 2.5 percent
per year over the past two decades, expanding educational attainment of the workforce
has contributed to the shifts in the labor market. Vietnam’s early effort to promote access to
primary education for all and to ensure its quality through centrally setting minimum quality
standards has paid off. The share of Vietnamese without or with only primary education
has declined significantly and more than half of the workers, especially in professional and
technical occupations, now have secondary and higher degrees.10

Despite expanding human capital, demand for well-educated workers remains strong.
While the large increase in the number of lower and upper secondary graduates has eroded the
wage premium at these lower levels, is particularly noticeable at the top end of the education
distribution, where the number of college graduates has expanded significantly but not enough
to keep up with demand. While upper secondary graduates in wage work could expect to earn
only 10 percent more than lower secondary school graduates, high returns to vocational, and
especially college and university education indicate that workers with advanced education
levels remain in short supply. This is true despite ample room for improvement of the quality of
tertiary education. Indeed, the World Bank Enterprise Survey 2015 identifies skill shortages as
one of the top three constraints to business expansion in Vietnam.

A growing share of the labor force holds wage jobs. Analysis of the labor force survey
(LFS) suggests that wage employment has increased from only 32% of the total labor force
in 2007 to 38% of the labor force in 2014. The increase in wage employment was driven by
wage employment with contract, especially in private domestic and FDI firms. Formal sector
wage employment in total labor force increased from only 18% in 2007 to 23% in 2015.11
Formal employment (with contract) in the wage sector is associated not only with higher
incomes but a number of other benefits such as health and social insurance. Education level
matter significantly in terms of access to wage and in particular formal wage jobs.

Women and ethnic minorities are less likely to hold wage jobs and are paid less.
Controlling for observable characteristics, women are 9% less likely to hold a wage job than



11	In the wage sector, there is a large overlap in the characteristics usually associated with formal jobs. Out of all workers in
the wage sector, 59% have a written contract, 51% have health insurance and 50.2% have social insurance. Almost 50% of the
total wage workforce reports to have a written contract and be covered by both health and social insurance, while 38.3% of the
workforce in this sector reports to be employed in a job with none of these characteristics.

men, and ethnic minorities are 12% less likely than members of the Kinh and Hoa ethnic
group to hold wage jobs. These differences have been roughly flat over time. Among those
who hold wage jobs, ethnic minorities face a “wage penalty” of 7%. The wage penalty faced
by women is 13% and has steadily declined in recent years.12

The forthcoming Country Gender Assessment provides a highly focused analysis of
gender and employment.13 It notes that women form a large share of unpaid family workers,
particularly in agriculture. The Assessment also points out that only 6 percent of households
in the poorest quintile have access to tap water at home and that women and girls are typically
responsible for obtaining and treating water. Women with wage jobs have more favorable
working conditions than men on average, reflecting the fact that a large share work either in
the private sector or foreign-owned firms. Women with wage jobs are more likely to have a
written contract than men with wage jobs. The study also notes that employment growth has
been substantial in manufacturing sectors that have employed substantial shares of women
since their inception (such as garments) and also in sectors that have become increasingly
intensive in the employment of women over time (notably electronics and mother vehicles),
suggesting that the growth of manufacturing is expanding job opportunities for women. The
Assessment also highlights the gap between female and male earnings.

Human capital investment is not only a driver of aggregate growth, but also determines
pathways to prosperity. At the individual level, the education level is strongly correlated
with the probability of wage employment and especially formal wage employment which
tends to pay higher wages. As such, enabling higher educational attainment is pathway to
achieving shared prosperity. Against this background, uneven access across income groups
at the upper secondary and higher levels is not only constraining skilled labor supply but also
poses constraints to social mobility.

More productive jobs pay higher real wages and are thus a critical precondition for
rising living standards. Differences in wage growth within and across countries can be
traced largely to different rates of labor productivity growth. Indeed, firms with higher labor
productivity in Vietnam tend to pay higher average wages to their employees. The issues
of creating an environment conducive to labor productivity growth is therefore intrinsically
linked to the question of sustaining progress in achieving the World Bank’s twin goals of
reducing poverty and boosting share prosperity.

Creating more and more productive jobs is therefore the cornerstone of the inclusive
growth strategy. On the demand side, further job creation will require Vietnam to sustain
high growth rates which is in turn related to the ability to create an environment conducive to
higher productivity growth, driven by a dynamic private sector and further global integration.
On the supply side, the agenda is about enabling a responsive education system, especially at
secondary and post-secondary levels (vocational and tertiary) that can provide qualifications
and skills that are relevant to evolving labor market demands. Boosting skilled labor supply
and human capital accumulation is particularly important against the background of slowing
labor force growth. After achieving universal primary education, Vietnam is now moving
towards universal secondary education. Institutionally, reforms to education governance,
financing and delivery mechanisms, including more provider autonomy, competition and
involvement of private providers can help boost efficiency, quality and relevance.

2.3	Emerging constraints to the current growth model

Vietnam’s economic success notwithstanding, there are concerns about whether the
current growth model can sustain past performance. Economic growth has moderated
in recent years. During 2008-14 GDP growth averaged about 6 percent annually, still almost
two percentage points above the average growth rate of lower middle income economies
during this period (4.1 percent). This slow-down partly reflects cyclical factors and a weaker
global economy but there are also emerging structural constraints that may be holding back
Vietnam’s growth. Addressing these constraints is a crucial precondition for Vietnam to meet
its full potential not only in terms of aggregate economic growth but also in terms of tackling
remaining poverty challenges and achieving shared prosperity.

In recent years, Vietnam experienced recurrent macroeconomic and financial sector
turbulence. While volatility originated from external developments—an unprecedented
economic boom caused by massive foreign capital inflows, followed by an external demand
shock triggered by the global financial crisis—the episodes of economic disturbances were
exacerbated by sharp swings in the macroeconomic policy stance, erratic credit growth and
asset price bubbles in the real estate sector. Inflation spiked twice in 2009 and 2011 coinciding
with a marked slow-down in growth. While macroeconomic stability has been restored the
economy still suffers from vulnerabilities built up as a by-product of past crises. Lingering
problems in asset quality and unresolved non-performing loans (NPLs) remain a drag on
the bank’s balance sheets and pose a risk to macroeconomic stability and undermine the
ability of banks to provide long term financing needed for development. Indeed, access to
finance is the most common constraint to business expansion, cited in the 2015 World Bank
Enterprise Survey. At the same time, the need to address large fiscal deficits and rapidly
rising public debt will constrain public finances in years to come.

Economic growth has not just decelerated but the underlying growth model changed.
While productivity growth was the main driver of GDP growth in the early years of Vietnam’s
transition, the contribution from productivity growth declined drastically over the past
decade. Growth accounting across a range of assumptions presents a picture of generally
low rates of total factor productivity growth in the last decade. Instead growth became almost
exclusively reliant on factor accumulation, underpinned by a rapidly expanding labor force
and high investment rates, especially in the run up to the 2008/09 global financial crisis.
While this growth model has delivered solid growth rates, there are reasons to believe that
the accumulation of labor and capital is waning in its power to propel future growth.

Vietnam’s demographic dividend is starting to dissipate. In recent decades Vietnam
reaped a significant demographic dividend. Since 1990 almost 25 million Vietnamese
have come of working age. This greater labor supply translated into average annual labor
force growth of about 2.5 percent, almost doubling Vietnam’s work force between 1990
and 2013. Indeed, about one third of Vietnam’s historical average GDP growth rate (6.7
percent) can be attributed to the expanding work force while two-thirds traditionally came
from labor productivity growth. However, looking ahead, this demographic dividend will start
to dissipate and potential employment growth is expected to decline due to demographic
factors. In coming decades Vietnam will become one of the fastest ageing societies in the
world with significant implications for the labor market, fiscal policies, public services and
growth. While the working age population and labor force will continue to expand for another
two decades, the rate of increase will be markedly lower--about half of the recent historical
average. In fact the working age population is already in decline as a share of the population.
Furthermore, the already quite high labor force participation rate (around 77 percent) implies
limited reserves to boost aggregate labor supply.

This means Vietnam will need to boost labor productivity to sustain high growth. GDP
per employed person more almost tripled between 1990 and 2015—reflecting a combination
of improved agricultural efficiency and a rapid shift of employment out of low productivity
agriculture into higher productivity non-farm jobs. However, following a bout of labor
productivity growth after the initial liberalization of the economy, Vietnam’s labor productivity
growth has levelled off just shy of 4 percent over the past decade. While this is close to other
emerging economies in Asia at Vietnam’s current productivity level (and high by comparison
with emerging economies in other parts of the world), it is less than half of China’s labor
productivity growth. Against the backdrop of slowing labor force growth, the current rate of
labor productivity growth would not be sufficient to lift Vietnam’s potential growth rate to the
levels targeted in the SEDP.

Vietnam’s high savings and investment rate has been an increasingly important
driver of economic growth. Because it is a relatively capital-scarce economy, Vietnam’s
growth path has been underpinned by a rapid accumulation of the capital stock. Vietnam’s
investment rate more than tripled from less 10 percent in the early 1990s to now about 30
percent of GDP, markedly higher than the average investment rate of 23 percent in other
lower middle income economies. Capital accumulation became a major growth driver,
accounting for about one third of Vietnam’s GDP growth over the past decade. The growth
in investment has been faster in the private sector than in the state sector, with the domestic
private sector being the strongest performer (both in absolute and in relative terms). As a
result, the composition of investment has changed dramatically since the acceleration of
economic reforms. In 2001, the state sector accounted for almost 60 percent of total capital
accumulation in Vietnam, with the rest divided roughly equally between FDI companies and
the domestic private sector. While public investment, by both the general government and
state owned enterprises remains high–together accounting for about 40 percent of total
investment, it was rapid growth of domestic private sector investment, fueled by rapid credit
growth (about 40 percent of investment) and significant and rising FDI inflows (about 20
percent of investment) that boosted Vietnam’s investment rate. Indeed, firm level evidence
confirms rising capital intensity of domestic private sector firms.

38     Sustaining Success


Meanwhile, the rates of returns to investments have deteriorated, partly reflecting
diminishing returns, but also pointing to inefficiencies in the allocation of capital.
Declining returns to investment mean that it takes more and more investment to generate
the same growth impact. Returns are expected to decrease gradually as the capital stock of
the economy expands and the most urgent gaps are addressed. However, the rapid decline
experienced by Vietnam is unlikely to be the sole effect of a relative abundance of capital;
especially because infrastructure and capital needs remain substantial in Vietnam. Rather
it is at least in part a question of whether additional capital is being allocated to the sectors,
activities and projects that generate the highest returns.

Investment from the state budget and SOEs is fragmented. While sustained public
investment has led to rapid expansion of infrastructure, investment efficiency is hampered by
lack of coordination in an increasingly devolved intergovernmental fiscal system. Provincial
governments -which now account for about 80 percent of total state budget investment- and
SOE tend to select and undertake their own infrastructure projects often in isolation, without
employing a strategic approach linked to national priorities and with little regard to supply-
demand considerations. Against the backdrop of increasingly tight fiscal constraints a focus
on efficiency, value for money and asset management is crucial to enable effective public
investment in growth enhancing infrastructure.

Meanwhile the growth performance of the domestic private sector has not been
commensurate with its command of an increasing share of capital and investment. Private
sector firms have become increasingly capital-intensive over time, yet returns on capital have
eroded–albeit private sector capital productivity seems to remain above the state owned sector.14
Distorted price signals have caused capital to flow into speculative sectors and fueled asset price
bubbles, rather being deployed in expanding productive capacities. For example, real estate
investment expanded by 29 percent per year on average in real terms over the last decade while
average annual output growth in the sector was a meager 5.2 percent over the same period.




14	Notably, the recent credit boom was driven by an expansion of lending to the private sector. While the credit portfolio of
some SOCBs remains heavily tilted towards the SOE sector, the overall share of SOE in total credit has declined in recent years
from about 30 percent in 2007 to around 16 percent. This is mirrored in firm level data, that suggests that private sector firms
–which had traditionally been subject to financing constraints - significantly increased their leverage ratios (consistent with the
rising share of the domestic private sector in total investment during this period). However, rather than financing productivity
and growth enhancing investments, a large portion of lending went into speculative sectors, such as real estate. Meanwhile
some poor performing SOEs remain highly leveraged, poses significant exposure to the SOE sector and a continued risk to
the banking sector.

Moreover with the investment rate already high, further accelerating capital stock
growth is becoming challenging. Vietnam’s savings and investment rates are high by
international comparison. While investment is expected to remain an important growth driver,
raising the investment rate substantially above the current levels is not likely to be feasible,
especially since domestic private and public investment are constrained by crisis legacies,
financial sector weaknesses, and relatively high public debt. Rather the focus should be on
providing incentives for higher investment efficiency to revive returns both in the public and
the private sector.

Declining productivity growth is a symptom, rooted in rising inefficiencies in resource
allocation and deployment in the economy. Productivity growth reflects patterns of
resource allocation across enterprises, between and within industries. This points to deeper
questions about what is holding back a more efficient allocation and use of Vietnam’s
abundant production factors.

While the potential productivity gains from reallocating resources across sectors remain
substantial, structural transformation has slowed. With agriculture still accounting for
almost half the labor force, and with significantly lower labor productivity than the industrial
and services sectors, future gains from structural transformation remain substantial (even if
not as great as before). Labor productivity in agriculture is only about 40 percent of average
labor productivity, in part due to underemployment. How rapidly structural transformation will
continue will mostly depend on the pace of job creation in services and manufacturing. The
contrasting experiences of other countries in the region is instructive. China had a similar
share of agriculture in employment (47%) in 2004, yet by 2011 this had fallen to 35%. In
contrast, it took two decades (1993-2012) for agriculture’s share in employment to fall from
46% to 32% in the Philippines. Slow change is also evident in Thailand with the share of
agriculture in employment falling only from 46% to 40% between 2001 and 2012. Outside
East Asia, Turkey nearly halved its agricultural employment share (from 47 to 24%) over
two decades (1990 to 2010).15 Sufficient job creation in services and manufacturing is a
precondition to generate demand and pull more workers from agriculture. However, tracking
slower manufacturing output growth since 2008, the rate of job creation has slowed down
as well. Manufacturing jobs expanded at about same rate as labor force growth keeping the
share of manufacturing employment in total employment flat at around 20 percent over the
past 5 years.

At the same time, labor productivity in agriculture remains low. Aggregate land productivity
(measured as value added per ha of agricultural land), increased rapidly in the 1990 and is higher
than most regional peers. However, aggregate patterns for labor productivity in agriculture
show a less favorable picture with both productivity levels16 and growth rates lagging behind
most regional peers, although there is a lot of variation within Vietnamese agriculture across
regions and farming systems. Productivity of other inputs, including water, fertilizers and
pesticides also point to some inefficiencies when benchmarked against regional comparators.
The relative resource intensity of Vietnam’s agriculture is a concern both in terms of growth
and competitiveness but also from the point of view of sustainability (discussed in more detail
under the third pillar). Administrative controls on land, and direct state involvement in both
input and output markets, were important factors in the sector’s stability and inclusive growth
over recent decades. Yet these policies and institutional legacies seem to now be delaying
further transformation of the sector. Agricultural land consolidation remains at an early phase
due in large part to a lack of functioning land and land lease markets. Shifts in land use
patterns (towards higher value crops) have also been relatively slow reflecting administrative
land use controls that favor rice production. Land consolidation and more market driven land
use will be critical to enable mechanization and crop diversification and hence productivity
gains. In parallel tackling the challenges of food quality and safety, factor productivity, pollution,
resource scarcity, and climate change, will rest heavily on a dynamic agricultural innovation
system that is capable of generating responsive technical and management solutions, and
ensuring their diffusion across the sector.

Outside agriculture, within sector and firm productivity growth was dampened by a
combination of incomplete restructuring of the state owned enterprises and a weak
domestic private sector. Over the past two decades, Vietnam has gradually reduced the
footprint of state owned enterprises in the economy. While their relative importance has
declined significantly (reflecting a combination of restructuring of the SOE sector and rapid
growth of private sector enterprises), state owned enterprises still account for about one-
third of all business assets and one quarter of output in the enterprise sector. SOEs remain
dominant players in several sectors including fertilizer, coal, utilities, banking, rubber and
plastics, and construction sectors. Many SOE enjoy preferential access to resources and
may also benefit from favorable regulatory frameworks and enforcement. Natural resource
producers like Petro Vietnam and Vinacomin have exclusive access to mineral reserves.
Others, such as EVN, Vinalines and Vietnam Airlines operate in highly regulated markets,
giving them significant advantages over private and foreign-invested companies. Fragmented
and sometimes overlapping responsibilities in the management of SOEs and weak corporate
governance all undermine efficient use of resources in the state owned sector and the SOE
sector has been lagging performance. Growth rates have been consistently lower than private
sector, although the gap has narrowed substantially since global financial crisis. Controlling
for capital intensity –reflecting the fact that many SOE are capital intensive- shows that the
average labor productivity of SOEs is about 40 percent lower than the private sector. As
such, weak productivity of SOEs continues to act as a drag on economic performance.




16	In part lower labor productivity may be caused by statistical measurement problems related to underemployment and
seasonal employment in agriculture which may result in over reporting of labor input in the sector (compared to other sectors).
42    Sustaining Success


Despite having become a major engine of growth and job creation, the domestic private
sector is facing its own set of constraints. Following the 2002 enterprise law there has
been rapid private firm creation. However most domestic private firms are small. Household
enterprises and corporates account for over 70 percent of private sector firms. Production is
dominated by family farms in agriculture and small workshops in manufacturing. Most of these
firms are inward oriented, serving the domestic market. Only about 17 percent of domestic
private sector firms are directly engaged in export activities. Many of these firms simply
lack the scale, access to technology and competitive pressure needed to boost productivity
and few of these enterprises ever reach medium size. As a result, larger, technologically
more advanced firms engaging in manufacturing and higher value services linked to export
markets and global value chains are largely missing. Most of the few Vietnam’s existing
medium and large domestic firms –many of them either SOEs or closely connected to the
state sector —are engaged mostly in property development and finance where they are able
to capitalize on preferential access to state-controlled land, capital or licensees.

Despite the country’s exceptionally strong export performance, the domestic value
contribution in key exports is low and the linkages of domestic firms to global value
chains are weak. In key exports, Vietnam’s domestic value added is relatively shallow. For
overall manufacturing domestic value added is only about 51 percent but it is even lower
(about 30 percent for high value products such as electronics). In part this reflects the nature
of cross border supply chains and in part a dual track economy. On the one hand there are
export oriented foreign invested firms, which are closely integrated in global supply chains.
While accounting for less than 10 percent of Vietnam’s GDP, these enterprises produce 70
percent of Vietnam’s export value and account for 60 percent of its imports. On the other

hand, there are domestic firms which are largely inward oriented and serving the domestic
market. The linkages between these two segments are very limited. As such, the FDI sector
operates in isolation rather than serving as a broader catalyst for growth, with limited spillovers
to the domestic private sector in the form of increased demand for inputs, access to new
technology and managerial techniques, demonstration effects and agglomeration benefits.
The expanding labor intensive manufacturing sector has not stimulated the development
of supplier industries such as cotton and synthetic cloth, dyes, chemicals, plastics and
steel. As the experience of Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China, Singapore, and now China shows,
export value added can be enhanced through heightened technological intensity in exported
products and services. These examples also show that an export model that is primarily
based on low labor cost and labor intensive, low technology exports will ultimately diminish
as wages inevitably rise.

             Box 1: Integration in Global Value Chains – A tale of two sectors

 ELECTRONICS

 Vietnam has emerged as a major ICT hardware assembly hub. Export turnover
 in this industry in 2014 was USD$ 32.2 billion, top among the country’s exports. ICT
 hardware exports consist mainly of communications equipment (75%), computers and
 storage devices (12%) and automotive electronics (6%). The FDI sector account for 90%
 of Vietnam’s electronics exports while only the remaining 10% by domestic companies.
 In communication equipment (mainly handsets), Samsung Electronics Vietnam alone is
 responsible for 98 percent of Vietnam’s mobile handset and component exports. Perhaps
 more importantly, only about 30% of Vietnam’s electronics exports in 2011 were comprised
 of local value added with the rest being import content. Most ICT hardware is manufactured
 based on foreign designs and specifications, making the industry deeply depended on
 imported components, and leading to low value added value from domestic firms.
 To increase domestic companies linking into the ICT global value chain presents
 an enormous challenge. In this highly competitive sector, there are high entry barriers
 of capital and technology intensity, stringent technical requirements (high quality, large
 volume, just-in-time delivery) and the ability to innovate and adapt, and engage in product
 design. Most Vietnamese firms do not possess the capacity to overcome these barriers as
 this would require cutting inventory costs, keeping up with technological changes through
 investment in research and development, and managing second-third tier suppliers – all of
 which relies on significant capital, skills and process upgrading. This reality explains why
 linkages and spillovers from ICT hardware are weak.
 Opportunities for FDI spillover in the electronics/ICT hardware industry can occur
 through Vietnamese firms increasing their value-add in providing services to support
 the industry. Integration, including through joint venture, has been easier with smaller FDI
 companies or first and second tier suppliers in the subsector of electrical appliances, where
 competition is less fierce and the need for co-location of suppliers is higher. High transport
 cost-to-value ratios for electronic appliances has forced the end-product manufactures to
 seek geographic co-location. Correspondingly, opportunities exist for Vietnam to increase
 its global value-add in this subsector.

TEXTILES AND APPAREL

Vietnam has comparative advantages in producing and exporting textile products.
Vietnam is one of the world’s top apparel producers, exporting USD $17.8 billion worth
of products in 2013, and employing an estimated 1.2 million workers in more than 3000
registered businesses. The majority of these small domestic firms are trapped in low-
productivity, low-value production mostly in the cut-make-and-trim market using imported
raw materials. A crucial consequence has been that buyers provide all product and
engineering specifications, as well as production equipment. This has translated into local
textile manufacturers not developing in-house design and engineering capabilities. They
have thus not been able to graduate from the role of subcontractor to the role of product/
brand developer.
The textile sector faces a number of constraints. Low labor productivity is, for
example, apparent through the cost disadvantage per shirt in Vietnam, especially
when compared to China. A 2013 study showed that while producers in Vietnam
manufacture an average of 12 polo shirts per worker per day, garment manufacturers in
China’s Guangzhou Province produce an average of 25 shirts per worker per day. The
study concluded that while production costs of export-quality polo shirts is lower in Vietnam
than in China, Vietnamese producers are unable to capture a higher price from buyers,
relative to their Chinese competitors, because of differences in volume, timely, consistent
delivery and quality. Another challenge is dependence on imported raw materials. An
estimated 80-90 percent of textile production relies on imported raw materials, making
the industry vulnerable to global price fluctuations and to downward pressure on profits; if
input costs were to increase. Lastly, the fragmented nature of SMEs in the textiles industry
highlights the need to capture economies of scale. Clustering can allow the Government
of Vietnam to do this through shared learning and reducing transaction and transportation
costs. Cluster links among firms would be beneficial for large exports and would help them
succeed.
The Trans Pacific Partnership opens up opportunities for Vietnam to increase exports
in the textiles sector, and to maintain its competitiveness, but lifting productivity is
key. The textile sector needs critical investments in upstream activities (such as fabric and
cotton ginning) and downstream activities (such as design and marketing) to make most
of the Trans Pacific Partnership. Producers must be linked more closely with buyers and
suppliers so that they can adapt production designs to meet quality standards and shorten
lead times. There is a need for a long-term investment strategy in design, marketing, and
the creation of new styles; the absence of such strategies underlines why so few well
known Vietnamese fashion brands exist, even though Vietnam is one of the world top
garment and textile exporters.

3.	Inclusive service delivery

As the review of trends of patterns of poverty reduction and shared prosperity earlier
in this chapter makes clear, Vietnam has achieved broad success at inclusion. Growth
has been highly inclusive in terms of the distribution of income gains, and equitable service
delivery has also generated widespread improvement in non-monetary measures of welfare.
This record of equity is seen in both human development outcomes and the distribution of
health and education expenditure in a comprehensive fiscal incidence analysis. Looking
towards the future, the inclusion challenge has two components: an unfinished agenda
around marginalized groups and gender equality, and a net set of service delivery challenges
driven by the country’s demographic and economic evolution.

3.1	A record of success in basic service delivery

The country’s extraordinary accomplishments in poverty reduction and shared
prosperity have been paired with tremendous advances in basic service delivery. Along
simple measures of education, health, and access to infrastructure. Progress along a number
of basic social indicators are summarized in the table below.

Vietnam’s achievements with regard to basic education quality are particularly
remarkable. Evidence for the effectiveness of Vietnamese schools come from both the
Young Lives longitudinal study and the Programme for International Student Assessment
(PISA), in which Vietnam participated for the first time in 2012. In the Young Lives study,
children in Vietnamese schools learn more by a wide margin compared with children in
schools in Peru, Ethiopia, and India. While Vietnam and India have similar levels of GDP
per capita, at age 15 nearly all Vietnamese students outperform the top 5 percent of Indian
students in math. In PISA, the performance of its students exceeded that of many OECD
countries. There is also relatively little variation in scores by socio-economic status. Scores
at the 5th percentile of the distribution in Vietnam are approximately equivalent to the 25th
percentile in Mexico, Thailand, and Turkey. Analysis has found that likely factors behind this
success include strong motivation by students, high expectations from parents, high level of
commitment by teachers (measured through very low absenteeism), effective management
and evaluation of teachers, and substantial investment in pre-school education and school
infrastructure.17

In health, Vietnam has also made great progress. Overall rates of child mortality and child
stunting have fallen rapidly over time, and life expectancy has increased markedly. Child
mortality levels are below those of peers and low for Vietnam’s level of income. No single
factor explains the long term gains in child health, which have occurred during a period of
great investment in health care. Among the contributing factors were a large expansion of
health care facilities and workers and implementation of a series of measures including
special programs targeting women’s and children’s health, promotion of family planning,
and targeted use of community health workers. After a period of decline, malnutrition rates
are at the average among peers, although in recent years progress has been minimal, and
malnutrition rates are still high among ethnic minorities.

Inclusive infrastructure access has been a hallmark of Vietnam’s experience, most
notably in the areas of electricity as well as information and communications technology
(ICT) access. The country made huge gains in electricity access during an astounding push
over the period 1994-1997, when the share of households increased from 14 percent to
61 percent. Today 99 percent of Vietnamese households have access to electricity. While
mobile phones and internet access were nearly non-existent in 2000, in 2014 there were
147 mobile phone subscriptions for every 100 Vietnamese, 90% of Vietnamese households
owned a mobile phone, and 48% of Vietnamese used the Internet.18

Another way to see Vietnam’s strong performance in service delivery is via the high
rates of satisfaction with most aspects of public services and conditions influenced by
public policy. In addition to objective measures, subjective measures show that Vietnamese
are pleased with various conditions that are influenced by government policy. Results from
the Gallup World Poll show that large majorities of people in Vietnam express satisfaction
with schools, availability of affordable housing, water quality, air quality, health care, roads,
and public transportation. The greatest standouts are in the areas of schools and affordable
housing, where Vietnam ranks sixth and third, respectively among all 143 countries surveyed
in the fraction of people who say they are satisfied. In contrast, air and water quality are the
two areas where Vietnam ranks lowest in satisfaction as compared to other countries.

Vietnam stands out in the extent that service provision has been equitable. One way
to see this is through the Commitment to Equity (CEQ) analysis that was completed during
the preparation of the SCD. The CEQ is a comprehensive fiscal incidence analysis of the
impact of expenditure and tax policies on inequality and poverty. CEQ analysis produces a
variety of “income” measures starting with market income and then progressively adding and
subtracting various taxes and expenditures. A flowchart illustrating the precise composition of
each of the income measures is shown in an annex. The “final income” measure treats health
and education expenditures as if they were transfers to households. Thus the difference in
the distribution between “final income” and other measures reflects the extent to which such
expenditures are equitable.

In the set of countries for which CEQ has been conducted, Vietnam stands out for its
low inequality by any income concept. In this figure above, moving from left to right the
income concepts increasingly incorporate additional elements of fiscal policy. Vietnam’s pre-
fiscal level of inequality (using market income) is low in comparison to the rest of the world
and fiscal policy is inequality-reducing, but the impact of Vietnam’s fiscal policy on inequality
is approximately average.

Measured using the CEQ “final income” concept, expenditure on health and education
account make the largest contribution to inequality reduction via fiscal activity. A
summary of the changes in inequality from various fiscal activities is shown in the figure
below. Inequality reduction from in-kind spending alone accounts for over 90 percent of
total inequality reduction (from fiscal activity) and education’s share in inequality-reduction
from in-kind fiscal expenditures is approximately 75 percent, indicating that approximately
2/3rds of all inequality-reduction is produced by education spending alone. Within education
expenditures, spending at the primary and lower-secondary levels account for nearly 4/5ths of
the marginal impact on inequality from education. Health expenditures also reduce inequality,
but the estimated impact of health is about 1/3rd of the estimated impact of education. The
personal income tax system is progressive—reducing inequality by half a Gini point—but the
tax system as a whole has relatively little impact on inequality.19

Looking to the future, Vietnam faces both an unfinished agenda and an emerging agenda
of social inclusion challenges. The unfinished agenda encompasses ethnic minorities as
well as other marginalized groups and a set of concerns related to gender. Key marginalized
groups include urban migrants and people with disabilities. The emerging agenda concerns
service delivery challenges associated with Vietnam’s move to middle income status, with
a growing middle class and rapidly aging population. The following section reviews these
issues, starting with ethnic minorities.




19	This analysis is subject to several caveats. Most importantly it relies on an imperfect matching of budget data with service
usage information drawn from the 2014 Household Living Standard Survey (VHLSS), and service usage information drawn
from a household survey is subject to substantial error in reporting. Some elements of direct transfers and subsidies that could
not be matched between budget data and the VHLSS are not included in the analysis.

A critical question is whether growth will continue to translate into poverty reduction
now that poverty is increasingly concentrated among ethnic minorities. In the most recent
period for which we have data (2012-2014), although income continued to rise across the
distribution (and in the bottom 40%), progress on ethnic minority stalled. Since ethnic minorities
now comprise 60% of the poor and will make up an increasing share of the poor going forward,
it is less clear that growth will necessarily translate into poverty reduction in the near future.

Over the longer term poverty reduction for ethnic minorities can be expected to be
driven by greater economic integration with the overall economy. A critical channel for
overall growth to feed into poverty reduction is via migration. One reason poverty reduction
has lagged among ethnic minorities is that their out-migration rates have been historically
low.20 Migration is strongly correlated with higher income, and just 3.8% of ethnic minorities
live outside their province of birth, compared to 12.3% of Kinh and Hoa. The reasons for
low migration include language and cultural barriers and the household registration system,
which has discouraged migration, particularly for those without social connections in the
place of destination. A recent World Bank study on the registration system found that there
are extremely few ethnic minorities with permanent registration status in major urban areas
(just 1% of the permanent registrant population).21 There is, however, evidence that the
force of these factors is diminishing and that ethnic minority migration rates are increasing.
First, large increases in completion of primary and lower secondary education completion



20	 See for example the recent analysis of Coxhead, Cuong, and Vu (2015) which concludes “lack of mobility is a leading
candidate to explain the distinctive persistence of poverty among Vietnam’s ethnic minority populations, even as national
poverty has sharply diminished.”

rates mean that young ethnic minorities are now more likely to speak Vietnamese. Second,
the force of the household registration system has diminished, and acquiring temporary
registration in urban areas is no longer difficult. The household registration study found that
in the southern industrial center of Binh Duong, ethnic minorities make up a surprisingly high
fraction of the population, including 11% of recent migrants.

Thus recent patterns, although mixed, provide some basis for optimism that growth will
continue to drive poverty reduction among ethnic minorities. However, it may take time
for social networks to develop to facilitate migration among ethnic minorities more broadly.
And although language and cultural barriers are diminishing, worldwide experience suggests
that ethnic division will persist. This suggests that in the short-term targeted efforts for ethnic
minorities will be needed. A fuller discussion of the ethnic minority situation is found in the
priority section of this SCD.

Urban migrants are another potentially marginalized group. The household registration
system known as ho khau was developed initially to control migration and to serve as an
instrument of public security. Although the system has become less rigid over time, concerns
persist that ho khau limits the rights and access to public services of those who lack
permanent registration in their place of residence. A recent World Bank study found that at
least 5.6 million people lack permanent ho khau in their place of residence (and have only
temporary registrant status) including 36% of the population of Ho Chi Minh City and 18%
of the population of the Hanoi. Those without permanent registration work overwhelmingly
in the private sector, mostly in manufacturing, and make up three-fourths of all employees
of foreign firms in the surveyed areas (Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Da Nang, Binh Duong, and
Dak Nong.)

The household registration system is a source of inequality of opportunity for migrants.
In material economic terms and in the labor market, temporary registrants no longer face
disadvantages, except that they are largely excluded from public sector employment. However
temporary registrants continue to face some limitations in service access, particularly for
public school, health insurance for young children, and basic procedures like obtaining a birth
certificate. The World Bank study also found that 70% of citizens in surveyed areas believe
the system limits the rights of people without ho khau and should be made less restrictive.22

The household registration issue is closely linked to service delivery challenges that
urban centers face due to the influx of urban migrants. City governments have faced
strains in providing services to migrants, which has led some to partially exclude those
without permanent registration. This phenomenon is a consequence of both existing capacity
constraints (for example, for schools), and the fiscal burden cities face in providing services.
However, taking into account impacts on revenue and transfers, the net fiscal impact is likely
positive or only mildly negative. Additionally, some urban centers face particular issues due to
the large number of migrants who locate in areas at high risk of flooding. Some policymakers
have raised concerns that relaxing the system could result in increased migration to urban
centers, straining public services and municipal finances.23

People with disabilities comprise a large and growing group of people who are not
fully included in Vietnamese society. Vietnam has a substantial population of people with
disabilities, in part because of the legacy of conflict, and as the old-age population expands
rapidly, so well the fraction with some form of disability.24 Disability in Vietnam is highly
correlated with poverty (Mont 2011). Those with disabilities have faced obstacles in access
to health, education, social assistance, transportation and infrastructure, information and
communications, as well as culture and sports (NCCD 2010). Most notably, more than half
of children with severe disabilities never attend school.

The Vietnamese government has made a number of strong commitments to advancing
the rights of people with disabilities. Foremost among these are the Law on Disabilities,
ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), and
elements of the Constitution. Both the Law and the CRPD reflect a modern approach to
disability, which differs substantially from the how disability has been understood in Vietnam
and in much of the world until recently. Policy has shifted towards a view of people with
disabilities not as victims and objects of charity, but as subjects of the law with clearly defined
rights. Tangible implementation of these commitments has been very limited.

On gender equality, across a wide variety of measures, Vietnam rates very high. School
enrollment rates are similar for men and women, and female labor force participation rates are
high. In three areas gender concerns are particularly important: the extremely high sex ratio at
birth, the lack of women in leadership positions, and the prevalence of domestic violence.

While Vietnam has achieved broad success in gender equality, there are three key areas
of concern. First, in business and particularly in government and political spheres, the face
of leadership is still overwhelmingly male. The civil service has a large share of women, but
their representation in leadership positions is small and tends to be at lower levels. A World
Bank study of commune health stations and district hospitals in six provinces found that
women make up 39% of doctors but just 6% of hospital directors. In the last decade and a
half, the share of women in the National Assembly has been declining and is now at 24.4
percent. Few chairs of National Assembly committees are female. Women’s representation
also remains low in key bodies of the Communist Party: the Politburo, the Central Committee,
and the Secretariat. Women constitute only 18.3 percent of Party leadership at the commune
level, 14.2 percent at the district level, and 11.3 percent at the province level. Similar
imbalances appear in the private sector. While substantial numbers of women are employed
in wage jobs, few are in management positions. In the 2015 Enterprise Survey, just 22% of
firms reported that they have a female top manager (compared to an average of 27% across
EAP countries.)

A second area of great concern for gender is the large imbalance in the sex ratio at
birth (SRB), the number of male births per 100 female births. The much higher number
of boys than girls born in Vietnam is a product of sex-selective abortion resulting from the
combination of son preference and the ready availability of sex identification of fetuses
through ultrasound technology. Sex-selective abortion is a form of gender discrimination in
itself and a threat to gender equity over the long term. Starting around 2006, the SRB has
risen rapidly, reaching nearly 114 in 2013, placing Vietnam—with India and China—among
the countries of the world with the highest SRBs. This imbalance will result in a large number
of surplus men starting in about 20 years, which may result in an increased level of antisocial
behavior, violence, and human trafficking.

A third area of concern is domestic violence. In a 2010 study, 34% of women who had ever
been married reported that they had experienced physical and/or sexual violence at some
point in their lives, and 9% reported having experienced violence in the previous 12 months.
Five percent of women had ever been pregnant reported experiencing physical violence
during a pregnancy. Rates of experiencing physical violence were higher among younger
and less educated women. Rates of current sexual violence did not vary substantially by age
or education level.25

3.3	The emerging agenda for service delivery

In addition to the challenges associated with marginalized groups and gender equity,
Vietnam faces a new set of challenges for inclusion and service delivery. The new
challenges are driven by two developments: the rapid aging of the population and the rise of
the middle class.

56    Sustaining Success


One of two major trends that will impact the shared prosperity agenda is Vietnam’s
current seismic demographic shift, which now makes it one of the most rapidly aging
countries in the world. The fraction of the population that is of working age peaked in 2014
and is now in decline, while the fraction over 65 is growing very rapidly. As a result, the old-
age dependency ratio (OADR), which has been roughly flat for decades, will climb steeply
and double in the next twenty years.26

This extremely rapid aging is the consequence of a constellation of factors. First, the
current old-age population (and thus the OADR) in Vietnam is small. This is due to the low
birth rate and high child mortality during the famines that took place 1940-45 as well as the
high adult mortality rates during the ensuing conflicts. Second, the post-1945 birth cohorts,
who are just reaching old-age, are quite large due to the high fertility rate of that period.
Finally, because fertility fell rapidly in the 1990s, the cohort of people entering working age is
quite small. In other words, the numerator of the OADR has just started to increase rapidly
from a low base, while the denominator is shrinking.

This rapid aging will generate new service delivery challenges. Most clearly, it will put
strain on the social insurance and broader social assistance system. Second, it will mean
new challenges for the health care system as the burden of disease shifts from infectious
disease towards non-communicable disease. Third, concerns about inclusion of people with
disabilities will rise as that population grows with population aging. Finally, provision of long-
term care of the old-age population will become an issue of widespread concern.

A second major trend determining challenges for shared prosperity is the expansion
of the middle class. The fraction of the population that is part of the “Global Middle Class”
with consumption level of at least $15-a-day (2011 PPP) terms is projected to rise from 11%
to more than half of the population by 2035. This trend will generate new challenges for
service delivery, as this expanded group of the relatively wealthy bring rising expectations
for government services.

Experience from other countries suggests that the growing middle class is characterized
by several features. First, it expects government to deliver quality services and provide
citizens with greater voice and choice. Second, it is subject to new challenges, many of them
the result of earlier successes: changing family structures, a growing burden of lifestyle
diseases, and economic needs for a higher- and more relevantly-skilled workforce. Third, in
the transition towards higher income status, the emerging middle class faces old and new risks.
With a more open and marketized economy comes increased economic volatility, creating
new risks such as unemployment, wage and price shocks, rising inequality and integration of
migrant populations into cities, and the need for constant skill upgrading. These new realities
in turn create fiscal risks as governments seek to expand social security systems, provide
universal health coverage at affordable cost, and expand coverage, relevance, and quality
of education to higher levels. Managing new risks in the face of rising expectations from the
middle class will place new demands on social policy and institutions.

4.	Sustainable management of natural assets and environment

Natural resources (fish, forest, land and water) have contributed to the impressive
growth Vietnam has achieved since 1990. Going forward, they need to be better
managed to capitalize on their contribution to boosting shared prosperity and achieving
sustainability. Land, water, fish and forest are direct inputs to agricultural production
(including timber production and aquaculture) and also generate ecosystem services. Using
these primary inputs, Vietnam’s agricultural value addition grew at an average rate of 3.7
percent between 2000 and 2013, outperforming all other middle-income Asian countries other
than China. The most rapid growth has occurred for livestock, aquaculture, and beverage/
industrial crops, reflecting changes in domestic demand and improved trade opportunities.
Vietnam’s agro-food exports now exceeds US$ 25 billion, and the country is among the
top five global exporters in commodities as diverse as rice, shrimp, coffee, cashews, black
pepper and rubber. In 2012, the sector accounted for about 4 percent of GDP (similar to
the garment/textile industry) and 8 percent of Vietnam’s merchandise. Sustaining these
contributions will require Vietnam to adopt a path involving sustainable management of its
natural assets and environment rather than exploiting them beyond their carrying capacity.27
The urgency with which Vietnam must adjust its growth pathways is underscored by its
exposure to pollution, natural hazards and climate variability, because of the contribution
of natural systems to resilience and the potential impact of climate change on the resource
base and in turn income.

4.1	Advancements in transforming agriculture, sustainable use of natural resource
and the environment, and climate resilience

Vietnam is a major supplier in international agricultural commodity markets. Currently,
Vietnam has more than $1 billion in trade for seven different commodities (or commodity groups),
and it ranks among the top five global exporters of each. The domestic market for commodities is
also expanding in Vietnam with the growing middle class. Shifts in consumer taste and growing
urbanization are also increasing mass market grocery sales which accounted for an estimated
15 percent of total food sales in 2013, and has doubled between 2005 and 2013. Vietnam’s
agriculture is at a turning point and going forward needs to ensure that the benefits of additional
sectoral growth exceed the costs. The government’s Agricultural Restructuring Plan recognizes
the need to increase efficiency, innovation, diversification, and value addition for the sector and
agro-food system to remain competitive in international and domestic markets.

Farmers in Vietnam are gradually transitioning to a more diverse set of crops as
households demand different food products. Changes in consumption patterns, with greater
emphasis on nutrition and increase in spending on protein sources, are underway in Vietnam.
Farmers are slowly diversifying primary agriculture to respond to these changing consumption
patterns. Diversification allows for greater variation in processed/prepared foods and other
agro-industries, creating opportunities for employment and improved production systems.

While not a replacement for effective land markets, the government has been allocating
land use rights over land to households, communities and economic entities. By 2010,
the Vietnam had issued approximately 31.3 million Land Use Rights Certificates (LURCs),
covering roughly half of Vietnam’s land area and 90 percent of farm households. Through the
certificates, the government seeks to provide greater land-tenure security, facilitate access
to credit, and enable the transferability of use rights. The certificates are also necessary for
accessing payment systems that aim to internalize positive externalities of land management
practices – for example, payment for forest ecosystem services.28 The certificates help
provide an incentive for land stewardship and an opportunity to engage in the land rental
market and consolidate land.




28	The payment for forest ecosystem services program promotes the maintenance of natural forest cover and transfers
financial resources from the beneficiaries to the producers of ecosystem services. While the performance of the program has
been mixed, it is seen to be successful because it contains a legal requirement to pay financial resources from sectors such as
hydropower and tourism to smallholders who are managing the land. This augments the willingness of households to reverse
land degradation.

There has been some consolidation of agricultural production in parts of Vietnam. This
is evident in rice production where 85 percent of the surplus is accounted for by the top two
quintiles. This statistics points to a trend toward greater concentration in commercial rice
production, with approximately 300,000 households responsible for most of the country’s
exports. Similar trends are evident in aquaculture and emerging in livestock production.
This makes enhancing competitiveness of agriculture and improving value-addition more
manageable.

While Vietnam works to maintain its position in agro industries, it is also starting to
tackle the management of key inputs to the value chain, such as fisheries. Vietnam
has adopted fisheries comanagement approaches with formalized fisheries groups in closed
systems (for example, lagoons and reservoirs). The comanagement of coastal fisheries is
now occurring at a pilot scale, and has only recently been extended to open access areas
(such as coastal areas) following Decree No. 33 issued by the government in 2010. Technical
and financial support is being provided to all stakeholders who engage in the practice of
comanagement.

Beyond agriculture, Vietnam has put in place comprehensive strategies and policies
on green growth, climate change, and environmental protection. Vietnam’s Green
Growth strategy identifies strategic tasks such as reducing the intensity of greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions, promoting the use of clean and renewable energy according to greening
production and greening lifestyle, and promoting sustainable consumption. Public agencies
are gradually being strengthened to protect the environment and promote green growth at
the central and local levels. Financing for environmental protection, while still insufficient, is
also being increased.

Vietnam has developed strategies to respond to climate-driven risks (both extreme
and chronic events) in the medium (5-10 years) and long term (35-40 years). Vietnam’s
climate change strategy emphasizes, among other things, proactively coping with natural
disasters, monitoring climate, adopting measures to adapt to climate induced events,
enhancing coping capacity, and investing in advanced science and technology to cope
with climate change. In 2007, The Government approved the National Strategy for Natural
Disaster Prevention, Response and Mitigation to 2020 (NDPRM). The strategy, recognizing
the exposure of Vietnam to extreme events, recommends the development of catastrophe
risk financing solutions to complement other disaster risk management measures. Along
with a National Target Program, the NDPRM forms the overarching policy framework for
disaster risk management and climate change adaptation activities. They are complemented
by other dedicated decrees and laws, such as the country’s first-ever law on Natural Disaster
Prevention, Response and Mitigation (No. 22/2013/QH13)29 which became effective in May
2014. Implementation of these strategies helps reduce Vietnam’s ability to cope with multiple
natural hazards including typhoons, floods, droughts, sea water intrusion, landslides, forest
fires, and occasional earthquakes




29	The Law emphasizes the importance of comprehensive disaster risk management.

Vietnam has been undertaking activities to improve investments in the country’s
infrastructure in order to enhance resilience to climate change. Vietnam has been, with
support from development partners, developing and adopting decision-support tools that
integrate forecasts of climate change into planning processes. In the Mekong River Delta,
several provinces and cities have come together to translate into action the vision for integrated
development articulated in the Mekong Delta Plan rather than unintentionally undermining
each other’s investments in resilience. This includes jointly planning for investments related
to a rise in sea level and changing flood risks, through enhanced attention to the siting of
infrastructures and residential communities.

Vietnam has pledged its own domestic resources of $3.2 billion to reduce GHG emissions
by eight percent by 2030 relative to the business as usual scenario, contributing to the
global effort to mitigate climate change. This represents Vietnam’s contribution to the
UN target of keeping global warming at less than 2o C by the end of the 21st century. With
support from the international community, to the order of $18 billion, Vietnam’s commitment
could increase to 25 percent. If the target of eight percent (or 25 percent) GHG emission
reduction is achieved in 2030, emission intensity (emission per unit of GDP) will be reduced
by 20 percent (or 30 percent), respectively, relative to 2010 levels. Many sectors will need
to contribute to achieve the GHG reduction targets including energy (proposed through from
changes in fuel combustion and fugitive emissions), transport, waste, land use and forestry,
and agriculture.

The government has recently developed a revised power sector plan that envisages
increasing the amount of wind and solar capacity to 18 gigawatts by 2030. Vietnam’s
current energy mix is dominated by hydro (42%), coal (30%) and gas (20%) with almost no
wind or solar capacity (figure 45). Installing approximately 18 gigawatts of renewable capacity
would contribute to a reduction in incremental coal investments over the next 15 years to 44
gigawatts. Investments in renewables plus other measures would enable Vietnam to achieve
a 27.7 percent reduction in the business as usual CO2 emission levels from the energy sector
by 2030. The measures needed for this change (including increased renewable capacity)
have a marginal abatement cost of less than $10 per ton of CO2.30

The government has been taking regulatory action to address air pollution over the last
two decades from the energy and transport sectors. Guided particularly by the Ministry
of Transport (MOT), Vietnam has introduced several regulations to control vehicle emissions
while transport demand has grown. The government has also adopted regulations on vehicle
emission standards and on fuel quality.

Vietnam’s achievements in reducing the impact of its growth trajectory on the
environment and addressing issues of climate change are noteworthy, yet significant
work remains. Vietnam has the opportunity to leapfrog some of the environmental and natural
resource degradation challenges faced by other fast growing economies based on how it
handles unsustainable exploitation of natural resources, transformation of the agriculture
sector and agro-food system, pollution, and adaptation to climate change. Vietnam needs to
accelerate the pace at which it reforms policies and translates some of its current policies
into actions to avoid lock-in effects and irreversible outcomes. The next three subsections
describe key existing challenges that need to be tackled to deliver on reducing extreme
poverty and shared prosperity in a sustainable manner.

4.2	Constraints to improving agriculture

Vietnam performs poorly compared to its peers when examining the natural resource
depletion as a percentage of GNI. The graph shows how nearly 15 percent of GNI was
lost to natural resource depletion during a peak growth year. The percentage has, however,
been declining in the recent past, and could be explained by various factors including
the extent of natural resources degradation that has already taken place. Vietnam faces
several challenges to effectively using its natural assets to achieve the twin goals in an
environmentally sustainable manner. Declining productivity, is one of the issues Vietnam

needs to address. Vietnam also needs to strengthen its enforcement of policies and laws on
environmental protection and deter violations of environmental laws.

Vietnam’s agricultural productivity could be higher. Land productivity in Vietnam is
wide-ranging. Vietnam’s rice yields have been relatively high compared with regional
peers. Its coffee yields have also been the highest among major coffee producers. Yields in
other main crops, however, have exhibited low productivity. The share of agricultural growth
accounted for by total factor productivity is much lower in Vietnam than among regional
peers (Table 8). Labor productivity in Vietnamese agriculture overall is low compared with
other emerging middle income countries although there is regional variation. The limited use
of suitable land, low investment in technology for crops other than rice, and the part-time
nature of labor in agriculture explain the recorded levels of productivity. Water productivity is
also low because of an aged irrigation structure that is not optimizing water management and
use. There is a need for ‘smarter’ crop water management and infrastructure investments
that help the system to catch up with the ongoing transformation and constraints in land and
water resources.

The low productivity means that Vietnam’s agricultural growth has resulted from the
expansion of agricultural land and intensive use of fertilizers, pesticides and water for
crops, and the use of antibiotics in aquaculture. Fertilizer application rates grew rapidly
during the 1990s but have more or less stabilized since the early 2000s. At nearly 300
kilograms per hectare, the application use rate in Vietnam is about double that of other
Southeast Asian countries; and with the excess amounts running off into bodies of water,
agriculture is a non-point source of water pollution. Rice production practices are also a
significant source of GHG emissions (which are about half of the agriculture sector’s
aggregate GHG emissions, about 42% of the national level). These trends have resulted
in Vietnamese agriculture having a rather large and extensive environmental footprint that
needs to change by modernizing agricultural practices.

Low productivity in the forest sector is partly due to the institutions and incentives
for forest management. State Forestry Companies (SFCs), manage about 14 percent of
the country’s 13.8 million ha of forests and are plagued with numerous problems including
poor forestry practices. This results in the degradation of the resource base and low yields.
In addition, due to inadequate incentives, Vietnam is missing the opportunity to generate
higher value from forest resources by supplying the lucrative domestic market for sawnwood.
Vietnam currently depends on neighboring countries for sawnwood.

Land fragmentation is a constraint on agricultural modernization. Currently there are
regulatory factors that limit consolidation. However, the government is exploring options
for reducing land fragmentation. In Vietnam, agricultural land consolidation remains fairly
nascent, although consolidation of commercial production is occurring at a faster pace –
especially for livestock, aquaculture and commercial rice – as noted above.

Vietnam is not taking full advantage of the market opportunities for generating
increased value or having the transformative impact on farmers and communities that
are the sources of the agro-food exports. Projections are that by the early 2030’s primary
agriculture would account for 6-8 percent of Vietnam’s GDP, while the agro industry, together
with food distribution and logistics (and other services), could account for double this share
(12-16 percent)31,32. There is expected growth in consumption of agrofood products, which
creates opportunities for Vietnam. Vietnam’s exports, however, sell at a discount to that
of other leading producers. The bulk of Vietnam’s agrofood exports are sold as primary
commodities or initially processed products. While this is not a constraint, Vietnam has
relatively scarce resources (especially land) and therefore needs to get more value from its
land. In addition, Vietnam has not promoted vertical integration of the supply chain, limiting
the linkage between farmers and private sector. The exception is aquaculture, where, in
2015, an estimated 70 percent of pangasius production was raised by processing companies
in vertically integrated operations (up from 10 percent in 2010).

The mixed record of Vietnam’s agricultural export – with expansion in trade volumes
while having shortcomings in quality and sustainability - is partly explained by the
rapid rate at which change has occurred. It is also a result of government policy and

32	In 2011, food and beverages accounted for some 20% of Vietnam’s industrial output. Its growth in output and output per
worker over the 2000-09 were quite similar to that of many of industrial sub-sectors. (Nguyen et al 2014)

engagement in certain industries. While administrative controls on land, and direct state
involvement in both input and output markets assisted with the sector’s stability and inclusive
growth over recent decades, these policies and associated legacy institutions are now
delaying the transformation of the agriculture sector. For example, state-owned farms and
/or processing/trading companies have played a very prominent role. Keeping their status
quo as SOEs, however, maintains a ‘culture’ of low product quality.

Vietnam’s agriculture has contributed significantly to degradation of natural assets.
Shrimp aquaculture in the Mekong Delta has been the cause for large-scale destruction
of mangroves and a major source of water pollution. Under so-called extensive systems,
shrimp farmers use large amounts of chemicals and antibiotics to keep the shrimp in dense
shrimp ponds healthy. The organic and inorganic matter in the effluent from these ponds
often contaminates surrounding freshwater and coastal waters. In the agricultural sector,
Vietnam has one of the highest fertilizer uses per hectare in the world and has continued to
expand along with expanded and also intensified livestock production, both of which have
contributed to increases in emissions of ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O). These
subsectors are also responsible for producing PM2.533, which is harmful to human health.

problems associated with agricultural commodity production are either moderate or severe.

Land is being cultivated more intensively. While the area under paddy rice has not really
changed, the total harvested area grew by an average of 1.7 percent a year during the 2000s
due to a shift toward double and triple cropping. The expansion of the ‘third rice crop’ in the
Mekong Delta has disrupted natural flooding processes, restricting the transfer of nutrients
and normal cleansing effects, leading farmers to use more fertilizers and pesticides. The
intensification of rice production has also contributed to water pollution, biodiversity loss, and
the growth of GHG emissions. In upland areas, the fallow periods of shifting cultivation have
been shortened to the point of almost continuous cultivation, leading to soil degradation.
The growth in livestock production has also been accompanied with an increase in water
pollution and GHG emissions.

Since the early 1990s, the Northern Mountainous Areas and the Central Highlands have
witnessed deforestation and serious erosion problems due to the cultivation of rubber,
upland rice, maize, soybean cassava and expansion of coffee. The earlier (1990s)
expansion of coffee and aquaculture production also occurred largely at the expense of
upland forest or mangrove forests respectively.34 Some 74 percent of coffee planted in Dak

agriculture has grown nearly 15 percent (from 8.9 million to 10.2 million hectares) since 2000.
Expansion continues by the increased use of steeply sloped land for cassava production in
upland areas and a surge in rubber plantation areas on following recent price increases.

Statistical data indicates that the total erosion-prone area amounts to 13 million hectare
or 40 percent of natural areas.35 At present, the country has about two million hectare of
land deemed to be ‘seriously degraded,’ and another 9.3 million ha encountering problems of
desertification.36, 37 The latter is 20 percent of the total land area and supports about 22 million
people. Studies of National Institute of Agriculture Planning and Projection (NIAPP) showed
that up to 60% of cultivation areas has been affected by soil runoff. The amount of soil lost
every year is from several dozen tons/ha in secondary forest and grown perennial crop land
to several hundred tons/ha on bare soil. The amount of annual soil loss on annual crop land
without erosion control ranges from 50 to 100 tons/ha in the whole country.

Overexploitation of marine fisheries has resulted in declining yields and quality for
an extended period (figure 47). The share of the catch consisting of ‘trash fish’ and small
fish now account for an estimated 60 percent of the total marine catch, raising concerns
regarding overfishing. More than two-thirds of the volume of fish caught or produced is
consumed domestically, and the small fish are part of the feed for aquaculture. Domestic
consumption of fish is growing rapidly, with an estimated 50 percent of Vietnamese obtaining
their dietary protein from aquatic products.

Overfishing is especially evident in the near shore areas, which are the fishing grounds
for some 85 percent of country’s fleet and the primary source of livelihood for poor
or near poor coastal communities. Although the exact fisheries stock is unknown, it is
evident that fishers continue to catch above the allowed limits, restricting the regeneration
and restoration of fisheries. Some fishers also adopt destructive practices in prohibited areas
and during times of spawning, aggravating the situation.

Until recently, some 80 percent of total freshwater withdrawals in Vietnam were for
agriculture. While irrigation coverage is high with most amenable areas equipped, the current
irrigation systems were designed primarily for rice and several factors impede increased
water productivity. Incomplete structures and/or water losses during operations have many
schemes operating at only 60-70 percent of their capacity.38 Low water productivity is only
part of the problem. In regions, like the central highlands, drought and water shortages have
been increasingly affecting the region and threatening coffee production of the smallholder
farmers. At the same time, hydropower, aquaculture, municipal and industrial water needs
are increasing, but institutional arrangements for water sharing are lacking.

4.3	Limited abatement of environmental pollution

Vietnam is among the top ten countries affected by air pollution due to lack of control of
polluting sources, including power and transportation39. Satellite-derived images show
that average fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels are high, approaching the levels in China,
including some pockets of very high concentrations in urban and industrial zones. The major
sources of PM pollution in Vietnam include fuel combustion by industry and the power sector,
transport (from fuel combustion and re-suspension of road dust), domestic and commercial
emissions from using coal and biomass (rice husks) for cooking and heating and, during the
harvest season, the burning of field residues.

More than 83 percent of the Vietnamese population (mostly in urban areas) are exposed
to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels that exceed WHO guideline values since 1995
and the percentage has been increasing (figure 48). Approximately 14 million Vietnamese
living in 26 cities are exposed to more than 70 grams of urban vehicle emissions for each ton
emitted, with higher levels in some cities—87 grams for each ton of emissions in Ho Chi Minh
City and 120 in Hanoi. Evidence from epidemiological studies in Ho Chi Minh City revealed
associations between NO2 concentrations and hospital admissions for lung and respiratory
problems during the dry season, pointing to a potential role of pollution exposure in causing
poor health.

Vietnam is the most energy intensive economy in South East Asia and among its
economic peers, making the energy sector a significant emitter of GHGs. Vietnam has
been increasingly dependent on non-renewable energy sources since 1990.40 For every unit
of GDP produced the country uses 2 units of energy. This indicates large energy savings
potential and opportunity to become more competitive.

From 2004 to 2014, overall CO2 emission in Vietnam from power generation sources
increased by 73 percent. Energy intensity influences the GHG emissions from the sector.
In 2010, 28.1 percent of emissions related to energy were estimated to come from electricity
generation, 27.6 percent from the consumption of energy in the industrial sector, 24.9
percent from transport and 12.4 percent from household energy use (UN, 2013). A significant
challenge for Vietnam is meeting its future power demand while complying with government’s
commitment to reduce GHG emissions in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)
presented at the 2015 Convention of the Parties for the UNFCCC.

Electricity demand will continue to rapidly grow, reflecting economic growth and catch
up in per capita consumption, which is low by international standards (e.g. one third of
China). The latter suggests a high level of unmet demand. The projection of needing only 44
gigawatts of new coal fired power generation until 2030 is the best case scenario (from an
environmental and GHG emissions standpoint) for Vietnam to be able to meet its growing
demand. Limiting new coal generation to this level will require that nuclear, combined cycle
gas plants, 18 gigawatts of solar/wind are online by 2030 as outlined in the revised power
sector plan. Should the alternative energy sources not be developed, there will be the need
to add an additional 20 gigawatts of coal over the next 15 years. Establishing the alternative
energy sources is very ambitious and points to the need for Vietnam to address air pollution
by doing more than changing Vietnam’s energy mix.

Water pollution is another serious environmental issue in Vietnam. In some rural areas,
toxics have become a problem and are affecting water quality because water management
practices in agriculture result in a large proportion of applied fertilizer and pesticides in streams
and groundwater or emitted as nitrous oxide.41, 42 While smaller in volume, water pollution in
craft villages is of significant concern because of the impact it has on those working in the
villages. Urban wastewater, however, is the largest contributor to water pollution in many parts
of the country, meaning that both now and in the future, sanitation and wastewater collection
and treatment will be critical issues for improving water quality.

In urban areas, water pollution is imposing a significant cost for those who cannot
manage the health effects. The Economics of Sanitation Initiative (2009) found that diarrhea
is the sanitation-related disease associated with the highest number of cases at over 7
million a year. The economic cost of treating patients can be estimated using an average
cost of $4.50 per case of water-borne illness, resulting in a cost of $31.7 million. Diarrhea is
also the main cause of death from poor sanitation and hygiene, accounting for around 4,600
deaths a year.

4.4	Vulnerability to climate change

The impacts of climate change are already evident in Vietnam and will only intensify
over the coming decades. Vietnam has a high and increasing exposure to impacts from
rising sea level, ocean warming and increasing acidification combined with extreme weather
events.43 Official climate change scenarios (from the Ministry of Natural Resources and
Environment), have projected that annual mean temperature will increase 0.6°C to 1.2°C by
2040 (depending on location) relative to the average during the period 1980-1999 and from
1.1°C -1.9°C to 2.1°C - 3.6°C by 2100.44

Vietnam is vulnerable to multiple hazards, some chronic and some extreme (Figure 50).
Almost 60 percent of Vietnam’s land area and over 70 percent of its population are at risk of
multiple natural hazards including typhoons, floods, droughts, sea water intrusion, landslides,
forest fires, and occasional earthquakes. Climate change is likely to increase the impact
of disasters, especially the frequency, severity, and intensity of the hydro-meteorological
events. Many of Vietnam's cities are likely to be increasingly affected by natural disasters.
This poses a serious challenge not only because of the large concentrations of people and
assets in urban areas, but because cities are a critical element of Vietnam’s impressive
economic growth and its poverty-reduction record.

Projections show that sea levels are likely to rise significantly over the coming decades,
compounding the impacts on already exposed communities. In Deltaic regions which are
at risk of land subsidence due to natural processes, human activities such as drainage and
groundwater extraction significantly exacerbate the process, increasing the threat of coastal




43	 Larger irrigation schemes are managed by state-owned irrigation and drainage management companies, whose operating
revenues come from a combination of public subsidies and water use charges to industry and municipalities. Since 2008, most
farmers have been exempt from paying fees for services provided by the irrigation and drainage management companies.
While this measure was adopted to improve farmer welfare, it has weakened the accountability of the companies before local
water user organizations. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that some 80 percent of the
nitrous oxide emissions in Vietnam derive from agriculture.

flooding. This is prominently displayed in the Mekong where such manmade subsidence is
found to be 6 mm per year.45 The projected loss of mangrove forests because of sea level
rise and human activities is a significant concern and is likely to accelerate coastal erosion.
Considerable increase of salinity intrusion is projected in coastal areas as a result of climate
change. With an un-fixed saline-brackish border, the Delta is particularly vulnerable to
increased salinity intrusion associated with sea level rise. The total area affected by salinity
intrusion in the Mekong River Delta with concentrations higher than 4 g/l will increase from
1,303,000 hectares to 1,723,000 hectares with a 30 cm sea level rise.46

Climate change and sea level rise will affect both yields and production of key crops
such as rice, maize, cassava, sugarcane and coffee. For rice the worst yield reductions
are about 12 percent in the Mekong River Delta and about 24 percent in the Red River Delta.
In the Mekong River Delta, a 30 cm rise by 2050 would result in a loss of 193,000 ha of rice
area due to inundation and 294,000 ha due to salinity intrusion, both without adaptation. The
loss of rice area would lead to a decline in rice production of about 2.6 million tons per year
based on current yields. These changes will occur in conjunction with the projected large
changes in agricultural land use due to market conditions. In the context of rice, however,
the country has a large exportable surplus cushion that the impact of climate change is not
expected to impact food security (especially once changes in consumption pattern are also
accounted for). Coffee on the other hand could be negatively affected by climate change
because of its reliance on expansion into areas that are marginally suited for the crop
and therefore vulnerability to water and temperature disruptions that are often associated
with increases in evapotranspiration and increased frequency of hot days and nights, and
increased occurrence of drought.

The effects of climate change are likely to affect fish physiology and ecology as well as
the operation of aquaculture. Some fish species, such as catfish, may grow more rapidly with
higher temperatures, but at the same time be more vulnerable to disease. The main impacts of
climate change on aquaculture seem likely to be a consequence of increased flooding and salinity.
Semi-intensive and intensive shrimp producers may incur additional costs of water pumping
to maintain water and salinity levels. Since the industry is both capital intensive and growing
rapidly, adaptation is likely to be autonomous with the costs borne by operators. The total cost of
adaptation is estimated at an average of $130 million per year from 2010–50, which is equivalent
to 2.4 percent of total costs.

Fisheries, particularly coral reef fisheries, are also likely to be affected by the impacts
of sea level rise, warmer oceans, and ocean acidification. Substantial reductions in catch
potential are projected with 16-percent decrease in maximum catch potential projected in the
waters of Vietnam.47 Given a 100 cm sea level rise, Vietnam is expected to lose 8,533 square
kilometers of freshwater marsh (a 65-percent loss)48, which contributes to human well-being
through provisioning (timber, fuel wood, and charcoal), regulating (flood, storm, erosion control,
and the prevention of saltwater intrusion), habitat (breeding, spawning, and nursery habitats for
commercial fish species and biodiversity), and cultural services (recreation, aesthetic, non-use).

Estimations of economic losses of public assets from extreme events revealed increasing
losses since 2005, though these are relatively stable as a proportion of GDP for the same
period. There is a wide range in the cost of impact, and over the past 25 years the losses range
from between 0.4 percent to 1.7 percent of GDP. 80 percent of the numbers of losses were for
values up to 5,000Bn VND, representing approximately 21 percent of the total cost for both floods
and storms. There also are a number of events with large losses exceeding 45,000Bn VND. 2.9
percent of GDP is the highest estimated loss from the 25 years of data.49 In addition, disaster
events in Vietnam have caused more than 13,000 deaths over a period of two decades (till 2010).
There is seasonality and different levels of severity to the natural hazards by region, with the north
having a greater proportion of higher category storms and being a relatively ‘higher risk’ areas.50

Coastal cities in Vietnam are projected to be affected by increased tropical cyclone intensity,
in addition to sea level rise augmenting the impact of coastal flooding. Floods associated with
sea level rise and storm surges carry significant risks in informal settlements where a significant
portion of the urban population in Vietnam live– 41 percent in 200551 – and where lack of drainage
and damages to sanitation and water facilities are accompanied by health threats. Ho Chi Minh
City is projected to be particularly exposed to climate risks. A study that quantified current and
future citywide flood risks to Ho Chi Minh City projects that up to 60 percent of the built-up area
will be exposed to a 100 cm sea level rise.52, 53 In the absence of adaptation, the planned urban
development for the year 2025 further increases by 17 percent Ho Chi Minh City’s exposure to
sea level rise.

PRIORITIES

Based on the diagnostic in the previous section, further progress in achieving poverty
reduction, shared prosperity and sustainability depends on whether Vietnam will seize
emerging opportunities and manage critical risks. On the one hand, persistent ethnic minority
poverty, rapid population aging, a volatile global environment and macroeconomic vulnerabilities,
governance weaknesses and the growing environmental footprint and vulnerability to climate
change pose risks to Vietnam reaching its full potential. On the other hand, key opportunities
exist to reignite productivity led growth by reinvigorating structural transformation and agricultural
productivity growth, creating an environment for vibrant private sector growth, leveraging global
integration and reaping the benefits of rapid urbanization.

5.	Opportunities
Reinvigorating structural transformation: Enhancing the prosperity for the bottom 40 percent
rests in large part on the implementation of reforms to return the economy to a productivity-
led growth path. Since a considerable share of Vietnam’s labor force employed in relatively
low productivity agriculture, unlocking future productivity growth can to some extent rely on
reinvigorated structural transformation with continued sectoral shifts of workers into higher
productivity sectors and activities, especially in manufacturing and services. This will require steps
to ensure a competitive environment for manufacturing and service sector in terms of provision of
quality infrastructure and conducive regulatory and institutional environment. It also puts attention
on modernizing agriculture –where Vietnam also enjoys strong comparative advantages- to boost
labor productivity and deepen and extend agricultural value chains, including by fostering forward
linkages with food processing industries.

Creating an environment for vibrant private sector growth: At the same time, there are also
great opportunities to foster within sector and within firm productivity growth. Further restructuring
of state enterprise sector remains crucial in this respect, but perhaps even more critical is
the creation of a more enabling environment where private sector firms have even access to
productive resources and face competitive pressure to innovate and improve efficiency. This
requires broad structural reforms aimed at creating effective and efficient factor markets, mainly
for land and capital, an investment-friendly business climate and quality regulatory environment
and enforcement.

Leveraging global and regional integration: Vietnam continues to enjoy strong comparative
advantages that could propel further foreign investment and export driven growth, especially in
context of further global and regional integration. Making most of upcoming trade agreements,
such as the TPP, ASEAN AEC and the EU FTA both in terms of greater market access but
perhaps more importantly in terms of facilitating domestic reforms presents a key opportunity for
Vietnam. While the direct gains of trade and investment are apparent in Vietnam’s remarkable
export performance, there is room to garner indirect effects. This would require creating an
environment where the potential productivity gains associated with foreign direct investment and
a competitive export sector transpire more broadly across the economy in the form of forward
and backward linkages with domestic firms, technology and innovation spill overs and increased
competition.

Reaping the benefits while mitigating the cost of urbanization: Vietnam remains one of the most
rapidly urbanizing countries in the World. Having doubled over the last 25 years, Vietnam’s urban
population is projected to double once again in the next 30 years. By 2025 about half of Vietnam’s
population is projected to reside in metropolitan areas. Urbanization holds significant promise
in terms of fostering agglomeration and economic density (which in turn boost productivity) but
76   Sustaining Success


also significant risks. Without effective and integrated urban planning and adequate investment in
urban infrastructure and service delivery, Vietnam could see these positive impact of urbanization
reverse course. Vietnam’s major cities are already experiencing unprecedented traffic congestion,
pressure on core municipal services and the urban environment. Ensuring well managed cities
and scaling up of urban infrastructure and services as well as connecting cities with each other
and the global economy will be essential to reaping the benefits and mitigating the costs of
urbanization.

6.	Risks
Persistent ethnic minority poverty and welfare gaps: Ethnic minority poverty is a growing and
persistent challenge and the most significant risk to the elimination of extreme poverty in Vietnam.
Already today ethnic minorities account for 60 percent of the remaining poor and this share will
grow further over the coming years. Eliminating extreme poverty in Vietnam will therefore largely
(and increasingly) hinge on closing persistent welfare gaps of ethnic minorities. These remaining
poor are harder to reach; they face difficult challenges — of isolation, limited assets, low levels of
education, poor health status—and poverty reduction among ethnic minorities has become less
responsive to economic growth in recent years. To mitigate this risk it is important to consider
specific and targeted investments in ethnic minority communities, especially in terms of providing
inclusive public services (water and sanitation, nutrition, education).

Volatile global environment and macroeconomic vulnerabilities: Vietnam’s efforts
to sustain poverty reduction and shared prosperity face the risk macroeconomic shocks
and volatility. While global integration may hold the key to prosperity, it also intensifies
vulnerabilities to external shocks. Indeed, Vietnam experienced significant turbulence
in recent years. While some of the economic difficulties have originated from external
developments—an unprecedented economic boom caused by massive foreign capital
inflows, followed by an external demand shock triggered by the global financial crisis—the
episodes of economic disturbances were exacerbated by sharp swings in macroeconomic
policy stance. Recent years have seen macroeconomic stability restored, but rising public
debt, low forex reserves and lingering asset quality problems present macroeconomic
vulnerabilities. Fiscal consolidation, a gradual move towards using inflation as a nominal
anchor with greater exchange rate flexibility and more decisive measures to resolve NPLs,
ensure adequate capitalization and further consolidate the banking sector would all help
bolster macroeconomic resilience – a key prerequisite for sustained growth and prosperity.

Growing environmental footprint and vulnerability to climate change: Rapidly increasing air
and water pollution and GHG emissions impact the quality and health of both urban and rural
households and also hamper efforts to meet Vietnam’s commitment to global emission targets.
The degradation of Vietnam’s natural resource assets pose additional risks to sustainable gains
in poverty reduction and shared prosperity. With most of the poor relying on these assets (e.g.
agricultural land) as their main source of income the sustainable use of these assets is important
to control the vulnerability of the natural resource dependent households to shocks. Vietnam is
also vulnerable to natural hazards and climate change, such as typhoons, floods and droughts.
Vietnam has incurred significant costs and loss of life due to variable weather patterns. Vietnam will
increasingly bear such setbacks if the degradation of natural systems is not addressed, as these
systems are important for resilience. The shortcomings in the current mechanisms for planning
and disaster preparedness, response and recovery make Vietnam vulnerable to additional losses
due to climate change.

Governance weaknesses: While Vietnam’s existing governance structure has facilitated economic
growth and poverty reduction during the past decades, there is a substantial risk that governance
weaknesses will constrain future growth and social outcomes. Government effectiveness is being
hindered by both horizontal and vertical fragmentation and blurry boundaries between private and
public spheres which result in a lack of transparency and accountability in decision making and
distortions in resource allocation. How Vietnam manages the transition process and the shifting
boundaries between the state and the emerging private sector will fundamentally shape Vietnam’s
future economy, state and society.

Rapidly aging population: Vietnam has reaped the benefits of a demographic dividend in recent
decades, with a large bulge in the share of the population of working age resulting from a steep
decline in fertility. Now the country faces the downside—a population that is aging at one the fastest
rates ever seen worldwide. The working age population as a share of the overall population has
already peaked and is projected to decline in absolute terms within two decades. This situation
will be transformative in several ways. First, it means that one factor in the country’s past rapid
growth has faded. Second, the growth in the old-age population will place new demands on
service delivery. This includes means a rapid shift in the profile of the disease burden facing the
health system. It also poses the danger of a rise in poverty among the old-age population.

7.	 Priorities for poverty reduction, shared prosperity and sustainability
There are seven key priorities for achieving further progress in poverty reduction, shared
prosperity and sustainability in Vietnam. These priorities are aimed at making the most of
Vietnam’s opportunities while mitigating some of the identified risks that could undermine future
gains in poverty reduction, shared prosperity and sustainability. The proposed agenda cuts
across many areas that affect the economy and perhaps more importantly the welfare of the poor
and bottom 40. This relatively broad agenda reflects the complexity of Vietnam’s development
challenges and opportunities. It posits that investments in a broad set of productive endowments
are needed for Vietnam to reach its aspirations. Effective market institutions and good governance
(institutional capital), quality infrastructure (physical capital), a productive labor force with relevant
skills (human capital) and sustainable use of Vietnam’s abundant natural resource asset (natural
capital) are all critical ingredients of future growth and prosperity. While board in terms of the areas
covered, the analysis suggest focused efforts within individual priority areas.

While the agenda is relatively broad not all priorities are equally important. There are two
main criteria that are used to determine the relative importance of the proposed priorities. The
first criterion is the expected impact on poverty reduction, shared prosperity and sustainability.
In judging impact, the approach takes into account the critically of the priority to addressing
constraints to achieving the twin goals as well as the degree of urgency with emphasis given to
those priorities that require short term action, defined as the next five years, coinciding with period
of the upcoming Country Partnership Framework. The second criterion is synergies between
priorities, e.g. whether a given priorities would affect the twin goals through multiple, cross-cutting
channels. An example is reform of factor markets for land and capital, which through their impact
on allocation of resources and investment affect productivity of farms and firms and would have
substantial positive spillovers and benefits in terms overall growth prospects of Vietnam’s economy.
While anchored in evidence and analysis, this prioritization exercise relies in an important ways on
judgement and benefitted from a process of consultations with the country team, the government
and other stakeholders (a summary of consultations is provided in Annex 1).

There are important synergies and linkages between these different priorities. Beyond
their individual relevance, many of the priorities are complementary and mutually reinforcing.
A few simple examples illustrate this. Education and skill development are an important
prerequisite for economic growth and especially gains in labor productivity. Closing the
education gap between the poor and non-poor is also a central element of the inclusion
agenda, given the sharp drop in enrolment rates among children of poorer households and
ethnic minorities, in particular at secondary and tertiary levels. But a skilled labor force can
only be productive if there are a sufficient number of quality jobs. Job creation in turn hinges
on functioning market institutions, including sound fiscal management, a stable and efficient
financial system, and functioning markets for land use rights that ensure the most productive
firms and farms have access to the resources they need to flourish and expand. At the same
time, ensuring environmental sustainability and mitigating climate change and disaster risks
is key to preserving productive assets and jobs, especially in natural resource-intensive
sectors, including in agriculture, which remain a key livelihood source, especially for the poor
and bottom 40.

Priority 1: Expand inclusion of ethnic minorities	
Addressing persistent ethnic minority poverty is the critical poverty challenge. Although
poverty measured by the $1.90-a-day line, has already been all but eliminated, substantial
numbers of people still fall below the national poverty line. Projections indicate that
approximately 84 percent of Vietnam’s remaining poverty, measured using the national line)
will be ethnic minorities by 2020. By the spirit of the twin goals, ethnic minorities constitute
the core remaining “extreme poverty” challenge in Vietnam.

Members of Vietnam’s 52 ethnic minority groups have historically been much poorer
than members of the majority Kinh group and the Hoa (Chinese) ethnic group. Very large
gaps in socioeconomic between ethnic minorities and the Kinh/Hoa are evident in the earliest
data (from the 1989 census), reflecting a longstanding divide. Analysis shows that from 1989
forward the conditions of ethnic minorities have advanced substantially, and in a comparison
of experiences of ethnic minorities around the world, Vietnam stands out as a case where
minorities have shared to a great extent in the benefits of overall economic growth.54

Despite progress, ethnic minorities remain disproportionately poor. The most recent
data from various sources provides reason for alarm: child malnutrition rates for ethnic
minorities remain flat, progress on ethnic minority poverty reduction has stalled, and infant
mortality rates for ethnic minorities have actually increased. These developments indicate
that growth alone cannot be counted on to boost ethnic minorities out of poverty.




54	The causes of poverty of ethnic minorities in Vietnam has been the subject of a large number of studies, e.g., ADB (2003),
DFID and UNDP (2003), Oxfam and ActionAid (2009), and World Bank (2009, 2012). A series of studies have carried out
statistical decompositions of majority-minority differences in consumption or earnings, including van de Valle and Gunewardena
(2001), Baulch et al (2007), Baulch et al (2010), and Dang (2012). Hall and Patrinos (2012) include Vietnam in a book-length
treatment of poverty of ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples around the world. A comprehensive survey of the literature on
these gaps is found in the Vietnam 2035 study. The discussion presented here is limited to some key issues.

The persistence of ethnic minority poverty is the product of disadvantages across a
broad set of domains. These include social exclusion and lack of ability in the Vietnamese
language; geographical isolation and low mobility; limited access to quality land; low levels
of educational attainment and systemic obstacles to educational advancement; poor health
and nutrition; and limited service access. The Vietnamese government has recognized
the challenge of ethnic minority poverty, and commitments to promote ethnic minority
development are prominent in recent government decrees, the draft 2016-2020 Socio-
economic Development Plan, and the 2013 Constitution.

There is no special ethnic minority path out of poverty. A Bank study found that ethnic
minorities who have moved out of poverty follow paths very much like those of successful
Kinh and Hoa. They move from subsistence agriculture to pursue cash crop production
and activities including aquaculture and forestry, diversify into off-farm activities, and then
investing more in their children’s education. However, the combination of disadvantages
faced by ethnic minorities has limited the number who have followed this path.

In practice, much of the policy effort towards ethnic minorities has focused on ethnic
minority education, infrastructure (particularly local roads) in ethnic minority areas, and
livelihoods interventions to encourage ethnic minority productive activities. Rigorous
evidence shows that schools are effective in closing educational achievement gaps for ethnic
minorities and that rural infrastructure boosts ethnic minority incomes. Evidence is thin on
the effectiveness of livelihoods interventions for ethnic minorities.55 Some such efforts have
lacked a clear rationale or have not been well tailored to ethnic minorities.




55	 Unpublished findings from the Young Lives study show the effectiveness of schools for ethnic minorities, and Mu and Van
de Walle (2009) shows the impact of rural roads for ethnic minorities.

Given the concentration of ethnic minorities in agriculture and natural resource
activities, one part of policy should be aimed at improving their productivity. This could
include renewed livelihood efforts, coupled with careful and critical evaluation to determine
what particularly types of initiatives are successful. Support is also need to ensure that their
natural resource-based safety net remains resilient to weather and other shocks and that they
are not subject to displacement as a result of other land consolidation efforts or infrastructure
investments. Other policy changes to boost productivity in these areas, with reference to
ethnic minorities, are discussed under Priority 4 in this document. Additionally, tourism has
untapped potential as a driver of economic activity in some areas with substantial ethnic
minority populations.

Policy should also draw from the recognition that over the long term, migration will be
a pathway to economic integration for many ethnic minorities. Vietnamese language
ability among ethnic minorities, previously an obstacle to migration, is improving among
the younger generation, and over time ethnic minorities will develop migrant networks that
will ease the path of future migrants. The prospect of migration points to a need to focus on
providing equality of opportunity for the next generation ethnic minority children.

Three interrelated circumstances generate a triangle of inequality of opportunity for
ethnic minority children: poor education, malnutrition, and low access to sanitation.
The higher poverty of ethnic minorities can be attributed largely to low educational attainment.
The modest levels of ethnic minority enrollment at tertiary and upper secondary levels are a
consequence of many factors, including childhood malnutrition, which is in turn driven by a
set of causes including poor sanitation. Completing the cycle, children who grow up in poor
households are much more likely to drop out of school early, be malnourished, and lack
adequate sanitation. In these three areas, policy interventions could close the opportunity
gap. These interventions should be implemented on the areas where ethnic minorities are
concentrated—the Northern Mountains, the Central Highlands—and be particularly targeted
at ethnic minorities specifically.

Improving education access for ethnic minority children is a first policy priority to
boost equality of opportunity. High-quality early childhood education programs can boost
preparation, particularly for ethnic minority children. Placing teaching assistants who know
the local language in the first few years of primary school can ease the transition for children
who do not learn Vietnamese at home. And financially supporting ethnic minority children
can raise attendance rates in upper secondary school.

Improving nutrition is a second priority. Early childhood nutrition has substantial effects on
early cognitive development and readiness to learn in school. Despite existing programs, high
rates of malnutrition persist among ethnic minority children. Two of the most important factors
in undernutrition are inadequate knowledge about the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding,
complementary feeding practices, and micronutrients, and the lack of time women have for
childcare and for themselves during pregnancy.

A third policy priority is sanitation. A major driver of malnutrition is lack of improved
sanitation facilities. Poor access to sanitation is also one factor behind the high levels of
infant mortality among ethnic minorities. A national sanitation program can achieve universal
usage of improved sanitation. Policies, targets, and incentives under such a program should
be aligned to promote community-wide behavior change, including targeted support for the
84   Sustaining Success


poor, such as low-interest household financing and/or targeted output-based subsidies.
Affordable and accessible toilets provided through local private suppliers can move more
people from open defecation and unimproved sanitation to improved sanitation. Community
mobilization and behavioral-change communications can support a new social norm within
communities.

In developing programs to address ethnic minority poverty more generally the
government could benefit from experimenting, monitoring, and evaluating, since in
many cases the evidence on “what works” is thin. Pilot approaches could be carefully
evaluated before programs are expanded to scale. And in many cases initiatives could draw
on promising new insights from behavioral economics. Choices about sending children to
school, feeding infants, and constructing latrines are determined by a variety of factors other
than cost–benefit calculations. Interventions that seek to “nudge” behavior can be effective
and cost-efficient.

Finally, lack of voice in policy development and program implementation has been a
factor in the persistence of ethnic minority poverty. At the central level, relevant policy
is chiefly in the hands of the Committee on Ethnic Minority Affairs (CEMA). Few individuals
in the CEMA organization at a high level, however, are ethnic minorities themselves.
District and commune-level authorities, even in areas with substantial populations of ethnic
minorities are typically dominated by members of the ethnic majority groups. Consequently,
ethnic minorities typically have little role in local decision making. Civil society organizations
advocating for ethnic minorities have a low profile and are discouraged by the existing legal
framework. Opening opportunities for ethnic minority organizations and promoting ethnic
minorities in government bodies could help make policies towards ethnic minorities more
effective.

Priority 2: Build productive infrastructure and competitive cities

Sustained investment in and effective management of infrastructure assets is an
important priority to prevent emerging infrastructure bottlenecks from becoming a
constraint to growth and job creation. Ensuring reliable electricity supply, efficient logistics
and transportation, access to cost effective and reliable telecommunication services are
critical preconditions especially for the development of high value added manufacturing and
service sectors. Economic growth is putting increasing pressure on Vietnam’s infrastructure.
Freight volumes and electricity demand are projected to expand rapidly, driven by and in turn
driving Vietnam’s future growth performance. Meanwhile, Vietnamese cities are growing fast
and a key challenge for municipal governments is to rapidly put in place the infrastructure
to support economic activities, ease urban mobility and provide water, sanitation and other
municipal services to the growing urban population. There are also infrastructure gaps in
rural areas. Priority infrastructure there include investments that would expand access water
and sanitation especially in poor and remote and poor communities. Accordingly, Vietnam’s
Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2011–2020) places high priority on infrastructure
development to achieve high-quality and sustainable economic growth. The Socio-Economic
Development Plan 2016-20 (SEDP) estimates demands for investment capital at about
US$139.4 billion, equal to about 10-12 percent of GDP per year between 2015 and 2020.

Further development of connective infrastructure is critical to make most of the
opportunities coming with Vietnam’s further integration into global value chains.
Vietnam is ranked highest on the World Logistics Performance Index among the lower
middle-income countries, but it lags behind its higher-income competitors, including China,
Malaysia, and Thailand. Despite its reliance on road transportation (which accounts for
three quarters of its inland freight traffic in 2014), Vietnam has only 525 km of operational
international-standard expressways. Highway congestion is estimated to cost beneficial
86    Sustaining Success


cargo owners (BCOs) $274 million in 2020; the economic cost of congestion to all users is
estimated to be $1.7 billion annually. Intercity truck speeds in Vietnam average only about
35km/hour. A fragmented trucking industry delivers substandard service to BCOs relative
to peer countries.56 Rail and inland waterways are underdeveloped. Meanwhile, Vietnam’s
port and marine terminal system is highly fragmented, leading to overcapacity and poor
landside integration with other transport modes. Addressing these emerging logistics
bottlenecks will require development of multimodal transportation infrastructure (including
railway and waterways) using an integrated corridor approach; and modernizing logistics
services, including trucking industry, freight forwarding and warehousing as well as further
investments in the customs clearance system to make cross-border trade more efficient and
reliable (building on the implementation of the ASEAN single window).

In the power sector, electricity demand will continue to grow fast, necessitating sustained
investment in generation, transmission and distribution capacities to ensure sustainable,
reliable and affordable energy supply. It is anticipated that electricity demand will continue
to grow by 7-10% annually through 2030. This will require the installation of 25GW of new
generation capacity by 2020 and an additional 40-50 GW by 2030 (more than doubling the
current capacity of 35 GW). Meanwhile, the lack of cost-reflective electricity tariffs has eroded
the financial capacity of the sector and diminished incentives for private investment. On the
supply side, balancing economic growth and environmental and climate objectives will require
an efficient mix of different energy sources. With hydro already accounting for over 40 percent
of Vietnam’s generation capacity, renewable resource potential is now mostly solar and wind
but unlikely to be sufficient to fully meet future demand.57 Vietnam has estimated natural gas
reserves at around 600 billion cubic meters (bcm), largely offshore, currently underutilized
with production in 2013 at approximately 10 bcm. Large undeveloped gas reserves are located
offshore in the Malay - Tho Chu and Phu Khanh basin, in the center and south of Vietnam,
both with active development interest. Development of these offshore fields and integration
with combined cycle power generation is estimated to be cost-competitive with imported coal
fired power generation and would have positive balance of payments and carbon footprint
impacts. However timely development remains contingent upon mobilization of necessary
large-scale project finance and leveraging of capable strategic and technical partners. On the
demand side, Vietnam is one of the most energy inefficient economies in South East Asia.
Encouraging investments in more energy efficient technologies and infrastructure –including
through adequate, cost reflective pricing - could lower electricity demand thereby reducing the
need for upgrades in generation capacity (at a potentially lower cost).

In the water and sanitation sector, lack of access to clean water and particularly to
adequate sanitation facilities is a key driver of both child mortality and malnutrition.
Despite great progress over time, many Vietnamese households do not have adequate
water and sanitation. Overall in rural areas, 33% lack sanitary latrines and 39% do not have
access to clean water.58 Those without access are disproportionately poor and ethnic minority
households. There are also growing urban sanitation concerns: only 10% of wastewater
and 4% of fecal sludge is treated. In communities without improved latrines, children are
often exposed to bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites that cause intestinal infection. Chronic
infection limits the ability of the body to absorb nutrients and reduces growth. Children who are

malnourished in part due to poor water and sanitation are much more likely to have cognitive
deficiencies and drop out of school. In Vietnam, stunting rates are high precisely among the
communities that are most likely to lack improved sanitation facilities.59 A WSP study found
that poor sanitation causes considerable financial and economic losses in Vietnam. Financial
losses---reflecting expenditure or income losses resulting from poor sanitation— are equal
to roughly 0.5% of annual GDP, while overall population welfare losses are equal to 1.3%
of GDP.60 Experience has demonstrated that expanding access is not entirely a question
of providing infrastructure. Complementary to infrastructure is an adequate regulatory
framework, and well-designed targeted support for the poor. Additionally, in regards to rural
sanitation—which is chiefly a question of private infrastructure—community mobilization and
behavioral change campaigns are needed to support a new social norms within communities.

Finally, Vietnam’s rapid urbanization process is intensifying pressures on urban
infrastructure and services. Drawn by the economic opportunities offered by Vietnam’s
major urban centers rural-urban migration continues unabatedly. Having doubled over the
last 25 years, Vietnam’s urban population is projected to double once again in the next 30
years. All of Vietnam’s population growth is now taking place in cities. This coming urban
age holds potentially significant economic benefits for Vietnam. Cities tend to have higher
productivity due to economies of scale and clustering of firms allowing for knowledge spill-
overs, innovation and dense ecosystems of service providers, suppliers and thick labor
markets in which firms can flourish.

While urbanization initially achieved high levels of density, many cities are now
experiencing unprecedented (and in some cases uncoordinated) land expansion. Urban
land increased by about 50 percent between 2000 and 2010 while urban residential land
almost doubled during the same period. Density fell from 19.4 urban residents per hectare
in 2005 to 18.6 in 2010, despite more 3 million city dwellers. Low density development
increases the cost of municipal service delivery and dampens agglomeration benefits.

Relatively low and declining urban density is aggravated by the lack of efficient mass
public transportation systems. As a result, Vietnam’s urban areas are fragmented and do not
function like economically and physically integrated metropolitan regions. And urban mobility
needs will continue to change. Not only will the growing urban population exert pressure but
with rising household incomes (and likely decline of car prices after the elimination of import
duties in 2018 under the ASEAN free trade agreement) cars are likely to increasingly replace
the now ubiquitous motorcycles as the preferred mode of transport. If such patterns persist,
Vietnam’s cities will be overwhelmed by traffic congestion and emissions without reaping the
full benefits of agglomeration.

Without effective and integrated urban planning and adequate investment in urban
infrastructure and service delivery, Vietnam could see these positive agglomeration
economies reverse course. Foreshadowing these risks, Vietnam’s major cities are already
experiencing unprecedented traffic congestion and pressure on core municipal services,
as urban transportation, water and sanitation systems, health and education services, and
other physical and social infrastructure have struggled to keep pace. Moreover, rapidly rising
urban populations strain natural resources and pollute the environment.

These significant national and subnational infrastructure needs will have to be
addressed under tight financing constraint. Over recent years Vietnam’s public debt has
risen rapidly limiting the room for further reliance on debt financing. These existing debt
pressures are amplified by Vietnam’s declining access to concessional external borrowing
which has served as major source for infrastructure investment to date. Meanwhile, a steady
decline in the revenue-to-GDP combined with rising recurrent spending have constrained
fiscal space for needed investment in physical infrastructure. After peaking at 11 percent
of GDP in 2010, government budget capital spending has fallen to estimated 6 percent of
GDP in 2015. Moreover, at the subnational level few subnational governments can raise
sufficient revenue to finance infrastructure on their own, leaving many heavily dependent on
the central government transfers.

These tight financing constraints reinforce a focus on institutional reforms to enhance
efficient planning, selection, financing and implementation of infrastructure projects and
better coordination across levels of government. Fragmentation of public infrastructure
investment, poor master planning and project design, lack of capability in site management
and supervision, and delays and cost overruns have all contributed to inefficiencies in public
investment. With provincial governments now account for about 80 percent of total public
investment, provinces often select and undertake their own infrastructure projects often in
isolation, without employing a strategic approach linked to national priorities and with little
regard to supply-demand considerations. This has resulted in over-investment and duplication
of infrastructure assets while at the same time limiting resources available for investment
in national trunk infrastructure and spatially and functionally integrated infrastructure

development.61 Stronger mechanisms and incentives to ensure cross-provincial and cross-
functional coordination especially for investment in trunk infrastructure would go a long way
to achieving greater returns.

In addition, Vietnam aims to mobilize more private sector participation in infrastructure
financing and delivery. While the government has put emphasis on attracting private
investors to infrastructure sectors, interest is dampened by a challenging legal and regulatory
environment and cumbersome approval processes. A fairly rigid approach to risk sharing
between public and private sector pose often an impediment to greater private sector
participation. Nevertheless, Vietnam’s PPP projects have averaged about $1 billion per year
from 2000 to 201462, mostly for build–operate–transfer (BOT) projects in the power sector. To
strengthen the legal framework for PPPs, the Government of Vietnam in 2015 promulgated
Decree No. 15/2015/ND-CP (Decree 15) on public-private partnerships (PPP) to help address
Vietnam’s infrastructure challenges and provide an enabling business environment that
promotes private sector participation in long-term strategic public infrastructure development.

In terms of managing urban growth, integrated urban planning, effective land markets
and investments in municipal infrastructure are crucial to maximizing the economic
benefits of agglomeration and density while mitigating risks of congestion and costly
urban sprawl. The core of urban policy reform is the need to let urban land markets emerge.
Better managing land use and zoning is crucial to avoid environmentally- and economically-
costly urban sprawl. Reforming land institutions — like strengthening land registration
and adopting market land valuation— and discontinuing land-for-development deals are
priorities to reduce excessive and fragmented urban land conversion. This would need to
be underpinned by integrated urban planning and investment in municipal service delivery.
Strengthening coordination between urban development and transport planning could help
achieve transit-oriented development and promote high-density mixed-use development
around (intermodal) mass transit corridors and systems. Finally, reforms of the system of
intergovernmental relations need to continue to empower local authorities –both financially
and administratively- to be responsive to local needs while strengthening accountability
mechanisms and performance incentives. This could include clarifying expenditure
responsibilities, expanding revenue autonomy (including development of a property tax
system) and putting in place a prudent framework for municipal borrowing.

Developing a portfolio of cities comprising of large and secondary cities that can
facilitate effective rural-urban transformation. Besides an absence of a well-functioning
land markets, Vietnam will have to amplify economic density around large metropolitan
areas and secondary cities with demonstrated potential. It will have to shorten the economic
distance to large markets to enable specialization. And it will have to dissipate social division
in access to services between migrants and urban residents to encourage human capital
development for greater agglomeration economies. This will require a mindset change about
urbanization, the benefit will be agglomeration economies across a vibrant portfolio of towns

and cities performing complementary functions. Metropolises such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh
City will interact with the global economy and provide the urban diversity that encourages
learning, innovation, and new product development, connecting people and firms to the world.
Cities such as Can Tho, Da Nang and Hai Phong will allow producers both to benefit from
clustering because they can choose workers and materials from a bigger pool and to engage
in beneficial competition. These cities will be aggregators for the hinterland economy and be
part of global value chains. Towns such as Buon Ma Thuot in the Central Highlands, which is
famous for its coffee, will let firms and farms exploit plant-level scale economies by providing
roads (for inputs and outputs) and schools and other amenities (for workers’ families).

Priority 3: Strengthen economic management and market institutions
Enhancing the prosperity of the Bottom 40 percent rest in large part on the implementation
of reforms to return the economy to a productivity led growth path. The weakening
trend in private sector productivity growth reflects that redirecting resources to private
enterprises alone is not sufficient to create productivity growth, but needs to be accompanied
by strong market institutions. For private sector firms and markets, to work as they should,
they need strong market institutions, in particular rule-of-law, sound competition framework,
effective factor markets, quality regulations and transparent, efficient and fair enforcement.
In this regard, Vietnam’s institutional reform agenda remains unfinished. There is a growing
recognition that institutional legacies, incomplete market institutions, a cumbersome
investment climate have become impediments to growth, especially of the domestic private
sector. Despite recent improvements, available cross-country competitiveness assessments
show that Vietnam is lagging behind other countries, especially on dimensions related to the
policy and institutional environment. Firm surveys conducted in Vietnam also confirm that a
majority of firms perceive government conduct to be uneven and favoring connected firms in
the enforcement of regulations, government procurement and allocation of land use rights.
While benefiting individual firms, these policy distortions undermine efficiency and provide
incentives to firms to engage in rent seeking rather than productive activities. Vietnam has
the potential to join the ranks of industrialized countries within a generation, but this will
require tough choices and actions to deepen market institutions and create an environment
more conducive to private sector led growth. This entails steps to i) solidify recent gains in
macroeconomic stability, ii) bolster financial sector stability while enhancing the sector’s role
in engendering more efficient allocation of capital, iii) deepen reforms of the state owned
sector and iv) creating a more levelled playing field, quality regulations and enforcement.

First, maintaining macroeconomic stability and resilience is a necessary prerequisite
for sustained growth and private sector development. Vietnam’s deeper global
integration and further transition to a market-based economy will expose the economy to
more macroeconomic volatility, underscoring the importance of sound macroeconomic
management to safeguard against shocks.

Despite relatively resilient growth, Vietnam’s recent past has been characterized by
recurrent bouts of macroeconomic instability. Unlike other emerging markets, Vietnam did
not experience sharp swings in economic activity. However, despite Vietnam’s more resilient
growth record, macroeconomic volatility has been more severe than in other economies in
the region and at Vietnam’s income level. While some of the economic difficulties originated
from external shocks—overheating caused by massive foreign capital inflows, followed
by an external demand shock triggered by the global financial crisis—macroeconomic
turmoil was exacerbated by stop-and-go macroeconomic policies, including erratic credit
                                                           Vietnam Systematic Country Diagnostic 2016        91


growth and fiscal expansion. While tentative stability has been restored, the economy still
suffers from vulnerabilities built up as a by-product of past policies. Deep-seated banking
sector vulnerabilities, sizable fiscal imbalances, high and rapidly rising public debt, volatile
fiscal revenues and inefficiencies of public expenditure, especially public investment pose
headwinds to future stability and growth.

Solidifying macroeconomic stability will require fiscal consolidation while tackling
vulnerabilities in the banking and SOE sector. Reining in fiscal imbalances and creating
fiscal space to address potential contingent liabilities while safeguarding critical social
and investment spending, would mitigate macroeconomic risks and facilitate achievement
of development goals. Moving gradually toward using inflation as a nominal anchor with
greater exchange rate flexibility would provide a monetary policy framework more conducive
to maintaining stability and buffering external shocks. Building on recent gains in stabilizing
the banking sector, more decisive measures could be undertaken to resolve NPLs, ensure
adequate capitalization and further consolidate the banking sector.

Vietnam faces a significant fiscal reform agenda to rein in accumulated imbalances,
enhance domestic revenue mobilization and strengthen expenditure efficiency. The
average fiscal deficit during 2009-14 increased to about 5 percent of GDP, markedly higher
than the 1.2 percent during 2003-2008. After large increases in public debt over the past
few years, fiscal consolidation is important to stabilize and then gradually reduce the public
debt, through a combination of both revenue and expenditure measures. On the revenue
side, coordinated tax policy and administration efforts are needed to stabilize the revenue-
to-GDP ratio while creating a balanced tax structure suitable for an emerging middle income
economy. On the expenditure side, necessary reforms should focus on enhancing spending
efficiency, including of public investment and ensuring sustainable financing models in key
sectors such as health, education, and pension. In addition, Vietnam faces increasing risks
92   Sustaining Success


on its public debt portfolio. Having benefited from access to highly concessional long-term
multilateral financing over recent decades, it must now increasingly confront important policy
trade-offs and choices in managing the costs and risks associated with available domestic
and external financing sources.

Fiscal policy reforms could be underpinned by steps to strengthen the institutional
foundations for sound fiscal and public financial management. Coordination between
the main institutions of fiscal management, both at the center (Ministry of Finance and
Ministry of Planning and Investment), and between the central and provincial governments,
is relatively weak and could be strengthened. In addition, further efforts are needed to
enhance the comprehensiveness of the budget given the still large number of fiscal and
quasi-fiscal activities that are not reflected in the core fiscal accounts. This could be
accompanied by efforts to modernize budgeting procedures (along the lines of the recently
adopted budget code), including instilling a more medium term perspective in fiscal policy
and stronger systems of expenditure prioritization, underpinned by improved information
systems and fiscal transparency. A more unified debt management function would help to
both use the opportunities and manage the risks that will arise with Vietnam’s transition
to a more market based financing model. Finally, the system of intergovernmental fiscal
relations also deserves attention to ensure fiscal resources and authorities are appropriately
distributed across central, provincial and commune levels in a way that encourages efficient
delivery of services, including increased revenue autonomy; review of allocation norms and
intergovernmental transfers and more autonomy especially for provinces with high fiscal
capacity like Hanoi and HMC to access borrowing from domestic markets.

Second, a stable and efficient financial system is crucial for allocating Vietnam’s
high national savings—32 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2014—toward
productive investment. Vietnam’s has a fairly large financial system for a low middle-income
country. But the system is relatively undiversified and continues to be dominated by banking
sector with banking sector asset accounting for about 135 percent of Vietnam’s GDP and 80
percent of total financial system assets. Moreover, despite its relatively large size the impact
of the financial system on long-term economic growth happens more through improving
the productivity of capital rather than through simply increasing capital intensity. Boosting
credit growth may induce short term economic growth but if capital allocation is impaired
this may lead to poor investment and asset quality and hence intensify risks of instability.
For the financial system to support sustainable, long term growth, it needs to face incentives
to distribute capital and risks efficiently, so that growing credit is allocated to productive
enterprises and investments.

State presence in the banking sector remains large and involves both direct and
indirect ownership links. Five major state-owned commercial banks continue to account for
almost 40 percent of banking sector assets in addition to cross-ownership of the state, SOEs
and State Owned Commercial Banks (SOCBs) in several other commercial banks, which
undermines the corporate governance of the banking sector and amplifies the potential for
systemic risks. The share of foreign banks in total commercial banking assets has remained
small and relatively stable at 10 percent, partly reflecting the statutory foreign ownership limit
in the banking sector.

Despite growth in recent years, Vietnam’s capital markets remain shallow. Corporate
bond and equity markets - a major source of investment financing and long-term capital in
many middle-income economies- are at a nascent stage of development. The domestic fixed-
income market is small, dominated by government bonds. The Social Security Fund (SSF)
is the only institutional investor of significant size, managing pension reserves amounting
to 6.5 percent of GDP. Equity markets have grown rapidly but are still at an early stage of
development. While the number of companies listed in the two exchanges has increased
dramatically, primarily due to the “equitization” of SOEs, total equity market capitalization
is relatively small at 20 percent of GDP, reflecting the fact that listed firms in Vietnam are
generally small.

The banking system is still struggling to overcome vulnerabilities that have built up as
a result of a credit boom in the recent past. Erratic credit growth has been a major source
of macroeconomic instability. A rapid credit expansion through the 2008 global financial
crisis was followed by a credit squeeze in 2011, triggered by a decline in real estate prices
and economic slow-down. As a result, the banking system accumulated a significant amount
of non-performing loans (NPLs), and several small banks have experienced liquidity and
solvency problems and there are lingering concerns with regards to the overall capitalization
of the system. Despite looser monetary policy in 2012, credit growth remained sluggish
reflecting strained banks’ balance sheets and the need for deleveraging. The banking sector
continues to exhibit lingering asset quality risks. System-wide nonperforming loans (NPLs)
are reported to have declined to about 3 percent of total loans, but this is likely to understate
the true level of problem loans. Part of the reduction in reported NPLs is due to transfers
94    Sustaining Success


of NPLs (equal to about 3.8 percent of gross loans) to the Vietnam Asset Management
Company (VAMC).63 While Banks are required to gradually provision against assets
transferred to VAMC, the underlying credit and associated capital impairment risks have not
been fully eliminated. In addition, resolution of NPLs by VAMC has progressed slowly, with
less than 5 percent of the transferred bad debts resolved. Efforts in this regard have been
hampered by the absence of an enabling legal framework for insolvency and asset titling as
well as for protecting VAMC and commercial bank staff against possible lawsuits arising from
potential losses to the state in case a fair-market-price-mechanism cannot be established.
However, new regulations that took effect on October 15, 2015, introduced a fair-market-
value mechanism for NPL purchase by VAMC and allow greater flexibility in the disposal
of NPLs, including through direct sale of bad debts. More recently, credit has expanded in
2015, reaching 20 percent of GDP, and the target is the same for 2016. This again poses
stability risks that could undermine longer term financial intermediation.

Putting the financial sector on a more stable footing and enabling healthy financial
intermediation will require addressing a complex array of institutional and regulatory
factors. Given the central role of the banking sector in the economy the immediate priority is
to address remaining vulnerabilities in the banking sector. While the SBV has taken steps to
contain risks of banking sector instability, deeper structural reforms remain important. These
include more decisive steps to resolve NPLs, enhance governance structures and risk
management capacity, mitigate connected lending practices, and improve financial reporting
and supervision. To achieve this loan classification and loan-loss provisioning will be brought
in line with international standards and the legal framework for creditor rights and asset
resolution will have to be further strengthened. Improving the regulatory and supervisory
framework under which banks operate is critical to transparency and accountability in
the banking sector and to strengthen incentives for Banks to become more competitive,
especially in the context of Vietnam’s further integration in the regional and global economy.
Vietnam’s three supervisory agencies lack independence, supervisory powers, and have
weak technical capacity. Despite improvements since 2011, on-site inspection is still deficient
and the largest banks have not been inspected in accordance with international financial
reporting standards. The supervision of large state-owned financial institutions is impaired
by conflicts of interest, as supervisory agencies frequently exercise ownership rights in the
same institutions that they supervise. Accordingly it is important to ensure adequate systemic
risk monitoring and enhancing the use of adequate macro-prudential tools.

A strengthened financial sector will contribute towards expanding financial inclusion
in Vietnam. Exclusion from the formal financial sector has been shown broadly to intensify
income inequality, as the “unbanked” pay higher costs for financial services or are unable
to invest, consume or plan adequately for financial risks. The World Bank’s 2014 Global
Findex survey found that only 31 percent of Vietnamese adults held an account at a formal
institution. This rose from 21 percent in 2011 and although this is a substantial improvement
more needs to be done, particularly in rural areas where the number of Vietnamese adults
with access to formal financial services is much less than the national average.

transferred assets within five years (coinciding with the maturity of VAMC bonds).

The more medium term priority is to further develop capital markets and non-bank
financial institutions, which currently remain small and underutilized. The reliance on
the banking sector for long term credit and the slow development of capital markets also
undermines access to longer term financing in the economy. While the macroeconomic
situation appears to have stabilized since 2012, financial vulnerabilities still need to be
addressed by a coherent reform program. Healthy and liquid equity and bond markets
could help provide a more reliable source of long-term funding to the private sector and
improve corporate governance. Reforms in these markets could mitigate risks posed by an
overreliance on the banking sector and help improve the allocation of resources.

Third, deeper reforms of the SOE sector remain an important priority. Enhancing
incentives and creating an enabling environment for the restructuring of the state owned
sector remains an important economic reform priority for Vietnam. Overall, the SOE legal
framework has improved markedly with the issuance of a number of Laws, Decrees and
other legal documents in the last five years. Important changes were introduced by the
amendments to the Enterprise Law, passed in 2014 which aims at ensuring more equal
treatment of enterprises irrespective of ownership types as well as improved corporate
governance of SOEs. In 2014 the Law on Management and Use of State Capital Invested
in Production and Business and its associated Decrees laid the legal foundation for a more
effective ownership function and strengthened the overall management framework for SOE.
These improvements in the legal and regulatory framework are important, but the focus now
needs to shift towards ensuring consistent implementation. This includes further progress in
equitizing remaining SOEs (including divesting from controlling shares), continued divestment
from non-core assets, enhanced transparency and elimination of any preferential treatment
of SOEs.

Finally, creating a more competitive business climate is crucial for private sector and
productivity led growth and job creation and for Vietnam to take full advantage of the
opportunities offered by further global and regional integration. Available cross-country
competitiveness assessments show that Vietnam is lagging behind other countries, especially
on dimensions related to the policy and institutional environment. Vietnam’s performance
on structural policies in the Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment remains
slightly below the average for low income countries, even though it performs better in other
dimensions. While Vietnam’s ranking in the Doing Business survey has improved to 90th
position in 2016 (from 93rd in 2015) it remains below China, Thailand and Malaysia. In the
Global Competitiveness Index, although Vietnam has regained some ground, overall it has
fallen from 59th position in 2011-12 to 68th sin 2014/15 assessment.

Vietnam’s institutional environment remains an uneven playing field, considerably
reducing the pressure on and ability of domestic private sector firms to expand and
grow. Firm surveys consistently report that connections to the state are necessary to
succeed in business and that vested interests’ power is on the rise. For example, firms in the
PCI surveys report that state connections are critical in accessing contracts, land and other
resources. Faced with limited access to productive resources (foremost land and capital),
regulatory obstacles and red tape the vast majority of private firms are discouraged from
investing and expanding and many have gravitated toward lower productivity, less capital-
intensive activities. Most of the few existing larger firms outside the FDI sector are either
SOEs or private sector firms engaged in a web of interactions in which state authorities
provide direct and indirect support including preferential access to land and capital, while
firms in turn provide state authorities with opportunities to participate in and benefit from
commercial activities. This has muted pressures to innovate and improve efficiency while
attracting significant resources to activities that benefit from connections with the state
rather than to productive sectors and activities. Addressing inequalities in the regulatory
environment, access to finance, infrastructure and markets (i.e. level the playing field) and
removing the relative disadvantages the majority of private domestic sector face is crucial to
enabling these firms to become the engines of future productivity and employment growth.

While early liberalization has created competitive product markets factor markets –
for land and capital- remain subject to government intervention. As discussed earlier,
financial sector reforms are crucial not only to maintain financial stability but also to enable
more market driven financial intermediation and more efficient allocation of capital in the
economy. Vietnam has maintained exclusive state ownership of land. While there is legal
framework for land use rights which principally aims to mimic the efficiency of land property
rights and markets within the constraint of state ownership, in practice state authorities,
especially at the provincial level, remain heavily involved in the distribution of both rural
and urban commercial land. Provincial governments control the primary market for most
commercial plots while SOEs –many of which hold significant land use rights- are key players
in the secondary market. In the absence of clear market and price signals the allocation of
land is driven by administrative controls and vulnerable to inefficiencies at best and favoritism
at worst. The allocation of land, its ownership and management is an area in which reforms
would be most likely be arduous, requiring major institutional and governance changes. The
benefits of these reforms, however, would be cross-cutting for infrastructure development,
agriculture, urban development and environmental sustainability.

Going forward, deep and comprehensive trade agreements, such as TPP and the EU
FTA can serve as an external anchor for productivity enhancing structural reforms.
TPP is not only removing tariff barriers, but will also have tangible impacts on regulatory
quality, intellectual property rights, investor protection, competition, SOE management,
labor and environmental standards, food safety, public procurement and liberalization of
services, including financial services and telecommunications. While implementation of
these commitments will be particularly challenging for Vietnam –given its gradual reform
path and institutional legacies (e.g. large SOE sector, incomplete market institutions, etc.),
Vietnam has shown in the context of its accession to WTO that it is able to leverage external
commitments to advance domestic reforms, especially in challenging reforms areas.


Priority 4: Transform agriculture and use of natural assets
Agriculture (including fisheries and forests and the agro food system) plays an
important role in Vietnam and will continue to contribute to achieving the twin goals
in a sustainable manner. Although, reliance on agriculture is declining on average, there
is significant variation across and within regions. For example, there is significant decline
in agriculture as an income source in the Red River Delta and Northern Mountain areas,
while agriculture remains a leading source of income in the Mekong Delta and Central
Highlands. The natural resources that directly and indirectly contribute to agriculture also
remain an important part of the livelihood portfolio of marginalized households, including
ethnic minorities.

This priority focuses on measures needed to transform agriculture and promote the
sustainable use of natural assets. It emphasizes more market-driven production systems,
value addition, strengthening the role of private sector and agribusiness as a means to link
smallholder farmers to market and enhance productivity, and reduce environmental footprint
of subsector activities. It also calls for some economy-wide reforms especially in relation to
land consolidation and land markets, the operating conditions of state-owned companies,
policies and institutions associated with research and development, collaboration among
private entities, the role of government, and public spending in the relevant sectors. The
reform priority highlights the importance of using vertical integration, innovation, knowledge
of good practices, and modern technology to improve competitiveness in domestic and
international markets. The aim is to produce ‘more from less’, that is generate greater
economic value (including producer and consumer welfare) while using less human and
natural capital. This would increase productivity, enhance competitiveness, and help reduce
the environmental footprint of agriculture and other natural resource based industries.

Reform measures should support producers of agricultural and natural resource based
commodities to seize opportunities created by the changing consumption patterns.
As Vietnam’s middle class grows, there are opportunities in the domestic market resulting
from increased consumption of livestock, dairy and other sources of protein. There are
also changing consumption patterns for wood-based products and concerns regarding
sustainability. Going forward, the expanding domestic market will present opportunities
similar to export markets. To respond to these opportunities, landholders should have greater
choice and flexibility in land-uses. The government should lift some of the existing restrictions
on conversion of agricultural rice land and consider reallocating large areas of lowland for
cultivation of crops other than rice. This would help catalyze investment in agriculture and
promote diversification, which in turn would spur activities and employment in the agro-food
                                             Vietnam Systematic Country Diagnostic 2016       99


system. Complementing these measures should be improved access to finance, as this
would support adopting new and innovative practices. In the forest sector, access to technical
know-how, credit and opportunities to internalize public benefits from sectoral investments
(for example in sawnwood production or coastal forestry) would motivate positive changes
in forest management.

Land consolidation opportunities, that mitigate potential negative social impacts, will
be important for improving the production structure of agriculture. In 2011, 69 percent of
farm units were less than 0.5 hectares. For small landholders, land consolidation could help
upgrade their production systems to more commercial systems and benefit from economies
of scale. Amendments to policies that restrict land consolidation, such as the regulations
that place limits on the annual cropland holding sizes (which was three hectares in 2015
with some exception) and policies that designate the best farmland for rice production are
necessary to enable local entrepreneurs or other investors to optimize resource use.64 The
government needs to increase efforts such as those known as “small farms large fields”
which promote cooperative farming, or facilitate plot exchanges between households. In
some cases, households have leased out their land to companies and arranged for certain
household members to continue working on the professionally managed farms.65

Land consolidation should not, however, be equally applied across all rural areas of
Vietnam. In parts of the Northern Mountains and Central Highlands, where poor and ethnic
minority households reside in close proximity to forests, land consolidation may not result in
its intended benefits as many of these areas are not suitable for agricultural food crops. For
many of these communities limited access to alternatives and cultural practices create an
inextricable connection between them and the environment. They rely on natural resources
for a wide array of subsistence and economic services, including foods, medicines, fuel,
building materials, traditional handicrafts, and income generating activities. Many of these
communities also manage agroforestry systems which include perennial and subsistence
crops. For these households, key support is to ensure that their natural resource-based
safety net remains resilient to weather and other shocks. It is also important to ensure they
are not subject to displacement as a result of other land consolidation efforts or infrastructure
investments.

The government should make public investments that catalyze improved land
management among private investors. Public budget could be used to co-finance private
land managers’ environmentally friendly investments that generate public goods (for example,
by subsidizing landowner restoration of riparian areas and coastal forests). It could also be
used to pay or provide financial incentives to producers and communities for ecosystem
stewardship (for example, through preferential credit to producers who adopt long rotation
timber and produce carbon sequestration benefits or use sustainable water management
practices). In Dak Lak, the government is cost-sharing coffee farmers’ adoption of water saving
technologies and providing preferential credit to farmers whose replanting of coffee is being
accompanied by improvements in soil and water management practices. Initiatives similar to
the Payment for Forest Ecosystem Services (PFES), such as performance based payments
for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, should also be considered.

Vietnam should enable land markets because they help lower the environmental
footprint of agriculture and reduce pollution of land and water. Currently there are
many industrial and other high-polluting activities located in rapidly growing urban areas
of Vietnam. The market solution to rising urban land values is to displace lower-valued
industrial sites. In Vietnam, however, the market is not playing this role. Finding alternative
sources of revenue for local governments – such as through property sales, or income taxes
– would help remove highly polluting industries from densely populated areas. The example
of industrial relocation from Dalian, China illustrates how transforming land markets can be
used to the benefit of environmental quality. In the case of agriculture, well-functioning land
markets would result in relocating the production of commodities such as coffee and rice to
where it is environmentally and financially sensible.

Vietnam should adopt policy reforms that help manage pollution and optimize use of water
resources. The government could put in place and enforce incentives (e.g., effluent fees) to
effectively reduce water pollution and help public wastewater utilities cover investment and
operation and maintenance expenses. Raising wastewater fees would also meet a prerequisite
for greater private sector investment. Similarly, management practices and technical solutions
that can lower water and fertilizer use, and approaches to rejuvenating aging plantations (for
example rice production practices that alternate wet and dry rice, lowering water use and
GHG emissions) would help reduce excessive use and pollution of water.

Better integrated planning, regulations and incentives are also needed to efficiently
allocate water resources across different sectors. In the agriculture sector, many support
policies in Vietnam are working counter to the environment, such as waiving of water use
fees. Reversing this, while maintaining measures to protect the rural poor, could help reduce
wasteful water use. Adoption of measures to expand water supply and availability will be
important in some regions and sectors. This could include well-planned investments in multi-
year storage infrastructure such as dams, development of regional water supply schemes,
rainwater harvesting, and more. Such measures will contribute to more than agricultural
transformation and promote sustainable water use more widely.

Modernization of agriculture and improved management of natural resources will
require adopting more knowledge-driven approaches. Producers will need information
and technical support on meeting food safety requirements and climate–smart agriculture,
land and forest management technologies. This will require investment in human resources
and infrastructure for research and development (for example, investments in laboratories
102 Sustaining Success


and people to research how to meet food safety requirements in domestic and export
markets), data collection, and transfer of information. The public sector should not generate
all the necessary information and innovations. Instead, it should focus on collecting and
maintaining reliable data on critical environmental and natural resource parameters and
facilitating transfer of information and catalyzing greater private sector involvement in
knowledge generation. More generally, there will be a need for service providers who can
assist with improving production, meeting the quality standards of more mature and informed
domestic and international consumers. Promotion of collective action through industry
associations and encouragement of these associations to serve technical and professional
functions will be beneficial. It also could result in more income and skilled jobs in agriculture
and management of natural resources.

The government should generate and make publically available key data including slope,
precipitation, land suitability, pollution and more. To improve the quality, consistency, and
public and private sector access to data, the government should:
	       Consider putting in place a platform for harmonizing and maintaining updated
      	
        information
	       Promote the use of current and affordable information and communication technology
      	
        and publically accessible spatial data apps to readily collect and share real time
        information on climate, weather, water, soils, air quality, and more
	       Build the capacity among research organizations and think tanks to analyze data, and
      	
        ensure these organizations prioritize approaches to improve public agencies’ use of
        data and new ways of sourcing information to improve monitoring and enforcement,
        and develop methods for using data to inform decision-making
	       Require coordination between research organization and public agencies, to ensure
      	
        the technical assistance on improving environmental management and natural
        resource use contributes to policy implementation
	     	Improve access to information on key variables (for example, water consumption and
        pollution). Publically accessible information will also help identify laggards in making
        investments and adopting improved processes for handling environmental issues (for
        example, waste water treatment).

Vietnam should bolster the capacity of its public institutions to play more of a facilitative
role in agriculture, natural resource use, and environmental management. As the pressures
and economic justification for the modernization of agriculture (including fisheries and forestry)
increases, continued government management of change could constrain the innovativeness
and resilience of Vietnamese farmers, and potentially deter investment in the subsectors. This
should be avoided in order to capitalize on the opportunities to create jobs and improve income
generation from agriculture and use of natural resources. During this period of transformation,
the government should monitor and enforce programs and policies that aim to reduce negative
environmental impacts, rather than prescribe what needs to be done.

Priority 5: Adapt service delivery to new expectations and aging
population
Service delivery across a broad set of areas emerges as a priority for two reasons.
First, investments in human capital are a critical ingredient of the broader growth agenda, as
Vietnam seeks to move towards a new growth model, which will drive continued growth in
the incomes of the bottom 40 percent. Second, access to and quality of services delivered
are a principal determinant of the direct welfare of the bottom 40 percent and the poor.
Additionally, addressing the challenges faced by disadvantaged groups including ethnic
minorities, people with disabilities, and urban migrants is in large part a question of service
delivery. The agenda under this priority encompasses a set of initiatives in education, health,
and social protection, along with some particular actions to address critical gender inequity.

While internationally renowned for its success at delivering high-quality basic
education, Vietnam’s education system fails to capitalize on this excellent foundation
as students progress. Although the system achieves high overall quality and low variation
in learning outcomes, many poorer students fail to advance. Large gaps between the poor
and the wealthy in school enrollment are visible at upper secondary ages, and very few poor
children attend tertiary education. Overall, only approximately half of students now complete
upper secondary.66

chapters on innovation and inclusion, and the Vietnam 2035 background paper “Tertiary Education in Vietnam: Characteristic
and Challenges.”
104 Sustaining Success


Access and equity are diminished by an exam-based system that allocates the limited
places in academic high schools. Vietnamese education policy puts the onus on the student
to demonstrate sufficient academic talent to merit a place in upper secondary education,
preventing student with marginal exam performance from entering upper secondary school.

Drop out may be exacerbated by scarce options for relevant, high-quality secondary
school. Students who decide not to continue or who do not do well enough on exams are
tracked in to technical and vocational schools and programs. The labor market returns to
these programs and to stopping after academic upper secondary are low, and may add to low
progression and high drop out.67 While some technical and vocational programs allow students
to finish secondary school and obtain a post-secondary credential, many are outdated, too
short, and/or not relevant to job success. Often parents report viewing secondary TVET
through the stigma of failure to win a spot in academic secondary school. It is possible that
the returns to upper secondary will rise as the overall demand for skills increases, but it also
likely that reforms will be needed to improve the quality of upper secondary education and
make it more relevant to the labor market.

Despite the high returns, tertiary education also suffers from problems of quality and
relevance. Tertiary graduates relatively higher salaries are thought to reflect their scarcity
and inherent talent more than knowledge and skills obtained in their degree programs. With
some notable exceptions, tertiary education quality and relevance are hampered by numerous
deficiencies. Full-time faculty with PhDs are rare; low salaries oblige many professors to take
on large teaching loads at numerous institutions. Numerous bureaucratic obstacles either
promote or fail to encourage innovative classroom practices, regular updating of curricula,
and/or connecting research and instruction. Required classes and restricted student choice
of study programs lower student interest. Much instruction is reported to be overly theoretical
and unconnected to the demands of future employment.

Tertiary education quality and relevance problems have their roots in challenges to
implementing an effective regulatory framework. Over the past decade, Vietnam’s de
jure regulatory framework for tertiary education has advanced considerably, including a
2012 law promoting university autonomy. Implementation and de facto changes have been
much slower in arriving. In this context, the World Bank (2013) highlighted evidence of
disconnects between skills needed for employment and those developed by universities and
colleges. The narrow definition of tertiary education—with its heavy emphasis on traditional
university disciplines and careers—is a final educational obstacle for poorer students. Their
greater ranges of academic abilities and future career opportunities should be met with a
continually-updated supply of tertiary-level study options. The current regulatory framework,
however, retards the growth of responsive tertiary institutions—alike for universities and non-
university institutions. Policies suppress revenue generation, fail to reward merit, discourage
innovation, and limit the number of providers and types of provision. Paradoxically, limitations
on tuition and a purported concern for quality—both of potential benefit poorer students—are
the main levers through which access is restricted and innovative change is stifled.




67	A preliminary analysis of the returns to education by level is presented in the pillar one section of this concept note, and a
more detailed analysis is being conducted for the full SCD.
                                                       Vietnam Systematic Country Diagnostic 2016 105


Within the education sector there are several specific subpriorities. These include (i) a
focus on early childhood education for the poorest students and especially for ethnic minority
students, to equalize readiness-to-learn; (ii) continued improvements to quality through a focus
on inquiry-based learning at a grade levels; (iii) specific attention and policies in secondary
school and beyond that remove exam-based allocation of advancement opportunities and
other obstacles for high school completion by poor students; and (iv) providing a growing
array of university and non-university choices for young adult learners.

There is also a need to ensure that the education system provides equal access to
disadvantaged groups. Completion rates are low for ethnic minorities, particularly beyond
the lower secondary level, while more than half of children with severe disabilities never
attend school, and children of urban migrants without permanent registration status face
barriers to enrollment. For children with disabilities, schools need to make accommodations
to provide for their special needs, and for urban migrants, reforms are needed to eliminate
the impact of the registration system for enrollment.68

In health, there are there are a number of key challenges relevant to the country’s
stated commitment to providing Universal Health Coverage including quality care
without impoverishment. These include improving basic health outcomes for disadvantage
populations which require differentiated approaches, providing a health financing system
that allows access to care without impoverishment while also providing stronger incentives
for more efficient and quality care, and a public health and service delivery system that can
respond to the populations changing health needs, particularly focusing on improved quality,
addressing key lifestyle risk factors and strengthening the grassroots health system as a
trusted provider of quality care.69

The lingering basic health agenda concerns remote areas and among ethnic minorities.
Child and maternal mortality rates in mountainous rural areas are 3 to 4 times higher than
in rural plains and urban areas. As noted earlier, malnutrition remains high among ethnic
minorities. This leaves disadvantaged populations vulnerable, and results in inequality of
opportunity. Malnutrition, in particular, has long term implications for schooling, learning,
employment, and productivity.	

Out-of-pocket payments for health have a significant impact on poverty (headcount
and gap) in Vietnam. About half of all health spending in Vietnam is paid for out-of-pocket
(OOP), and as a share of GDP it is high by regional standards (about 2.5-3% of GDP).
Survey evidence indicates that just over 4 percent of Vietnamese households experienced
catastrophic health expenditures in 2012 (exceeding 40 percent of the household budget),
while 2.5 percent (over 2 million people) were pushed below the poverty line. Both figures
improved in the period 2008-10, but progress then stalled between 2010 and 2012. The rate
of impoverishment due to OOP in Vietnam is higher than most countries in Asia.




68	Education for ethnic minorities is addressed under Priority 1.

Insurance Review, and the most recent Joint Annual Review of Health Sector Performance and a forthcoming Health Quality
and Equity study based on a health facilities survey.

The national health financing system puts Vietnam on track to become a high cost and
inefficient health system, crowding out other health expenditures that may improve
health outcomes or financial protection. At more than 6% of GDP, Vietnam already spends
significantly on health and more than most East Asian countries except countries such as
Japan and Korea that have already reached high income and aged demographics.70 Health
insurance coverage has increased to more than 70% of the population, however a large share
of the population in the bottom 40% do not have health insurance because they are in the
agricultural or informal labor market; at the same time, health insurance does not necessary
protect against impoverishing or catastrophic expenditures. Current policies on hospital
financial autonomy, fee-for-service payment mechanisms and the reduction in the state
subsidy of health service prices exacerbate the impoverishing effect of health expenditures.

The grassroots level health system is not seen as a trusted provider of good-quality
essential health services at the grassroots level and there are legitimate reasons for
concern. The primary outpatient and basic hospital services offered at the district and
commune levels are disproportionately used by the poor, but the quality of care and availability
of services could be substantially improved, with direct relevance to key indicators of shared
prosperity. Staffing and resources at this level are inadequate due to the systemic drivers
that pull patients and resources to higher-level hospitals. Those who have the means or the
proximity to higher levels of care, will go directly to provincial and central level health facilities
in order to seek access to access to the better health professionals, diagnostic capacity and
treatment capacity.

A forthcoming study (World Bank 2016b) based on a detailed health facility survey
found that equity of the quality of care between poor and wealthier areas is surprisingly
high but that quality problems are commons. The study examined care at commune
health stations and district hospitals in six provinces. It found that substantial numbers of
health care providers do not follow the applicable checklist when presented with symptoms
typical of basic health care cases, i.e. overall ability levels are low. Ability levels of health
care providers at district hospitals are higher on average than those at commune health
stations, but the local poverty rate is uncorrelated with health care provider’s ability level.
The study found that there is very high use of unnecessary and harmful treatments (as in
other countries.) There is much greater use of drugs in Vietnam than in other countries
and in particular extremely high use of antibiotics. Doctor knowledge of correct treatment is
particularly low for tuberculosis and child pneumonia.

The public health system will increasingly have to respond to new challenges that
require different approaches, including motivating behavior changes due to lifestyle
risk factors and responding to emergencies due to climatic changes. Some of the key
health changes will require population wide and community-level behavior change either in
feeding practices, sanitation, smoking, or alcohol consumption. From international experience,
further improvement in health outcomes will come from reducing the population risk factors
or in managing the health impact of these risk factors before they become severe. Vietnam
public health systems or the coordination between the health and other sectors directly
involved in these areas are not yet developed to address these kind of behavior change
challenges. A number of measures are proposed as priorities for the health sector. These
include measures to increase the attention to culturally sensitive outreach of basic health
services to reach ethnic minorities in disadvantaged highland areas; reduce the percentage
of health financing that is paid out-of-pocket through higher insurance enrolment among the
informal sector; continued strengthening improvement in the purchasing of health goods
and services, including pharmaceutical procurement reforms to help lower the high price
of drugs; and hospital accountability to deter rent-seeking by hospitals. Proposed policy
measures to strengthen grassroots service delivery include a range of interventions to
establish a stronger focus on delivering preventive, outpatient and community based services
including addressing those bottlenecks in service delivery such as competency of providers
and availability of necessary drugs and laboratory services; and also policy changes in the
overall service delivery system to improve coordination and cooperation and reduce the
current fragmentation and competition among providers.

In light of both the middle class and aging trends, Vietnam’s pension system faces
serious challenges. Greater coverage will be needed to match growing expectations so
that the very rapidly growing old-age population does not fall into poverty. Coverage of
contributory pensions in Vietnam remains low, though not out of line with countries at similar
income levels globally. Figure 3 shows the global relationship between share of working age
population participating in contributory pension schemes and GDP per capita. Vietnam is
around where one might expect given its income level and high labor market informality. At
end-2013, social insurance covered about 10.9 million people in the compulsory scheme
and 176,000 people in the voluntary scheme. This is just 20 percent of the total workforce,
with coverage heavily concentrated among the top 40 percent of the distribution.

In terms of generosity within the contributory pension system, Vietnam has been an
outlier within the EAP region and globally. This is a product of high accrual rates in its
pension system. This situation will improve somewhat with the 2014 reforms, which reduced
annual accrual rates, though the adjustments only become fully effective from 2022. This is
a welcome reform, but falls short of making the system sustainable and still leaves Vietnam
with globally high accrual rates. A complicating factor in Vietnam is that workers have typically
contributed against a minimum base salary, so people combine high replacement rates with
low absolute value of pensions.

Even after recent reforms, the current pension system is not sustainable. Prior to the
2014 reform, the pension fund was projected to enter into deficit from 2021 and to have
depleted all reserves by 2034. Another way of putting this is that the contribution rate
required to keep the fund in balance would have had to rise to almost 30 percent of salary
by 2035, and to 80 percent of salary by 2080. This would clearly not be sustainable from a
competitiveness perspective and would imply major subsidies from the budget. The 2014
reforms are steps in the right direction in this regard, but do not go far enough or fast enough
to make the system sustainable long term, though they do push back the point at which the
system goes into deficit.

Overall, well over half of people 60 and over has neither a formal sector pension nor a
social pension, and half of those with some pension have a very low benefit. Combined,
these benefits cover under 20 percent of the population 60+, which is modest by the standards
of neighbors such as China and Thailand. The current system is represented in Figure 12,
and exhibits a common problem of developing country pension systems of a large “missing
middle”, between the relatively small and better-off formal sector covered by the existing
VSS system and even smaller (and concentrated among the very old) group covered by
social pensions.

A number of priorities are proposed to expand coverage to all workers, including those
in the informal sector. Perhaps the most pressing priority is further reform of the formal
sector pension system to achieve long-run financial sustainability of the system. Expanding
coverage of the formal system without further reform will simply create a deeper fiscal burden
in the future. Further reform is necessary also to create the fiscal space to allow for public
subsidies to incentivize participation of informal sector workers and gradually reduce the
eligibility age for social pensions. Global experience, as well as Vietnam’s own experience
with health insurance coverage expansion, strongly suggests that public subsidies will be
needed to achieve widespread old age financial protection. Policy and financing reforms can
be complemented by modernization of SI administration to improve compliance, reduce the
burden of compliance on enterprises, and promote a service-oriented SI delivery system.

The social assistance system has been characterized by uncoordinated policy and
program development in recent years. Social assistance programs have been expanded
without adequate attention to program design and with poor delivery systems. New policies
and programs have been introduced ad hoc with overlapping target populations and
objectives. Delivery systems for social assistance programs are weak – much below what
one would expect from country at Vietnam's level of development. These include systems
for beneficiary identification, targeting, program beneficiary management, benefit payments
(improving current cash payments by using third party agents for greater transparency and
110 Sustaining Success


accountability, eventually moving to electronic payments), community mobilization and social
work networks, feedback/grievance redress, monitoring and evaluation, and management
information systems.

There are also knowledge gaps on both assistance program spending, outcomes and
impacts. Such evidence is needed to enable an informed discussion on how the system can
evolve to address current risks and vulnerabilities (e.g., who should be covered, what is the
appropriate policy mix, how should these programs be financed).

There are a number of proposed priority areas for reform of social assistance. These
include 1) a more coherent approach for household-based transfers, moving away from
multiple fragmented programs with overlapping target populations and objectives, 2) better
systems for beneficiary identification and screening in targeted social assistance programs
to improve the poverty reduction impact of a given level of spending, 3) the consolidation
of delivery systems through investment in payment systems, management information
systems, and improved client outreach and case-management mechanisms for households
with complex needs, and 4) rethink the design of area-based anti-poverty programs to
emphasize more diversified community-driven income-generation approaches.

Various changes in service delivery and public administration are also needed to
advance gender equity. Three critical areas of concern for gender equity are the lack
of women in leadership positions in both the private and the public sectors, high rates of
domestic violence, and the extremely elevated sex ratio at birth, and. Measures to boost
women’s leadership include childcare support, training opportunities, and eliminating gender
discrimination in the retirement age. The government may want to consider setting up such a
special program for women’s leadership in the public service. Multi-sectoral evidence-based
approaches directed at both genders can help reduce domestic violence.71 One measure that
could reverse the alarming rise in the sex ratio at birth is easing the two-child policy, but the
SRB will probably only change substantially as parent preferences evolve. The government
policy may be able to speed this evolution through education campaigns to emphasize the
value of daughters, and pension expansion to lessen the concern of parents concerned
about having a male offspring to support them in their later years.

Priority 6: Augment resilience to climate change and benefits from
mitigation
The poor in Vietnam are more exposed to climate and therefore more vulnerable to its
impacts. Recent work by Narloch and Bangalore (forthcoming) found that poorer households
live in communes with steeper slopes, greater rainfall variability and temperature variability.

Ongoing climate events and projected climate change can set back development gains
unless there is a concerted effort to make climate smart investments and pursue a
sustainable and climate resilient growth trajectory. This priority area focuses on reforms
that can reduce the impact of climate change on income and human capital. It focuses
on efforts to scale up approaches for disaster preparedness, response and recovery,
manage natural hazards, incentivize climate smart interventions, and coordinate planning
and investments. It also includes reforms that could reduce emissions from coal, enabling
Vietnam to deliver on its nationally determined contribution to mitigating climate change.
112 Sustaining Success


Vietnam, being highly decentralized, needs to more effectively coordinate and plan for
climate change across sectors and levels of government. In the Mekong and Red River
Delta, limited coordination among public institutions, prevents planners and decision makers
from making strategic decisions, across sectors and provinces, on the future direction and
nature of development. For example, one city may build infrastructure to protect its own
investments while increasing the risk of flooding in other areas. To change the current
situation, cities and provinces need to jointly plan for investments related to a rise in sea
level and changing flood risks. They need to jointly pay greater attention to the siting of
infrastructures and residential communities. Several cities on the Mekong Delta have started
to adopt such an approach.

At the provincial and municipal level, there is the need to design land use plans that
account for disaster risks, and promote the scale up of disaster preparedness, response
and recovery while also recognizing reasons for households to live in risk prone areas.
The impact of climate change on high flood risk areas is proportional to the development
and activities that are found in these areas. The systems in place to prepare, respond
and recover from a climate event also influences extent of the impact. Land use planning
processes should consider the vulnerability of areas to disasters in an effort to minimize the
physical and financial impact of disaster events. The process, however, must also recognize
the constraints of those who are currently exposed to disasters when proposing alternatives
if the plans are to be effective. For example, recent work in Ho Chi Minh City, found that
local and migrant households will not move from their current residential location despite
high flood risk and health impacts (World Bank and Australian AID 2014) because the rents
are cheaper and people can live closer to their workplace. In such cases, investments in
infrastructure that enable people to maintain comparable jobs should complement flood
zoning efforts.

To adapt to climate change, Vietnam needs to improve the information base it uses to
inform plans and investments. The analytical underpinnings of decisions today remain
weak. Vietnam needs to invest in upstream analytics that is based on robust data collection
processes, information, and analysis. For Vietnam, this could require putting in place
mechanisms for monitoring and collecting additional data (for example, enhance systems for
collecting data on land use, predicting impacts of sea level rise, and so on) and investing in
non-structural instruments such as early warning systems and upgrading hydromet systems.
It would also require developing a comprehensive, user friendly and publically accessible
platform for the data and information. The data should improve the government’s ability to
reexamine sectoral policies relating to agriculture (for example, triple rice cropping), urban
development (for example, nature and spatial development), coastal zone management
(for example, siting of mangroves and sea dykes) and water resources management (for
example, choice of infrastructure or non-structural measures to control floods and saline
intrusion). It should also help adjust land-use to changing water regimes (between fresh,
saline, and brackish waters). Such platforms should improve the information base used for
ex-ante planning, mitigation and response to disasters (especially by adequately accounting
for disasters and having a systematic approach for assessing disaster impacts). The data
should also be accessible to private sector.

Vietnam needs to build subnational capacity to conduct risk and uncertainty analysis
of chronic events and to use decision-support frameworks to identify and prioritize
needs and attract private investments. This would enable the government (at multiple
levels) to internalize natural resource conditions and trends, capture the influence of climate
                                              Vietnam Systematic Country Diagnostic 2016 113


change, natural processes and human actions, and optimize opportunities for public and
private investment, resource. Vietnam’s effort to build capacity to mainstream climate risks
into development policies should enable provinces to undertake improved integrated spatial
planning across sectors, and ensure that land and water resources are managed in a manner
that takes into account the potential longer term climate and development impacts. Having
the right incentives and information available would to engender smart decisions by both
public and private sector, and could further motivate private sector engagement in climate
resilient infrastructure.

Increased investments in reducing exposure and vulnerability of cities and rural
communities to climate change are necessary. The financing needs for adaptation to
climate change during 2010–50 was estimated to be on the order of $75–100 billion per
year72. Cities that are vulnerable to climate change need to invest in appropriate adaptation
measures which should include ecosystem based measures (for example, placing a greater
emphasis on integrated coastal zone management, protecting mangrove and coastal forests,
and natural reef ecosystems), and “climate-proofing” infrastructure, including storm-drainage
systems, water supply and treatment plants, and protection or relocation of energy or solid
waste management facilities. The investments could include spending on the maintenance
and extension of coastal and flood defenses (both physical infrastructure and natural systems
such as mangroves) to minimize the impacts of sea inundations, salinity intrusion and river
flooding, to protecting urban infrastructure and the most valuable agricultural land. It could
also include expanding and improving the irrigation infrastructure, especially in the central
regions where the opportunities for irrigation expansion are greatest and could assist with
changes in water availability.73 Investments are also needed to reduce the significant risks
of informal settlements in cities that are highly exposed to sea level rise. Given the scale
of investments required, Vietnam will need to conduct evidence-based prioritization efforts
to identify the investments that generate the most benefits, while contributing to reducing
poverty and boosting shared prosperity.

Social assistance that is climate responsive can help alleviate the exposure bias faced
by the poor. The poor, in addition to residing in areas with greater exposure or vulnerability
to climate risks, confront major disadvantage with respect to having financial resources
and access to financial instruments (e.g., insurance) that can buffer them against these
risk. This underscores the importance of bolstering existing social assistance programs to
help those who are vulnerable and overexposed to climate change and natural hazards to
adapt and recover. Such efforts would lower the likelihood of these households slipping back
into extreme poverty and becoming the “new” extreme poor. The International Institute for
Environment and Development estimated that the total (direct and indirect) annual economic
losses due to flooding in Can Tho city was US$642 per household, which represents 11
percent of each household’s annual income.74 In such cases, social assistance programs
that are climate responsive can be very beneficial. In Can Tho, making such a reform is
also a relatively modest investment, as it involves leveraging the infrastructure associated
with the existing social assistance systems and modifying the program to provide social
assistance to households affected by flooding.

Development of suitable risk financing instruments (in addition to insurance) will improve
Vietnam’s ability to cope with disaster response and recovery. The government has taken
important steps to strengthen the country’s financial resilience to disasters. In May 2014, the
law on “Natural Disaster Prevention, Response and Mitigation (No. 22/2013/QH13)” became
effective, shifting the emphasis from ex-post disaster response to comprehensive disaster risk
management. It also provides for the use of state budget funds for natural disaster prevention
and control and sets out a state policy to support the development of the domestic disaster
risk insurance market. To effectively implement this law, Vietnam needs to invest in assessing
the underlying risk factors – a quantitative risk profile of the government’s contingent liabilities
in the face of future disasters - in order to take informed decision on disaster risk financing.
The government will then need to a cost-effective financial protection strategy, relying on an
optimal combination of financial instruments to cover sovereign risk including contingency
budgets, national disaster (multi-year) reserves, contingent credit and risk transfer instruments
(including insurance). A dedicated disaster reserve fund or parametric insurance could be
included to help secure additional financing in case of a major disaster.

Stabilizing climate change globally requires every country to commit to reducing
emissions. Vietnam is not a significant emitter of CO2 globally, yet it has a high level of
CO2 emission per unit of GDP. This suggests there is room for improvement. Delivering on
its nationally determined commitment to mitigate climate change, will require adoption of
measures that do not slow growth or poverty reduction. From among the potential ‘no-regrets’
measures which have immediate and local co-benefits, Vietnam should prioritize improving
energy efficiency and lowering the carbon footprint of the energy and transportation sectors.
The latter, in addition to lowering GHG emissions, will also generate immediate and local
benefits from reduced air pollution.

Effective Air Quality Management (AQM) policies and programs will reduce GHG
emissions. They will also improve public health and reduce negative impacts on the
environment. Air pollution in Vietnam is estimated to result in labor productivity losses of
14 percent of GNI annually75 and a reduction in the adjusted net saving of 2.5 percent76.
Addressing air pollution in Vietnam will require reforms that support the government to
adopt the national action plan for AQM along with a series of sequential policy actions that
will enable the implementation of the plan by 2020. The policy actions that would support
planning, include: (i) monitoring and data collection, (ii) the development of multi-pollutant
AQM implementation plans for cities and city/urban clusters, (iii) the development and
adoption of regulations on vehicle emissions standards and on fuel quality, (iv) the initiation
of industrial permits for control of air emissions from the relevant industrial sectors, and (v)
coordination and planning across institutions and sectors.

Information on levels and sources of air pollution need to be generated and made
publically accessible to galvanize broad public interest in and support for government
measures to address pollution. Vietnam needs to adopt current technology and systems for
information generation and validation, and to facilitate public access to information. Vietnam
must also improve the capacity of public institutions to improve coordination, monitoring and
enforcement, which is important for managing pollution.

Incentives for private sector to operate in green and low carbon industrial zones could
contribute to achieving lower GHG emissions and promoting pollution abatement from
industry. Vietnam should start by assessing the feasibility of scaling up policies and programs
that it has successfully adopted. Cleaner Production (CP) is one of the best known, and
has been used to both reduce waste and lower resource use in the industrial sector while
improving industry performance. It is estimated that in sectors like textile, food processing
and leather there is an average savings potential of 30 percent for water without major
investments in infrastructure. Based on government surveys in Vietnam, only 11 percent
of industrial facilities were using CP techniques to reduce their energy, fuel, and materials
consumption in 2010, pointing to significant room for improvement. Vietnam could also
design low carbon industrial zones by factoring in, at the design stage itself, opportunities to
minimize the industries adverse environmental impact based on where it is situated. Such
economic zones could also focus on attracting investors that produce green products and
services.

Vietnam needs to also adopt policies that incentivize private sector investments in
cleaner energy production, and improve the sector’s infrastructure and environmental
performance. Currently, low electricity prices are partly responsible for Vietnam’s high energy
intensity. They also limit any incentive for energy efficiency. Although Vietnam increased
average tariffs by 44 percent between 2010 and 2012, cumulative inflation amounted to
53 percent over this same period.77 As a result, real electricity tariffs went down, and are
among the lowest in the region. In addition to the negative budgetary and energy efficiency
implications, artificially low tariffs constrain the ability of utilities to finance their investment
and O&M expenditures or to attract private sector investment. The overall investment required
in the energy sector is estimated at approximately US$ 6 billion per year till 2030. Without
incentives for private sector engagement, Vietnam will struggle to finance the large amount
of power sector infrastructure that is needed to move to newer and lower carbon-intensity
fuels including liquefied natural gas, wind, and solar.

The government needs to be the regulator of operations in the energy sector by setting
and enforcing environmental standards. Vietnam could reduce its air pollution by improving
energy efficiency in the industrial sector, and putting in place mandatory performance based
targets combined with financial incentives for industry and provinces. Within the Ministry of
Industry and Trade, an industrial energy efficiency and conservation office could facilitate
this program.

Standards should also be used to improve energy efficiency among end-users. A
number of countries have establishing minimum energy performance standards for common
electrical devices, including the European Union, Australia, Canada, the United States, as
well as India, Korea, Mexico and Russia. In the residential sector, there is nearly 140,000
GWh of energy efficiency potential. Over 87 percent of this amount could be achieved through
energy efficiency for lighting, refrigeration, air conditioning, water heating, and fans.

Cross-Cutting Priority: Strengthen Institutional Foundations and
Governance
As Vietnam embarks upon the next phase of reforms, the interplay between policies
and governance will become even more important. The institutional environment will
determine the direction of policy changes and whether policy and regulatory changes are
properly implemented. Without reforms of the governance system, it will be difficult to deliver
most of the other priorities identified in this report. Maintaining macroeconomic stability,
delivering growth-enhancing infrastructure and regulatory reforms, tackling ethnic minority
poverty, boosting health insurance coverage and secondary education completion, ensuring
prosperous and livable cities, enhancing trade logistics and “greening” growth will all require
an effective public administration that has the capabilities to mobilize domestic resources,
implement public investment and spending programs, promulgate quality regulations and
provide fair and transparent enforcement. This section summarizes some of the key cross-
cutting governance challenges that emerge from the analysis.

Vietnam continues to face a number of cross-cutting governance challenges. These
challenges can be broadly grouped into three core aspects of governance. First, the
respective roles of the state and the market will need to continue to evolve. With the state
still involving in productive activities and resource allocation, questions about a level playing
field, independent regulation of markets and an effective competition framework remain
pertinent. Second, issues of coordination and implementation capacity also remain critical
with government effectiveness being hindered by fragmentation within and across levels of
government and weakness in public administration management. Thirdly, transparency and
voice in decision making, resource allocation, regulatory reform and service delivery could
be strengthened further to provide the foundation for more accountability. While Vietnam
has sustained high growth rates and strong public service outcomes in the early stage of
development, governance weaknesses may become a drag on future growth and social
outcomes. Attention needs to be given to modernizing Vietnam’s core government institutions
to enable them to continue to support a rapidly developing middle income economy.

Transform state market relations
Institutional legacies of Vietnam’s past state driven development model continue to
affect state market relationships. Starting out from a centralized system in which the
private sector played an exceedingly marginal role, in which price signals were largely absent
and the state essentially retained monopoly power in the allocation of resources, Vietnam
has come a long way in creating markets. Today the vast majority of transactions in the
economy are market based and prices for most products and services are determined based
on supply and demand. This notwithstanding, there are institutional legacies that distinguish
Vietnam from other market economies. These legacies manifest themselves in the economic
realm where state authorities still play an important role in the allocation of resources,
especially capital and land, and where state-owned enterprises continue to engage in a
range of commercial activities. As a result the institutional context is characterized by a
blurry delineation of commercial and regulatory functions which has created opportunities
for corruption and in turn undermined effective and independent regulation of markets and
consistent enforcement. It has also given rise to what the recent Vietnam 2035 report has
called a “commercialized state” where state authorities and enterprises directly engage in
and benefit from the opportunities offered by the market.

The incomplete transition to the market is also evident in public service delivery. For
example, Vietnam’s health sector model is evolving from a historically centrally planned
and financed system to a more decentralized market-based system where providers have a
large degree of autonomy. Another example is the higher education system. Despite many
years of efforts to grant them greater autonomy, public universities remain burdened by
central government control, which limits their freedom to determine curricula, hire faculty,
and raise funds. This legacy of centralized planning is an obstacle for universities seeking
to attract competent faculty and to update their programs to provide graduates with relevant
job market skills.

The role of the state will need to continue to evolve towards a provider of public
goods and an enabler of private sector enterprise. While the withdrawal of the state from
commercial activities may continue to proceed in gradual manner, it is important to ensure
that the regulatory environment and enforcement is even, regardless of enterprise ownership
and relationship with state authorities. A clearer functional separation of commercial and
regulatory functions remains an important unfinished institutional reform agenda in this
regard. In the sphere of public services, modern service delivery mechanisms often imply
moves towards more competitive service provision which in turns requires higher degrees of
managerial and financial autonomy of service providers and some case opening up to private
sector provision. Separation of these functions are critical in sectors and enterprises that
generate negative externalities (for example, pollution or inefficient use of water) and where
disregard for the ‘public bad’ increases revenue. In Vietnam, inefficiencies and waste in the
irrigation sector is an example. Vietnam has already started to move in this direction but it yet
has to develop the institutional underpinnings required to make these more devolved service
delivery models work effectively.

Strengthen coordination and implementation capacity
Core government institutions are fragmented, often with overlapping mandates
for policy formulation and implementation splintered across agencies and between
the center and provinces. This has contributed to inconsistent policy setting, lagged
implementation and inefficiencies in resource use. For example, less than 10 percent of
firms in the Provincial Competitiveness Index surveys during the past 10 years believe that
central laws will be consistently implemented in provinces. The need for better coordination
between different national government agencies and provinces also manifests itself in the
management of natural resources and climate change. For example, for air pollution, the
ministries involved in the national action plan for air quality management include MONRE,
Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Industry and Technology, Ministry
of Construction, Ministry of Housing, along with the provinces and cities. In the social sectors
there are similar issues, particularly associated with implementation of existing policies. In
many cases, province and local officials poorly or only partially implement centrally-designed
policies and programs. This is often a particular challenge for policies towards ethnic
minorities, given that local authorities even in ethnic minority areas are typically from the
majority Kinh.

Systematic changes in coordination will be needed to facilitate integrated work across
ministries/ departments and provincial governments. Coordination is necessary to
promote improved integrated planning among provinces and across sectors. Improved
coordination and clarity over mandates can reduce the transaction costs of public and
private interventions. Institutional reform required to enhance coordination needs a long
term commitment to public service reform, incentives and institutional structures that support
good governance.


Enhance voice and transparency
Enhancing transparency and providing reliable and timely information is critical for
both the functioning of markets and of the government. While Vietnam has made progress
in establishing legal requirements for information disclosure, there are significant remaining
gaps. For example, the quality of corporate financial reporting in Vietnam remains below
that of Vietnam’s middle income–country peers within the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) Economic Community.78 Despite progress there is also still considerable
room for improvement on the government side. For example, Vietnam scores 18 on the
Open Budget Index, above China and Cambodia but considerably below the global average
of 45 and below most other ASEAN economies. Even with the transparency standards that
Vietnam set for itself, such as in land management and SOE sector, there is still a large gap
between the standards and the actual levels of transparency.




78	 Vietnam Accounting Standards (VAS) have not been kept up to date with developments in International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS). Prudential and other regulatory financial reporting requirements take precedence over accounting standards.
Monitoring and enforcement of compliance with the accounting standards are lacking. The result is that the financial statements
are not prepared on a basis comparable with those in other jurisdictions. REPORT ON THE OBSERVANCE OF STANDARDS
AND CODES (ROSC) on ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING, World Bank 2016.

Limited implementation of information disclosure requirements, and high transaction
costs associated with obtaining sectoral or provincial data often result in the use of
inconsistent data for planning. For example, differing information between sectors or
between levels of government on land cover, suitability and use, and limited information
on land ownership affect the prioritization of interventions and often result in suboptimal
measures and investments. Similarly, limited information on performance make it difficult for
the public to benchmark their local government, and to add their support to or perspectives
on specific issues.

At the same time, the oversight bodies are constrained by the lack of independence in
their efforts to impose limits on the actions of the government. A final set of governance
challenges relates to the lack of voice for marginalized groups. In many countries around the
world, progress on inclusion has been driven by advocacy by civil society organizations. For
example, indigenous people’s groups in many countries in Latin America have helped focus
government attention on the need for inclusive policies. Likewise, the agenda for inclusion
of people with disabilities has been advanced globally by advocacy organizations driven in
large part by people with disabilities themselves. Space for such organizations in Vietnam
remains limited, as many of the organizations fall under the Communist Party umbrella, and
existing government organizations—such as the Committee on Ethnic Minority Affairs and
the National Coordinating Council on Disability—have limited advocacy roles.

Annex 1: Summary of Consultations
Four consultation events of the draft SCD were held in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Buon Ma
Thuot (Central Highlands). In Ho Chi Minh City on April 6 we discussed the draft SCD analysis
and messages with a group from the private sector at an event organized by the Vietnam
Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In Buon Ma Thuot on April 7 the team conducted
similar consultation with students and faculty from Tay Nguyen University. The presentation
used in both events is attached. In Hanoi consultations were held on May 22 and May
27 with development partners, representative of the government and think tanks. Overall
the consultations revealed broad agreement among stakeholders on the main analytical
underpinnings and general tenets of the draft SCD, including the proposed three pathways
and six priorities for achieving progress towards shared prosperity and poverty reduction in
a sustainable manner. The main results of the consultations are summarized below.

Inclusive growth and job creation

Participants expressed broad agreement with the principal analysis underpinning the SCD.
While noting that Vietnam has indeed achieved high and sustained growth which turn led to
major gains in poverty reduction and shared prosperity, participants agreed that there are
emerging constraints to the existing growth model. In particular, they underscored concerns
about stagnating labor productivity growth and declining investment efficiency. Private
sector participants supported the strong focus on enabling the private sector to become the
key driver of growth and job creation. Much of the discussion revolved around the specific
constraints faced by private sector firms and policy to ease the constraints so as to unleash
its full potential. The discussions highlighted the need to further improve the investment
climate, ease the administrative burden and level the playing field. For example, private
sector representatives raised the issue of providing more even access to capital for firms
regardless of their ownership. They also highlighted the opportunities coming with further
global integration, and agreed that there was tremendous potential for domestic private firms
to deepen linkages with the FDI sector and increase participation in global value chains. In
terms of specific sectors, participants at both events noted Vietnam’s potential in enhancing
productivity and value-added from agriculture and that this should deserve specific attention.
Participants in both discussions also emphasized the importance of investment skills that
are relevant to businesses as a way to enable labor productivity growth. Finally, participants
agreed that infrastructure development, especially in key sectors, such as power generation,
was important, but raised questions about these investments could be financed, given tight
fiscal situation and rising public debt.

Social inclusion and poverty reduction

Participants voiced support for the analysis and priorities related to social inclusion. Several
private sector representatives highlighted the issues around education, echoing the treatment
of SCD and the push for universal high-quality secondary education. They noted that firms
are very concerned with whether the quality of education is adequate to satisfy their human
resource needs and that education is a critical are for the inclusion of the next generation.
They also mentioned that there are quality concerns around vocational education as well.
Members of the private sector group also raised other questions related to social inclusion
                                             Vietnam Systematic Country Diagnostic 2016 123


around the impact of rising material conditions on welfare. They asked whether lower levels
of material poverty necessarily translated into lower “spiritual poverty” and greater happiness,
suggesting that “social infrastructure” is as important as physical infrastructure. They also
suggested that the SCD consider questions of how to develop remote areas and create jobs
for the population in such areas. Finally, they emphasized the importance of understanding
the distributional impacts of economic growth going forward. The policy issues around ethnic
minority poverty were highlighted at all event but were particularly prominent at the Tay
Nguyen University (where 20 percent of students are members of ethnic minority groups).
They asked why ethnic minorities are still poor and in particular why have some policies
towards ethnic minorities not been so effective? Participants agreed that ethnic minority
inclusion is the principal extreme poverty challenge facing Vietnam.

Environmental sustainability and natural resource management

Participants had numerous comments on issues of environmental management and natural
resources. Private sector representatives asked questions about how workers can move out
of agriculture, whether agricultural production should move away from rice and into other
crops, and the extent to which modernizing agriculture can have spillover effects on other
industries. They discussed the possibility of seeing climate change impacts in the Mekong
Delta as an opportunity to move into higher value production. Participants at Tay Nguyen
University applauded the SCD’s focus on improving natural resource management and
modernizing agriculture. They suggested the SCD consider issues of modernizing forestry
and capacity building for management of natural resources. They also recommended that
the SCD recognize the tension between maximizing development and protecting natural
resources, noting for example that with increasing energy demands there is increased
pressure to further exploit hydropower potential, while dams can have some negative impacts.

Governance

Participants largely agreed with the analysis on the governance challenges that Vietnam is
facing as well as the way the SCD addresses governance as a cross cutting theme. The
private sector representatives emphasized the untimeliness, unfairness, and inconsistencies
in the implementation of policies toward the private sector. They also pointed to the lack of
coordination and overlapping functions between ministries, citing three to five ministries being
responsible for one area of work. The private sector participants noted the poor performance
in the public sector, and coupling with the lack of accountability mechanisms, it is difficult to
hold anyone accountable if corruption happens. Students and faculties at the Tay Nguyen
University suggested that looking at corruption is not enough and that more public scrutiny
is needed to avoid waste and inefficiency in public investment. Participants also suggested
the need to promote social feedback and public oversight in the conduct of the state, and to
have a clear monitoring framework to gauge results.
