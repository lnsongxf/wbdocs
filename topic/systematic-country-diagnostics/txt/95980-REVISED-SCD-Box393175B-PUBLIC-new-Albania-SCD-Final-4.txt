 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
 Growth and Shared Prosperity

 With economic growth exceeding 6 percent per annum on average, Albania was Europe’s most rapidly
 growing economy in the decade leading up to the global financial crisis of 2008. Per capita gross
 domestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 6 percent in real terms, the best growth performance
 of any non-oil rich European country. This strong growth performance meant that Albania, which was the
 poorest nation in Europe in the early 1990s, reached middle-income status in 2008. The rapid pace of growth
 helped the country narrow the per capita income gap with the European Union (EU) from 18 percent of
 average EU incomes in 1998 to 30 percent in 2012.1

 The association between economic growth and poverty reduction is strong in Albania. In the boom
 years between 2002 and 2008, growth lifted a large number of people out of poverty, with the poverty rate
 declining from 25.4 percent to 12.5 percent. Economic growth was inclusive, with consumption among the
 bottom 40 percent of the distribution (the bottom 40) growing more quickly than the average for the country.2
 The drivers of economic growth during this period benefited the less well off, with poverty falling by half in
 both rural and urban areas.

 In the aftermath of the global crisis, the pace of economic growth decelerated, the decline in poverty
 halted and income convergence with the EU stalled. Albania’s economic growth averaged less than 3
 percent a year in real terms between 2009 and 2012, sinking to an average of only 1.7 percent a year in 2013
 and 2014. The impact of the crisis resulted in a shrinking labor demand, and the poverty rate stood at 14.3

percent by 2012, with poverty increases particularly in urban areas. Adjusted for purchasing power, per capita
income was US$8,123 in 2013, leaving Albania as the fourth poorest country in Europe, with 7 percent of the
population living below the $2.50-a-day poverty line.3

Given the strong association between economic growth and poverty reduction in Albania, the country
needs to accelerate growth in order to reverse the recent poverty trend and increase prosperity.
Accelerating growth is essential to lift people out of poverty, but income growth will also need to continue to
reach all segments of the population—that is, equitable growth—to ensure sustainable long-term gains in
shared prosperity. The World Bank’s twin goals are to eliminate extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity.
These goals are measured along two dimensions, namely, (1) the rate of extreme poverty and (2) the pace of
income growth among the bottom 40, both of which are relevant for Albania. These goals will need to be
realized in a way that is environmentally, economically and socially sustainable to ensure that welfare today is
not increased at the expense of future generations.

This systematic country diagnostic (SCD) addresses the question of how to accelerate equitable
growth in a sustainable manner, thereby achieving marked progress in reducing poverty and
promoting shared prosperity—advancing the World Bank’s twin goals. The report suggests that Albania has
the opportunity to revisit its economic strategy not only to reignite and sustain growth, but also to increase
employment opportunities and raise living standards for all to ensure that growth remains equitable. What are
the opportunities and constraints to reigniting equitable growth? Does Albania have the structural foundations,
the enabling environment and the capacity to manage risks needed in order to accelerate economic growth,
reduce poverty and build shared prosperity? The SCD employs a conceptual framework using an assets-based
approach to economic gains by households, firms, and the overall economy as a way to identify the constraints
to economic growth across the income distribution.4

Is Albania’s economic model adequate to support income growth and poverty reduction?

The SCD uses a top-down approach to investigate the patterns of growth and its distribution in order to assess whether Albania’s
economic model is adequate to reduce poverty and increase shared prosperity. The SCD finds that pre-crisis drivers of growth in
Albania have been exhausted and suggests that a different model is needed going forward.

The 1990s opening of the economy from communist isolation was accompanied by early liberalization
and structural reforms. These reforms enabled reallocation of production factors from stagnant sectors to

circa 2012. Despite the slowdown in the economy, inequality, measured by the Gini index, remained broadly unchanged. The Gini
index was 26.9 in 2012, compared with 28.2 in 2008.

more productive sectors, freed up investment and shifted labor from agriculture in rural areas to manufacturing
and services in trade, transport, and communications in urban areas. The average annual real growth rate was
7 percent between 1992 and 1999, and per capita income rose from $2,075 to $3,262. Growth was financed by
substantial foreign inflows, equivalent to a quarter of GDP, in the form of official aid and remittances from the
large number of Albanians living abroad.5

Strong growth continued in 2000-2008 at an annual average rate of 6 percent. The construction and
services sectors were the drivers of economic and employment growth in 2000–2008, contributing nearly three-
quarters to output growth and 32 percent to formal employment growth. The reallocation of resources from
rural agriculture to rapidly growing urban sectors such as construction and services contributed close to 60
percent of real GDP growth. An economy-wide decomposition of per capita growth indicates that increases in
capital stock accounted for over 85 percent of the rise in GDP per capita. However, the inter-sectoral and
spatial shift away from agriculture in the 2000s did not lead to notable gains in aggregate productivity or formal
employment growth in the period before the global crisis. Strong expansion of the economy prior to the global
crisis was accompanied by a decline in official labor force participation as a large share of rural migrants chose
inactivity and informality instead of formal employment.6 Formal labor force participation fell from 73 percent
in 2000 to 58 percent in 2008. Despite the quick expansion of output, formal employment dropped in this
period.7

administrative sources, capturing strictly formal employment. With the availability of the labor force surveys since 2008, the extent of
the informal market in Albania was revealed. World Bank calculations show 47 percent in 2010 and 2011; informality per these estimates
is defined as all self-employed and unpaid family workers in nonagricultural sectors, plus employees not covered by social security. This
is in line with the 43 percent in 2013 reported by INSTAT.
7 Labor force participation rates are measured using administrative data.

In 2000–2008, growth was driven by domestic consumption. Total consumption accounted for almost 64
percent of the growth in aggregate demand. High import content of domestic consumption coupled with high
rates of public investment led to not only a large trade deficit (averaging 24.5 of GDP in the period 2000-08),
but also widening current account deficits. The rapid expansion of consumption was fueled by: (1) remittances
(peaking at $1.5 billion in 2008), which were consistently above the inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI)
and official developmental assistance (ODA) as a share of GDP, and (2) domestic sources such as wages, other
nonwage income, strong growth in credit, and the expanding fiscal deficit. Real wages grew at an average of
close to 10 percent per annum, with upward pressure from the sizeable flow of remittances and unrecorded
flows from undocumented activities. Domestic demand was further fueled by lax fiscal policy and a boom in
credit growth. The average annual fiscal deficit stood at 5.2 percent of GDP; credit to the private sector grew
an average of 180 percent a year.

The substantial rise in wages contributed to poverty reduction before the crisis. Of the six percentage
points decline in poverty in 2005–2008, household labor income was the main contributor followed by
pensions, remittances, and social assistance benefits. However, the pace of the real wage increases was
significantly higher (real wages doubled) than the pace of productivity gains (total factor productivity remained
flat). This, along with an appreciating Albanian lek, eroded competitiveness.

The Eurozone crisis slammed the brakes on Albania’s economic expansion. GDP growth declined to
around 1.4 percent by 2013. Exacerbated by Albania’s close links to poorly-performing Greek and Italian


                                                                 iv
economies, Albania’s export volumes, remittances, and financial flows diminished. While exports drove the
limited economic expansion of the economy post-2008, they remained highly market- and product-
concentrated, with significant physical capital content in non-labor intensive sectors such as minerals and
unrefined oil. FDI inflows, which, in 2000–08, had accelerated at an annual average of 3.8 percent, slowed to
1.7 percent per annum between 2009 and 2013. Investment ratios (around 25 percent of GDP) remained much
higher than gross national savings (just above 15 percent of GDP in 2012 and showed a declining trend). While
FDI continued to finance most of the current account deficit, external debt increased since 2009, albeit
remaining at a manageable 36.7 percent of GDP in 2014. Remittances fell from 10.3 percent of GDP in 2008
to 6.8 percent in 2013, and their cover of the trade deficit declined from an average of 52 percent prior to the
crisis, to 42 percent in the period after.

Albania avoided recession post-2008 largely through loose fiscal policy, leading to rapidly rising public
debt (from 55 percent of GDP in 2008 to 70 percent in 2014). Substantial and growing public debt increased
the vulnerability of the economy because of high interest costs, rollover risks, and the potential to crowd out
private sector growth. Lax fiscal policy and poor control over public financial management led government to
accumulate payment arrears to businesses estimated at 5.2 percent of GDP in 2013. Government arrears
contributed to deterioration in market activity and a rise in nonperforming loans (NPLs). As the crisis hit,
problems of portfolio quality (stemming from easing of credit standards and overexposure towards sectors
such as construction) came to the fore and the NPL ratio climbed from 6.5 percent in 2008 to almost 25 percent
in late 2014. Rising government arrears, loans in foreign currency to unhedged borrowers, cumbersome judicial
procedures and difficulties with collateral execution also contributed to the rise in NPLs. This undermined
commercial bank earnings and restrained the ability and willingness of banks to expand credit to the private
sector. Credit growth to the economy slowed from an annual average of 57 percent immediately prior to the
crisis (from quarter 1 2005 to quarter 2 2008) to 10 percent in the period after (from quarter 3 2008 to quarter
1 2014).

The sharp slowdown in the economy post-2008 caused the demand for labor to fall. Employment
declined across the economy, leading to contraction in household incomes and a rise in poverty. In 2009–13,
employment and labor participation rates dropped, respectively, to 45 and 53 percent, and real private sector
wages in non-tradables declined. The number of employed people declined by around 123,000 in only one year
(2008–09), and the employment rate fell from 56 to 53 percent in 2007–10. The slowdown affected youth and
women in particular. There was a 5 percentage point reduction in employment among women and an 8
percentage point drop in youth employment. The decline was 11 percentage points among women aged 15–24
years. In 2008–12, the poverty rate rose in urban areas from 10.2 to 13.6 percent and in rural areas from 14.7
to 15.3 percent, driven primarily by a shock to the labor market, particularly the contraction of low-skilled
labor-intensive sectors. For example, output and employment in the construction sector contracted at an annual

                                                        v
average rate of 3.5 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively, between 2008 and 2013. Inactivity rates more than
doubled from 15 percent of the population in 2008 to 38 percent in 2013, and poverty rates were significantly
higher among the inactive. In 2012, poverty incidence was 11 percent among households headed by the
employed, 22 percent among households headed by the unemployed and 24 percent among households headed
by the inactive.

The gradual loss of competitiveness, lack of productivity gains and increase in poverty reflected the
inadequacy of the economic growth model to deliver sustainable gains in income. The 2008 external
shock exposed the limitations of the domestic-driven growth model that depended on foreign flows to finance
domestic consumption, investment, and ultimately growth. The resulting macroeconomic imbalances will
continue to exert downward pressure on the economic gains of households and create disincentives for
accumulation and productive use of factors of production. Restoring a sustainable macro-fiscal framework is,
therefore, a high-order requirement for reigniting growth and increasing prosperity. The path to strong income
growth requires a structural shift toward increased productivity among firms, a boost in the external
competitiveness of the economy, and inclusiveness in the growth process while maintaining the conditions for
macroeconomic stability. Long-term economic growth and employment gains require this shift in the growth
model.

Does Albania have the endowments and assets needed--and the ability to use them efficiently and
intensively--to reignite equitable growth?

The SCD applies a bottom-up approach to examine the ways in which the stock, accumulation and distribution of human, physical,
and financial capital have hindered or generated economic gains among households and firms. The SCD finds that Albania is well
endowed and has accumulated a wealth of assets, but that inefficient use of these assets has undermined growth. Moreover, by
excluding segments of the population from the accumulation and use of assets, the country is missing an opportunity for faster and
more inclusive growth.

Albania has a relatively young population by European standards, but labor market outcomes
demonstrate that this endowment is not used optimally. The quality of labor market engagement is weak
and characterized by low employment rates, low labor force participation rates, significant informality, a
substantial share of unpaid family workers and extremely high outmigration. These features are prevalent
particularly among youth, women, minorities, and the bottom 40. For example, among youth 15 to 29 years of
age, only 29 percent in this age group were employed in 2013. Among women 15 to 29 years of age, the share
of employed was only 23 percent. The lower employment rates among youth and women are partly driven by
higher unemployment among youth (29 percent in 2013) and lower activity rates, particularly among young
women (30 percent). A 20 percentage point gender gap exists in labor force participation rates. Estimates
suggest that close to half of total employment outside agriculture corresponds to informal employment, and
nearly three-quarters of the labor in construction is informal. Extraordinary out-migration (cumulatively
equivalent to 5 percent of the resident population in 1990, rising to 40 percent in 2010) has also affected the
human capital base and the capacity of the domestic labor market to create jobs and absorb labor.8

With weak labor market engagement and declining remittances, it is necessary to strengthen the
capacity of Albanian households to generate labor market income. This will require long-term
commitment to policies such as the alignment of labor supply with the needs of the labor market for the
creation of (formal) jobs and the development of the skills needed to boost firm-level productivity, attract
investment, and expand access to higher productivity and better paying employment opportunities among the
population. Gaps exist in our understanding of the constraints to a well-functioning labor market, but evidence
suggests that among the key obstacles are disincentives and barriers to employment among women, youth,
minorities, and disadvantaged groups.

 Source: 2012 LSMS data.                                                   in preschool. The socioeconomic gap in higher
education is also significant. Twice as many people are enrolled in tertiary education in the highest quintiles
then in the poorest quintiles. Inequalities exist in the stock of human capital, affecting the capacity available in
the workforce. The share of individuals with primary education or less is substantially higher among poorer
groups. Although Albanian students have consistently improved their scores in international assessments,
learning outcomes remain low, with a learning gap equivalent to 2.5 years of schooling among 15-year olds
relative to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries’ averages.

The population is relatively healthy with improving health outcomes in recent years, but significant
inequities persist across socioeconomic groups. Life expectancy at birth reached 77 years in 2011 (80 years
among women and 74 among men), higher than in neighboring Serbia (74.5) and FYR Macedonia (75) and

                                                                    viii
only three to five years behind high-income countries such as Greece and Italy. Infant and maternal mortality
rates have declined, but remain high. Infants in rural areas are twice as likely to die before age 1 as infants in
urban areas, while infants in remote mountainous regions are four times more likely to die before age 1. While
child malnutrition has declined steadily in the past decade, over a quarter of children in the poorest quintile
were stunted (suffering from chronic malnutrition) in 2009, compared with 13 percent in the wealthiest quintile.
At the same time, Albania is beginning to suffer from a non-communicable disease pattern typical of wealthy
countries. Ischemic heart disease, stroke, and cancers are the leading causes of adult death. In addition, out-
of-pocket health expenditures are high, particularly among the poor.

Strengthening the quality of human capital would increase the share of skilled labor in the labor force,
thereby boosting productivity through the employment of a healthier and more highly skilled
workforce. An increase in the quality of human capital can also contribute directly to the welfare of the poor
(for example, by reducing the impact of catastrophic spending on poverty). However, efforts should be focused
on narrowing the policy priorities to measures that directly contribute to raising the quality of and equity in
access to education, lowering patient financial risks, enhancing the quality of health care, and improving the
incentives for formal employment, including among vulnerable groups.

Insecurity in property rights undermines productive use of land endowments. Albania has one of the
lowest scores (137 of 148 countries) in the world in terms of overall property rights, particularly physical
property rights. The lack of a well-functioning land market is having broad negative impacts on rural
development (for example, substantial farm fragmentation) and urban development (the uncontrolled growth
of urban settlements). With respect to urban areas, it is estimated that between 1992 and 1996 the informal
sector provided 60 percent of houses built by the private sector.9 This has led to inefficiencies in the allocation
of land, land use and space (density). Lack of urban planning has undermined the growth potential of Albanian
cities. With respect to rural areas, the initial land privatization process resulted in a large number of tiny and
scattered farms, holding back the development of the agricultural sector. As of 2012, there were over 350,000
agricultural holdings in Albania averaging one hectare in size. Most farmers remain locked in low-income
subsistence farming, unable to utilize their land assets to generate additional economic gains. Overall, poor
enforcement of property rights represents the key obstacle preventing firms, farms and households from
entering the land market. This has direct consequences not only on landownership, but also on income
generation and the incidence of poverty. Some groups, such as women and the less well-off, are at an additional
disadvantage because they are often excluded from landownership. The country has almost twice as many male
landowners than female, and most female landowners have a property share of less than 25 percent.
Comprehensive land policy reform would increase land formalization, promote inclusion, and address problems

in land compensation and property valuation schemes. Focusing the agenda on improved national territorial
planning among all governments will help foster efficiency and equity in the use of land and space. Along with
ownership, the issue of sustainability of land management is also critical, especially given the importance of
nature-based tourism and Albania’s legacy of environmental hotspots along its beautiful coastline.

Consistently declining rates of return on capital are raising broad questions about the opportunity
costs of resources. While physical capital accumulation was an important driver of precrisis economic growth
(accounted for an average of 25 percent of output in the period 2000-08), returns on capital are low and have
been declining for a long time. Total investment expanded, on average, by 13.3 percent in 2000–08, of which
some 80 percent originated in the private sector. Private investment grew by an average of 10 percent a year,
reflecting to a large extent a boom in construction. Public investment, at 17 percent of gross fixed capital
formation, rose even more quickly, at a 13 percent annual average, going to the transport sector for new road
construction rather than maintenance of existing infrastructure. Consistently falling returns on capital
(estimated to fall by 30 percent between 2000 and 2012) discourage domestic and foreign private investment
flows, place a burden on public finances, and, ultimately, reduce economic growth. Poor management of capital
investment has contributed to large inefficiencies. Moreover, weaknesses in financial intermediation, including
equitable access to financial markets, represent a constraint on the accumulation and use of financial assets
both for households and firms. For example, Albania had 22 branches per 100,000 adults in 2012 compared
with the average of 36 in the EU and only 280 deposit accounts per 1,000 adults, compared with 2,245 in the
EU.

 Does the enabling environment support equitable growth?
 The SCD focuses on the enabling environment required for better accumulation and use of assets and endowments. The SCD finds
 that the quality of the institutional and business environment, the delivery of public services, and the mechanisms available to protect
 the poor are ineffective in supporting the buildup and use of assets by firms and households. However, all three areas have the
 potential to support the buildup and use of assets if governance reforms are undertaken.

 Overall, weaknesses in governance and the perception of corruption have long-dominated Albania’s
 image. The country remains in the bottom 30 percent in global rankings of corruption perception. An
 inefficient judicial system and inconsistent application of the rule of law, coupled with perceptions of
 corruption, have generated mistrust in the government among economic agents and citizens, as well as
 significant informality. Enhanced independence, accountability, and professionalism of the judiciary would
 ensure that the implementation of laws and regulations is carried out in a nondiscretionary manner. Expanding
 consensus building in Parliament in the adoption of reform strategies, laws, and regulations could also help
 overcome inconsistent application of laws and regulations by courts and executive agencies. Tackling these
 high-level problems in governance would contribute to restoring confidence that the legal and institutional
 environment can protect and enforce the property, contract, and other rights of economic agents. The EU
 candidacy status of Albania represents an opportunity to pursue the EU integration agenda, including an effort
 to raise the quality of institutions on par with Europe.

 Entrepreneurs continue to face burdensome institutional and regulatory barriers. This is reflected in the
 poor investment environment, which is having a direct effect on firm and farm growth. Businesses are reporting

                                                                     xi
that institutional and governance barriers are negatively affecting their sales and employment growth. It is more
burdensome to deal with construction permits, trade logistics, inspections, and property and land registration
in Albania than in neighboring countries and in other countries around the world. Moreover, businesses and
entrepreneurs have voiced strong concerns about the discriminatory implementation of regulations and the
high level of complexity in rules, procedures, and reporting guidelines. Making the investment policy framework
stronger and more transparent would help spur local business development, attract foreign investors, and
harness spillovers from FDI. It would also help reduce informality and help foster global and regional
integration. In turn, it is expected to affect incomes positively across the distribution and economic sectors
through the greater employment and entrepreneurial opportunities created by a regulatory environment in
which firms can thrive.

Lack of reliability in energy supply is a large burden on economic growth. High economic dependence
on weather-affected hydropower resources (98 percent dependency), high distribution losses (close to half the
energy supplied), low collection rates, and technical inefficiencies have made the energy sector an unreliable
and financially unsound supplier. Securing energy supply is an immediate need and can be achieved through
diversification in generation, strengthening regional integration, efficiency gains in distribution by reducing
losses and more effective cash collection, the development of a competitive energy market that will attract
private investment, and reductions in the fiscal exposure of the government.

The provision of public services must be strengthened in order to accelerate inclusive growth.

institutional capacity, limited accountability to public service users, territorial fragmentation, and socioeconomic
and spatial inequalities in access. Corruption perception is high, accountability low, spatial inequality in access
substantial, and the penetration of information and communication technology incomplete. In a fiscally-
constrained environment, efficiency gains are the primary road to improvement in the delivery of equitable
public services. With respect to public spending, key reform areas include: i) improving public investment
management to ensure that a scaling-up of public investment supports long-term macroeconomic stability and
growth; ii) strengthening the link between output/performance and spending; and iii) optimizing revenue
mobilization (for example, expanding health insurance coverage and reducing the reliance on payroll taxes).
Likewise, fostering the development of institutions and good practices to reinforce financial discipline (such as
strengthening the commitment control system of the central government), reaching compliance with regulatory
benchmarks (for instance, in the water and wastewater sectors), improving the public-citizen interface in the
delivery of public services to enhance responsiveness and reduce the high rate of informal payments (for
example, in health care), capitalizing on fiscally sound public-private partnerships (PPPs), and overcoming
institutional weaknesses in the absorption of preaccession EU funds (such as in agriculture) can help improve
the use of public funds in service delivery.

The effectiveness of institutions to protect the poor and vulnerable needs strengthening. In the recent
past, the main poverty-focused program has been poorly targeted and characterized by low coverage. Moreover,
the benefits received by the poorest quintile were among the lowest in Europe. As of 2012, the share of the
poor covered by the program was only 24 percent, but the share of non-poor receiving benefits had risen from

                                                                  xiii
5.2 percent in 2008 to 7.4 percent of the total in 2012. Meanwhile, spending on disability assistance increased
because of growth in the number of beneficiaries and the overly generous indexation and ad hoc expansion in
benefits. From 2007 to 2013, the number of beneficiaries rose by 50 percent to reach 165,000. The disability
assistance program does not effectively target and support the truly disabled. As a result, social safety nets do
not address the needs of most poor households, and are inadequate in protecting the vulnerable and the
disadvantaged from household-specific or systemic shocks.

What risks threaten the sustainability of inclusive income growth and welfare improvements?

The SCD identifies risks threatening the sustainability of rapid and inclusive growth. Albania is exposed to multiple risks, which
will threaten progress toward the twin goals if not managed well. These risks are cross-cutting and affect the pattern and distribution
of economic growth, the ability of economic agents to build and use assets and endowments, and the institutional environment that
enables households and firms to generate income. Managing these risks is needed to ensure that the gains of shifting to a new growth
model are sustainable instead of short-lived and sporadic.

The key macroeconomic risk relates to difficulties in restoring the medium-term macro-fiscal balance,
which is critical for boosting the competitiveness of the economy. The earlier domestic demand-fueled
remittances-financed growth model is no longer sustainable and has contributed to severe macroeconomic
imbalances—characterized by high public debt, structural fiscal deficits, public sector arrears and large non-
performing loans--which must now be addressed in order to reignite growth and reverse the recent increase in
poverty. Fiscal consolidation is an important step toward improving macroeconomic stability. It needs to be
supported by deep structural reforms aimed at reducing explicit and implicit contingent liabilities (such as in
the energy sector, the pension system, and property restitution and compensation for formerly expropriated
land). The risk remains that fiscal consolidation could go off the rails—perhaps due to social or political
pressures—resulting in inefficient ad hoc expenditures that undermine the medium-term macro-fiscal
framework needed to support growth. While the financial sector has remained largely resilient to the global
crisis (with solid liquidity ratios and strong provisioning requirements) continued vigilance is needed, given the
decline in banks’ profitability and potential deleveraging in a system dominated by subsidiaries of European
banks. The greatest external macroeconomic risk stems from the weak European recovery and its impact on
demand for Albanian goods, services and workers.

On the environmental front, the key risks include disaster risk, climate change risks, the
overexploitation of natural endowments, and pollution. Managing these risks well would underpin
competiveness and growth potential in water, land, and coastal assets. Ensuring that the economy can count
on natural resources is key for securing the income sources of households and firms in sectors relying on natural
endowments (agriculture, energy, water, tourism, extractive industry). Moreover, Albania is prone to
hydrometeorological and geological hazards. As such, its exposure to natural disasters is large and exacerbated

                                                                   xiv
by climate change. In turn, this increases the vulnerability of households and the overall economy to climate
shocks, which, if they materialize, can reverse the progress toward the twin goals.

Social risks are associated with the exclusion of some groups from economic opportunities. Social risks
involve perceptions of inequality and corruption, as well as barriers to equitable economic participation,
especially among the poor and the less well off, women, youth, and minorities. Exclusion can jeopardize
progress achieved in boosting shared prosperity, but also prevents the maximization of gains from the growth
process given that some groups cannot contribute in line with their potential. Promoting inclusion across
socioeconomic groups (including ethnic minority, gender, gender-identity, age, and economic status) will
directly guard against the erosion of living standards and incomes of marginalized groups and ensure that all
groups are part of the new growth path of the economy.

What are the policy priorities for advancing the twin goals?

The SCD identifies the most important policy priorities for Albania to restore growth and make growth
inclusive and sustainable for reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. A two-stage approach
was adopted to identify priorities for overcoming the constraints to advancing the twin goals in Albania. In the
first stage, the SCD identified twelve major constraints which are undermining the achievement of substantial
progress toward the twin goals, and then defined a policy priority for addressing each of these twelve
constraints. The Table below summarizes the twelve priorities and their key policy recommendations. In the
second stage, the Albania SCD Team drew on the findings of the diagnostic and of stakeholder consultations
in order to cluster the twelve priorities based on their direct impact on achieving the twin goals. Priorities were
scored based on their direct impact on growth, poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Three mutually-
reinforcing categories of priorities were identified, as follows:

1. Fundamental Priorities: This group comprises the highest-ranking policy priorities, considered
    fundamental for reaching the twin goals in Albania. Unlocking these five constraints is the necessary and
    immediate prerequisite for the success of all policy priorities in advancing the twin goals. This group
    exerts direct impact both on the productivity and competitiveness of the economy and on greater inclusion.
    It includes: (1) restoring fiscal sustainability and financial stability; (2) establishing a high-quality business
    environment that promotes firm growth and job creation; (3) providing clean energy efficiently, equitably,
    and in a sustainable manner; (4) formalizing and enhancing the inclusiveness and sustainability of the land
    market; and (5) enhancing governance, transparency, and the accountability of government toward citizens.
2. Supporting Priorities: A further four are viewed as supporting priorities that amplify the impact of the
    top five priorities over the longer run. The group includes (1) increasing the quality of labor market
    engagement among the bottom 40, youth, women, and minorities; (2) improving the quality and relevance

    of the education system and skills training programs; (3) improving the efficiency and equity of public
    resource management; and (4) ensuring more inclusive access to financial markets.
3. Sustaining Priorities: This group—although not seen as having the strongest direct and immediate impact
    on growth and inclusion--is considered critical to enhancing the economic, social, and environmental
    sustainability of the top five priorities. The group includes: (1) enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency
    of social protection systems for the benefit of vulnerable groups, (2) ensuring the sustainable use of natural
    resources and the stewardship of the environment, (3) improving the quality and equity of health services
    and reducing health-related financial risks.

   Improving quality, efficiency and equity of health services                                        Sustaining




Notable complementarities exist between the policies with a high impact on economic growth (such
as macroeconomic stability and energy security, as well as governance and a high-quality business environment)
and the policies with a specific impact on equity (related to the quality of labor market engagement, the
protection of vulnerable groups, and building up the quality of human capital). Capturing synergies, developing
proper sequencing and building institutional capacity to develop and implement reforms will be critical to
maximize equitable growth in a sustainable manner.

The World Bank Group’s strategy to support Albania will be built around the top five SCD priorities.

INTRODUCTION: GROWTH AND SHARED PROSPERITY IN ALBANIA

Albania is a small European country. It has a population of 2.8 million (2011 census). It is located in
Southeastern Europe, bordering Greece to the south and Kosovo and Montenegro to the north. Its coastline
of 476 kilometers extends along the Adriatic and Ionian seas. Seventy percent of the country is mountainous.
In 1991, Albania emerged from nearly 50 years of harsh communist rule with widespread poverty and a nearly
devastated economy. At the time, Albania was the most isolated country in Europe with virtually no ties or
cooperation with any other nation and dependent solely on its own crippled industry and agriculture.

With economic growth exceeding 6 percent per annum on average, Albania was Europe’s most rapidly
growing economy in the decade leading up to the global financial crisis of 2008 (Figure 1). Albania has
experienced extraordinary growth. Since 1998, the country’s real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita has
grown at an average annual rate of 6 percent, the best growth performance of any European country that is not
oil rich. Because of strong growth performance, Albania grew from the poorest nation in Europe in the early
1990s to middle-income status in 2008. In 2013, income per capita was $8,123 (adjusted for purchasing power
parity). The rapid pace of growth helped the country narrow its per capita income gap with the European Union
(EU) from 18 percent of the average EU income in 1998 to 30 percent in 2012.1

 There has been a strong association between economic growth and poverty reduction in Albania. In
 the boom years between 2002 and 2008, growth lifted a large number of people out of poverty; the poverty
 rate declined from 25.4 percent to 12.5 percent (Figure 2). In the years prior to the financial crisis, economic
 growth was inclusive, and consumption among the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution (the bottom
 40) grew more rapidly than the country’s average growth in consumption (Figure 3). Growth incidence curves
 depicting the consumption growth rate for each percentile of the population show that, in 2002–08, the positive
 consumption growth disproportionately benefited the less well off (Figure 4). Poverty halved in both rural and
 urban areas.

 With the decelerating pace of economic growth post-2008, poverty rose, and income convergence with
 the EU stalled. Albania’s growth averaged less than 3 percent per annum in real terms between 2009 and 2012.
 Growth slowed further in 2013 and 2014 to an average 1.7 percent per annum. Poverty reached 14.3 percent
 by 2012 and particularly affected urban areas. Consumption growth among the bottom 40 and among the
 overall population also fell between 2008 and 2012, by 1.2 and 1.3 percent, respectively. At the end of 2014,
 Albania’s income per capita was roughly a third of the average EU income per capita, making Albania the fourth
 poorest country in Europe, with 7 percent of the population living below the $2.50-a-day poverty line.2

Given the historically strong link between economic growth and poverty reduction, going forward,
Albania needs to finds ways to (re)accelerate growth to increase prosperity. A shift in the growth
trajectory of the economy is required to achieve Albania’s aspirations for a European standard of living.
Assuming that average growth rates among the EU countries reach historical levels (that is, the EU at 1 percent
and the new EU member states [EU11] at 3.5 percent annually), a growth path maintaining the current average
annual growth rate of 2 percent would mean that Albania’s convergence with the EU average income levels
would occur several generations in the future (Figure 5).3 However, returning to a scenario of an average growth
of 6 percent a year would boost income per capita significantly and allow the country to reach the average EU
income in 25 years (Figure 6). Convergence to the income of the EU11 could become a reality in only 10 years.

While growth acceleration is necessary to lift people out of poverty in Albania, income growth will
need to reach all segments of the population—that is, make growth equitable—to ensure durable gains
in boosting shared prosperity, the twin goals of the World Bank. These goals are measured along two
dimensions, namely, (1) the rate of extreme poverty and (2) the pace of income growth among the bottom 40,
both of which are relevant in Albania. These measures can contribute to guiding and monitoring the progress
toward improvements in the standard of living by using the potential of the people, their endowments, and
their institutions more effectively. These goals will need to be realized in a way that is environmentally,
economically, and socially sustainable to ensure that the welfare of the population is not expanded at the
expense of future generations or specific groups in society.

This systematic country diagnostic (SCD) addresses the question of how to accelerate equitable
growth in a sustainable manner in Albania and, thus, make marked progress toward reducing poverty
and promoting shared prosperity in the country. The report argues that Albania has the opportunity to
revisit its economic strategy not only to accelerate and sustain growth, but also to increase employment
opportunities and raise living standards, that is, ensure that growth remains equitable.

What are the opportunities for and the constraints to reigniting equitable growth in Albania? Does
Albania have the enabling environment, the capacity to manage risks to sustainability, and the
structural foundations needed to embark on a shift toward economic growth, poverty reduction, and
shared prosperity? The SCD approaches these questions through the following structure (Figure 7):

      The next section outlines the conceptual framework of the report, which is centered on an assets-based
       approach to economic gains by households, firms, and the overall economy as a way to identify and tackle
       the constraints to income growth across the distribution.
      Block 1 poses the question: is the economic model adequate to support income growth and poverty
       reduction? The SCD investigates the patterns of growth and its distribution to assess the adequacy of the
       economic model to deliver results on poverty reduction and shared prosperity. It applies a top-down
       approach to investigate the patterns of economic growth and its distribution.
      Block 2 poses the question: does Albania have the needed endowments and assets to reignite growth in an
       equitable manner through their efficient and intensive use? The SCD applies a bottom-up approach to look
       at ways in which the current stock and accumulation of assets, the distribution and use of assets, and the
       returns to assets have hindered or led to economic gains across households and firms.

                                                           4
   Block 3 poses the question: is the environment able to support equitable growth? The SCD focuses on the
    enabling environment required to promote the accumulation and use of assets and endowments in Albania,
    including the quality of the institutional and business environment, the delivery of public services, and the
    institutional mechanisms available to protect the poor.
   Block 4 poses the question: are there risks to the sustainability of incomes of economic agents? The SCD
    identifies the risks threatening the sustainability of growth and inclusion. It looks at the macroeconomic,
    social, and environmental risks that may hinder the country’s progress toward the twin goals.
   Based on a thorough diagnosis of the drivers of and constraints to recent growth and poverty reduction,
    the SCD derives the policy priorities for reigniting equitable growth in a sustainable manner with the aim
    of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. The SCD is candid about the areas in which additional
    analytical work is needed.

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The SCD’s conceptual framework rests on the premise that, to advance the twin goals in Albania, the
economy needs to accelerate the pace of growth, but also to make growth equitable. Economic growth
directly contributes to achieving the twin goals by expanding the size of the pie. Without growth, progress in
poverty reduction cannot last. The pattern and distribution of economic growth also matter in ensuring that
growth is equitable. Effectively managing risks (macroeconomic, environmental, and social) ensures
sustainability and guards against vulnerabilities and the erosion of living standards and incomes.

The framework of the SCD includes a top-down approach and a bottom-up approach to identify
patterns in the capture of economic gains across households, firms, sectors, and the overall economy
and, thus, the constraints to maximizing and sustaining the gains, including across the distribution.
The framework relies on, but also expands on the assets-based approach to shared prosperity explicitly to
include firms and the overall economy.4 Specifically, it looks at the capacity of the country to generate economic
gains by promoting economic growth, jobs, and sustainability at the macro level (top-down) and the ways in
which this capacity interacts with the productive capacity of households and firms (bottom-up)—that is, income
at the household level and among firms—to benefit households and firms and contribute to the economic
growth process.

The top-down analysis looks at the historical patterns of economic growth and evaluates the ability of
the economy to deliver lasting gains in living standards. The issues relate to the drivers of growth, the
distribution of the benefits of growth, and whether these are able to deliver lasting poverty reduction and shared
prosperity.

The bottom-up analysis is centered on building the stock of assets and endowments that households
and firms possess. The analysis assesses the extent to which these endowments and assets can be employed
to bring sustainable gains in poverty reduction and shared prosperity. The endowments and assets include
factors of production such as human capital, physical capital, financial assets, land, and natural resources. The
accumulation and use of assets and endowments and the relevant returns are a function of interactions with
institutions and markets. Efficiency of use is evaluated from the angle of markets and the institutional
characteristics of markets that enable or restrain resource reallocation. Inclusiveness relates to the ability of
households and firms to access, participate in, and benefit from economic growth. Along these dimensions and
relative to the goal of generating growth for poverty reduction and shared prosperity, the economic gains and
the distribution of these gains across households, firms, and sectors matter, as follows:




4The asset based-approach is developed by Bussolo, Maurizio, and Luis-Felipe López-Calva (2014) Shared Prosperity: Paving the Way in
Europe and Central Asia, Washington, DC: World Bank.
                                                                  6
   The long-term productive capacity of households depends on the level and distribution of (1) the stock
    of assets and endowments owned by each individual and household, (2) the intensity of use of the assets
    to produce income, and (3) the prices of and returns to assets. Public and private transfers also boost
    household income. Understanding how these dimensions change across a population and over time allows
    a dynamic view of income generation and distribution to be captured.
   By enabling productive employment through the generation of jobs, firms play a central role in creating
    opportunities for inclusive growth. The economic contribution of firms is a function of the use of factors
    of production (assets and endowments) and the respective productivity (the returns). The prices of the
    products of firms are mainly determined by factor costs and the extent of competition and, as such, are
    directly affected by the institutional characteristics of product and factor markets.

Among households and firms, certain factors can enable or limit the capacity to accumulate, efficiently
use, access, and benefit from assets and endowments. Social safety nets can have an impact on household
incomes and provide critical protection from vulnerability and shocks, but can also impact the capacity of and
incentives available to households to build up the stock of assets (for example, by providing disincentives to
invest in human capital or participate in labor markets). Regulations that shape the environment in which firms
do business may also add to price determinants through a direct effect on the competition enterprises face. The
coverage and quality of public infrastructure and public services—such as health care, education, water,
sanitation, and electricity—also play a crucial role in facilitating asset accumulation, use, and returns among
households and firms and can enhance productivity and equality of opportunity.

The analytical framework focuses on sustainability by assessing the ability of economic agents to
mitigate risks and increase the resilience to shocks. To ensure that economic gains are not either short-
lived or achieved at the expense of future generations, the framework highlights the importance of addressing
economic, environmental, and socials risks. It also accounts for the time horizons of policy actions. For
instance, the stock and distribution of household human capital (for example, educational attainment) cannot
be altered in the short term. However, improvements in the business climate or access to public services are
amenable to changes within a shorter time span, while delivering positive longer-term results. Thus,
sustainability is treated as a cross-cutting theme affecting the ability of economic agents to guard against risks
to their welfare.

Overall, the framework is used to set priorities for relieving the constraints to achieving lasting and
inclusive growth. The constraints are identified through the core diagnosis of this SCD. Unlocking the
constraints on reducing poverty and enhancing shared prosperity is the key determinant in formulating policy
priorities with the greatest impact on equity and growth in Albania.

BLOCK 1: A TOP-DOWN LENS: HISTORICAL PATTERNS AND DRIVERS OF
ECONOMIC GAINS

How can Albania strengthen the foundations of growth and increase employment opportunities, while ensuring that the benefits of
growth accrue to all Albanians? This section investigates the patterns of economic growth in Albania over the past decade and a
half and the beneficiaries of these gains. It assesses whether the current growth model is conducive to high and sustainable economic
growth in the short and medium terms to generate lasting improvement in living standards, including among the bottom 40 and the
poor. The section demonstrates that the global financial crisis of 2008 exposed four key vulnerabilities of the pre-2008 domestic
demand-driven model: large fiscal and debt imbalances, financial sector weaknesses, external vulnerabilities, and erosion in poverty
reduction. This indicates a pressing need for structural reforms to raise productivity and competitiveness in the economy, create more
and better formal employment opportunities, and include the poor and the less well off in the growth process.



The Economic Model of the Past

Albania experienced extraordinary growth after the opening of the economy in the early 1990s, albeit
from a very low base. The opening of the economy in the 1990s from the isolation of the communist era was
accompanied by early liberalization reforms such as price and exchange rate liberalization, privatizations, and
the introduction of market-based institutions. These first-generation structural reforms enabled the reallocation
of production factors from stagnant areas to more productive areas, freed up investment, and boosted
productivity in key sectors, including manufacturing and services in trade, transport, and communications.
Between 1992 and 1996, the economy grew at more than 9 percent a year in real terms (Figure 8). Income per
capita rose from $2,075 to $3,262.5 Inflation was in single digits (Figure 9). The country enjoyed substantial
foreign inflows, at 24.3 percent of GDP, originating from government aid (official foreign transfers averaged
17.7 percent of GDP) and from remittances from the large number of Albanians living abroad.6

to 24.0 percent of the population, from 3.6 percent in 1990.

However, poor market regulatory mechanisms, the small size of the private banking sector, which was
unable to satisfy the private sector’s demand for credit, and low economic literacy led to the emergence
of usury markets (pyramid schemes) in 1997. The failure of the pyramid schemes generated sharp economic
contraction in 1997 and bouts of civil disorder (Figure 8). It damaged the public trust in economic, social, and
political institutions. The economy rebounded in 1998. The Kosovo crisis of 1999 triggered a large influx of
Albanians from Kosovo (estimated at over 430,000 people), which also contributed to boosting growth on the
back of the increased domestic demand among immigrants, particularly for transportation and services.7

The economy grew at an annual average of around 6 percent from 2000 until the onset of the 2008
financial crisis on the back of nontradables. The construction and services sectors were the drivers of
economic and employment growth in 2000–08, contributing nearly three-quarters to output growth and 32
percent to employment growth (Figure 10). Construction and other services grew close to 14 and 10 percent in
real terms, respectively, in 2000–08.8

The reallocation of labor from agriculture to rapidly growing sectors such as construction and services
helped support growth by raising output per worker. Indeed, this intersectoral shift contributed close to
60 percent of real GDP growth in 2000–08 (Figure 11). In 2000–08, increases in output per worker stemmed
primarily from the climb in the value of the physical capital available to workers.9 An economy-wide
decomposition of per capita growth indicates that increases in capital stock accounted for over 85 percent of
the rise in GDP per capita in 2000–08 (Figure 13). Investment originated primarily in the private sector, although
public sector investment grew at a faster pace (13 percent annually) than private investment (10 percent
annually).

9 With a practically null contribution of total factor productivity to output per capita growth, these results are not at odds with the
results produced when output per worker grew at 3.7 percent between 1996 and 2008. While total factor productivity is a residual of
changes in output per capita from a hypothetical aggregate production function, this represents the scale contribution to output once
all included factor inputs have been accounted for. The average productivity of labor picks up changes that have not been accounted
for by variations in factor inputs other than employment.

Large internal migration of Albanians from rural to urban zones in the late 1990s and the first decade
of the 2000s accompanied the sectoral shifts in labor (Figure 12). Employment in agriculture declined by 16
percent between 2000 and 2008.10 A part of the low-skilled labor from rural areas filled the labor market demand
in the rapidly growing nontradable sectors. Employment in construction more than doubled (albeit from a low
base), while employment in services rose by 10 percent.

The intersectoral shift away from agriculture in the 2000s did not bring notable gains in aggregate
productivity. In many countries, the sectoral shifts (from agriculture to manufacturing and services) and special
shifts (from rural to urban areas) are associated with large productivity gains as resources shift from lower-
productivity rural activities to more-productive urban-based sectors. Despite the massive reallocation of labor
across space and sectors in Albania in the 1990s and 2000s, the actual gains in total factor productivity from


10 Analysis based on administrative data from INSTAT. Employment in agriculture as measured by INSTAT until 2013 included
working-age individuals who owned land and engaged in production for their own consumption. The inclusion of subsistence farming
as employment severely distorted the picture provided by labor market indicators. In 2013, the new Labor Force Survey methodology
shifted the output focus from consumption to income generation, thereby reducing the likelihood of such distortions.

this process were small in 2000–08 (Figure 13). Indeed, aggregate total factor productivity increases stemmed
from hikes in productivity in the agricultural sector, where sectoral output grew despite lower labor input,
thereby offering a strong indication of the excess labor in agriculture prior to migration to urban areas.

Employment growth contributed negligibly to GDP growth in the precrisis period. The strong
expansion of the economy prior to the crisis was accompanied by a decline in labor force participation.11 A
large part of rural labor migrants went into inactivity and informality, and labor force participation fell from 73
percent in 2000 to 58 percent in 2008. In aggregate, despite the rapid expansion of output, formal employment
actually dropped without creating incentives for labor productivity increases (Figure 14). The employment rate,
as measured by the change in employment as a share of the working-age population, contributed less than 1
percent of the increase in GDP in 2000–08 (Figure 14). The unemployment rate fell from 18 to 13 percent, and
wages went up. The decline in the labor force was thus unlikely to have been driven by a rise in the share of
discouraged workers.

11 These results are likely affected to some extent by data problems related to the shift of many Albanians to self-employment. They

should be interpreted with caution. In addition, the size of the informal labor as well as outmigration flows is large in Albania, as
discussed in Block 2.

From the expenditure side, strong domestic demand drove economic growth in the 2000s (Figure 15).
In 2000–08, total consumption (public and private) grew by an annual average of 6 percent and accounted for
almost 64 percent of the growth in total aggregate demand. High import content of domestic consumption
coupled with high rates of public investment led to not only a large trade deficit averaging 24.5 of GDP 2000-
08, but also widening current account deficits in the same period. The rapid expansion of consumption was
financed by (1) remittances, which, in the precrisis period, were consistently above the inflows of foreign direct
investment (FDI) and official developmental assistance (ODA) as a share of GDP (Figure 16); and (2) domestic
sources such as wages, other nonwage income, strong growth in credit as well as expanding fiscal deficit.
Between 2000 and 2008, the average annual fiscal deficit stood at 5.2 percent of GDP; credit to the private
sector grew an average of 180 percent a year, and foreign inflows averaged over 20 percent of GDP.

Sizable remittances and unrecorded flows from illicit activities not only fueled the growth in household
consumption, but also put upward pressure on real wages in the formal sector. At their peak in 2008,
remittances reached almost $1.5 billion. Because around 40 percent of the population lives abroad
(predominantly in Greece and Italy), Albania has been among the top remittance-receiving nations in the world.
Along with the inflow of remittances, unrecorded income from informal activities also put upward pressure on
wages.12 Real wages grew rapidly (according to administrative data), at an annual average of close to 10 percent
in 2000–08, thereby further boosting private consumption. Real wages in trade and construction, sectors fueled

by remittances, rose at the most rapid pace prior to 2008 (Figure 17). Public sector salaries kept up with the
increase in incomes in the rest of the economy, increasing by an average of 9 percent a year in 2001–08.13
Because around 19 percent of employment was in the public sector (2000–08 average, based on administrative
sources), these wage increases translated into real income gains among a large part of the population.14

At the household level, strong domestic demand translated into real income gains. The rise in wages
contributed to the reduction in poverty observed prior to the crisis. Of the 6 percentage point decline in poverty
in 2005–08, household labor income was the main contributor, followed by pensions (Figure 18). Among the
bottom 40, a large share of household income growth was explained by labor income growth (Figure 19). Other
sources of income, such as remittances and social assistance benefits, contributed to household income growth,
but with less impact on the poor.




13 While public sector salaries rose prior to 2008, they were still at a lower level compared with salaries elsewhere in Southeastern
Europe, except Montentegro.
14 Labor Force Surveys, starting in 2007, indicate that public sector employment was at around 36 percent in 2011.

The pace of the increase in real wages was significantly higher than the pace of productivity gains,
which, along with an appreciating Albanian lek, harmed competitiveness. Average real wages largely
outgrew productivity (Figure 20). Real wages nearly doubled in 2000–08. Productivity remained essentially
unchanged (Figure 21).15 Real wage growth in excess of productivity growth negatively affected competitiveness.
Moreover, the real appreciation of the lek over 2000–08 only occurred at the expense of competitiveness (Figure
20).




15 Real wages also rose faster than labor productivity, with the gap between the two due to higher capital share per unit of labor employed.

With no gains in productivity, rising wages, and appreciating currency, Albania lost competitiveness.
Net exports contributed negatively to growth because of the rapid consumption-induced growth in import
demand, far exceeding the growth in exports (Figure 15). The underlying reasons for the persistent trade deficit
reflect a combination of strong import demand due to unsustainably high growth rates as well as weaknesses
in exports, indicating a lack of competitiveness.

Exports were highly concentrated in the first decade of the 2000s. Exports were dominated by footwear
and textiles-clothing, which accounted for nearly half of exports prior to 2008, followed by minerals and metals,
which accounted for another third of the export structure (Box 1). Exports of minerals, fuels, and electricity
grew steadily throughout the period.16 But Albania’s export basket remained relatively unsophisticated with
respect to embedded human capital and was relatively capital intensive. Moreover, the destinations of export
were highly concentrated relative to international standards (Figure 22). The share of the top 5 markets in total
exports was over 80 percent; Italy was the key export destination (Figure 23). In 2000–08, the Herfindahl-
Hirschman Index (HHI) was five times higher in Albania than in comparators (economies of a similar size or
income per capita) such as Bulgaria or Hungary and more than double the HHI in Armenia, Jordan, the
neighboring former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Moldova.17 Prior to 2008, export growth was driven
by the same products to the same markets (see Box 1).


16While exports of electricity grew in the 2000s, imports have been consistently higher than exports.
17The HHI product (market) indicator is a measure of the dispersion of trade value across an exporter’s products (exporter’s
partners). A county with a preponderance of trade value concentrated in a few products (few markets) will have an index value close

The Economy post-2008

Despite the significant gains in income, by the time the global financial crisis hit in 2008, it was
apparent that the domestic-demand-driven, foreign-financed model of growth was built on unstable
ground. Flat productivity, declining competitiveness in external markets, and fiscal and financial sector
imbalances reflected the prevalent weaknesses in the growth patterns of the economy. The global crisis only
exacerbated these vulnerabilities as declining remittances and capital inflows were no longer able to support
domestic demand.

The eurozone crisis slammed the brakes on Albania’s economic expansion: economic growth started
to slow in 2009 and hit bottom in 2012–13. In 2009–12, GDP growth halved to less than 3 percent, declining
to around 1.4 percent in 2013. Because of Albania’s close links to the Greek and Italian economies, which were
among the most affected in Europe, exports, remittances, and financial flows declined. Remittances declined
from 10.3 percent of GDP in 2008 to 6.8 percent in 2013. FDI inflows, which, in 2000–08, accelerated at an
annual average of 3.8 percent, slowed post-crisis to 1.7 percent per annum between 2009 and 2013.18 Current


to 1. Thus, it is an indicator of the exporter’s vulnerability to trade shocks (the exporter’s dependency on its trading partners and the
danger it could face should its partners increase trade barriers). Measured over time, a fall in the index may be an indication of
diversification in the exporter’s trade profile (trading partnerships).
18 Albania has one of the lowest stocks of FDI in Europe relative to the size of the economy. At the end of 2013, the FDI stock per

capita was five times smaller than the average in the EU11.
                                                                        17
investment ratios remained much higher than gross national savings; the latter represented slightly more than
15 percent of GDP in 2012 and is on a declining trend, given the observed fall in the inflow of remittances
(Figure 24). The excess of investment over savings has determined the size of the negative current account
balance, which—at double digits over the last decade—is evidence of external vulnerabilities (Figure 24). While
FDI continued to finance most of the current account deficit, external debt increased since 2009, albeit
remaining at a manageable 36.7 percent of GDP in 2014.

Albania was able to avoid recession post-2008 largely because of loose fiscal policy. As economic growth
slowed after 2008, fiscal deficits and public debt increased (Figure 25 and Figure 26). The inability to boost fiscal
revenues because of low tax revenue collection and large tax evasion on the one side and the structural burdens
on public expenditures on the other side led to an increase in the fiscal deficit. Loose fiscal policy, combined
with a depreciation of the lek, brought public debt levels up to about 60 percent of GDP in 2011, the legal limit
set in 2008. The energy shortage in 2012 and the need for government support for the power generation utility
in the form of guarantees led the government to ask Parliament to remove the 60 percent debt ceiling from the
organic budget law. In December 2012, the Parliament did this, but without proposing any other fiscal or debt
anchor. The public and publically guaranteed debt kept rising, from 55.1 percent of GDP in 2008 to 70.0
percent in 2014.

Lax fiscal policy, combined with poor control over public financial management, eventually led to the
government’s inability to pay on its contracts with private businesses. Even as revenues were declining
and public investment budgets were reduced in the wake of the 2008 crisis, many public works continued at
the same pace as initially planned, and contractors continued to carry out public works, often by drawing on
commercial loans. With fiscal space running out, this translated into a buildup of payment arrears for public

                                                          18
works and value added tax (VAT) refunds estimated at 5.2 percent of GDP in 2013. These arrears led to a
liquidity crunch, which further deteriorated market activity and contributed to the rise in nonperforming loans
(NPLs).

Substantial and growing public debt raised vulnerabilities because of the high interest costs, the
rollover risks, and the potential for harm to growth prospects. Interest expenditures, at about 3.2 percent
of GDP in 2013, crowded out more productive spending and represented a major source of vulnerability in the
budget.19 Over 55 percent of domestic debt (almost 30 percent of GDP) needed to be rolled over within a year,
exposing the government to changes in market conditions.

The financial sector reacted to the shock by reducing the supply of credit to the economy. Credit growth
slowed significantly, thereby suppressing economic growth. Credit to the corporate sector decelerated on the
back of large volatility of growth of key sectors such as constructions, trade, hotels and restaurants. Household
credit reflected a large share of mortgages. (Figure 27 and Figure 28). Increased financial intermediation in the
pre-crisis period, coupled by an easing of credit standards, and overexposure towards some sectors such as
construction led to a buildup of vulnerabilities in the balance sheets of the commercial banks. As the crisis hit,
problems of portfolio quality came to the fore and the NPL ratio climbed from 6.5 percent in 2008 to almost
25 percent in late-2014. The high level of NPLs also undermined the earnings of commercial banks and their
ability to lend.

The post-2008 slowdown and resulting contraction in domestic demand were accompanied by a rise
in the relative contribution of exports to growth. The decline in imports contributed the most to the growth
post-2008 as import demand, particularly from households, fell. Still, exports remained at 30 percent of GDP,
significantly lower than in other middle-income countries, but their relative contribution to growth increased
(Figure 29).

While exports drove the limited economic growth post-2008 (Figure 15), this was not a reflection of an
improvement in Albania’s external competitiveness, as revealed by the emerging patterns of exports:

      The export concentration in market destinations remained high by international standards. In
       2008–13, 77 percent of exports went to the EU countries hit hardest by the global crisis (on average, 54
       percent of total exports went to Italy) (Figure 29). The EU economies are projected to remain vulnerable
       from lower growth in the medium term, limiting the expansion of exports from Albania to these markets.
      The export concentration in products was not only high, but was also increasing. Measured by the
       share of the top 3 or top 5 products or by the HHI, the concentration of export products expanded after
       the 2008 crisis (Figure 30).
      Albania has a strong revealed comparative advantage in footwear, clothing-textiles, minerals
       (including crude oil), hides and skins (including leather), and metals, but these remain
       underutilized in exports (Box 1). The export structure shifted from footwear and textiles prior to 2008
       to minerals after 2008. At the more refined HS-4 level, crude oil and chromium ores and concentrates are
       now the top 2 exports, accounting for 34 percent and 8 percent of exports in 2013, respectively (table B1.1).
       The expanding role of crude oil in the export basket partly explains the increase in the export product
       concentration (see above). Exports of minerals and electricity also grew steadily throughout the 2000s.

                                                                   20
    Albania’s comparative advantage is limited to exports of a few goods that are not connected to
     other products produced domestically. The product space (Figure 31) assumes that a country can more
     easily export a new product if its factors of production are already used in the production of other goods.20
     Albania’s export basket remains undeveloped in the core of the product space. It is mostly scattered in the
     periphery, especially compared with successful exporters such as Germany, where more-sophisticated
     products are located in a densely connected core. Moreover, Albania has been losing comparative advantage
     in traditional goods (Box 1). Only a limited number of new goods are emerging, few of which require
     production capabilities that could enable Albania to expand its export profile.
    Albanian exports to the world continued to exhibit increasing physical capital content, but little
     progress with respect to median wage, skill, or human capital content (Figure 32). As a result, the export
     basket is relatively unsophisticated with respect to embedded human capital.21 The share of skilled workers
     associated with the products that Albania exports did not vary significantly by destination market or over
     time in terms of labor sophistication, although exports to Eastern Europe and Central Asia seemed to
     embody a lower skill content and a higher level of physical capital. Albanian exports to the EU and the
     Russian Federation were characterized by relatively low wages and low value added per worker compared
     with exports to Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
    Albania has underutilized its trade potential for exporting services. Service exports have exhibited a
     striking pace of growth since 2000. Albeit from a low base, service exports have increased fivefold since
     2000 (from $447.8 million in 2000 to $2,034.8 million in 2013). Growth in service exports can be mainly
     attributed to tourism-related and modern services (including financial service exports). However, the
     growth also dropped off (from 30 percent a year in 2002–07 to 5 percent a year in 2008–13).




20 See Hausmann, Klinger, and Lawrence (2003). The authors measure the distance between two products as the conditional

probability that an exporter with a revealed comparative advantage in product x also has a revealed comparative advantage in product
y. Empirically, countries climb the product space by developing goods close to those they currently produce. It has been shown
empirically that countries tend to diversify into export products close to those in which they are already specialized. It follows that
countries specialized in products that are closer to each other and the production of which requires capabilities that are used for the
production of other goods are able to upgrade their export basket more readily.
21 Export composition and destination markets matter, given that what and where a country exports affect the level and structure of

labor demand in the exporting country. The structure of a country's exports—that is, the types of products it exports, in which
sectors, and at what levels of value added—affects the types of labor needed to produce these exports. Export structure tends to vary
according to the destination market. Exporting to high-income countries, where consumers have a relatively high preference for
quality, stimulates the production of high-quality goods and increases the domestic demand for skilled labor (see Brambilla, I.,
Lederman, Guido Porto. 2012. “Exports, Export Destinations, and Skills.” American Economic Review 102 (7): 3406–38). There is also
empirical evidence that the types of products countries export matter for economic growth (see Hausmann, R., J. Hwang, and D.
Rodrik. 2007. “What You Export Matters.” Journal of Economic Growth 12 (1): 1–25; Verhoogen, E. A. 2008. “Trade, Quality Upgrading,
and Wage Inequality in the Mexican Manufacturing Sector.” Quarterly Journal of Economics 123 (2): 489–530). The latter author shows
that more-productive plants produce and export higher-quality goods than less-productive plants and pay higher wages to maintain a
higher-quality workforce.

    Box 1. Albania’s Exports
    Albania’s key export categories comprise raw materials or low–value added, labor-intensive
    products. Exports of minerals, fuels, and electricity have been growing steadily since 2005, emerging in
    2012–13 as the largest category of exports. Exports of wood and paper products have also grown moderately.
    After a major expansion in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the growth of exports of textiles and footwear has
    been moderate post-2008.
    Albania can enhance its trade in goods and services. It has a strong revealed comparative advantage in
    footwear, clothing-textiles, minerals (including crude oil), hides and skins (including leather), metals, tourism,
    and modern services (communications). Exports of goods and services need to regain ground to exploit
    these advantages (table B1.1).
    Export growth takes place primarily on the intensive margin, which means that growth was mostly
    driven by more exports of the same (old) products to the same (old) markets (figure B1.1).
    In the immediate precrisis period (2005–08), Albania’s growth on the extensive margins was relatively high,
    including new products in old markets (for example, Italy), and old products in new markets. This suggests
    that Albania’s established links with Italy and other EU markets could be an important strength of its
    exporting firms. Indeed, 60 percent and 40 percent of the exports of products to Italy, on average, survive
    for the first and second year, respectively, compared with an average survival rate of 42 percent and 24
    percent for the first and second year, respectively, for exports to the EU. However, Albania’s overall export
    relationships have a far lower survival rate than those of comparator countries. Only 42 percent of export
    flows remain active after the first year in Albania, and only 11 percent after four years. This compares with
    survival rates for Hungary—the peer country with the strongest survival performance—of 60 percent after
    year 1 and 29 percent after year 4. Albania’s export survival rate is lower than that of any of its peers except
    Armenia and Jordan, suggesting that exporting firms have difficulty expanding their product lines, or entering
    into new markets, or both.

Albania’s current export structure and characteristics suggest the country could exploit notable
advantages in expanding exports. A review of selected export categories reveals specific sectoral
constraints to exports as follows:
    -    Agribusiness. Agri-food value chain integration and market participation are still limited, but
         present significant income and job generation potential. Despite Albania’s favorable climate and
         geographical position, agricultural exports make up only around 5.4 percent of total exports (Q1
         2014), the lowest in the region. Albania has a large negative trade balance in agricultural products
         (the value of imports is more than five times the value of exports). At the end of 2013, of the active
         1,690 food enterprises, the majority were registered natural persons (78 percent) relying entirely on
         domestic capital (97 percent). Collectively, the industry provides jobs to only some 12,000 people.

                                                             24
            The main challenge of the sector is low competitiveness. The fragmented and subsistence-oriented
            supply base, legislative gaps, and poor enforcement of food safety standards, infrastructure
            deficiencies (power outages, poor transport networks, and so on), and the current business
            environment (to include high levels of informality) are all factors that have limited a much greater
            development of the food industry. As a result, Albania has not yet succeeded in taking advantage of
            both domestic and external (subregional and EU) market opportunities.
      -     Apparel and footwear. Albania has a small textile and shoe industry that relies on low–labor cost
            assembly operations and competes with lower-cost Asian producers who are also becoming more
            productive. Upgrading to higher–value added exports (that is, moving up the production chain to
            full product and branding) would allow Albania to maintain a niche in this sector for relatively small-
            scale, high-quality, and quick-turnaround production (especially for the well-established Italian
            market).
      -     Mining. Given Albania’s endowments in mineral resources, a balanced development of the mining
            sector by attracting foreign investors could contribute significantly to increasing exports. However,
            the governance framework needs to be strengthened to reinforce a competitive, transparent, stable,
            nondiscretionary regulatory regime that also accounts for environmental risk and sustainability.
      -     Tourism and tourism-related services are key channels through which Albania can achieve
            sustainable long-term growth while safeguarding the environment. For Albania to improve tourism
            offerings and penetrate international markets, it must stimulate more foreign interest and investment
            (which will require substantial improvements in the investment climate and the provision of public
            services such as access to good-quality infrastructure, an adequate water supply, better sanitation,
            adequate waste treatment services, and good land management practices) and, by doing so, increase
            its integration in the global tourism market. Growing the tourism sector will likely require a shift
            away from traditional and regional markets toward the EU and other high-income countries.


With the slowdown of the economy post-2008, the demand for labor declined across the board.
Construction and services suffered, including service exports, which had been the engines of employment
growth prior to the global financial crisis. Employment declined across all sectors, leading to contraction in
household incomes. In 2009–13, employment and labor participation rates fell, reaching 44.5 and 52.7 percent,
respectively; real private sector wages plummeted, especially in construction (see Figure 17). There were no gains
in total factor productivity post-2008. However, output per worker grew, primarily thanks to increasing capital
spending under a loose fiscal policy and, to a small extent, improving dependency ratios and human capital
increases.22

The global economic crisis weakened labor markets. The number of employed people declined by around
123,000 in just one year (2008–09), and the employment rate fell from 56.4 to 53.4 percent in 2007–10. The
slowdown affected youth and women in particular. There was a 5 percentage point reduction in female




22 Albania experienced the last stages of a demographic transition in the 2000s that allowed for a more rapid rise in the working-age

population relative to the total population. In turn, the population had higher human capital content as proxied by the average
education among adults.
                                                                    25
employment and an 8.4 percentage point fall in youth employment. The decline was 10.5 percentage point
among women aged 15–24 years (Figure 33).

With the decelerating pace of economic growth post-2008, accompanied by a contraction of the
demand for labor, poverty increased. Following a decrease in poverty of 13 percentage points (from 25.4
percent in 2002 to 12.5 percent in 2008), poverty levels rose in 2008–12 (Figure 2). Poverty increased from 10.2
to 13.6 percent in urban areas in 2008–12 (Figure 34), driven primarily by a shock to the labor market and, in
particular, the contraction of labor-intensive sectors such as construction. A disaggregation of prefectures by
rural and urban residence highlights sharp inequalities in welfare across the country: urban poverty ranged from
5.6 percent in Kukes to 17.5 percent in Lezhe; rural poverty ranged from 9.7 percent in Elbasan to 29.5 percent
in Kukes (Figure 35).23

of poverty and welfare across municipalities.

Post-2008, unemployment and economic inactivity were also associated with lower socioeconomic
status. Not only did inactivity rates double post-2008, but poverty rates were also significantly higher among
the inactive. From 15 percent in 2008, inactivity rates were 38 percent in 2013 (Figure 36). Individuals living in
households in which the heads were active (either employed or self-employed) or retired were less likely to be
poor than individuals living in households in which the heads were unemployed or inactive. Among households
in the bottom 40, for instance, 20 percent of working-age members were in unemployment, and 24 percent
were out of the labor force, compared with 13 percent and 15 percent, respectively, in the top 60 percent of
the income distribution (the top 60). In 2012, the incidence of poverty was 11 percent among households
headed by employed persons, 13 percent among households headed by retired persons, 22 percent among
households headed by unemployed persons, and 24 percent among households headed by inactive persons.
The profile of the less well off thus shows a higher share of household heads in unemployment and inactivity
among the bottom 20 and bottom 40 (Figure 37).

Emerging issues
Persistent loss of competitiveness, lack of productivity gains, and increases in poverty reflect the
inadequacy of the economic growth model to deliver sustainable gains in income. Albania’s inability to
recover fully from the external shock of 2008 exposed the limitation of the domestic-driven growth model that
depended on foreign flows to finance consumption, investment, and growth. This led to a deepening of
macroeconomic imbalances post-2008, a marked slowdown of economic growth, and a rise in poverty. If
unaddressed, these macroeconomic imbalances will continue to exert downward pressure on the economic
gains of households and discourage the accumulation and productive use of factors of production. For example,
the accumulation of arrears has contributed to the buildup of NPLs, which, in turn, has limited the ability of
productive firms to raise financing. High public debt constrains the government’s ability to open sufficient
fiscal space to strengthen social programs for the poor and, if unaddressed, could lead to a crowding out of
productive government spending.
Reducing macro-fiscal and financial sector vulnerabilities is a prerequisite for accelerating growth.
Albania suffers currently from macroeconomic imbalances related to high public debt, high structural-fiscal
deficits, public sector arrears, and a chronically high volume of NPLs in the financial sector that constrains
credit to the private sector. A competitive and inclusive economic model will require restoring and sustaining
macroeconomic stability to boost the confidence of investors with respect to the predictability of the economic
environment and, ultimately, support growth and protect incomes. Growth-friendly fiscal consolidation,
supported by improvements in public financial and debt management, is key to fiscal sustainability to ensure
                                                             28
that current fiscal policies are not implemented at the expense of future generations. Guarding financial sector
stability by reducing NPLs, reviving credit growth, and strengthening bank and nonbank prudential authorities
is essential for spurring growth and protecting the income of economic agents.

Restoring and maintaining the credibility of the government’s macro-fiscal framework is a high-order
necessity for propelling growth and prosperity. In the short term, exogenous factors such as the recovery
of the European economy will support better economic outcomes. However, the prospects for recovery in
Europe are subdued. Even if external demand fully recovers to precrisis levels, the Albanian economy can be
expected to grow at no more than 3 percent annually in the absence of reform. Such a growth rate is likely to
lead only to moderate and diminishing gains in poverty reduction (all else being equal). Therefore, the path of
successful convergence to EU incomes requires a structural shift toward increased productivity among Albanian
firms, a boost in the external competitiveness of the economy, and inclusion in the growth process within an
environment of macroeconomic stability. This type of quality growth is likely to generate long-term economic
and employment gains.

BLOCK 2: A BOTTOM-UP LENS: HOUSEHOLD AND FIRM ENDOWMENTS
FOR GENERATING ECONOMIC GAINS

Do households and firms have the endowments base to contribute to and benefit from the new economic growth model? The capacity
to generate economic gains from markets depends on the endowments and assets economic agents possess and their distribution, their
efficiency and intensity of use, and the returns economic agents receive from them. This section explores the stock and distribution of
endowments and the use of endowments in terms of human capital (demographics, health and education, and use in the labor
market), land and natural resources, and physical capital and financial assets. The efficient use of these endowments is essential to
the effort to boost growth, reduce poverty, and promote shared prosperity. The section also explores the functioning of labor markets,
given their importance in the generation of income among economic agents.

The main finding is that Albania is endowed and has accumulated a wealth of assets in many areas, but the use of these endowments
and assets has not been efficient. Overall, Albania has the endowment base to reap large economic benefits, although critical
deficiencies exist in education and skills. The country has not used its endowments efficiently to maximize economic gains in markets
and engender sustained poverty reduction and shared prosperity. By excluding parts of the population from the accumulation and
use of assets, it is forgoing an opportunity to realize growth potential.



Human Capital and Labor Markets24

Workers need to be prepared to contribute to and benefit from the growth process. They need to have
the skills, the incentives, and the opportunities required to participate in and respond to labor markets. Because
labor is the main source of income in most households, improving the quality of labor market engagement
among households can have a significant impact on living standards.

However, there are challenges in accumulating and making better use of human capital endowments,
particularly in improving employment opportunities. Labor market engagement is deteriorating, especially
in the quality of employment, among some population groups such as youth, women and minorities.




24 There are several challenges to including more extensive labor market analysis. First, Labor Force Survey microdata are available for

2007–11, but have been collected up to 2013. Before 2007, only administrative data on labor markets exist. Moreover, comparability
issues arise in terms of analyzing trends from 2011 onward. This analysis therefore discusses trends in 2007–10 and provides
additional in-depth exercises with the 2011 data only. For more recent labor market outcomes, it relies on published INSTAT data for
2013. Second, other in-depth analytical work is limited, partly because of the lack of engagement by the World Bank in this area.
                                                                     30
The labor market in Albania

Employment rates are low. Although employment rates are higher than in neighboring countries, only half
the working-age population had jobs in 2013.25 Unemployment stood at 16.1 percent in 2013, and only 60
percent of the working-age population was active in that year. Overall, youth and women are systematically
more disengaged from labor market activity (Figure 38); joblessness is staggeringly high among young women.
Among youth 15 to 29 years of age, only 29 percent were employed in 2013, and, among women 15 to 29 years
of age, the share was only 23 percent.26 The lower employment rates among youth and women are partly driven
by higher unemployment among youth (29 percent in 2013) and lower activity rates, particularly among young
women (30 percent). Overall, there is a 20 percentage point gender gap in labor force participation rates.

A large share of young women are not in employment, education, or training (NEET). Overall, the
share of NEETs reaches 18 percent among young people in the 20–24 age-group (Figure 39), comparable with
the rate in the EU.27 A closer look reveals that almost one in four women in the age-group is NEET, around
twice as high as the rate among young men in the age-group. The rate peaks at 29 percent among the 30–34
age-group. Similarly, around 29 percent of youth 20–24 years of age who have a primary-school education are
NEETs.

27 Eurofound (2012) reports that the average NEET rate in 2011 was 6.9 percent among 15- to 19-year-olds and 18.2 percent among

20- to 24-year-olds. (See Mascherini, Massimiliano, Lidia Salvatore, Anja Meierkord, and Jean-Marie Jungblut (2012) NEETs: Young

The quality of employment is also low. Close to half the employed work in agriculture, particularly women
(Figure 40). Among these, almost three-quarters have primary-school education or less, and almost all (98
percent) have secondary education or less. The services sector, accounting for over one-third of employment,
captures the majority (82 percent) of more highly educated workers.28 However, only 12 percent of the
workforce has tertiary education, in contrast to slightly more than half with only primary education or less.
Furthermore, among the employed, a large share corresponds to either unpaid family workers (31 percent), the
vast majority of whom work in agriculture (91 percent) and are women (71 percent), or to the self-employed
(29 percent).29 Thus, the agricultural sector accounts for a large share of employment, particularly among the
low skilled, but most workers are either in self-employment or unpaid family workers (Figure 40).

Informality is widespread in the labor market. Estimates suggest that close to half of total employment
outside agriculture corresponds to informal employment, and nearly three-quarters of the labor in construction
is informal (Figure 42, Box 2).30 Although trends point to a slight decline, informality remains substantial.

by INSTAT.

      Box 2. Informality in the construction sector
      Key findings of an International Labour Organization survey of 200 male construction workers in
      Albania on the topic of informality are as follows:a
       84 percent of the respondents said they worked informally, and about half said they would prefer their incomes
        to be declared
       72 percent of the respondents nonetheless generally support the concept of informal employment
       Respondents favored informal services because of lower prices (40 percent) and more rapid delivery (22 percent)
       43 percent of the respondents were regularly employed informally
      Respondents attributed the widespread informality in the sector to limited employment opportunities,
      high taxes and social contributions that provide incentives for informality among employers and
      employees, and issues with the legal system.
      a. ILO (2011). Another survey conducted among street vendors (7 percent of the total were interviewed) found
      that around 80 percent of all vendors work without a license, and 90 percent do not pay taxes.


Several constraints to a more vibrant and inclusive labor market seem to limit the accumulation and
efficient use of human capital. Beyond the need to boost labor demand, these constraints affect the
accumulation and stock of human capital assets, particularly in education, but lead overall to poor utilization of
assets as a means to obtain labor income. First, although the workforce is moderately young and health
outcomes have improved, important gaps exist in access to basic education and in the quality and labor market
relevance of education and training systems (see below). Second, as in neighboring countries, disincentives and
barriers to formal employment contribute to substantial informality and reduction in fiscal revenues, especially
among some population groups. Third, the dynamics of the labor market are deeply affected by geographical


                                                               33
mobility, particularly international migration. Nonetheless, there is a significant knowledge gap about labor
markets in Albania. This should be addressed to clarify the constraints and policy options for higher-quality
labor market engagement.

Demographic characteristics and health care
While Albania has a moderately young population, labor market outcomes suggest that this
endowment is not being used optimally. In 2010, the share of the 65+ age-group in the population was 9.7
percent, well below the average in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (12.1 percent), and 21.3 percent of the
population is 15 years of age or less, compared with the regional average of 17.5 and an average of 16.8 percent
among countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This relatively
young age structure represents a potential source of economic growth, provided that this pool of human capital
can be used intensively and effectively. The evidence represented by the labor market engagement of youth
suggests, however, that this is currently the case. Challenges will emerge as the demographic dividend begins to
disappear and as the dependency ratio rises when, later on, these larger cohorts entering the workforce today
retire (by 2050), causing a significant expansion in the population share of the elderly (Figure 43).31 Another
issue that could affect the human capital endowment (and on which more research is needed) is the high ratio
of births of boys relative to girls, estimated at around 111.7, one of the highest ratios in the region.32

31 By 2050, 25 percent of Albania’s population is likely to be aged 65 and older, which puts it well over the 2050 average of 23.1

percent in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
32 These sex imbalances at birth arise because of the missing girls problem also identified in some Asian countries and in the south

Caucasus, which usually reflects a combination of factors, including son preference, declining fertility rates, and sex-selective
abortions. (See World Vision and UNFPA (2012) “Sex Imbalances at Birth in Albania” for details on Albania.)

Larger households with children are overrepresented among the poor and bottom 40. The age-gender
pyramid (Figure 44), which also presents the share of poor across age-groups, shows that poverty is more
prevalent among households with younger children (often minorities). Among households in the bottom 40,
28 percent of the members are under 15 years of age, compared with 16 percent among the top 60. Controlling
for other factors, having an infant in the household increased the probably of being poor by over 60 percent,
and each additional child was associated with a 50 percent increased probability of being poor, compared to a
one-third average increase in probability of being poor for each additional elderly person.33

Albania has a relatively healthy population and workforce because of improvements in health
outcomes in recent years, but significant inequities persist among socioeconomic groups. Life
expectancy at birth reached 77 years in 2011 (80 among women and 74 among men), higher than in neighboring
Serbia (74.5) and FYR Macedonia (75) and only three to five years behind high-income countries such as Greece
and Italy. Infant and maternal mortality rates have declined, but remain high. Children in rural areas are twice
as likely to die before age 1 as children born in urban areas, while children in mountainous regions are four
times more likely to die before age 1.34 While child malnutrition has declined steadily in the past decade, over a
quarter of children in the poorest quintile were stunted (suffering from chronic malnutrition) in 2009, compared


33World Bank analysis using LSMS data from 2005, 2008, and 2012.
34The infant mortality rate fell from 18.1 per 1,000 live births in 2007 to 15 in 2012, and the maternal mortality rate fell from 31 per
1,000 women in 2005 to 27 in 2010. Still, both the infant and maternal mortality rates are high compared with the EU 2011 averages
of 4.1 per 1,000 live births and 5.8 per 1,000 women, respectively. Neonatal mortality, an important indicator of the quality of health
care, needs particular attention. Infant mortality per 1,000 live births was 12 in urban areas, 24 in rural areas, and 42 in mountainous
regions (based on INSTAT data and the 2010 Demographic and Health Survey). No data are available on adult mortality
disaggregated by income.
                                                                     35

development and productivity.

The growing risk of premature mortality and morbidity because of noncommunicable diseases
threaten future household well-being and productivity and disproportionately affect the poor and the
bottom 40. Noncommunicable diseases are responsible for 89 percent of adult deaths. Ischemic heart disease,
stroke, and cancers are the leading causes of death. While the Mediterranean diet is said to be a likely explanation
for the relatively good adult health (despite the significant shortcomings in the quality and equity of the health
care system), eating habits are changing, and other risk factors are increasing. Smoking rates have risen in the
past decade, and currently half of all men smoke. In 2012, 10 percent of adults (age 16-64) and 46 percent of
those over 65 reported having a chronic illness. The contribution of diabetes to the disease burden grew by 90
percent in 1990–2010. Hypertension has emerged as a major risk factor and disproportionately affects the poor.
In 2009, one-third of men in the poorest quintile were hypertensive, compared with 20 percent in the upper
quintile.35 An analysis of household data found that chronic disease was significantly associated with a 44
percent increase in the increased likelihood of poverty in 2005, controlling for other factors. This declined to a
23 percent increase in 2012, which suggests some progress in providing protection against the impoverishing
effects of illness, but remains high.

Out-of-pocket health care expenditures are high, particular among the poor, thereby increasing
consumption poverty. In the case of health care, households often bypass lower-cost primary care services to
seek care in hospitals or the private sector and pay too much for medicines because of weaknesses in
pharmaceutical pricing and regulation. In 2012, out-of-pocket spending on health care represented 10 percent
of total consumption expenditures among the poor, compared with 5 percent among the wealthiest quintile.36
This is more than in comparator countries, and the average health care spending of the poor exceeds a common
threshold for catastrophic health spending.37 An estimated 6 percent of Albanians have been driven into poverty
by health care spending.38 This is high by EU standards, and the situation has deteriorated among the poor in
recent years (such as a rise of 7 percent in out-of-pocket health care spending in 2008), despite a modest
expansion in health insurance coverage (a growth in coverage from one-third to one-half of the poorest in
2008–12). Controlling for other factors, health insurance coverage was associated with a one-third decrease in
the likelihood of being poor in 2012.

37 Catastrophic expenditure is typically defined as spending more than 10 to 25 percent of total household consumption on health

care. In Western Europe, the average out-of-pocket health care expenditure is about 3 percent of household consumption, with an
average of about 5 percent in comparable countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (Smith, Owen, and Son Nguyen. 2013. Getting
Better. Washington, DC: World Bank.)

Poor quality and inequality in access to health care further affect the opportunities to the efficient
accumulation and use of human capital of disadvantaged groups. While the health care system performs
well on some measures of access to basic services, there are significant shortcomings in quality and equity.
While child vaccination coverage is high, and nearly all women deliver in health facilities, only a third of poor
women were informed by their health providers of signs of complications in pregnancy, compared with 73
percent among more well off women. Ninety-eight percent of poor women reported barriers to access,
compared with two-thirds among the wealthiest quintile. Among poor women, the major barriers to access are
the cost of treatment (80 percent), distance and transportation (about 60 percent), concerns that no medicines
or providers would be available (65 percent), and concerns about inadequate supplies and equipment (75
percent).39 In 2011, 59 percent of Roma reported not being able to afford essential drugs prescribed to them in
the previous year, compared to 31 percent of their non-Roma neighbors (Figure 47).40 In terms of quality, a
recent survey found that Albanian doctors gave correct diagnosis and recommended treatment only half the
time when they were presented with hypothetical patient vignettes. Among male adults (15–49) with
hypertension, 90 percent were not aware of their condition; 6 percent were aware, but not under treatment: 3
percent were under treatment, but not successfully; and only 1 percent were receiving treatment and had their
hypertension under control.41 Sexual minorities face a lack of access to and quality of health services, especially

Albania has raised the access to all levels of education, thus strengthening the human capital base of
the new generation of workers. Half the working-age population has only primary education or less (see
above). The level of education of the flow of workers that will enter the labor market in the future is showing
improvement: primary and lower-secondary enrollments are nearly universal, and, in 2009–13, preprimary net
enrollment shot up from 47 to 79 percent, while upper-secondary gross enrollment climbed from 76 percent
to 92 percent. Gross enrollment ratios compare favorably with regional peers and the OECD average, and
gender gaps have disappeared. This expansion in access has been augmented by the growing provision of
private education. In 2007–13, the share of private school enrollments in basic education (primary and lower
secondary) increased from 4.1 percent of students to 5.4 percent; in upper secondary from 7.5 percent to 11.2
percent; and in higher education from 6.6 to 19.0 percent, almost tripling. However, the large gap between
gross and net enrollment rates suggests that there is poor internal efficiency. Many students are falling behind
the appropriate grade for their age-group. In upper-secondary education, the gap is about 20 percent, meaning
that about a quarter of upper-secondary students are older than the official age-for-grade. In terms of
enrollment, girls have parity with boys at early ages; gaps in favor of girls emerge starting at age 12.

Nonetheless, inequalities remain. The bottom 40 and the poor show lower enrollment rates and lower
educational attainment, limiting the access of these groups to economic opportunities and, thus, the potential
asset-base of the country (Table 1). In preprimary education, for example, net enrollment is twice as high among

the wealthiest quintile as among the poorest quintile. In 2011, only a third of Roma children were enrolled in
preschool, perpetuating the cycle of poverty.43 Studies have demonstrated the importance of early childhood
development for overall cognitive development and for lifetime earnings potential, particularly among poor
and marginalized populations.44 The incidence of poverty is highest in households in which individuals have
not completed primary education, at 15 percent (capturing around 66 percent of the total poor) (Figure 48). The
socioeconomic gap in higher education is significantly wider. More than two times more people in the highest
quintiles are enrolled in tertiary education relative to the poorest quintiles. Inequalities also exist in the stock of
human capital, thus affecting the opportunities available to the workforce of today (Figure 49). The share of
individuals with primary education or less is significantly higher among the poorer groups.

Returns to higher education are high, but, relative to primary education, there seem to be, on average,
no wage incentives for individuals and households to invest in secondary education. The wage premium
for tertiary educational attainment relative to secondary education increased only over the past decade (as in
other countries in the region), rising from 48 percent in 2002 to around 62 percent in 2008 (Figure 50). More
recent analysis based on the Labor Force Survey (2011) suggests that returns remain high (at 50 percent relative
to primary educational attainment), but that there is no wage premium for secondary schooling.45 This zero
average wage premium for secondary education (relative to primary), the underlying factors of which should be
explored, likely affects the incentive to continue the formal education path past primary school, especially
among a large part of the labor force in the informal sector.46 Moreover, the high returns to tertiary education
are out of reach of a large share of the poor and the bottom 40 given the lower levels of educational attainment
among these groups. Evidence in the region also suggests that, even among individuals with tertiary education,
the average returns mask significant disparities, and the returns may not be equally available to all, particular to
the poor.47

Returns to education also differ by gender. It is estimated that women who are wage employed earn around
20 percent less than men with similar characteristics in terms of age and education even after one has accounted
for the sector and type of employment. The gap widens in younger cohorts (aged 40 or less), reaching around
24 percent.

The quality of education at all levels is inadequate to equip students with the basic skills the labor
market requires. Although students in Albania have consistently improved their scores in international
assessments, learning outcomes are stubbornly low even relative to neighboring countries with similar levels of
income. More than 60 percent of 15-year-olds are functionally illiterate in mathematics, while about 50 percent
are deficient in reading. These are among the highest shares of functional illiteracy among youth in countries
participating in the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment. The learning gap between the
OECD average and Albania is equivalent to 2.5 years of schooling (Figure 51 and Figure 52). A data gap needs
to be filled on socioemotional skills, an assessment of which should start in preschools.

Firms cite inadequate skills as a constraint to business development, signaling labor market demands
inconsistency with education and training outcomes. There are no internationally comparable data on the
quality and relevance of upper-secondary and tertiary education in Albania; however, among the South East
European 6 (SEE6) countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, FYR Macedonia, Montenegro, and
Serbia), Albania has the largest share (36 percent) of firms reporting that the workforce does not possess the
skills they require, highlighting a potentially important skills mismatch in the country. A general trend in the
region is a shift from jobs that require unskilled (routine and manual) to skilled (nonroutine cognitive) labor.
Such a trend is also necessary in Albania if the new growth model is to succeed. This calls for a thorough
assessment of the education and training systems in the country and their links to labor demand.

Moreover, given that Albania still faces severe quality challenges throughout the formal education
system, training systems and adult learning programs, although important, might not be the
immediate area of focus given the limited analytical base. Nonetheless, progress can be made in improving
these by prioritizing the establishment of a multistakeholder skills task force, promoting autonomy among
training institutions, and promoting training, along with job placement support for the jobless. Steps in the
right direction include the decision to transfer technical and vocational education and training from the Ministry
of Education and Sports to the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare to ensure closer ties between labor policies
and training provision; coordination with higher education institutions and training providers outside of the
formal education system remains a challenge.

The capacity of the economy to innovate is limited. The economy continues to be a source of low-
technology and low–value added exports partly because of limited capacity for research and development
(R&D) and innovation, which constrain firms from achieving smarter, more rapid growth. Albania lags
substantially behind other countries in the EU and the SEE6 countries in research capabilities and innovation.
It does not have a critical mass of specialized researchers, nor does it have sufficient infrastructure and funding
for research excellence. According to United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization
estimates based on partial data, gross expenditures on R&D in Albania represented only 0.15 percent of GDP
(compared to 1.9 percent European average) in 2008, funded almost exclusively by the public sector and by
foreign sources. While public financing for R&D will remain constrained in the current fiscal environment in
Albania, efficiency gains can be achieved by strengthening the institutional framework to ensure the effective
targeting of scarce R&D and innovation funds to the best potential firms and research projects (box 3).

Labor regulations

Labor regulations influence the cost firms face in hiring and firing workers and can also affect
employment decisions regarding the type of labor market engagement individuals and firms pursue.
The impact of labor regulations on aggregate employment or unemployment is ambiguous, but work across
countries shows that it is likely to be limited if it is within a certain range of flexibility or rigidity.48 Nonetheless,
some groups, particularly outsiders such as youth and women might be more affected by stringent labor market
regulations. Research is needed to establish the extent to which labor market regulations affect labor outcomes
in Albania, as the country fares differently across various available indicators. For instance, in terms of flexibility
in setting wages, the country ranks particularly poorly at 123rd in 148 countries (the worst position among
Southeast European countries).49 Similarly, cross-country regional data for 2010 placed Albania as one of the

countries with the highest minimum wage (as a percentage of the average wage).50 Conversely, the country
ranks well worldwide in the flexibility in hiring and firing workers (position 29 in 148 countries). Few firms
report labor regulations as an obstacle in operations.51

Disincentives to (formal) work

Firms and workers may face disincentives to work that keep them out of the labor market or out of
formal employment. In the case of Albania, it is particularly important to understand the factors that result in
such high levels of informality outside the agricultural sector. Disincentives, as in other countries, could be
linked to the levels or structure of labor taxation and social protection benefits.52

Evidence on work disincentives from taxes and social protection systems is, however, scarce for
Albania. Labor taxation in Albania is higher than in non-European OECD countries, although it is slightly
lower than the regional average (Figure 53). Compared with neighboring countries, Albania lies in the middle in
terms the extent to which labor taxation gives rise to work disincentives. Beyond the level of taxation, the
structure of taxation also matters. The progressivity of labor taxation recently improved in Albania, which, in
January 2014, went from a flat taxation system that treated all workers the same regardless of earnings, thus
penalizing low-wage earners, to a progressive taxation system.53 Evidence on the potential impact of this
measure on employment is not yet available.

Even if labor taxation is not particularly high in Albania and has an improved structure, other factors
could affect the willingness of Albanians to contribute.54 One potential source of disincentives to (formal)
work related to labor taxation is the perception of governance issues, inefficiencies in the provision of public
services and government spending (see below), and disincentives to pay social security, given the recently
addressed delinks between benefits and contributions.55

The impact of social protection on aggregate labor market outcomes is expected to be limited.
Evidence from countries in the region suggests that the design of a social protection system has the potential
to discourage (formal) work. In Albania, the main social assistance program Ndihma Ekonomike has built-in
work disincentives from exclusionary filters discouraging employment. These are currently being reformed,
with ongoing pilot projects in three regions, toward a proxy means-tested targeting system. Given the low
coverage and generosity of the program, it is likely to have limited impact in explaining aggregate labor market
outcomes.

While the impact is arguably limited, the joint effect on formal employment of labor taxation and
social protection systems should be explored. Evidence on neighboring countries in Southeast Europe
suggests that combined disincentives from labor taxation and social protection systems have the potential to
keep individuals out of formal employment. These disincentives arise from high implicit tax rates that capture
both labor taxation and forgone social benefits in the take-up of formal employment.56

Disincentives for formal employment in Albania, in particular, warrant special attention given the high
levels of informality. Although analysis is needed to determine the root causes of informal employment and
policy options, recent work by the International Labour Organization (ILO 2011) suggests a combination of
factors, possibly reinforcing each other, that could raise the incentives to informality related to “complex legal
and administrative regulations, high overall taxes and social security contributions, a lack of trust in the
institutions and administrative procedures, a lack of access to formal property, a long-term decline in the tax-
paying ethic, and a broad acceptance by the wider public of illicit work.”57 These factors are combined with the
limited capacity of institutions to tackle and investigate cases of informal employment. Box 3 captures some of
the available insights on the region that are not available on Albania.

Box 3: Disincentives to (formal) employment from labor taxation and social protection systems in
the western Balkans
The World Bank report Back to Work: Growing with Jobs in Europe and Central Asia looks at how labor taxation
and social protection systems can potentially affect incentives to work across countries in the region (Arias
et al. 2014). Evidence on the western Balkans shows that labor taxation and social protection systems,
particularly given their structure and design, do not always make (formal) work pay. In terms of taxation, it
remains high in some countries, but it is also less progressive than in Western Europe, potentially
discouraging work among low-wage earners. Levels of taxation are higher in Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Serbia than in their neighbors and the regional average (figure B4.1). In FYR Macedonia and Serbia, low
progressivity is driven by artificially high social contribution rates for low-wage earners given the existence
of reference wages. Furthermore, social protection systems are often designed in such a way that they
discourage or even prohibit work through employment-related exclusionary filters, low retirement ages,
abrupt withdrawal of benefits, and other factors.
Together, labor taxation and social protection can make the cost of moving out of inactivity or
unemployment high for countries in the western Balkans, particularly among low-wage earners (figure B4.1).
In Serbia, around 85 percent of labor income is taxed away for a low-wage earner shifting from inactivity
(receiving social assistance) to a formal job. On average in the western Balkans, the move out of
unemployment can be particularly onerous, with around 64 percent of the new earnings lost between forgone
unemployment benefits and labor taxes.

Barriers to work

Barriers to jobs also exist, potentially more binding among some groups, such as youth, women, and
the less well off, thereby limiting the utilization of human capital in labor markets. These barriers may
relate to inadequate skills (discussed above and particularly relevant for the less well off), but also to other
factors such as inflexible work arrangements, access to productive inputs, limited social capital, access to
childcare, and attitudes and social norms, particularly as these affect women.58

    Flexible work arrangements: around 24 percent of the employed work part time, and, among these
     people, women are overrepresented (61 percent). Although the share of part-time workers in Albania is
     higher than in neighboring countries, it is not clear whether this reflects the fulfillment of worker
     preferences or is another manifestation of low-quality employment that is capturing the work schedules of
     unpaid family workers, for instance.
    Social capital: social capital can provide households with access to networks that could facilitate links with
     jobs, access to credit, and a cushion from asset depletion in the face of shocks. Albanians put a high value
     on having connections to facilitate access to a public or private job: around 67 percent of Albanians
     consider that having connections is moderately important, very important, or essential in obtaining a good
     public or private job.59 This might put age categories such as youth (as new labor market entrants) and the
     less well off at a disadvantage because they can likely count on fewer of these networks to link them to
     labor markets. Among women, the poor, and the bottom 40, lower endowments in social capital may be
     one of the factors hindering the access to networks that could open up economic opportunities. Of
     individuals in the bottom 40, for example, only 8 percent say they participate in at least one association
     (such as trade unions, neighborhood associations, religious, cultural, or political groups), as opposed to 16
     percent of individuals in the top 60.60
    Access to and use of productive inputs such as land and natural resources or financial services:
     access to inputs represents an additional obstacle to (formal) employment (see below). For instance,
     Albania has one of the lowest scores in Europe and Central Asia in terms of the ease of obtaining a bank
     loan, and access to financing is considered one of the most problematic factors in doing business.61 T The
     lack of access to finance limits the availability of poor and middle income households to afford formal
     housing and contributes to the growth of the informal housing sector. In addition, the land markets and

Childcare and social norms: A relatively small share of children, particularly among the bottom quintile, are
enrolled in preprimary school (see above). Because social norms across the region dictate that women are the
main providers of child and elder care and household work, limited access to child care and less time available
for work outside the home might represent barriers for women’s participation in productive employment. In
Albania, similar to other countries in the region, women spend less time in paid work compared with unpaid
work (Figure 55); among women with children under 6 years of age, the time spent on childcare-related activities
is high, and such women perform more unpaid than paid work relative to other women. Evidence on European
countries suggests that greater access to and affordability of childcare can positively impact female labor force
participation.62 Attitudes toward women might affect even women who work by promoting gender segregation

International migration is high in Albania. From a share of 5 percent of the resident population in 1990 at
the end of the communist era in Albania, the stock of emigrants rose to 40 percent, where it has remained since
2010. In 2013, almost 1.3 million Albanians were living outside the country, most of them in Greece (46 percent)
and Italy (36 percent).63 Compared with the global mean and regional averages, emigration rates in Albania are
exceptionally high and a rather recent phenomenon (Table 2).

Largely because of migration, the resident population has declined, particularly among people of
working age. The population pyramid in 2011 shows a decline since 2001, particularly among the 20-45 age-
group (Figure 56). Although natural population increase (births relative to deaths) is comparably high in Albania,
the population was around 2.8 million in 2011, compared with around 3.1 million in 2001. Decomposing the
change in population into natural increase and net migration (immigration relative to emigration) shows that
most of the decline in Southeast Europe in recent years can be attributed to negative net migration rates. Among
other SEE countries, only in Serbia has population shrinkage more severe.

The high international migration rates in Albania, particularly among those of working-age and the
more well educated, impact not only the human capital base, (and hence, the economic growth
process of Albania), but also the capacity of the domestic labor market to create jobs and absorb labor.
The proportion of individuals of working age is larger among emigrants than among the resident population,
which results in a reduction of the labor force and higher old-age dependency ratios. Because migrants are
relatively younger in the case of Albania, the resident population is older than the average emigrant, imposing
additional fiscal challenges on the country. Moreover, the share of emigrants above the age of 25 who have
completed secondary or tertiary education is considerably higher than the corresponding share among the



63On average, in 2000–11, around 5 percent of emigrants obtained a foreign nationality per year, which, over time, represents a
considerable number of Albanians with new nationalities. See the Trends in International Migrant Stock (database), Population

resident population (Figure 57), exacerbating the skills challenges of as well as affecting the labor market
conditions in the country. Evidence shows that a large share of (returned) migrants went abroad to seek or take
up employment opportunities: around 82 percent of male migrants (who comprise the majority of migrants)
were working abroad (compared with around 40 percent of women), and 38 percent had a prearranged job.
Few returned migrants left to pursue studies.64 Given that migration is seemingly related to attractive labor
market conditions abroad (especially for the better educated), part of the observed unemployment in Albania
may be explained as the consequence of a high reservation price and part with the inability of the supply of
skills to keep up with shifts in demand.65 Last, but not least, the high education level of migrants also suggests
that migrants are not largely comprised of the poor or the less well off.66

64 Returned migrants are those who lived abroad more than three months at any time in their lives. Data are from the LSMS 2012

reported in a forthcoming gender note on Albania by the World Bank using LSMS data.
65 This is to say that among those that have the opportunity to migrate, but remain in Albania, may have a high asking price before

accepting a job. Further analytical work on “reservation wages” is needed to uncover some of the dynamics and links among
unemployment, job creation, migration, and other factors.
66 Similar data on other Southeast European countries show less evidence for a drain on human resources. In Bosnia and Herzegovina,

FYR Macedonia, and Serbia, emigrants are characterized by similar or even lower levels of education than their resident counterparts.
                                                                  50

Migration in Albania has differentiated gender and socioeconomic patterns. The migration of women
and the migration of the poor and the bottom 40 are less prevalent, compared with the migration of men, the
non-poor, and the more well off. Fewer women migrated for work (38.5 percent among women compared with
81.6 percent among men); they were more likely to go abroad with family to join a spouse. Nonetheless, migrant
women are more likely to be from urban areas, of better socioeconomic status, and of higher educational
attainment than migrant men.

These patterns affect the human capital base of the country and highlight the need to raise
productivity in the economy to achieve the high income growth Albania aims for. The migration patterns
also affect the economic opportunities available to individuals and households with certain characteristics.
Figure 58 approximates a hypothetical population pyramid that represents the demographic structure by gender,

broad age-group, and education that could be observed if all emigrants to OECD countries returned to Albania
or, alternatively, if they had never left the country. It is apparent that more men were lost to migration than
women, and particularly the cohorts now between 25 and 64 years of age would be much larger. If all emigrants
to OECD countries returned, the average human capital would grow, reversing the drain on human resources
that Albania has experienced over the last three decades. The high out-migration puts even more emphasis on
the need to shift the growth model toward raising the productivity of the economy.

Land and Natural Resources as Productive Assets

Although Albania is endowed with rich natural diversity and abundant natural resources, their use as
productive inputs by households and firms presents challenges. The beautiful coastline holds potential
for tourism and economic development as one of the key drivers of growth. Yet, to realize this potential, the
country needs a major upgrade in its environmental infrastructure, municipal services, improved planning, and
the protection of coastal assets. Similarly, abundant hydro resources play a key role in the economy, but remain
highly dependent on weather conditions, and therefore highly volatile. Albania has a high proportion of forest
cover and fertile soils but most of the forest and pastureland is in poor condition. Fragile soils, combined with
unsustainable forestry and agricultural practices have led to severe erosion, particularly in remote uphill areas
where rural poverty is concentrated and persists. Erosion has also reduced the carrying capacity of pastures,
decreased agricultural yields, and increased fertilizer costs on agricultural land, a worrisome trend given the
large share of jobs that are dependent on agriculture. Upstream soil erosion and downstream sedimentation are
causing problems with drainage, irrigation, power infrastructure, and flooding.

Insecure property rights issues are in the core of the inability of households and firms to use land
endowments as productive assets. Albania has one of the lowest scores in the world in terms of property
rights, particularly physical property rights (Figure 59). Similarly, it is ranked 137 in 148 countries in overall
property rights, far behind neighboring countries such as FYR Macedonia (56), Montenegro (73), Bosnia and
Herzegovina (105), and Serbia (130).67 Albania is the second-worst performer in the Eastern Europe and
Central Asia region with respect to registering property, ranking 118 globally. Widespread informality and the
weak enforcement of property rights has limited the ability of owners to enter the formal property market, use
property as collateral to obtain access to credit, or even to obtain utility services or protection from
expropriation.

Unresolved policy, legal and institutional issues are the key impediments to secure property rights.
Although Albania made rapid progress in post-1991 land reform and privatization programs, challenges remain
due to unrealistic land policy, an incoherent legal framework, fragmented institutional responsibility, and a land
administration system that has not been modernized. Specifically:

         Land Policy: Albania has committed itself to an unrealistic financial obligation for restitution of property
          nationalized under the socialist regime. It has set the standard for compensation at full, current market
          value of nationalized proprties. Albania is the only country in the region to set such high and unrealistic
          standards. In addition, the delayed implementation of legalization of land increases tenure insecurity.
          Overall, a comprehensive integrated land management policy and legal framework would help resolve
          and harmonize the remaining land reform and policy issues. It will be critical to guide urban planning
          and management, agriculture and rural development, forestry and tourism to improve land
          management and land use.
         Land Administration: There is a large amount of unresolved property claims; almost 70 percent of all
          civil cases pending in Albanian courts and a large number of cases at the European Court of Human
          Rights involve land disputes. This is partly a reflection of the existence of manual property registration
          systems. Almost 80 percent of the property registration data in Albania is paper-based, outdated, and
          of unreliable quality. Lack of digitalization and poor quality in the underlying maps and data are among
          the key constrains to the operation of land markets in Albania. While the Immovable Property
          Registration (IPRO) performs the national land administration function, further modernization and
          strengthening are needed to build a professional and transparent agency. Although the IPRO has
          developed a modern IT system, less than 10% of the properties in the country are digitally registered.



                                                             53
           Reliable IPRO data are also key for development of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure in
           compliance with the EU Directive related to spatial data.
          Institutional Aspects: Overall, the institution structure for administration of property rights requires
           consolidation and better management. There are too many institutions responsible for allocating and
           managing immovable property which has led to gaps and overlaps in responsibility and weak
           coordination. Ultimately, it would be more efficient to consolidate authority and responsibility to a
           single authority.

Weak enforcement of property rights has led to uncontrollable growth of informal settlements in urban
areas, hampering the efficiencies in the use of land and space in cities. The process of transition to
market economy in Albania was reflected in an intense and unplanned urbanization of Albanian cities (also
discussed in Block 1). It is estimated that between 1992 and 1996 the informal sector provided 60 percent of
the total number of houses built by the private sector.68 This has led to inefficiencies in the allocation of land,
land use and space (density) which have led to reducing the benefits of agglomeration. Lack of urban planning,
reflected in the rapid informal growth of urban areas, has therefore undermined the growth potential of
Albanian cities (Figure 12). It is estimated that only 0.6 percent of the country’s territory has a development plan
and only 30 of the 373 local government units count with territorial development plans.69

Poor enforcement of property rights has also impeded the farm consolidation process in rural areas.
The land privatization process has resulted in a large number of tiny and scattered farms, holding back the
development of the agricultural sector. As of 2012, there were 350,916 agricultural holdings in Albania,
averaging 1.02 ha.70 Each farm unit operates on about 4.9 dispersed parcels of 0.2 ha each. Such production
structures lack technical and economic efficiency. Farm fragmentation has not yet been overcome by collective
action at input supply and/or marketing levels. Producer associations are very weak, and the few groups that
were established were mainly donor-driven and not sustainable.71

Most farmers remain locked in low-income, subsistence structures, unable to utilize their land assets
to generate economic gains. For the privately-owned land, leasing is at very low levels, estimated at 6 to 10
percent in 2013, and is mostly informal.72 The sales of agricultural land are even lower, with less than 2 percent
of the rural households having sold their land on the formal market.73 While almost all holdings report selling

69 On the planning side, the Government has undertaken recent reforms aimed at achieving a more sustainable urban development. In
2009, it passed a law on Territorial Planning which required all local government units LGUs to have a territorial plan. A second law
was passed in July, 2014 to further define the roles and responsibilities in planning of LGUs.
70 The average farm size remained relatively stagnant over the years, fluctuating between 1 and 1.25 ha over 2000-2012. Similarly, the

average size of parcels stayed virtually unchanged.

some of their output, primarily on the local markets, the amounts sold and the resulting incomes are marginal.
The average yearly monetary gross income from sales per farm is estimated at EUR 2,221 in 2012 (Table 3),
with livestock accounting for 54 percent, and field crops for 30 percent. With an average farm household of
4.5 people, this only translates into gross revenue of EUR 1.4 a day per person. Most holdings (86 percent) are
engaged in mixed farming systems that combine crops and livestock. Incomes from products processed on-
farm are rather negligible: they account for only 8 percent of the total gross income from sales, and are mainly
generated by brandy (raki), cheese and wine.

Some groups, such as women and the less well off, are at an additional disadvantage because they are
excluded from landownership. There are almost twice as many men landowners than women landowners,
and most women landowners have a property share of less than 25 percent.74 Current administrative procedures
of land legalization and registration exacerbate the gender inequalities in landownership.75 Furthermore, the
bottom 40 and the poor count on smaller plots relative to the rest of the population, also limiting their ability
to use these endowments to produce market income. Efforts to increase formalization, some under way, could
promote not only investment and growth, but also social inclusion, help streamline property tax collection by
making it more equitable and transparent, and provide an important source of income to local governments
that can be invested on improved services.76

Capital Allocation, Financial Assets, and Financial Intermediation

Gross fixed capital formation was a key driver of the precrisis growth boom of Albania. Gross fixed
capital formation expanded, on average, by 13.3 percent in 2000–08 and accounted for an average of 25 percent
of output. In the period 200-08, some 80 percent of total investment originated in the private sector. Private
investment grew by an average of 10 percent a year, reflecting to a large extent a boom in construction. Public
investment, at 17 percent of gross fixed capital formation, rose even more quickly, at a 13 percent annual




74 This disparity translates into mortgages: two-thirds of mortgages are taken out by men, and one-third by women.
75 The current administrative procedure of land legalization and registration that establishes an almost invariably man-head of
household or family head as the sole agent and representative on land issues contributes to the systematic decline in women property
owners. As these practices continue, the chances are high that property (housing and land) will be increasingly owned by men.
76 The government has launched an ambitious legalization program through ALUIZNI, a government entity that is helping to bring

several informally owned properties—most occupied by the poor—into the formal sector.
                                                                   55
average. The capital spending expanded at a rate of 6.6 percent. The bulk of capital spending (about 60 percent)
went to the transport sector for new road construction, not for the maintenance of existing infrastructure.

Overall, investment declined to an average of 1.2 percent a year between 2009 and 2014. Shrinking
revenue and the need for substantial downward adjustment of spending meant that most of the adjustment
burden after 2008 was borne by capital expenditure, one of the few discretionary items in the budget. Public
investment contracted by an average of 5.8 percent per annum from 2009 to 2014. Private investment also
decelerated to an annual average of 0.35 percent, due to overall slowdown of the economy and the contraction
in the construction industry.

Returns on investment are low in Albania, and they have been on a steep declining path over the past
decade and a half. Rates of return on capital (RORKs) have declined by over 30 percent since 2000, while
investment has been steadily increasing (Figure 60). The notable boost in investment prior to 2008 coincided
with the boom in the construction industry in the private sector, and in the public sector, it was the start of
building of new roads. Steeply declining RORKs indicate an increasing opportunity cost of capital.

While Albania enjoys high levels of capital stock per capita, inefficient use results in returns on capital
investments that are significantly lower than expected given its level of income per capita. The strong
rate of growth in investment led to per capita capital stock at comparatively higher levels relative to countries
with similar income per capita (Figure 61). Theoretically, under the neoclassical assumptions of diminishing
returns, one should observe a negative relationship between the RORK and a country’s income per capita.77
Indeed, a negative relationship between RORKs and per capita GDP holds on average for countries in Europe


77In essence, the RORK measures the contribution of investment to economic growth, that is, the RORK provides a basis for assessing
the contribution of capital investment to the growth process. (See Solow, R. 1956. “A Contribution to the Theory of Economic
Growth.” Quarterly Journal of Economics 70 (1): 65–94.)
                                                                 56
(Figure 62). Notable deviations from the expected average RORKs are Albania and Germany. In the case of the
latter (placed above estimated RORK regression line), this indicates that fundamentals and reform policies have
been associated with higher (than predicted by its income level) rate of return on capital investment. In contrast,
in the case of Albania, economic and institutional fundamentals have stifled the generation of profitable
activities in the country. Albania’s rate of return on capital is significantly lower (over 35 percent) than the rate
predicted by its income per capita levels. Emerging European economies such as the Baltic states, the Czech
Republic, or Poland, have RORKs two to three times the size of Albania’s, despite their significantly higher

Weaknesses in capital investment management partly explain the low returns on public investment.
Capital investment exhibits two key weaknesses that inhibit the efficient use of the capital factor of
production:78

             First, the prioritization of capital projects, particularly those funded through domestic sources, does not
              appear to be on robust grounds. The key weaknesses stem from the fact that the full cost of investments
              is not considered during the approval process. Major investment projects are discussed by the Strategic
              Planning Committee within the Prime Minister’s Office, with input from the Ministry of Finance. However,
              because the preparation of multiyear plans, the screening and approval of investments, and the drafting of

                                                                                               57
     annual budgets are not fully integrated, the management of public investment is inefficient. Despite the
     closer links between capital investment and integrated planning, a significant number of unplanned projects
     are introduced late in the budget process without a comprehensive assessment. Cost-benefit analyses, better
     prioritization, and monitoring and evaluation can help improve the management of capital investment.
    Second, while the focus in the past two decades has been on building new roads, spending on infrastructure
     maintenance is not sufficient. There is a considerable backlog of maintenance and other infrastructure
     projects (for example, hydropower and roads). A shift toward maintenance and rehabilitation is critical for
     preserving infrastructure and supporting growth over the medium term.

The inefficient use of capital reflects institutional weaknesses in the intermediation of financial
resources. The financial sector, dominated by foreign eurozone banks, has achieved notable growth since
2000.79 Foreign banks control over 90 percent of the market. Although the foreign banks are large for the
Albanian market, they represent a negligible share in the asset structure of their parent banks. As a result, the
Albanian banking sector infrastructure is exposed to policy and managerial decisions of parent banks. Capital
markets are rather underdeveloped, though investment funds launched in late 2011 had grown to over $600
million in value by the end of June 2014. There is virtually no other capital market activity. Corporate bond and
equity markets, which have become a major source of investment financing in many other middle-income
economies, as well as nonbank financial institutions are at a nascent stage of development. The presence of
private equity and venture capital funds is minimal as evidenced by Albania’s low rank (106) in the venture
capital and private equity attractiveness index.80

Despite the rapid acceleration in the intermediation of financial resources through the banking sector,
sustainable access to finance is considered one of the most problematic issues among businesses in
Albania. Credit to the private sector grew from less than 4.4 percent of GDP in 2000 to 40.2 percent in 2013,
supporting the rapid pace of investment growth (Figure 63). Yet Albania fares poorly against worldwide
comparators on the availability and affordability of financial services, ease of access to loans, and overall
financial market development.81




79 Austrian and Italian banks control 40 percent of the market. Greek banks hold between 15 and 20 percent. One Turkish bank holds

almost 20 percent of the market, and two subsidiaries of French banks hold 14 percent. Banks in Bulgaria, Germany, Kuwait,
Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia have smaller market shares.

Limited access to financial intermediation services negatively affects the ability of firms and
households to generate and accumulate financial assets. The latest enterprise survey on Albania reveals
that limited access to financial resources is considered an important business environment constraint.
Compared with other countries in the Europe and Central Asia region, fewer firms in Albania have a checking
or savings account or a bank loan or credit line, and a higher proportion of loans require collateral, which is
often set at a higher average value.82 Access to finance constrains the most dynamic firms relatively more (Figure
65).   Firms that considered limited access to finance as a major or a severe obstacle to doing business exhibited
the largest annual average sales growth rates in 2004–06 and increases in employment and sales of more than
10 percent a year. By contrast, firms that do not consider limited access to financial resources as a barrier to
doing business increased their employment by only 1.8 percent a year in 2010–12 and an annual average sales
decline of 1.6 percent after the crisis. This suggests that lack of access to finance can represent a major obstacle
to the operations of thriving firms. This outcome has also been observed across firms of different sizes and
ages. Older firms that report they face financial constraints show better performance in sales, while
microenterprises and young firms affected by financial restrictions after the recent eurozone crisis, namely, the
more rigorous credit underwriting standards adopted by banks, have experienced more rapid employment
growth (Figure 65).

Among households, the overall access to financial services is relatively narrow. Measuring access to
financial services by the penetration of bank branches throughout the country, one finds that Albania performs
less well than other countries in the region. Albania had 22 branches per 100,000 adults in 2012 compared with
the average of 29 in the rest of the SEE6 and 36 in the EU. Low population density makes the provision of
traditional banking services outside of the capital city costly and less efficient. There were 140 borrowers from
commercial banks per 1,000 adults in Albania in 2012, compared with an average of 184 in SEE6 and 442 in
the EU (Figure 66a). There were also more than 280 deposit accounts per 1,000 adults, compared with 1,277 in
the SEE6 and 2,245 in the EU (Figure 66b).83 Nonetheless, the 126 deposit-gathering Savings and Credit
Associations and 6 other non–deposit-taking microfinance entities fulfill a vital role in the provision of financial
services, predominately in rural areas, because most of their branches are located outside Tirana. Moreover,
32,600 investment fund holders have been added to the financial sector since early 2012 when the first fund
was registered, indicating a welcome shift in the views of (former) deposit holders.

Access to financial services and deposit penetration are more constrained among some population
groups, including the poor, the bottom 40, and women. The stock of financial assets is lower among the
less well off. Around 16 percent of people in the bottom 40 (aged 15 and over) had accumulated some savings
in the previous year; among the top 60, the corresponding share was 27 percent. The share of the borrowing
population that falls within the bottom 40 is one of the lowest in Europe and Central Asia.84 The bottom 40
are half as likely to put their savings in financial institutions compared with the top 60.85 Gender gaps also exist
in access to financial services. Fewer women have accounts in formal financial institutions. Moreover, the
gender gap in the access to property rights represents an obstacle for women seeking to access financial
resources because relatively fewer women can supply collateral or a payment history (see above).

The significant presence of NPLs limits the efficient use of financial assets, including for
entrepreneurial activities, but also diminishes the interest of banks in lending in an environment of
deteriorating asset quality. The worrisome level of 24 percent of NPLs in early 2014 reflects weaknesses in
the corporate sector, where the rate of corporate NPLs (especially in foreign currency) is significantly higher
than the rate of household NPLs (Figure 67). Some corporate balance sheets have been strained through the
long-standing accumulation of government arrears, which have impacted corporate liquidity.

There is a need to accelerate the adoption of legal, tax, and prudential means to reduce the stock and
flow of NPLs. High levels of NPLs have undermined bank earnings and capitalization and the ability and
willingness of banks to extend new loans. The authorities have adopted a number of measures to strengthen

the NPL prudential, restructuring, and enforcement framework and resolve long-standing tax ambiguities on
loan write-offs (see Box 4). Nonetheless, far reaching legislative, regulatory and judicial reforms are needed to
improve the insolvency regime, collateral execution, and private bailiff incentive structure. The 2002 bankruptcy
law (as amended in 2009), which draws most of its provisions from an old version of the German Insolvency
Code, has rarely been used as a restructuring tool and is mostly employed by the tax authorities as a tax
collection tool. This can be explained by the high complexity of the current provisions in the insolvency law
and the absence of qualified professionals (judges, insolvency practitioners, lawyers, and so on), who can
successfully apply them. Consequently, the number of restructurings is low and creditors struggle to recover
their loans. Enforcement systems are also weak and the role of the judiciary is undermined by lack of
experienced judges. As a result, it takes 525 days to enforce a contract and more than two years to resolve
insolvency, as the Doing Business 2015 report highlights. The transparency, disclosure practices, and role of
bank and firm boards of directors are weak as well.

    Box 4: NPL Resolution
    With the help of international partners, the Bank of Albania has embarked on the development of a set of measures to facilitate the
    reduction of NPLs.a The aim of the measures is to create the tools and incentives necessary to facilitate the establishment of
    sustainable debt servicing capabilities among operationally viable borrowers through appropriate financial and corporate
    restructuring. The program involves (1) an NPL mapping exercise and (2) the development of individual NPL recovery plans for
    the largest defaulted corporate borrowers. The mapping exercise covered approximately half of the banking system’s portfolio of
    corporate loans classified as B, C, and D. (Loans classified E were excluded because they were considered to have little or no
    recovery potential.) The banks classified their corporate NPLs into three categories: (1) loans that can return to sustainable debt
    servicing through financial or operational restructuring, (2) loans that are likely to return to nonperforming status following earlier
    unsuccessful restructuring, and (3) the residual portfolio of nonviable borrowers that require accelerated collection and collateral
    enforcement.
    After the conclusion of the mapping exercise, a pilot program was instituted to help participating banks develop multicreditor
    recovery plans for the country’s largest defaulted groups. This initiative is coordinated by the Bank of Albania, with support from
    the World Bank, and includes extensive training on financial and operational restructuring, as well as external feasibility assessment
    by restructuring specialists. More broadly, the Bank of Albania and the government have initiated a range of reforms to support the
    resolution of NPLs through legislative, procedural and taxation remedies.a To date, the main achievements include the following:
    1. Shortening and simplifying collateral enforcement procedures. Amendments to the Civil Procedure Code aim to shorten and
    simplify collateral enforcement procedures and significantly reduce the court’s right to intervene in enforcement or foreclosure on
    real property. In addition, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Finance issued a joint instruction on private bailiff fees, which
    provides for a clearer incentive fee structure for private bailiffs.
    2. Strengthening prudential regulations. The Bank of Albania adopted prudential measures to increase the effectiveness of risk-
    based supervision, and the nonbank regulatory authority strengthened its independence and capacity to supervise the burgeoning
    investment fund sector.
    3. Improving methodologies for voluntary debt restructuring and collateral appraisal. New guidelines have been published by the
    Bank of Albania to provide more consistent market expectations toward both debt restructuring and collateral valuation.
    4. Reducing tax ambiguities with regard to the write-off of unrecoverable NPLs. Banks continue to keep on their balance sheets a
    significant portion of unrecoverable problem loans that have been under litigation. Parliament adopted amendments to the Tax
    Law that clarify the conditions under which banks can write off NPLs through litigation. The Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the
    Tax Authority, clarified the tax treatment of loans in protracted litigation.

Emerging Issues

While Albania is endowed with human, natural and physical resources, which can propel the economy,
their use remains inefficient. The agenda for strengthening the asset base is vast:

      On the human capital side, areas to promote the accumulation and better use of human capital may
       include a wide span of policy measures. For example: expanding the access to and quality of preprimary
       education; better regulation of the expansion of tertiary education to assure quality and to align the sector
       with population trends and country needs; lowering patient financial risks, better preventive medicine and
       primary care and providing equitable access and quality health care services. Strengthening the quality of
       human capital will increase the skilled labor in the labor force, and therefore, boost productivity through


                                                                     63
    employing a healthier and better skilled workforce. An increase in the quality of human capital can also
    contribute directly to the welfare of the poor (for example, by reducing the impact of catastrophic spending
    on poverty). However, efforts should be focused on narrowing the policy priorities to measures that directly
    contribute to raising the quality and equity in access to education; lowering patient financial risks, while
    improving the quality of health care; and improving the incentives for formal employment, including of
    vulnerable groups.
   With respect to physical capital, consistently declining rates of return on capital raise broad questions
    about the opportunity cost of resources. Consistently falling returns on capital discourages private
    investment flows, especially from aboard, puts a burden on public finances, and ultimately lowers economic
    growth. While broad improvements of the environment for investment helps attract more capital (see Block
    3), strengthening the management of capital investment can bring large efficiency gains. Higher returns on
    investment could in turn contribute to the sustainable maintenance of assets. Narrow measures such as
    ensuring that all public projects are subject to proper assessment and prioritization as well as a overcoming
    the considerable backlog of maintenance and rehabilitation of infrastructure will boost returns. Moreover,
    weaknesses in financial intermediation, including equitable access to financial markets, are some of the key
    areas (which if improved) could support the more efficient use of capital.
   Improving the natural resources base (land and space) to support a productive, competitive and inclusive
    growth model requires sustainable use of natural resources and stewardship of the environment. Protecting
    the natural endowments and effectively integrating them in the economy is a foundation for sustainable
    growth. Engendering environmental sustainability and avoiding irreversible degradation is beneficial for
    both the preservation of existing nature-based jobs and livelihoods as well as for the development of key
    economic sectors (energy, agriculture, tourism).

Strengthening the productivity and competitiveness of the economy is also closely intertwined with
fostering improvements in the way markets operate. Well-functioning labor and land markets facilitate the
efficient accumulation and use of assets through which firms and households generate economic gains.

Given the low labor market engagement in Albania (significant informality and a substantial proportion of
unpaid family workers), particularly among youth, women, minorities, and the bottom 40, and the decline in
remittances, the market income generating capacity of households must be strengthened. This will require
broad-range policies of: aligning labor supply with the needs of the labor market for the creation of more
(formal) jobs and as well as developing a skilled labor force needed not only for boosting firm-level productivity
and attracting investment, but also to increase access to higher productivity and better paying employment
opportunities for the population. Although a significant knowledge gap exists to understand the constraints to
a well-functioning labor market, evidence suggests that among the key obstacles to a well-functioning labor
market are the prevalent disincentive and barriers to employment among women, youth, minorities and

disadvantaged groups. Focusing the policy agenda on improving the incentives to formal employment is key to
strengthening the quality of market engagement of households in Albania.

Poor enforcement of property rights presents the key obstacle for firms and households to enter the land
market with direct consequences not only for land ownership, but also for income generation and poverty.
Lack of well-functioning land markets has brought broad negative impacts both on rural development (as
evidenced by high farm fragmentation) and on urban development (as evidenced by the uncontrollable growth
of urban settlements). Comprehensive land policy reform is needed to increase formalization, promote
inclusion, as well as to address land compensation and property valuation schemes. Focusing this agenda on
improved national territorial planning to all territorial governments will help with fostering efficiency and equity
in the use of land and space.

BLOCK 3: ENABLING FACTORS FOR THE ACCUMULATION AND BETTER
USE OF ENDOWMENTS
A strong institutional and business environment, the efficient provision of public services, and the availability of institutions to
protect the poor and vulnerable have the potential to promote the accumulation and use of Albania’s assets and endowments. This
section focuses on whether this is the case in Albania overall by also applying an equity lens. The main finding is that all three are
ineffective in supporting the buildup and efficient use of assets by firms and households. However, all three have the potential to do
so if reforms are undertaken to improve governance, strengthen institutions, promote well-functioning markets, improve the efficiency
of resource allocation in the economy, improve access and equity in basic services, and ensure adequate protection for vulnerable and
poor households.

Quality of Institutions
Weak governance institutions inhibit the ability of households and firms to generate economic gains
in a sustainable way. Good governance and strong institutional capacity support the effective accumulation
and efficient use of assets. Albania needs to strengthen institutions and overcome the significant governance
gap with its neighbors and the EU. It achieved steady, positive improvement in a variety of governance
indicators during the first decade of the 21st century, albeit from a low base (Figure 68). However, in 2010–12,
all the world governance indicators (except political stability) revealed a reversal in the trend.86 In 2013, the
indicators stabilized or worsened. Political stability was the exception: it showed an increase, possibly
attributable to the election of a new government in 2013. This deterioration in the governance climate is
consistent across a broad range of governance indicators that rely on a variety of methodologies (Figure 69).
The decrease was both absolute and relative because Albania fell further behind the regional averages for all
the indicators except voice and accountability and regulatory quality, areas where Albania has generally seen the
most improvement. At the same time, the deterioration over these years has left Albania with a significant gap
relative to its neighbors and the EU in the ability to establish an effective and efficient judicial system (rule of
law) and control corruption.

Weak rule of law -- because of uneven enforcement of laws and regulations and chronic tax avoidance
-- represents the key governance risk today. The negative trend in governance indicators is most
pronounced in areas that require an effective and efficient judicial system and the consistent application of laws
and regulations. A weak and politicized judiciary raises concerns among citizens, firms and potential foreign
investors about the credibility of contract enforcement. Issues of independence and depoliticization of

Albania continues to lag on several broad governance and institutional fronts, including the
comprehensive implementation of newly devised strategies, the effective enforcement of new laws and
regulations, and the passage of draft laws by legislators. The European Commission’s June 2014 progress
report noted that, over the previous eight months, Albania had drafted or adopted a number of laws (for
example, a draft law on access to information and amendments to Civil Procedures and laws on asset declaration
and conflict of interest) and prepared a roadmap for justice reform to address the related risks.89 Despite this
progress, interinstitutional coordination and capacity constraints, and, together, they pose a risk to the
sustainability of economic growth, the equity of access, and the fair implementation of laws and regulations.

and Institutional Assessment [CPIA]) ranks Albania’s low on rules-based governance and transparency,
accountability, and corruption in the public sector (see annex 5).90 To address these issues, the European
Commission notes that Albania must overcome the challenges of institutional capacity, agency coordination,
and consensus building in Parliament to implement and enforce newly adopted strategies, laws, and regulations.

EU candidacy status represents an opportunity for Albania to pursue a EU integration agenda,
including a rise in the quality of institutions to a par with Europe. In June 2014, the EU Council formally
recognized Albania as an EU candidate country. EU integration involves the upgrade of institutions to the
standards set by EU member states, the acquis communautaire.91 The European Council Conclusions on Albania
of December 2013 highlighted the key priority areas for Albania to advance along the EU integration path,
which included a particular focus on administration and judiciary reform, the fight against corruption and
organized crime, and the protection of fundamental rights. A constructive, sustainable political dialogue is
considered essential in consolidating and maintaining the momentum of reform. The next step in the integration
process is accession negotiations.92 Successful negotiations would mean the alignment of Albania with the acquis
communautaire. This would require progress in modernizing the body of laws and practices to comply fully with
the EU. The negotiations usually involve agreeing to undergo various transitional periods before the new
member state must implement fully the laws of the EU and before they and their citizens acquire full rights
under the acquis communautaire.

The Business Environment

Despite recent progress, entrepreneurs continue to face burdensome institutional and regulatory
barriers. A look at the Global Entrepreneurship and Development Index, the latest Albania BEEPS (2013),
and the Doing Business indicators offers important hints about the main issues.93 According to the GEDI
Index, a measure of entrepreneurial attitudes, aspirations, and activity, Albania ranks in the 70s among 120
countries.94 Albania ranked 68th globally in the 2015 Doing Business survey, improving significantly from its
90th position in Doing Business 2014. Albania was an effective reformer in 2008–11 and introduced a number
of reforms that marked improvements (albeit from a low base) in business start-up, paying taxes, obtaining

91 The acquis communautaire is the common foundation of rights and obligations that binds EU member states. It comprises the

accumulated legislation, legal acts, and court decisions that constitute the body of EU law.
92 EU accession talks are expected to start after Albania demonstrates progress in reforms in public administration, the judiciary, the

fight against corruption, the fight against organized crime, and the protection of human rights, particularly of the Roma community.

Albania improved substantially, from 59.79 percentage points to 66.06 percentage points, in the distance to
frontier score (Figure 70 and Figure 71).95 This indicates that Albania has advanced toward the best practice in
business regulation by 6.27 percentage points. Albania made positive improvements in three areas, reflected in
Doing Business 2015, namely business start-up, construction permits, and property registration. Nevertheless,
further improvements will be required particularly in registering the property, obtaining construction permits,
and trade logistics where Albania is still lagging behind the rest of the region.

The institutional and regulatory framework, particularly its predictability and transparency, represents
a critical obstacle to business development. Evidence from firm surveys, together with anecdotal evidence


95The Distance to Frontier indicator compares an economy’s performance with the global best practice for each indicator. An
economy’s distance to frontier is measured on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance, and 100 represents
the frontier. For example, a score of 75 in doing business for a given year means an economy was 25 percentage points away from the
best performances across all economies and across time. A higher score would indicate that the economy is narrowing the gap with
global best practice. In this way, a country’s progress is represented as a higher Distance to Frontier value, and is not affected by the
rankings of other countries.
                                                                     69
gathered in unstructured discussions with business leaders, suggests that laws and regulations are applied in an
inconsistent, arbitrary manner. Firms complain that the lack of predictability and the uncertainty in the
regulatory environment make long-term investment decisions difficult. More directly, businesses report that
institutional and governance barriers negatively affect their sales and employment growth. Specifically, relative
to surveyed firms reporting low institutional barriers, firms reporting high barriers tend to generate an average
of 7.1 percentage points less in sales and 6.1 percentage points less in employment growth.96

A strong and transparent investment policy framework will help spur local business development,
attract foreign investors, and harness spillovers from FDI. In the absence of a strong private sector
equipped with sufficient capital resources, international investment becomes even more important in the
achievement of the country’s goal of improving competitiveness and productivity. The shift from lower– to
higher–value added jobs will depend on the ability of local companies to integrate into global production value
chains. To facilitate such a shift, there is scope to strengthen the investment policy framework to maximize the
benefits and spillovers from foreign investment (Box 5).

An institutional and regulatory environment that facilitates trade across borders and an overall
reduction in the economic distance to markets is key to the global integration of Albania. The trade
environment has undergone significant improvement in recent years, and the Central European Free Trade
Agreement has been beneficial to regional trade. In Doing Business 2015, Albania ranked 95 among 189
countries on the ease of trading across borders. It has a middle position compared with its comparators such
as Bosnia and Herzegovina (ranked 104), Croatia (86), FYR Macedonia (85), Hungary (72), and Montenegro
(52). However, more effort is needed to simplify clearance procedures, including by reducing burdensome
sanitary and phytosanitary inspections during cross-border trade, improving interagency information
exchanges, applying World Trade Organization rules on customs valuation consistently, improving weighing
procedures, synchronizing the working hours of customs and technical control agencies, simplify customs
documents, and resolve issues related to the national quality infrastructure.

instability, courts, informal competition, and corruption) to be either a major or severe obstacle. The results of the two separate
bivariate regressions on sales and employment growth indicate statistically significant and negative effects for both dependent
variables. For the survey, see BEEPS (Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey) (database), European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and World Bank, London, http://ebrd-beeps.com/data/.

Box 5: Channels for Improving Investment Policy in Albania
The investment policy framework comprises policies necessary to attract foreign investment of the type and
volume the country needs to trigger and sustain equitable economic growth. Specific areas in which the
investment policy framework might be strengthened through the following channels:
  Investor protection: Weak law enforcement and justice system, uncertainty in regulations on licensing
and concession agreements are a major concern of investors. Strengthening the legal framework would result
in a more transparent and consistent investment climate. It is important that the legal framework for
investment is characterized by
         clarity and certainty, which allows all stakeholders to understand which laws are applicable to their
          situation, and the specific meaning of the laws
         access to relevant legislation for all stakeholders
         predictability in the application of the law, which reduces the risks linked to changing interpretation,
          implementation or enforcement of the law
         stability of the legal, political and policy frameworks, which provides investors with assurances that
          government will not unilaterally and unfavorably change the basic conditions underlying their
          investment decisions
         fairness, possibility of legal options, and due process, which provides access to independent recourse
          and mechanisms for the settlement of disputes in connection with an investment
In addition, the establishment of an investor grievance mechanism, ensuring regulatory compliance across
government agencies and promoting effective problem solving for investors, would contribute to actively
preventing future investor grievances, by identifying investors’ issues in a timely manner and attempting to
resolve them at an early stage before escalating into open disputes. .
  Investment incentives: There is a plethora of tax and financial incentives in the manufacturing and energy
sectors, such as exemptions on dividends and profit-sharing payments, exemptions on public property
leasing fees in manufacturing, VAT exemptions for the purchase of machinery and equipment, VAT and
custom tariff exemptions, and so on. However, some of these incentive schemes are not supported by clearly
defined criteria, leaving space for inconsistent and unfair application. Their cost effectiveness is also
uncertain and would benefit from a cost-benefit assessment. The government should consider increasing
transparency and improving governance, analyzing costs and benefits, minimizing distortions to competition,
and improving administrative efficiency while contemplating on new forms of investment incentives.
  Investment entry barriers: Foreign investment is open in almost all sectors in principal, with the
exception of transportation and the media.a However, there are de facto entry barriers because of the
extraregulatory approvals required through the insurance and banking industries and the conditionality of
work permits for foreigners, which are approved only if the number of foreign employees in a company does
not exceed 10 percent of the total number of employees.b The elimination of these and other entry barriers
could help facilitate the entry of new investors.
  Corporate sector financial reporting: Despite some progress, financial reporting needs to be
strengthened to enable suitable differentiated financial reporting requirements for various corporate entities.
In addition, strengthening the institutions responsible for various aspects of financial reporting regulation
and enforcement would facilitate the access to good-quality financial information, which is crucial for the
access of businesses to financing and investment.

The country has not fully exploited the benefits of global and regional cooperation with neighboring
countries and the EU. As Albania integrates more deeply with the EU, its export performance and its
attractiveness for FDI are expected to be enhanced. As a result of the Stabilization and Association Agreement
with the EU in 2009, Albania now has duty-free access to the EU market for all except a few sensitive
agricultural products. Although starting from a low base, Albanian exports experienced double-digit growth
over 2007–13 in aggregate, and annual inflows of FDI averaged 8.4 percent of GDP. The new EU candidacy
status reached in June 2014 is expected to boost trade and investment with the EU. Trade with neighboring
countries has expanded, but other potential outcomes such as strategic regional coordination and cooperation
(for example, in water-basin management), potential industrial clustering, and joint efforts to attract large-scale
FDI have not materialized. Albania’s participation in regional FDI inflows has remained low relative to
neighboring countries and the upper-middle-income country group (Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey), of which
Albania is a part. Trade policy, by helping to exploit the process of EU integration, as well as smaller-scale
regional cooperation, can be instrumental in negotiations for additional free trade and bilateral FDI agreements.

In 2013–14, the institutional and regulatory reform has marked some progress. The government has
made improving the business environment a top policy priority and has undertaken a number of initiatives that
have led to improvements. It has initiated an institutional and business environment reform agenda, including
the creation of working groups to identify gaps in business regulations. In 2013–14, Albania streamlined tax
payments, introduced electronic payments in customs, made business start-up easier by lowering registration
fees, rationalized construction permits by reducing the time, cost, and procedures for processing permit
applications and by introducing new construction regulations, simplified the process of property transfers by
introducing effective time limits and the digitalization of records on immovable property, and shortened the
adjudication procedures involved in commercial disputes. The implementation of automated risk management
has led to a sharp decline in the share of goods subject to physical inspection in customs, with corresponding
savings in time and a reduction in uncertainty among traders.97 Some of these improvements are not yet
reflected in the various indexes and surveys measuring the quality of the regulatory and governance
environment, likely because of a lag between the adoption and implementation of reforms and the survey
reporting periods.

Corruption and Informality among Economic Agents

The prevalence of perceptions of corruption reveals weaknesses in the governance and business
environment. Corruption undermines the operational efficiency of firms and raises the costs and risks
associated with doing business. The presence of inefficient regulations constrains firm efficiency and presents

opportunities for soliciting bribes. Corruption was identified as the single largest obstacle to entrepreneurship
by 56 percent of the Albanian businesses surveyed in 2013.98 Corruption among public officials, in particular,
represents an administrative and financial burden on firms and poses an impediment to firm growth and
development. In some public service areas, informal payments are widely prevalent. Albanian firms report an
incidence of 18 percent in the payment of bribes during meetings with tax inspectors and a 34 percent incidence
in meetings to secure government contracts. Almost 12 percent of the firms surveyed had experienced the same
corrupt practices during the process of obtaining operating licenses (Figure 72). Similar findings were reported
by respondents to the American Chamber of Commerce in Albania. The 2014 survey show that the majority
of respondents think that informal economy (76 percent), government bureaucracy (76 percent), monopoly
and unfair competition (62 percent) and corruption (67 percent) were at high or very high level during 2013.99

In a cross-country comparison, Albania had one of the worst rankings in the perception of corruption,
as measured by Transparency International (Figure 73). Not coincidentally, Albania also ranks low in some areas
of the Doing Business index, namely, the areas most often associated with corruption and the solicitation of
bribes. Thus, Albania ranks 157th in dealing with construction permits, 151st in getting electricity, 131st in
paying taxes, 102nd in enforcing contracts, and 118th in registering property.

Prevalence of corruption as reported in surveys cited above encourages widespread informality, which
creates unfair competition for formal sector businesses and greatly affects their growth. The practices
of the informal sector are cited as the top business environment constraint by around 20 percent of the firms
surveyed.100 This is higher than the share in most other countries in the region (the regional average is around
14 percent), and around 40 percent of the firms in Albania are competing against unregistered or informal
firms. According to the International Finance Corporation’s Tax Compliance Survey conducted in 2013, 35
percent of business respondents declare that “making payments of unofficial salaries” to reduce the tax burden
occurs frequently or very frequently (Figure 74). About 29 percent say that “using fictitious/fake firms” also
occurs frequently or very frequently. About 42 percent say that unregistered sales occur frequently or very
frequently. Informal competition can negatively affect firm growth. Firms that report and experience notable
informal competition have lower sales growth in general, although it seems not to deter them from hiring
(Figure 75).101

100 Overall, 43 percent of Albanian firms indicated that informal sector competition was a moderate, major, or severe obstacle to

business. See BEEPS (Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey) (database), European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development and World Bank, London, http://ebrd-beeps.com/data/.
101 Based on the available surveys, there is no clear distinction between the issue of competition between registered and informal firms

and the issue of registered firms evading taxes by using unregistered workers or underreporting wages, for example.
                                                                                          74
An important feature of the informal sector is the illicit activities conducted by organized crime.
Cigarette smuggling and human, drug, and arms trafficking are among the prevalent illicit activities. A 2010
United States State Department report notes that Albania is a key transit country for narcotic traffickers moving
Afghan heroin from Central Asia to Western Europe.102 The fight against illicit activities is hampered by
corruption and weak institutions (Likmeta 2010).

Informality decreases tax revenues and thus affects the resources available for public investment and
the delivery of public services. This translates into a large tax gap.103 The tax gap is estimated at 16 to 20
percent for the VAT. Personal income tax revenues could be at least doubled through more efficient policies
and more effective tax administration. Audit information suggests that the corporate income tax gap is about
38 percent. If no provision is made for nonrandom audits, the evasion potential reaches almost 66 percent.

The key interventions to combat informality and corruption would involve increasing the quality of
the institutional and regulatory environment, but not the size of government. While the causes of
informality are complex, cross-country empirical evidence shows clearly that the size of the shadow economy
is inversely related to government effectiveness, the control of corruption, the rule of law, and regulatory
quality.104 Tax morale is negatively associated with the size of the informal economy.105 According to the
empirical literature, economic prosperity, democracy, and political stability are among the key determinants of
corruption.106 While greater economic prosperity is consistently associated with reductions in corruption
regardless of the initial level of corruption, greater democracy is likely more effective in accomplishing this in
the conditionally most corrupt nations.107 However, a larger government has no clear benefit in the most
corrupt countries, leading to the conclusion that increases in government size do not reduce corruption. In
designing policies, the performance of the government, the integrity of government institutions, and the trust
that citizens have in their government are critical in combatting corruption and informality.

Provision of Infrastructure and Public Services
Satisfaction with service delivery is low across most public services in Albania relative to the regional
average (Figure 76). For example, data of the Life in Transition Survey 2010 show that, while around 61 percent

103 A tax gap is defined as the difference between the amount of taxes the government should collect and the amount of taxes the

government actually collects for a given tax regime. It points to areas of revenue where room exists to expand collection based on the
existing tax regime. As part of the Albania Public Finance Review (2013), a detailed analysis of the tax gap was conducted using the
top-down and bottom-up approaches on the VAT, the personal income tax, the corporate income tax, and excise taxes.

of the respondents in Europe and Central Asia reported that they were satisfied with the public health care
system, only 45 percent said so in Albania.108 This is the lowest share in the region, along with Azerbaijan, FYR
Macedonia, and Ukraine. Albania also has the lowest satisfaction with the provision of tertiary education relative
to all countries in the region, at 49 percent (compared with a regional average of 70 percent); dissatisfaction in
this area actually increased relative to 2006. While, on average, 84 percent of the respondents in the EU
expressed satisfaction with water services, only 58 percent did so in Albania (Figure 77).109

Improving the delivery of public services, particularly among the poor and the bottom 40, can promote
the accumulation of assets. A more efficient and equitable delivery of health and education services would,
for example, promote human capital accumulation. The provision of key services and inputs such as energy
and water, can also contribute to increasing the intensity of use of assets by households and firms. There are,
however, notable challenges in the provision of public services and they relate to equitable access and
inefficiencies that restrict the accumulation and the intensity of use of endowments by households and firms
(each discussed below).

Socioeconomic and spatial inequalities exist in the provision of public services. Poorer groups in Albania
have, for instance, less access to education services (see above), to affordable broadband services (Figure 78) as
well as to good-quality facilities for water and sanitation (Figure 79). For example, in the case of broadband,
Albania is among the most expensive country in the region and services are not affordable for a large part of

the population. In addition, significant regional disparities exist in public service delivery. For example,
preprimary enrollment in urban areas is around 42 percent, compared with 23 percent in rural areas. Service
delivery varies across geographical areas in the continuity, access, and quality of water provision.110 The share
of households with access to steady water supply varies by region. It ranges from 47 percent in Durresto 88
percent in Shkoder. Seventy-five percent of the households in Fier—the second-poorest prefecture in the
country—report that the water provided there is not safe for drinking. About 50 percent of the population has
access to a sewerage connection, while the rest use on-site sanitation facilities. Similarly, there is a large gap
between rural and urban areas related to connectivity. While Albania performs reasonably well in terms of the
mobile broadband penetration (third highest in the region); the household penetration of the fixed broadband
market is the lowest in SEE6: 25 percent comparing with the second lowest fixed broadband households
penetration in the region of 46 percent in Serbia. The footprint of the fixed telephony network is limited,
covering only 34 percent of households, and hardly reaching the rural areas (where some 46 percent of the
population resides).

The inefficient provision of public services is widespread in Albania. For example, in 2012, over 50
percent of the electricity generated or imported was lost during transmission and distribution. For every 3
percent of reduction in electricity losses, the contingent liabilities of the sector decline by 1 percent of GDP. A
distribution loss reduction plan encompassing gains from better network management, the regular metering of
all customers (including large-tariff customers), customer outreach, and collection efforts can cut energy losses
by 6 percent of GDP and halve the contingent liabilities by 2 percent of GDP relative to the status quo.
Similarly, in the water supply sector, only 46 percent of water connections are metered, compared with nearly
97 percent in the top 10 percent of the best performing utilities in SEE (2012). Only about 45 percent of the
water produced is billed to end consumers, against a benchmark of 75 percent for the same top 10 percent in
the SEE and above 90 percent in Western Europe. This has led to large losses in the sector, and cost recovery
rates of around 50 percent, which is almost three times lower than in the top performing countries (Figure 80
and Figure 81). The delivery of public environmental services is also characterized by large inefficiencies. Of an
estimated 360,000 hectares that have been equipped for irrigation in the country, only 80,000 hectares were
irrigated (2009), and many canals and pumping stations are no longer operational.

There are common reasons behind the inefficiency in the delivery of public services across sections.

             (i)                              The prevalent perception of corruption and politicization intensified the inefficient
                                              provision of public services, affecting quality and hampering access, especially among
                                              lower-income groups. Citizen trust in the state has been historically low, and hence facilitation
                                              payments (bribes) to seek services common. Two examples illustrate this point. For example,
                                              health care delivery in Albania is characterized by the poor quality of care, inadequate primary care
                                              and preventive services, the excessive use of tertiary hospital care, and persistent unofficial
                                              payments or bribes. The public health sector is perceived by Albanians to be the most corrupt in

                                                                                                                                78
               terms of informal payments. Forty percent of the population report that they make informal
               payments (down from 50 percent in 2006). From 10 to 20 percent of the population reports
               corruption by the police and the courts, in the education system, and in the distribution of social
               benefits.111 A recent United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime study of corruption in Albania
               finds that 71 percent of payers of bribes pay bribes to doctors, and almost half (47 percent) pay
               bribes to nurses; the third-highest group (14 percent) pays bribes to the police, indicating that
               corruption is significantly more prevalent in the health sector than in other public services.112
               Because of a lack of confidence in primary and secondary hospital care, patients tend to bypass
               these and go directly to the tertiary hospital, or visit primary care facilities mostly to obtain referrals
               for higher levels of care. The quality of care is an important source of concern: a recent study
               found that doctors only properly diagnosed and treated common conditions half the time. Hospital
               autonomy remains limited, and accountability mechanisms are weak. Politicization in the
               management of public services also negatively affects service delivery (Box 6).
      (ii)     The existing institutional arrangements and governance issues in key public service
               sectors affect service provision. Highly fragmented, overlapping, or nontransparent institutional
               arrangements and delivery systems often cannot benefit from economies of scale and efficiency in
               operations. Low population density and extreme fragmentation in administrative responsibility
               seem to be the key obstacles to cost-effective local service delivery and have created deep
               inequalities between municipalities and communes (see above).113 For example, the management
               of public utilities involves several ministries and agencies with overlapping or unclear jurisdiction.
               This makes it difficult to manage resources and ensure that urban and rural households enjoy equal
               access to public utilities. The administrative reform currently underway is expected to improve
               efficiency in the system by reducing fragmentation of local governments.114 However, it will also
               require strengthening the capacity of the newly formed local governments which will cover larger
               population and territory than at present.
      (iii)    Many utility companies operate significantly below their own regulator’s good
               performance benchmarks, which are typically unambitious. For example in the water and
               wastewater sector, nonrevenue water is estimated at around 67 percent of all water (regulatory
               benchmark: 30 percent). Only 55 percent of all connections are metered (regulatory benchmark:
               85 percent). Utilities have on average of 9.3 staff per 1,000 connections (regulatory benchmark: 4).

service, and investment functions, including a wide range of local public services, such as communal services, economic development,

               The existence of best-in-class performers such as the utilities of Korça and Pogradec, both of
               which achieve 98 percent of the overall regulatory benchmarks, show that efficient utilities can
               exist. On the other side of the spectrum, the Durres utility reaches only 55 percent of the
               regulator’s benchmarks, but a recent business plan shows that the utility could improve from
               covering only 52 percent of the costs of operations through tariff collections to covering 148
               percent in only five years through a combination of efficiency measures and tariff adjustments,
               thus creating room for a self-financed service expansion and improvement plan.


Box 6: The Politics of Power: The Energy Sector in Albania
Albania’s energy sector is based on a single buyer structure, whereby a legal monopoly manages the wholesale
purchase and supply of electricity. This arrangement is common in small and medium systems in a phase of
transition and growth, but presents particular political and economic challenges.
In the past, the sector has been besieged by significant losses in the distribution sector, leading to annual power
imports of €120 million to €160 million to cover these losses, thus making the distribution entity the worst
performing company in the SEE6 countries. The new Government has launched a reform effort aimed at
improving the efficiency of the distribution sector by improving collection and reducing losses, and continuing
the process of market liberalization as per EU guidelines.
Moving forward in this reform process will need          Figure                B7.1.        Cross          Country            Comparative    Lossa

Inefficient provision of public services has led to rampant losses. High distribution losses and low
collection rates have been at the core of the energy sector’s poor performance. Close to one half of the energy
supplied is lost in Albania. Distribution losses rose to 45 percent of supplied energy in 2013 (from 30.5 percent
in 2010). Following the poor performance of CEZ Sh leading to its distribution license being revoked,
nontechnical losses (theft) are estimated to account for about 37 percent of total energy supplied in 2013.
Transmission losses, albeit reduced, accounted to 2.3 percent of total energy supplied in 2013. Collection rates
stood between 75 percent and 84 percent from 2010-2013, further exacerbating the financial distresses of the
energy sector.

The poor quality of infrastructure and public services often means significant coping costs for the
population, which are often more onerous for the less well off. In the case of water supply, for example,
household costs include the need to purchase water from other sources or resorting to in-home pumping,
treatment, and storage of water or on-site sanitation solutions. Such costs must be added to the $30 million
spent annually in subsidies to the utility companies. In the case of health care, out-of-pocket health expenditures
represent 9 percent of the household incomes of the poor and the bottom 40 (see block 2).

In a fiscally constrained environment, the delivery of public services can be improved primarily
through efficiency gains. Over the medium to long term, as fiscal space opens, additional budgetary allocation
may be warranted. Currently, Albania’s investment in the social sectors such as in health care and education is
below the regional average. The costs in wastewater and solid waste management will also rise because of the
requirement to satisfy the EU acquis communautaire. The Albania Public Finance Review (2013) analyzed spending
in the country and spelled out detailed recommendations on how to achieve greater efficiency. Some specific
examples relate to transport, the health care sector, and education (also see annex table A4.2).

        (i) Room remains to improve the efficiency of spending on the road network. The bulk of capital
             spending in the transport sector (more than 90 percent) goes to roads. The country’s ranking in the
             quality of road infrastructure has improved based on the roads newly constructed over the last decade,
             which accounted for an annual average expenditure of over 3 percent of GDP in 2008–12. Average
             expenditure on maintenance of the national road network in 2008–12 was about €12 million per
             annum. It is estimated that Albania would need €40 million to €45 million per annum to maintain the
             country’s primary and secondary roads. In addition, the country is faced with a large stock of unfinished
             road construction and rehabilitation. While the additional maintenance expenditures could be funded
             within current allocations, a shift away from investment in new roads toward maintenance and
             rehabilitation is critical for preserving the road network and ultimately saving public resources.
             Inadequate maintenance exacerbates the rate of deterioration, hastening the failure of the roadway and
             creating a need for reconstruction that could have been avoided. Reconstructing a paved road is
             estimated to be three to five times more expensive than maintaining it.115 Failure to maintain a paved
             road has also been estimated to increase user costs by a factor of three in terms of additional time, fuel,
             and vehicular wear and tear, which have a direct impact on the price of goods and the prices consumers
             pay for goods and services.
        (ii) Significant scope exists for efficiency gains in the health sector. Public spending on health care
             was 2.6 percent of GDP in 2013, the lowest level among countries in the region, equivalent only to
             Romania. The low budget expenditure on health reflects in part the country’s low level of public

          spending generally. The scarce funds are not used efficiently. Inefficiencies stem from the areas of
          expenditure, financing that is delinked from outputs or performance, excessive spending on
          pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, poor systems management, and other issues.116 In addition, the
          government faces challenges in enhancing revenue mobilization, pooling of health care resources,
          expanding insurance coverage, and reducing the reliance on payroll taxes in a difficult fiscal
          environment.117
     (iii) Similarly, public spending on education is inefficiently allocated. Albania spends much less on
          education than its neighbors. General government spending on education, at 3 percent of GDP in
          2013 (10.2 percent of all public spending) is below virtually every other country in SEE6 (for example,
          Kosovo at 4.2 percent and Serbia at 4.7 percent). The institutional framework for preuniversity
          education and the resource allocation formula are complex, and financing is not clearly linked to needs
          or performance. Inequities in the distribution of resources remain, although the government revised
          several norms in 2010—the minimum class size, the criteria for creating multigrade classes, and the
          hours of instruction required of full-time-equivalent teaching positions—to improve the regional
          distribution of resources. The complex institutional arrangements and the lack of clear criteria in
          financing—especially in preuniversity education—have to be tackled to drive up efficiency and equity
          in education. The partial decentralization of management and the financing of preuniversity education
          have led to less clarity in local investment and maintenance spending. Education financing needs to
          become more transparent and accountable, and investments need to be targeted to areas that will most
          effectively improve learning outcomes. Specifically, the government needs a transparent per capita
          financing formula that will account for and provide better funding to schools that disproportionately
          serve disadvantaged households.

Some of the inefficiencies in public spending stem from underdeveloped institutions for reinforcing
financial discipline and strengthening fiscal policy. Public financial management has improved, especially
following the recent efforts to clear arrears and strengthen the commitment control system.118 More action is



116 More than 50 percent of the health care budget goes to hospital-based services, mostly to the University Hospital Center Mother

Theresa Tirana, the country’s only university hospital. Primary care accounts for about 30.0 percent, and public health services for
about 8.5 percent. District hospitals receive too much of the budget given their low bed occupancy rates. About 90 percent of the
budget is for recurrent spending, including growing transfers to the Health Insurance Institute. Capital spending accounts for about
10 percent of the budget.
117 The Health Insurance Institute initially financed primary care and certain pharmaceutical expenditures, but took on the

responsibility for hospital financing in 2010. A payroll tax of 3.4 percent, divided equally between employer and employee
contributions, generates 21 percent of the institute’s revenue; the rest is financed by a budget transfer from the Ministry of Health.
Because of the negative impact of payroll taxes on labor and capital formation, the new government has proposed an increase in the
share of general revenues, with a longer-term goal to shift toward general revenue financing. Reductions in payroll taxes would need
to be sequenced with efforts to expand insurance coverage for the poor and for the informal sector.

required to improve discipline in budget planning, preparation, capital investment management, cash
management, and expenditure commitment. Another challenge relates to the implementation of effective
commitment control to prevent the accumulation of payment arrears. The recent initiative to register all
contracts with the Treasury is a major step forward, but more needs to be done to manage future obligations
and establish financial accountability and good financial management.

Related, overcoming institutional weaknesses with regard to preaccession EU fund management
could unlock investment resources for the Albanian economy. For example, the available EU preaccession
funds in the agriculture sector (such as IPARD) could provide much needed financing for the modernization
of agriculture and rural areas, thus promoting a shift to higher productivity and commercial production. The
start of the IPARD program (totaling EUR 92 million over 2014-20) is on hold, because of lacking
organizational framework (to include office space and equipment), difficulty to retain qualified staff, and
inability to meet the EU’s fiduciary and managerial requirements.

Strengthening the capacity of the government workers responsible for the management of public
services can contribute to improvements in the services. The CPIA ranks quality of public administration
among the top relative policy weaknesses in Albania (see Annex 5). The civil service suffers from several
weaknesses, especially with respect to merit-based recruitment, the allocation of temporary contracts, and rules
on promotion, worker mobility, and dismissal. Salaries have sometimes been increased to enhance equity rather
than performance. This has led to compression in the pay system, which has created disincentives for attracting
high-quality staff. Politicization has also interfered with the functioning of the civil service, particularly with
regard to appointments. The EU acquis communautaire requires a professional, impartial, and reliable public
administration system, operating according to the rule of law.

Efforts to digitalize processes have been launched, but they have not yet led to greater efficiency or
greater satisfaction with public services. According to the United Nations e-government development index
2014 rating, Albania ranks well. The ranking partly reflect the progress made in the digitalization of public
services, including the e-Albania portal, which offers 10 level-4 e-services and provides information on many
others; online procurement; the digitalization of 20 percent of property records; several one-stop shops for
municipal services; modernized business registration and licensing services; legal reforms, including digital
signatures; and the digitalization of passports and national identification numbers. Despite these efforts, citizen
satisfaction with public services remains low.

Major reform efforts have yet to focus on citizens, as opposed to businesses. The impact of municipal
one-stop shops is limited. Property records, a major source of citizen frustration and anger, are only partially
digitalized. Rising citizen expectations also partly explain the level of dissatisfaction with petty corruption. A
whole generation of Albanians who have come off age in the postcommunist era, has been regularly exposed


                                                         84
to high standards of service in Europe and in the modernizing private sector in Albania. Further sensitized by
an assertive print and electronic media, this cohort, unlike their parents, also demands much more from the
state and the democratic process.

Aware of the poor record in public service provision, the government has embarked on an ambitious
reform program. Elected on an anticorruption platform, the government seeks rapidly to improve a wide
range of services through enhanced interfaces at citizen service centers in Tirana that provides information and
access to 250-plus services offered by the government.119 The government is also undertaking regulatory reform
and business process reengineering and eventual digitalization.120 In the energy sector, the government's Power
Sector Recovery Plan aims to address the key problems in the sector.121 While the goals are laudable and the
political will palpable, important considerations relate to the sequencing of the reform process and the access
to the citizen service center outside Tirana, perhaps through regional offices.

Albania can selectively capitalize on fiscally sound public-private partnerships (PPP) to improve
service delivery. The country has the potential for PPP projects in energy, renewable energy, waste
management, health care, and education. However, the current experience with private sector involvement has
been mixed, including well-documented failures such as the private sector involvement in the electricity
distribution sector. PPPs can help relax Albania’s fiscal constraints, while also bringing in market expertise and
technology in finding solutions in service delivery. International best practice reveals that the ingredients for
the success of PPPs include the long-term, sustainable design of projects (based on a realistic evaluation of
public and private capacities), an embedded and clear long-term sectorial strategy (including the role of the
private sector), a robust governance framework, and the commitment of the public sector to fulfill its
contractual obligations. Proper selection, design, and implementation are key to ensuring that PPPs deliver the
expected results, do not present a fiscal burden, and contribute to improved public service delivery, while
making the sector more efficient by lowering costs or improving services.

Institutions to Protect the Poor and Vulnerable

Social safety nets can ensure an adequate minimum living standard for the more vulnerable and
promote and protect the accumulation of assets. The existing social safety nets are ill targeted and provide


119 By end-2014, the Government plans to pilot programs in four urban areas with citizen service malls. They will cover 24 public
services in four priority areas.
120 The specific objectives of the reform include reducing the scope for corruption, implementing modern service delivery, adopting

citizen-focused ethics in the provision of public services, and reducing the time and cost of service delivery for both citizens and the
government. The rationale behind creating the one-stop shop is the separation of the front office from the back office for public
service provision, which should reduce the opportunities for corruption among service providers. It will also allow the government to
focus on customer service at the front office. The government also intends to establish mechanisms for citizen feedback about the
quality and timeliness of service delivery. The efforts in business process simplification and digitalization are being planned in parallel.
121 The Power Sector Recovery plan is centered around four main pillars: a) enhancing security of supply through diversification of

generation sources and strengthening regional integration; b) improving system efficiency in the distribution sector by reducing losses
and improving cash collection; c) supporting improvements of the electricity market and d) introducing priority power reforms in the
power sector to create a competitive market that will attract private investment while reducing fiscal risks for the government.
                                                                      85
inadequate coverage. The social safety net program consists principally of two cash benefit schemes: the
Solidarity Albania Program and disability assistance. The former is the main poverty-targeted benefit. Disability
assistance is a categorical benefit provided irrespective of the economic status or degree of disability. The central
government finances both, but local governments carry them out based on centrally designed eligibility criteria.
Currently, local councils make the final decisions.

Overall spending on social assistance is comparable in Albania with other countries in the region, at
about 1.7 percent of GDP, but the system exhibits several weaknesses that limit its ability to reduce
vulnerability. The Solidarity Albania Program suffers from poor targeting and coverage and low benefit levels,
while the quality of spending on the more generous disability assistance program could be improved.
Specifically:

      The relative balance of social assistance spending has shifted significantly in favor of disability
       benefits, crowding out the poverty-targeted assistance of the Solidarity Albania Program. Disability
       assistance grew from 0.4 percent of GDP in 2000 to 1.1 percent in 2013, while Solidarity Albania Program
       spending declined from 0.8 percent of GDP to 0.38 percent. Solidarity Albania Program targeting accuracy
       is among the lowest in Eastern Europe (Figure 83). About 66 percent of the total benefits are captured by
       the bottom 40; 46 percent by the poorest quintile. The wealthiest quintile receives 8 percent. In 2008–12,
       the targeting accuracy of the Solidarity Albania Program deteriorated, and the share of total benefits
       captured by poorer households declined from 56 percent to 46 percent. Ongoing reforms are already aimed
       at improving targeting through a scoring formula (a proxy means test) that is being piloted in three areas
       of the country and covering 50 percent of the population.

      Solidarity Albania Program coverage is low because of definitions and eligibility criteria that cause
       serious errors of exclusion. As of 2012, the share of the poor the program covered was 24 percent, but its
       coverage of the nonpoor rose from 5.2 percent in 2008 to 7.4 percent in 2012. Meanwhile, the spending
       on disability assistance has increased because of a larger number of beneficiaries and the overly generous
       indexation and ad hoc increases in benefits. In 2007–13, the number of beneficiaries rose by 50 percent,
       from 108,000 to 165,000 (Figure 84).
      Solidarity Albania Program benefits are low and account for only 16 percent of the total posttransfer
       consumption of the poorest beneficiaries. This is in part because the benefits are not indexed to inflation,
       which has led to an erosion in real benefits. The disability assistance benefit, on the other hand, is almost
       triple the Solidarity Albania Program transfers and accounts for 46 percent of the total posttransfer
       consumption of the poorest beneficiaries. Benefit indexation has outpaced inflation by 100 percent because
       it is indexed to minimum wages, plus ad hoc adjustments. To contain the rise in disability spending and
       reverse the shift of resources away from the Solidarity Albania Program, the government is now indexing
       disability assistance to inflation.
      Disability benefits do not necessarily favor the poor or the most severely disabled. Only 3.8 percent
       of the poorest quintile receive disability assistance benefits. Survey data indicate that 11 percent of all
       disability benefits go to beneficiaries who report no functional disability at all, and another 18 percent go
       to those with only mild disabilities. Clearly, there is room to improve the quality of spending. An initial
       diagnostic shows that disability legislation is scattered; medical eligibility criteria are outdated; and the
       system for assessing disability cases is open to conflicts of interests (often, the doctors assessing disability
       cases are also on the reviewing commission).

The pension system currently provides pension benefits to most of the elderly, but, until recently, the
benefit was not guaranteed for the full pool of future retirees. Most elderly today meet the eligibility
requirements for the contributory pensions given their pretransition work histories; however, many of the
future elderly will not have accrued sufficient pension benefits to be eligible for a contributory pension
(estimated at around 20,000 people in 2030, compared with fewer than 5,000 today). It is likely that the poor
and less well off are overrepresented among this group, given their higher rates of unemployment and inactivity
today. The government recently approved a law to introduce a social pension as a minimum benefit (at a level
similar to the poverty line), providing a way of addressing this issue and tackling old-age poverty in the future.
The law also dictates rules for pension indexation, ensuring that the real value of pensions is not eroded and
preventing fiscally unsustainable ad hoc pension increases.

These weaknesses suggest that the current social safety net system does not provide adequate
coverage to the vulnerable and to excluded groups and poses social risks. The government can mitigate
these risks and has an active reform agenda seeking to improve the targeting of the extreme poor and the truly
disabled by refining eligibility criteria and expanding coverage; rebalancing social assistance spending in favor
of the Solidarity Albania Program by curbing spending on disability benefits; revising disability benefit eligibility
to move away from a purely medical approach to a more comprehensive functional abilities approach; and
using management information systems to modernize the administration of benefits and the mechanisms to
reduce error and prevent fraud. All these are critical steps needed to reduce the social risks. Over the medium
to long term, the government should also consolidate social assistance by channeling various subsidies (for
example, energy subsidies to protect the poor from tariff increases) through the Solidarity Albania Program;
link social assistance to human capital and activation mechanisms to ensure the inclusion of marginalized groups
in the growth process; and adopt a holistic view of social protection, particularly in the introduction of the
social pension.

Emerging issues
Weaknesses in governance and perception of corruption have long-dominated Albania’s public image.
Inefficient judicial system and inconsistent application of the rule of law coupled with prevalent perceptions of
corruption have led to mistrust in the overall governance system by economic agents and citizens and to high
informality. Enhanced independence, accountability and professionalism of the judiciary will ensure that the
implementation of laws and regulations is done in a nondiscretionary manner. Expanding consensus building
in Parliament in the adoption of reform strategies, laws and regulations can also help address issues related to
the inconsistent application of regulation by courts and executive agencies. Tackling these high-level
governance issues will contribute to restoring the confidence in the legal and institutional environment that it
can protect and enforce property, contract, and overall rights of economic agents. Focusing the policy agenda
on improved transparency and predictability of economic management, in turn, will decrease the implicit “tax”

                                                          88
which poor institutions and regulation put on economic activity, increase investment in the formal economy,
firm growth and job creation.

Despite improvements, the regulatory burden for business development in Albania remains large. This
is reflected in the mediocre investment environment with direct effect on firm (and farm) productivity and
overall competitiveness of the economy. It is still more burdensome in Albania to deal with construction
permits, trade logistics, inspections, and property and land registration than in neighboring countries and others
around the world. The immediate policy agenda can tackle these specific regulatory issues. Moreover, businesses
and entrepreneurs voice strong concerns about discriminatory implementation of regulation and high level of
complexity in rules, procedures and reporting guidelines. These obstacles to business development present
broad challenges for promoting entrepreneurship, investment and trade domestically and across borders.
Increasing the quality of the business environment in Albania will help reduce corruption and widespread
informality. In turn, it is expected to positively affect incomes across the distribution and economic sectors
through increased employment and entrepreneurial opportunities from a regulatory environment where firms
can grow and thrive.

The provision of public services and infrastructure in Albania is ineffective to support a growing
economy. Across the board and large inefficiencies in delivery and public spending are reflected in the poor
quality, weak institutional capacity, limited accountability to service users, territorial fragmentation, and
socioeconomic and spatial inequalities in access. Moreover, the current systems for performance management,
monitoring, and accountability for service delivery to citizens remain weak in Albania. In a fiscally constrained
environment, efficiency gains are the primary road to improvement in the delivery of equitable public services.
With respect to public spending, emerging priority areas would include: improving public investment
management to ensure that scaling up public investment supports macro-fiscal stability and growth (for
example, a shift from investment in new roads toward maintenance and rehabilitation); strengthening the link
between outputs/performance and spending (for example, in preuniversity education, pharmaceuticals and
medical supplies, among other); enhancing revenue mobilization (for example, pooling of heath care resources,
expanding health insurance coverage, reducing the reliance on payroll taxes). Moreover, fostering the
development of institutions and practices for reinforcing financial discipline (such as strengthening the
commitment control system at the central government level) and compliance with regulatory benchmarks (for
example, in the water and wastewater sectors), improving the public-citizen interface for delivery of public
services to improve responsiveness and to reduce the high rate of informal payments (for example, in health),
capitalizing on fiscally sound PPPs, overcoming institutional weaknesses related to absorption of preaccession
EU funds (for example, in agriculture) can help to better use public funds in delivering services. Inefficient
public service provision has meant significant coping costs for both households and businesses, and has
ultimately hurt their income. Overcoming socioeconomic and spatial inequalities in the provision of public

                                                         89
services (for example, in education, water, sanitation, connectivity) promotes both the equitable accumulation
and use of assets by households as inputs into the growth process and their own incomes.

Energy supply is not reliable in Albania and poses large burden on economic growth. High economic
dependence on hydro resources for energy provision makes energy supply vulnerable to weather patterns and
in dry years heavily dependent on energy imports. Moreover, high distribution losses, low collection rates, and
technical inefficiencies have made the energy sector an unreliable and financially-unsound supplier of energy in
Albania. Securing Albania’s energy supply is an immediate need and can be achieved through: diversification of
generation sources and strengthening regional integration; efficiency gains in the distribution sector by reducing
losses and raising cash collection; the development of a competitive energy market that will attract private
investment, while reducing fiscal risks for the government. Addressing these issues will not only boost the
efficiency and quality of energy supply – a critical input to the growth process of the economy, but also bring
energy reliability in the day-to-day operation of businesses and households.

Institutions to protect the poor and vulnerable are ineffective in Albania. The main poverty-focused
program is poorly targeted and characterized by low coverage and low benefit level; ongoing reforms to improve
targeting of the program are expected to result in progress toward poverty reduction. In addition, the disability
assistance program does not effectively target and support the truly disabled. As a result, the current social
safety nets do not effectively address the needs of the poor, and are ineffective in protecting the vulnerable and
the disadvantaged from household-level or systemic shocks. Effectively reforming the social protection system
by, for example, rebalancing spending between social programs and creating links to human capital
accumulation and activation mechanisms will contribute directly to the welfare of the poor in the short and
long-runs.

BLOCK 4: MITIGATING RISKS TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABILITY

Unmanaged risks—whether economic, environmental, or social—can jeopardize the sustainability of economic growth and the
progress toward the twin goals of reduced poverty and shared prosperity. The main finding of this section is that Albania needs to
combat a multiplicity of risks to ensure sustainable growth and lasting welfare gains among the people. The risks identified include
external and domestic economic pressures, natural hazards and climate change, and potential social pressures because of the exclusion
of marginalized groups.

Macroeconomic Risks

The key macroeconomic risks relate to both external and internal factors that could jeopardize the
sustainability of economic growth and the achievement of the twin goals. External risks pertain to lower-
than-expected growth and possible delays in Europe’s overall economic recovery. These delays would have an
effect on Albania’s economic outlook through their adverse impact on exports, remittances, and capital flows
because the EU countries, particularly Greece and Italy, are Albania’s largest trading partners and source of
financial flows. External economic development and the pace of the economic recovery in key export markets
such as Greece and Italy are uncertain and beyond the control of the authorities. A slower than projected pace
of recovery in the Eurozone could lead to lower than expected export-led growth, revenue collection, and fiscal
consolidation. Insufficient fiscal consolidation could undermine already fragile investor confidence and
adversely affect the rollover of public debt and holdings of government paper. Similarly, deterioration in the
financial health of foreign parent banks, most of which are in the Eurozone, could jeopardize credit recovery
and undermine credit, growth, and inclusion.

The domestic risks are related to the implementation of the fiscal and structural reforms currently
under way to reduce public debt and ensure inclusive and sustainable growth over the medium term.

First, the public and publically guaranteed debt has surged since the 2008 crisis, from about 55 percent
of GDP in 2008 to over 70 percent of GDP in 2014. Loose fiscal policy, currency depreciation, and
recognition of new stock of payment arrears have contributed to the increase. The high and growing debt poses
interest rate and rollover risks. Spending on interest, at about 3.2 percent of GDP, is already much higher in
Albania than in the other SEE countries, crowding out more productive spending and representing a major
source of vulnerability. Over 55 percent of domestic debt (almost 30 percent of GDP) should be rolled over
within a year, exposing the government to changes in market conditions. In a baseline scenario of no policy
reforms, Albania’s public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to remain on a raising and unsustainable trajectory in
the medium term.122 This scenario excludes the contingent liabilities in the energy sector (see below), which


  Public debt is estimated to reach 73.5 percent in 2015 and stay above 72 percent over the medium term. By 2018, the central
122

government debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to reach 76.2 percent if the primary deficit holds constant at 2.4 percent throughout the


                                                                  91
would put the debt dynamics on a rapidly accelerating unsustainable path, ultimately increasing the probability
of default. To successfully manage this risk the medium-term fiscal policy has to be recalibrated to
accommodate a gradual recovery in real sector growth and steadily reduce public sector debt. Decisive fiscal
consolidation has now become imperative to reduce the risk of macroeconomic crisis, reduce interest payments,
and free up resources for productive investments in education, health, and infrastructure.

Second, the financial sector is exposed to a number of potential vulnerabilities, which, if realized,
could negatively affect economic growth. Key potential vulnerabilities to financial stability include (a) low
and declining commercial bank profitability, (b) the large stock of NPLs, (c) substantial levels of euro-based
lending (giving rise to indirect foreign exchange credit risks), (d) the continued deleveraging of foreign bank
subsidiaries (leading to shrinking subsidiary balance sheets), (e) the consolidation of the savings and credit
association sector ahead of the introduction of the sector’s deposit insurance scheme, (f) the expansion of
government debt issuances without an active secondary market, and (g) the presence of contingent liabilities.
Financial sector risks are amplified by the fact that commercial banks are the main holders of Albania’s domestic
debt, with Raiffeissen Bank and the Bank of Albania holding nearly half of it. With some European banks
recently taking steps to reduce their exposure outside the Eurozone and the weak European growth outlook,
concerns about the rollover of public debt risk have risen. In addition, there is a need to improve financial
infrastructure, including the payment system, credit information bureaus, and collateral registries. Overall,
strengthening the independence and capacities of financial regulators is a prerequisite for the development of
intermediation and the maintenance of financial stability.

Third, the energy sector poses significant fiscal, growth, and inclusion risks. Recurrent energy shortages
because of fluctuations in rainfall, persistently high distribution losses (about 43 percent in 2013), and regulated
tariffs below recovery costs, have resulted in sustained fiscal support from the government through guarantees
for power imports. In the distribution sector, low collection rates among households, businesses, and public
institutions (78 percent in 2013) have contributed to the financial woes. Serious reforms are needed in the
energy sector to reduce the risks to the budget (especially in the form of contingent liabilities) and to the
country’s energy security and future growth (see Box 7). These include diversifying the sources of energy
generation, reducing distribution losses, increasing collection rates, improving the energy market model, and
implementing appropriate tariff levels closer to cost recovery.123 While the implementation of these reforms
has already begun, a large medium-term agenda remains unfinished, including additional investments in the grid
to reduce losses, changes in the market model (for example, the liberalization of the power market in accordance
with Energy Community Treaty obligations), and adjustments in energy tariffs closer to cost recovery.

30 percent real depreciation. See World Bank. 2014. Albania Public Finance Review. Vol 1.
123 Alternative sustainable and clean energy sources are available and include solar, wind, and geothermal. These sources generate a

tiny fraction of the total energy supply needed in Albania.
                                                                   92
Improving the performance in energy efficiency would help manage demand by limiting the need for expensive
imports of electricity.

  Box 7: Financial Impact of Alternative Structural Reform in the Energy Sector
  In a business-as-usual scenario –which assumes growth in electricity demand by 1.5-1.8 percent a year,
  normal hydrological conditions, no new generation added to the system and distribution losses gradually
  reduced to the level of 20 percent by 2020—the energy sector becomes financially unsustainable. The
  expected annual financial gap of the sector in
  this scenario would be about lek 25 billion Figure B7.1: Energy Sector Unfunded Deficits, lek
  (US$ 230 million) in 2015 up to lek 55 billion
  (US$ 510 million) in 2020 (around 4 percent
  of GDP).
  An aggressive loss reduction scenario
  assumes the distribution operator reduces
  losses by 6 percent annually through 2017—
  through better metering of large customers,
  clamping down on the illicit use of electricity,
  and higher collections of 1 percent annually
  until the collection rate reaches 95 percent
  (year 2020), a rate common in the region. The
  expected annual financial gap of the sector in
  this scenario would be about lek 10 billion
  (US$ 90 million) in 2015-2017, assuming
  tariff increase by 20 percent (from 9.8
  lek/kWh to 11.5 lek/kWh). This would also
  require investment to improve the metering
  and other infrastructure (US$ 160 million),
  included in the assumptions.                              Source: World Bank staff calculations

Fourth, property restitution and compensation for formerly expropriated land constitute another major
source of fiscal and growth risk. The recent rulings of the European Court of Human Rights in favor of
previous property owners who must receive compensation for expropriated land have heightened the potential
fiscal risks from property compensation.124 The government will need to undertake a comprehensive review of
the claims that have been filed, complete the ongoing cadaster work to assess the claims fairly, and amend
existing legislation on property to offer a fair judicial procedure for compensation and for appeal mechanisms.
The government has established a working group and initiated a process to look into these issues. The problem
requires a clear mechanism that provides a fair settlement to those owed compensation, while ensuring that the
settlements are within Albania’s fiscal capacity to meet these obligations.

Fifth, comprehensive pension reform has been initiated, but managing the risks related to the fiscal
sustainability of the system hinges on the successful implementation of the new policy measures



  Albanian law currently stipulates that former landowners are compensated at 100 percent of the value of for their land, which is
124

unprecedented in Europe.
                                                                   93
(Figure 85). A pension law was passed by Parliament on July 31, 2014, with the aim to ensure the pension
system’s fairness, incentives, and fiscal sustainability. The legislation responds to four key problems in the
current pensions system: low future benefits if the system were implemented as legislated; a loose link between
contributions and benefits; low participation rates among the working-age population today; and
unpredictability among workers and retirees and in fiscal policy because of discretionary increases and subsidies.
The new legislation tackles each of these issues, tightening the links between contributions and benefits,
providing a social pension at the poverty level for the future elderly who will not be eligible for a pension
because of a lack of contribution history, protecting pensioners from cost-of-living increases, and promoting
the fiscal sustainability of the system. The expected gains of the pension reform will depend on how well the
law is implemented.

The government has initiated reforms and has already made significant progress in a number of these
areas, but sustained implementation over the medium term will be key to ensuring macroeconomic
stability, reducing fiscal risks, and restoring robust, sustainable, and inclusive growth. While the
government has moved energetically to tackle the fiscal and structural reform agenda (fiscal consolidation,
public financial management, eliminating payment arrears, and addressing structural challenges in energy,
pensions, the financial sector, and land registration), sustained efforts are required to tackle these deep structural
challenges fully over the medium term. Without such efforts to ensure macroeconomic stability, growth (if any)
will not be robust, sustainable, or inclusive.

In addition to decisive reforms pursued internally, there are benefits to joining efforts with
neighboring countries and EU countries to manage some of these risks. For example, in the power
sector, Albania can benefit from integration with the European electric energy grid. In gas, the building of the
Trans-Atlantic Pipeline and the Ionian-Adriatic Branch would open new possibilities for power production and

industrial development.125 Generally improving interconnections—such as trade and links with external
markets, transport routes, and connectivity—among countries of the region and with the EU enhance the
capacity of firms and individuals to use their assets.

Environmental Risks

Albania is one of the top countries in the world with high economic risks because of multiple hazards.
In Albania, 88.5 percent of GDP and 86.0 percent of the total territory is exposed to risk from two or more
natural disasters.126 The entire country is prone to hydrometeorological hazards (floods, drought, heavy
snowfalls, and extreme temperatures) and geological hazards (earthquakes and landslides). According to EM-
DAT, in 1974–2013, more than 60 percent of disasters had a hydrometeorological origin.127 The risk is
compounded by Albania’s complex topography because more than 70 percent of the territory is mountainous.
In the last five years, the main disasters that have hit Albania were the devastating floods in Shkodra (2010) and
forest fires (2012) in several areas of the country.

Moreover, Albania is the Europe’s most vulnerable country to climate change as it suffers both from
substantial exposure to climate extremes and significant sensitivity to climate change. The just released
World Bank’s Turn Down the Heat 3 report projects a “new climate normal” for Western Balkans. Temperature
increases of up to 1.7ºC to 2.3ºC are expected by mid-century, along with a significant decline in precipitation.
Considering that over 95 percent of Albania's electricity is derived from hydroelectric power, this will pose
additional challenges to power infrastructure.128 Albania is expected to suffer from more frequent and severe
extreme weather events (floods, heat waves), droughts,, nd greater risk of fire in forests and pasture areas. Sea
level rise is likely to result in a loss of wetlands and coastal forest. Increases in the variability of precipitation,
steep topography, heavily populated low-lying coastal zones, and reliance on water for energy and agriculture
mean that Albania is extremely vulnerable to climate change.

While information on the risk of natural hazards remains patchy, available data show that the risk level
is comparatively higher in Albania than in neighboring countries and that it affects the poor
disproportionately.129 Albania ranks 41st in the world in terms of vulnerability to landslides, 43rd in terms of
earthquakes, and 58th in terms of drought risks.130 Considering that buildings in Albania are not built to
acceptable construction standards, the impacts of natural disasters on the built environment is of major concern.

The organizational and technical capacities to respond effectively to emergencies are limited. The poor and the
less well off are more vulnerable to shocks than the rest of the population because they can rely on fewer
mechanisms to cope and must often resort to asset depletion. Natural disasters may also have large
macroeconomic impacts, and strengthening the resistance of assets to disasters is important, especially in highly
vulnerable countries such as Albania.131

The Albanian agriculture sector in particular is facing increased vulnerability in the face of climate
change. Data analysis suggests that Albanian should expect an overall warming trend over the next 50 years of
some 1.5°C in a medium impact scenario. This contrasts to a 0.5°C warming over the previous 50 years.
Precipitation changes are much more uncertain than temperature changes, but a decline in 50 mm yearly can
be expected under the medium impact scenario, although with significant regional variations. The most fertile
lowlands could be most affected. Climate change could also increase the frequency and magnitude of flooding,
which already poses serious challenges to the country.

The risks of climate-related disasters for the agricultural sector and human settlements are immediate.
Recent flooding events in Albania have underscored these risks. Although no single weather event of this type
can be directly tied to climate change, an increase in extreme temperature and rainfall events such as these are
consistent with the best known science on the impacts of climate change. The majority of the rural population,
including a large share of the poor and the bottom 40, depends directly or indirectly on agriculture for their
livelihoods. The rural poor will be disproportionately affected because of their greater dependence on
agriculture, their relatively more limited ability to adapt, and the high share of income they spend on food.
Climate impacts could therefore undermine the progress that has been made in poverty reduction and adversely
impact food security and economic growth in vulnerable rural areas. There is a clear need for developing
operational adaptation strategies and plans, integrating regional knowledge and approaches, and upgrading an
institutional framework and development planning to deal with these new challenges. In addition, unplanned
growth of human settlements in hazard prone areas is increasing exposure. Managing the impact of climate
change on human settlements is therefore closely linked to land use administration and planning.

The internal electricity generation capacity is almost entirely dependent on hydropower and thus
sensitive to hydrological variability, which will further increase with climatic changes. Dependence on
hydrology poses a major risk to the country’s electricity supply and causes enormous variation from year to year
in the costs of meeting electricity demand. In 2010, Albania reached a record breaking generation output of
7,702 GWh, but in 2011 it dropped down to 4,159 GWh, which is about half compared to the previous year.
The costs of covering growing electricity demand are particularly high in poor hydrological years because


131 A recent study found that the risk of a catastrophic earthquake is around 18 percent of GDP and, in the case of a major flood, 10

percent of GDP. (Air for Europe Re. 2014. Country Risk Profile for Albania.)


                                                                   96
additional imports are needed to offset reductions in domestic hydropower production (Figure 86). The cost of
this hydrological volatility has been quite substantial in the last decade totaling about €782 million in the 2007-
2008 and 2011-2012 drought periods.132 If there are not enough imports secured to cover the demand, the
system has to resort to load-shedding, which peaked to 900 GWh in 2007. It is thus important to diversify
energy resources on a regional basis and expand and improve intra- and interregional transmission networks.
Gas is a critical element of this longer-term vision. With respect to hydropower, investing in hydro storage and
the better integration of hydro development with integrated river basin management that takes account of
climate risks would have notable sectorial, environmental and social benefits.

The depletion of natural wealth threatens sustainability and growth potential. Albania's level of natural
capital depletion increased sharply in 2008–12. Natural capital depletion represented 2.2 percent of gross
national income in 2008 and 3.9 percent in 2012 (Figure 87).133 This is of special concern given the role of natural
resources (coastal tourism, agriculture, hydropower and mining) in Albania’s exports and overall economy (Box
1). While policy to mitigate these risks are obvious (such as strengthening environmental management in the
mining sector, protecting ecologically critical coastal assets, and encouraging sustainable land management
practices), it would be important to better understand how effective the country has been in converting national
wealth into other forms of wealth; and whether this conversion is sustainable from the growth and
competiveness viewpoint.

Albania needs to grow in an environmentally sustainable manner to maximize its growth potential and
become compliant with EU environmental standards. The EU accession process opens new economic
opportunities; therefore, actions along this path, of which the environmental acquis are an integrate part, are
important for sustaining and accelerating growth. Further, the immediate impacts of a degraded environment
on health are being increasingly recognized, and the reduction of these impacts is a major announced goal of
the government’s environmental protection policy, programs, and regulations. However, limited institutional
capacity and insufficient public finance, human resources, and environmental management practices are a
challenge to national, regional, and local administrations in aligning economic policies and sustainable
development goals.134, 135 For example, a significant ramp-up in the quality and coverage of water services and


132 During the droughts of 2011 and 2012, Albania had to cover about 40 percent of its electricity demand through imports. In 2011,
3,181 GWh were imported to meet the annual demand of 7,340, while in 2012, demand grew to 7,621 GWh requiring 2,895 GWh of
imports. Cost of imports mounted to €197 million euro in 2011 and €161 million in 2012. This unforeseen cost of additional imports
was not factored in the electricity tariff creating significant deficits for CEZ Sh. In 2011 and 2012, the cost of CEZ Sh.’s imports not
covered by tariff was €45.7 million and €95 million, respectively.
133 Natural capital depletion is the sum of changes in national wealth derived from energy, minerals, and forests. Depletion is

calculated as the ratio of stocks to reserves in the case of energy and minerals or the ratio of roundwood harvest to natural growth in
the case of forest.
134 The CPIA ranks the policies for environmental sustainability among the top relative policy weaknesses in Albania (see table A4.3).
135 In 2011, public expenditure on environmental protection was lek 457 million, which was less than 1 percent of total government

budget expenditure. In 2012, an increase of 7.8 percent relative to 2011 was observed primarily in investments in the rehabilitation of
hotspots, solid waste facilities (landfills), the rehabilitation of wastewater collection, and the construction of new wastewater treatment
facilities.
                                                                     97
wastewater management services is needed to meet EU standards. In most cities where sewerage service is
available, coverage is still limited, and effluent is discharged untreated into the sea and water streams, which
poses public health concerns and reduces tourism potential. Currently, Albania has few conventional
wastewater treatment plants which, cover less than 10 percent of the population. Further, utilities are unable to
operate a number of recently built wastewater treatment plants due to lack of sewerage connections and cost-
recovery of treatment.

Waste management is a growing problem across the country. In larger cities, dump sites and landfills do
not properly prevent uncontrolled toxic fires or leachate pollution, both of which are harmful to human health.
In smaller towns, in the countryside and along the beaches, the lack of proper water collection and disposal
adversely affects local economic development and does particular harm to the tourism potential of Albania’s
natural beauty and cultural heritage. Further, water streams clogged with waste compromise performance of
the irrigation systems; increase the impact of flooding, and, more recently, started affecting performance of
hydropower generation, elevating the waste situation to the level of a national emergency. Industrial waste
amounts to 170,000 tons a year, of which 3–5 percent is hazardous. Collaboration with the United Nations
Development Programme identified 35 priority hotspots of industrial pollution; remediation plans exist for
only nine of these sites. Clean-up of these sites will not only take away a major health hazard for nearby
communities but also facilitate foreign investment by addressing past environmental liability issues.

Social Risks and Exclusion

Even during the high growth period, around one Albanian in five considered the economic situation
to be worse than in the past.136 Perceptions of economic well-being are not always aligned with the reality of
the improvements in living standards observed in the country, presenting social risks and potentially affecting
the process of development. In 2006, a year of substantial economic growth, 19 percent of the population
reported that their economic situation had deteriorated relative to 1989, and 51 percent that it had remained
the same.

Evidence in the region suggests that the negative perceptions may be linked to perceptions of rising
inequality and increased uncertainty and vulnerability.137 Inequality measures, including the Gini
coefficient and percentile consumption ratios, do not show a systematic increase in social risks in the past
decade. However, the discussion on governance may indicate one source of discontent among the population.
Around 33 percent of Albanians reported in 2010 that political connections or breaking the law, as opposed to
individual effort or skills, are the principal means of achieving success in life. This contrasts with 15 percent of
the people in 25 countries in Europe and Central Asia.138 These negative perceptions can have an impact on
the progress toward the twin goals because they potentially affect people’s behaviors and attitudes, such as
efforts to acquire skills, search for jobs, and support of reform processes.139

Equity concerns exist because some groups among the population have less access to economic
opportunities, thus excluding them from contributing to and benefitting from economic growth. The
poor and less well off, women, youth and sexual minorities are among those who are excluded from economic
opportunities or access to essential services (see Block 2). Youth, in particular, both men and women, are
relatively more disengaged from labor market participation and express less optimism about the future of
younger generations relative to those in other age-groups.140 Young women in particular have significantly lower
labor force participation, despite having higher enrollment rates in upper secondary and tertiary education and
scoring higher than boys on Programme for International Student Assessment (OECD) tests (see Block 2).

services, employment, education, and housing, and are sometimes subject to bullying or violence. Albania’s
Ombudsman has recommended revising education curriculum and providing anti-discrimination training to
teachers, and to modify the Labor Code to incorporate discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and
gender identity.142

Ethnic minorities face obstacles in taking full advantage of economic opportunities. The Roma and
Egyptians, for instance, have a lower stock and utilization of assets than the non-Roma.143 According to official
census, the group of Roma and Egyptians represent 0.42 percent of the population, but this may reflect
underreporting due to fears of discrimination.144 Others estimate the size of the Roma population in Albania
to be as high as 150,000 (3.2 percent of the Albanian population) in 2010.145 Across indicators, Roma have
poorer outcomes: while literacy rates are around 95 percent among non-Roma neighbors, they reach only 65
percent among the Roma. Malnutrition among Roma children is as high 65 percent compared to 24 percent
for non-Roma neighbors, with lifelong implications for health and cognitive development. Both the stock
(educational attainment) and accumulation (enrollment) of education is sharply lower among the Roma. Low
preschool enrollment of Roma and other factors contribute to early drop out from school: the latest Regional
Roma Survey (2011) reports young Roma adults (aged 16-24) had completed only 3.9 years of schooling on
average, compared to 10 years average of their non-Roma neighbors. Smaller differences are found in
employment and unemployment rates, although a gap exists, but differences become larger in terms of the
quality of employment. For instance, the Roma are more likely than the non-Roma to be in informal work (90
percent versus 71 percent, respectively). Overall, poverty rates are higher among the Roma than among the
non-Roma: controlling for other factors, Roma ethnicity was associated with a 170 percent increased likelihood
of being poor.146, 147 High rates of poverty and low rates of education perpetuate the cycle of poverty and
increase the risks of exclusion.

Emerging Issues

Albania is exposed to multiple risks, which if not managed well, will threaten the income growth and
inclusion prospects of the population. These risks are cross-cutting in nature and affect the pattern and
distribution of economic growth (as per the discussion in Block 1), the ability of economic agents to build and
use assets and endowments (as per the discussion in Block 2) as well as the institutional environment that

enables households’ and firms’ income generating capacity (as per the discussion in Block 3). Managing well
these risks is necessary to ensure that the gains achieved in shifting the growth model are sustainable instead of
short-lived and sporadic.

With respect to macroeconomic risks, the key challenges relate to the restoration of macro-fiscal
imbalances, critical for boosting the competitiveness of the Albanian economy. Fiscal consolidation is
an important step toward improving macro-fiscal stability. It would need to be supported by structural reforms
related to the reduction in explicit and implicit contingent liabilities (such as in the energy sector or the pension
system) in order to ensure that the consolidation process is not undermined through inefficient ad hoc
expenditures and in line with the medium-term fiscal framework. Additional (albeit broader) macroeconomic
risks stem from the continued weak European recovery and the internal risk of insufficient political will to
sustain the commitment to medium-term macroeconomic stabilization and fiscal consolidation.

The unsustainable use of natural resources comprises risks associated with inadequate stewardship
of valuable natural resources. Managing well these risks underpins Albania’s competiveness and growth
potential in areas such as water, land, and coastal assets. Ensuring that the economy can count on natural
resources is key for securing the income sources of households and firms in sectors relying on natural
endowments (agriculture, energy, water, tourism, extractive industry). Moreover, the exposure of the country
to natural disasters is large and exacerbated by on-going climate change. This in turn, increases the vulnerability
of households and the overall economy to climate shocks, which if materialized, can reverse progress toward
the goals. Therefore, natural resources (many of which cannot be restored or at least easily restored once
depleted) need to be used in a sustainable manner.

Last, but not least, there are social risks from the exclusion of some groups from economic
opportunities which threaten the sustainability of the growth process. Exclusion can jeopardize progress
toward boosting shared prosperity in particular, but also prevents maximizing the gains from the growth
process given that some groups will not contribute to their maximum potential. Promoting inclusion across
socio-economic groups (including ethnic minority, gender, gender-identity, age, and economic status) will
directly guard against the erosion of living standards and incomes of marginalized groups and ensure that all
groups are part of the new growth path of the economy. Addressing challenges along the three blocks discussed
in this report, reforms need to ensure equity and inclusion across the board.

ACHIEVING THE TWIN GOALS IN ALBANIA: SETTING PRIORITIES

The SCD shows that achieving lasting poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Albania will require a new economic strategy.
Equitable, export-driven growth is likely to generate long-term economic and employment gains, but will require sustained
macroeconomic stability and comprehensive structural and institutional reforms. The evidence presented in this SCD, combined with
informed judgment and extensive stakeholder consultations, allowed the SCD team to identify twelve key constraints to accelerating
growth for reducing poverty and promoting shared prosperity. Further prioritization was carried out among these twelve priorities
based on their direct impact on achieving the twin goals. Five top priorities are seen as fundamental to reaching the twin goals
through their impact on both growth and inclusion: i) restoring fiscal sustainability and maintaining financial stability; ii)
establishing a high-quality business environment; iii) providing clean, efficient, equitable, and financially sustainable sources of
energy; iv) formalizing and enhancing the inclusiveness of land and property markets; and, v) enhancing governance, transparency,
and the accountability of the government toward citizens. Addressing the constraints in these five areas is a necessary and immediate
prerequisite to unlock constraints in multiple areas that hamper achievement of the twin goals. Another four areas were seen as
supporting priorities which amplify the impact of the top five (fundamental) priorities over the longer run. These four policies
would seek to: i) boost the quality of the labor market engagement of the bottom 40, youth, women, and minorities; ii) improve the
quality and relevance of the education system and skills training programs; iii) improve the efficiency and equity of public resource
management; and iv) ensure more inclusive access to financial markets. The final three policy priorities are seen as sustaining,
that is, contributing to the financial, social and environmental sustainability of the other priorities and of the overall reform agenda.
These three additional policies would be aimed at: i) enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of social protection systems with respect
to vulnerable groups; ii) ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources and the stewardship of the environment; and, iii) improving
the quality and equity of health services and reducing health-related financial risks. Notable complementarities exist among priorities
that have significant impact on economic growth (such as macroeconomic stability and energy security) and those that have more
direct impact on equity (such as the quality of labor market engagement and the protection of vulnerable groups). Capturing synergies,
developing proper sequencing and building institutional capacity to develop and implement reforms will be critical to maximize
equitable growth in a sustainable manner.

The four-block diagnostic presented in this SCD identifies an array of constraints to effectively
reducing poverty and increasing shared prosperity in Albania. In particular, the SCD concludes that:

1. The earlier domestic demand-fueled growth model is no longer sustainable and has contributed to severe
     macroeconomic imbalances—characterized by high public debt, structural fiscal deficits, public sector
     arrears and large non-performing loans--which must now be addressed in order to reignite growth and
     reverse the recent increase in poverty.
2. Households and firms face constraints to efficient and intensive use of their assets and endowments. This
     limits their capacity to benefit from, and contribute to, economic growth. This includes inequities in access
     to education, health care, land, finance and labor markets, along with general shortcomings such as the


                                                                    102
    poor quality of the education system, widespread informality in land and labor markets, lack of urban
    planning, limited access to finance, and poor use of environmental resources.
3. The enabling environment for households and firms to accumulate and efficiently use assets needs
    considerable strengthening. This includes the regulatory environment for doing business, the delivery of
    public services and the provision of a well-targeted social safety net. Institutional weaknesses affect overall
    governance, create regulatory barriers that limit enterprise development, undermine the quality and equity
    of public service provision and perpetuate inadequate targeting, coverage, and benefit levels of social safety
    nets.
4. Albania faces a multiplicity of risks to the sustainability of growth and welfare gains for citizens. These
    risks may directly undermine growth or indirectly affect the accumulation and use of assets by economic
    agents or weaken the enabling environment. These include macroeconomic risks, natural resource risks
    and social risks related to exclusion of certain groups from economic opportunities.

To unlock these constraints, restore economic growth and return Albania to a path of poverty
reduction and shared prosperity, a new economic model is warranted based on increased domestic
productivity and orientation toward regional and global markets. This SCD argues that a shift toward a
new growth model is necessary because the earlier domestic consumption-based model has been largely
exhausted since the 2008 global crisis. Boosting productivity and competitiveness of the economy and
expanding inclusiveness are needed to generate long-term economic and employment gains.

In this SCD, a two-stage approach was adopted to identify priorities for overcoming the constraints to
advancing the twin goals in Albania (see Annex 1 for details). In the first stage, the SCD identified twelve
major constraints which are undermining the achievement of substantial progress toward the twin goals, and
then defined a policy priority for addressing each of these twelve constraints. In the second stage, the Albania
SCD Team drew on the findings of the diagnostic and of stakeholder consultations (see Annex 3) in order to
cluster the twelve priorities based on their direct impact on achieving the twin goals. Priorities were scored
based on their direct impact on growth, poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Three mutually-reinforcing
categories of priorities were identified. The section below summarizes the results of the priority-setting exercise
and discusses complementarities among different categories of priorities.

Results of the Priority-setting Exercise

Twelve broad policy priorities have been selectively identified for Albania to make progress toward
the twin goals. Table 4 summarizes the key constraints that results from the top-down and bottom-up analysis
of a spectrum of issues in this SCD, including assessment of the enabling environment and the cross-cutting
risks to sustainability that links the macro framework to the micro situation at household and firm level.

This SCD goes further in its prioritization to identify five top priorities to accelerate growth and
achieve the twin goals. The priorities have been clustered into the following three groups based on their
contribution to the twin goals through their direct impact on growth, poverty reduction and shared prosperity:

4. Fundamental Priorities: This group comprises the highest-ranking policy priorities, considered
     fundamental for reaching the twin goals in Albania. Unlocking these five constraints is the necessary and
     immediate prerequisite for the success of all policy priorities in advancing the twin goals. This group
     exerts direct impact both on the productivity and competitiveness of the economy and on greater inclusion.
     It includes: (1) restoring fiscal sustainability and financial stability; (2) establishing a high-quality business
     environment that promotes firm growth and job creation; (3) providing clean energy efficiently, equitably,
     and in a sustainable manner; (4) formalizing and enhancing the inclusiveness and sustainability of the land
     market; and (5) enhancing governance, transparency, and the accountability of government toward citizens.
5. Supporting Priorities: A further four are viewed as supporting priorities that amplify the impact of the
     top five priorities over the longer run. The group includes (1) increasing the quality of labor market
     engagement among the bottom 40, youth, women, and minorities; (2) improving the quality and relevance
     of the education system and skills training programs; (3) improving the efficiency and equity of public
     resource management; and (4) ensuring more inclusive access to financial markets.
6.   Sustaining Priorities: This group—although not seen as having the strongest direct and immediate impact
     on growth and inclusion--is considered critical to enhancing the economic, social, and environmental
     sustainability of the top five priorities and the overall reform agenda. The group includes: (1) enhancing
     the effectiveness and efficiency of social protection systems for the benefit of vulnerable groups,
     (2) ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources and the stewardship of the environment, (3) improving
     the quality and equity of health services and reducing health-related financial risks.

Complementarities and Capacity to Implement Priorities

There are notable complementarities among priorities which must be taken into account when
defining and sequencing the reform agenda in Albania. Complementarities are evident within each of the
three categories: reform of land markets, for example, will have an important positive effect on the business
environment, showing complementarity among fundamental priorities. Complementarities are important across
categories as well: reform of health insurance, pension and social protection schemes is essential to restore fiscal
sustainability in the medium-term. Selective reform may be necessary within an area deemed to have a lesser
direct impact on achievement of the twin goals due to its indirect effect on one of the fundamental priorities.
Some priorities would have higher impact on short-term growth (e.g. business environment) or longer-term
growth (e.g. education system), while others would have higher immediate impact on the income of the bottom
40 (e.g. social protection), which may have an important social solidarity and sustainability dimension. In a
fiscally-constrained environment, improving delivery of public services in the near term, for instance, can only
be achieved through efficiency gains rather than increased spending. These complementarities and tradeoffs
must be considered by Government and society in determining the timing and sequencing of priority reforms.

Capacity to implement reforms varies across the priority areas, and will need to be reinforced in order
to maximize progress toward the twin goals. The question of implementation capacity is not necessarily at
the center of the diagnostic or prioritization exercise, but is also an essential question in defining and sequencing

                                                            106
Albania’s reform agenda (and the World Bank Group’s support for that agenda). Annex 2 presents a cluster
analysis that assesses implementation capacity for each of the twelve priority areas.                     The analysis suggests
limitations in the current institutional environment for implementing reforms across the policy priorities.
Capacity is relatively higher in the areas of macroeconomic stability, improving the business environment,
reforming the land market, improving public resource management and expanding the labor market
engagement of vulnerable population groups. Reforms in these areas, which have a large impact on both
economic growth and income among the bottom 40, should be pursued vigorously to exploit available capacity.
The capacity to carry out policy reforms is found to be relatively low for establishing rule of law and for ensuring
energy security (Figure A2.2). Given the large impact of these two priorities on the twin goals, capacity-building
efforts will need to be strengthened in these areas. 148

The Policy Agenda in Priority Areas

This section discusses in more detail the findings for each category of priorities, including top policy
actions to alleviate constraints in each of the twelve priority areas. This includes the expected impact of
specific policy actions in overcoming the relevant constraints to advancing the twin goals.



                                                FUNDAMENTAL PRIORITIES

        RESTORING FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY AND MAINTAINING FINANCIAL
                                                         STABILITY

The diagnostic reveals that Albania faces key economic vulnerabilities that could directly jeopardize
the effort to realize a new growth model. Specifically, macroeconomic imbalances related to high public
debt, high structural-fiscal deficits, public sector arrears, large potential external imbalances, and the volume of
NPLs in the financial sector are noteworthy. In the short term and beyond, these vulnerabilities can affect the
generation and distribution of the gains among households and firms, the capacity of households and firms to
accumulate assets, and the returns households and firms receive. Addressing these imbalances would thus create
large benefits to the economy through positive direct and indirect effects in reducing poverty and increasing
shared prosperity. For instance, clearing the large public sector arrears is likely to boost growth not only by
fostering fiscal stability, but also by repaying suppliers and reducing the unpaid obligations of these suppliers
to subcontractors. These financial flows to the private sector are likely to raise domestic demand and contribute



148This finding is supported by the positive association between mean growth and growth distribution (the bottom 40) in the subset
of macroeconomic and financial stability, improving the business environment, reforming the land market, making the management
of public resources more efficient and equitable, and expanding the engagement of vulnerable population groups in the labor market.
See Figure A2.3.


                                                                 107
directly to growth. Direct impacts on the incomes of vulnerable and poor households may also take place by
clearing disability insurance arrears.149
Restoring fiscal sustainability, maintaining financial sector stability and improving macroeconomic
balances represent a first order priority and a prerequisite for eliminating many other constraints.
Lasting macro, fiscal, and financial stability is a necessary condition for the realization of a sustainable growth
model—one that is not achieved at the cost of the prosperity of future generations (for example, because it is
financed by an unsustainable accumulation of public debt)—and for poverty reduction and shared prosperity.
Improving the predictability of fiscal policy by limiting ad hoc fiscal adjustments can open up the fiscal space
for productive spending and for strengthening social programs among the poor. These benefits would arise in
addition to the economy-wide benefits of macroeconomic stability in providing a foundation for well-
functioning markets and the household-level benefits derived from protecting incomes from macroeconomic
volatility (for example, excessive taxation). The implementation of sound fiscal policies aimed at fiscal
consolidation can be achieved by improving the efficiency and quality of public spending, carrying out revenue
enhancing measures, tackling outstanding public arrears, addressing pension sustainability, and eliminating
quasi-fiscal deficits. Also, the improved planning and prioritization of public investment (for example, by
rebalancing new investment in roads by favoring road maintenance) can directly support the efficiency, quality,
and equitable management of public resources. Moreover, a strengthened public financial management system
would enhance the predictability and transparency of the government management of public resources.
Macroeconomic stability is essential for boosting the competitiveness of the Albanian economy and
protecting the incomes of the population. Large inflows of foreign resources (mainly remittances) and a
tendency of the exchange rate to appreciate have pushed unit labor costs above the levels supported by the
human capital that remains in the country. Restoring fiscal balance will counteract these trends, thereby directly
boosting the competitiveness of the economy. In addition, maintaining financial sector stability, implementing
complementary policies to improve the allocation of financial resources (by reducing NPLs and reviving credit
growth), and supporting the credibility of monetary policy are essential not only to spur economic growth, but
also to protect the incomes of economic agents (households, firms, farms).




149 A part of the public arrears relate to disability insurance; of individuals receiving the urban disability benefit, 11 percent are poor,

and 32 percent are in the bottom 40, while, among individuals receiving the rural disability benefit, 24 percent are poor, and 56
percent are in the bottom 40.

                 treatment and waste management)
                Maintain financial sector stability by reducing NPLs, reviving sustainable credit growth, increasing the
                 reserves of the deposit insurance fund, safeguarding the credibility of monetary policy, and strengthening the
                 autonomy of the financial regulatory authorities


                      ESTABLISHING A HIGH-QUALITY BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

The creation and growth of firms are currently limited by large regulatory barriers that prevent firms
from successfully competing in domestic and international markets. This regulatory burden affects firm
productivity and the overall competitiveness of the economy. It is reflected in poor integration with the EU
and the world so that total exports account for a mere 30 percent of GDP. As demonstrated empirically in the
SCD, the shortcomings of the business climate represent an obstacle to business development by lowering
firm-level growth and job creation. The key challenge resides in establishing and implementing transparent
business practices that encourage entrepreneurship and investment and that facilitate trade domestically and
internationally.
Increasing the quality of the business environment will help reduce the prevalence of widespread
informality. In turn, it is expected to affect incomes positively across the distribution and the sectors of the
economy.
The impact of improving the quality of the business climate on equitable economic growth can be
extensive in the short term and beyond. Specifically, improvement can help promote private sector
investment and new firm and farm creation and growth, including by reducing export costs and attracting FDI.
It can also foster formal job creation, as new firms emerge or grow in a business environment that incentivizes
the formalization of businesses and jobs. A policy agenda for improving the business environment should focus
on (1) cutting the regulatory burden across the board (for example, reducing regulations on construction
permits, trade logistics, inspections, and so on); (2) strengthening the government’s capacity to coordinate and
monitor business environment reform; (3) strengthening the policy, legal, and institutional framework for
private investment (including FDI) to boost the incomes of economic agents (both farm and nonfarm);
(4) minimizing informality through streamlined and simplified rules, procedures, and reporting guidelines; and
(5) improving trade logistics and facilitation, as well as deepening international and regional integration.

PROVIDING CLEAN, EFFICIENT, EQUITABLE, AND FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE
                                                         ENERGY
The efficient, secure provision of clean energy in a fiscally sustainable manner exerts a large impact
on economic growth and sustainability. The Albanian energy sector poses significant economic risks
stemming from recurrent energy shortages (because of fluctuations in rainfall), persistently high distribution
losses, regulated tariffs that are below recovery costs, and low collection rates. It has required sustained large
fiscal support through import guarantees and injections of liquidity into energy generation and distribution
companies.
The energy sector reforms are expected to contribute to poverty reduction and shared prosperity in
the long term by helping sustain growth, reduce fiscal risks, and ensure reliable energy supply. Reforms
in the energy sector could help reduce the contingent liabilities (of about 2 percent of GDP) to the government
budget and promote economic growth through reliable energy supply. For example, a distribution loss
reduction plan that reduces energy losses by 6 percent through better network management, the metering of
large tariff customers, customer outreach, and better collection could halve the contingent liabilities compared
with the no reform scenario. However, some of the reforms—for example, greater energy tariff collection and
a reduction in power grid losses—could have potentially negative short-term effects on poor households. This
entails a need for complementary measures that ensure energy affordability among the bottom 40 in the face
of sector reforms (including tariff reform). Thus, providing well-targeted public assistance to mitigate tariff
increases can be an effective tool.
Restoring the financial viability of the energy sector for reliable energy supply calls for immediate
high-priority reforms to break away from the unsustainable practices in the sector. Specific policy
actions include improving the management of hydro resources through integrated water basin approaches,
investing in new generation and diversifying the generation mix, decreasing distribution system losses to reduce
waste and increase energy efficiency, adjusting tariffs to reflect true energy costs, and opening up the electricity
market to regional competition. The market should move toward compliance with EU directives: large

                                                               110
consumers could start buying electricity on the market, and the distribution sector operator could become
responsible for a consistent supply of energy to tariffed customers. These measures are needed not only to
restore the financial viability of the sector and reduce the fiscal risks on the budget, but also to support growth
through a reliable supply of power. In addition, boosting energy efficiency would help manage demand by
limiting the need for expensive imports of electricity.

                       FORMALIZING AND ENHANCING THE INCLUSIVENESS
                              AND SUSTAINABILITY OF THE LAND MARKET
Formalizing and making the land market more inclusive and sustainable in Albania is expected to
have a positive impact on poverty reduction and the welfare of the bottom 40. The land market currently
suffers from widespread informality and the weak enforcement of property rights in both rural and urban areas.
This has limited the productive use of land assets, particularly among population groups such as the bottom 40
and women. Addressing the issue of land formalization through a realistic, fiscally affordable scheme and within
a reasonable time frame is key to eliminating this constraint.
Land policy reform is expected to have a strong impact on the twin goals. This impact can materialize
over the short to medium term if the access to land assets for productive use is expanded and secured in an
equitable manner, thus promoting economic growth and stimulating business development and job creation.
The land policy agenda includes an integrated land management reform with a focus on (1) increasing
formalization, including current administrative procedures for land titling and digital registration; (2) addressing
exclusionary practices in property registration that particularly affect the bottom 40 and women; (3) addressing
the current land compensation scheme in a fiscally sound and fair manner in line with international practice;
and (4) addressing land and property tax practices and valuation. Overcoming the constraints to well-
functioning land markets can also promote fiscal sustainability by raising the revenue of local governments
from property taxes and reforming the land compensation scheme.
Improving territorial planning and improving the technical and financial capacity of local
governments to implement plans will have a positive impact on economic growth and contribute to
the preservation of the country’s environmental and cultural assets. This impact can materialize in the
short to medium term through the implementation of recent planning reforms and by increasing the technical
and financial capacity of newly formed local governments to implement their plans. Strategic planning will allow
                                                              111
the identification of priority investments that should yield higher rates of return to capital and produce true
economic benefits for local populations. In addition, protecting cultural and environmental assets in parallel
with bringing services up to EU standards will allow the country to exploit its potential in tourism, generate
jobs, and contribute to shared prosperity. Finally, compared with the unplanned growth business-as-usual
scenario, planned development can contribute to the mitigation of the risks linked to natural hazards that
disproportionally affect the poor.

A rule of law that is transparent, predictable, and respected will have an overall positive impact on
economic growth and job creation in the medium to long term. Strengthening the operations of public
institutions facilitates the accumulation and use of assets by economic agents. Weak rule of law and the poor,
inconsistent, and uneven enforcement of laws and regulations are among the leading challenges in this area.
Large benefits to equitable growth arise from more transparency in the application of laws and
procedures and greater accountability in decision making. The first legislative steps have been taken to
fight corruption and organized crime. However, Albania still needs to enhance the independence,
accountability, and professionalism of the judiciary.150 This is especially important as the country pursues its
ambition to accede to the EU. In addition, expanding consensus building in Parliament in the adoption of
reform strategies, laws, and regulations and addressing the inconsistent application of laws and regulations by
the courts and by executive agencies will directly improve the efficiency of lawmaking and depoliticize the
process. Furthermore, improved corporate governance and financial reporting practices among banks and firms

The SCD clearly identifies the low quality of labor market engagement, especially among the bottom
40, youth, and women, as a key constraint to achieving the twin goals. Key labor market outcomes such
as high unemployment rates, low employment rates, low labor force participation, and the high rate of young
NEETs reflect poor labor market engagement. Among vulnerable groups such as youth and women, labor
market attachment has been deteriorating since 2008. Labor demand is being affected by mediocre growth
performance, but overcoming the constraints to building up and using human capital, including among the less
well off, will help foster significant, high-quality labor market engagement.
Formal job creation is a major pathway for combatting poverty and boosting shared prosperity.
Promoting flexible labor regulations and removing disincentives and barriers to formal work can help boost
the reliance of households on labor income. Activation measures benefiting particularly the less well off and
improving access to formal employment are two of the areas that can deliver a substantial impact on the
achievement of the twin goals.

The diagnostic is candid in highlighting the knowledge gap in a potential policy agenda for labor
markets given the scarcity of evidence on existing disincentives and barriers to employment,
particularly across some population groups (Box 8). This is an area of critical importance, but for which the
policy agenda remains partially undefined given the limited analytical base.

  Box 8. Labor Markets in Albania: A Key Knowledge Gap
  Improving the quality of labor market engagement, especially among the bottom 40, youth, and women, is a
  priority in the effort to achieve the twin goals in Albania. Yet, the SCD notes a knowledge gap in a potential policy
  agenda on labor markets given the scarcity of evidence on existing disincentives and barriers to employment, particularly
  across some population groups. There is thus a pressing need to gather knowledge in this direction.
  Priority areas in advancing the evidence-based policy agenda in this area include (a) conducting in-depth labor
  market analysis to identify and propose policies to address the disincentives and barriers to formal work (labor
  regulations, labor taxation, social protection, additional barriers), especially those affecting specific population groups
  disproportionately, and (b) collecting timely, accurate data on labor market supply and demand that can also feed into
  education and training system policies and reforms and active labor market policies. On the supply side, Albania could
  participate in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Program for the International
  Assessment of Adult Competencies, which measures skill levels among adults. It could also participate in the Skills
  toward Employment and Productivity skill measurement survey, which covers supply-side (including cognitive and
  noncognitive skills) and demand-side information. To understand the weaknesses of the education system, Albania
  might capture early grade learning outcomes among younger students. Taking part in international assessments,
  including the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (mathematics and science, grades 4 and 8) or the
  Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (reading comprehension, grade 4), and facilitating classroom-based
  assessments such as early grade reading or mathematics assessments could be a suitable way to measure early grade
  outcomes.



      IMPROVING QUALITY, ACCESS AND RELEVANCE OF EDUCATION AND
                                              TRAINING SYSTEMS
Achieving high quality, relevance, and equity in access in education and training systems is a key
ingredient in increasing the quality of the growth process by shifting to a model centered on
productivity, competitiveness, and inclusion. However, Albania’s education and training systems suffer
from serious deficiencies in meeting this challenge. There include inequalities in access to quality preprimary
and higher education that affect the less well-off disproportionately. Severe issues of quality and relevance of
education and training systems exist across the board.
Addressing the constraints in education and training is expected to have a significant impact on the
achievement of the twin goals. Raising the human capital of the population in a relevant manner (particularly
by starting early on among those groups currently at a disadvantage) and aligning education and training systems
with labor markets can boost economic growth by increasing the supply of skilled labor, enhancing productivity,
and opening up employment opportunities. This impact is anticipated to materialize primarily over the long
term as the new generation and future workforce begin to benefit from the overhauled systems. Nonetheless,
even in the short to medium term, gains are available from targeted interventions in education and training by,

for example, tightening the links with active labor market policies and improving the links with firms. A policy
agenda aimed at strengthening the human capital base by raising the quality, relevance, and equity of education
and training systems should focus on (1) improving access and expanding the equity in the access to preprimary
and higher education by targeting children and youth among the bottom 40; (2) improving the quality of the
education system in an equitable manner from preprimary to higher education by ensuring that graduates at
each level acquire requisite cognitive, noncognitive, and technical skills; (3) improving the relevance of
education and training systems through enhanced coordination between the government and the private sector,
strengthened links with active labor market measures, and the regular collection and use of labor market
information; and (4) improving the efficiency of public spending through enhanced school-level accountability
and management, including in financial decisions, and the adoption of a per capita financing model.

                                                           DELIVERY

The provision of public services in Albania is characterized by significant inefficiencies in delivery and
public spending, poor quality, weak institutional capacity, limited accountability in providing services to users,
territorial fragmentation, and socioeconomic and spatial inequalities in access. Informal payments (in health
care) and perceptions of corruption are prevalent.
The short- and medium-term impact on reducing poverty and increasing shared prosperity could be
notable through improved efficiency in public resource allocation and utilization. An additional step
toward achieving the twin goals in the medium to long term would be to enhance the supporting role of public
services in building the capacity of the bottom 40 to acquire and use assets (for example, through the equitable
provision of quality education and health care), thus improving overall welfare as well as promoting the ability
of the bottom 40 to contribute to and benefit from economic growth, thereby positively affecting long-term
social sustainability. More efficient spending and the crowding in of private investment further promote macro-
fiscal stability.

Given the tight fiscal space, specific policy actions on the agenda to improve public service delivery
may include (1) strengthening institutions and building the human capacity to reinforce financial discipline;
(2) improving governance, management, and accountability in service delivery; (3) strengthening efficiency and
equity in the management of public resources (for example, in health care, education, water, transport, and
sanitation) to expand access and quality; and (4) improving the legal and regulatory framework and the human
capacity in public service delivery, including through enhanced levels of accountability and management and
fiscally sound PPPs (for example, in ports, waste management, roads, and the social sectors).

                  transport, sanitation, etc) to improve access to, quality of and equity in public services
                 Improve the legal and regulatory framework for public services delivery, including through
                  enhanced level of accountability and management as well as fiscally-sound PPPs


                IMPROVING INCLUSIVENESS OF ACCESS TO FINANCIAL MARKETS
Expanding financial markets and making them more inclusive represent a potential area of sizable
impact on the achievement of the twin goals both in the short and medium term. Households and firms
in Albania currently have limited access to finance because of the low penetration of financial services and the
low financial inclusion. Especially women, rural populations, and the less well off are overrepresented in the
unbanked population. Building equitable opportunities to acquire greater financial assets among households
and firms is crucial to overcoming this challenge.
Addressing this constraint is expected to promote equitable growth and job creation by opening up
more opportunities for access to savings and borrowing using viable financial instruments, particularly
among excluded groups. A policy agenda to help expand financial markets and make them more inclusive
would include (1) improving efficient asset allocation and the availability of financing for long-term debt or
equity (for example, the development of government debt markets and other domestic capital market activities);
(2) encouraging the development of nonbank financial institutions (insurance companies, leasing, investment
funds, asset management companies, and so on); (3) strengthening financial infrastructure (deposit insurance,
payment systems, collateral registries, and so on); and (4) improving financial inclusion, particularly among the
bottom 40, rural populations, and women, by providing new savings, lending, and payment opportunities to
the unbanked population through banks and nonbank financial sector channels, such as savings and credit
associations, microfinance institutions, Albania Post, and mobile money providers.

       ENHANCING EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF SOCIAL PROTECTION
                                                           SYSTEMS
The effective and efficient provision of protection to vulnerable groups, including the poor, the
disabled, and the elderly will be key in advancing the achievement of the twin goals. Existing social
safety nets are not well targeted (although reforms are currently under way), do not provide adequate coverage
among the most vulnerable, and do not provide adequate protection against household shocks or cyclical
economic downturns. The qualitative assessment reveals the high impact of the effective and efficient provision
of protection to vulnerable groups, including the poor, the disabled, and the elderly, specifically through the
distributional effects.
The policy agenda in this area would include the continuation of ongoing efforts to improve poverty
targeting in the Solidarity Albania Program and the targeting of the disability program on the disabled,
rebalance spending across programs, modernize the administration of benefits, and enhance the link
to active labor market programs. A medium-term vision would include consolidation of social assistance by
channeling various benefits through the Solidarity Albania Program as well as linking social assistance to human
capital and economic activation measures and improving the institutional capacity to implement economic
activation measures so as to promote the inclusion of marginalized groups within the growth process. More
effective protection against income shocks to vulnerable families will likely boost the incomes of these families
immediately. Moreover, by allowing households to protect themselves against and cope with income shocks,
strengthened social safety nets are likely to enhance the impact of policies in support of asset accumulation and
use. Therefore, a holistic view of social protection is warranted, particularly through the introduction of social
pensions. The recent positive reforms of pensions need to continue, and there should be a focus on the
implementation of the recently passed legislation.

ENSURING SUSTAINABLE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND STEWARDSHIP OF
                                                      THE ENVIRONMENT

Natural resources are at the heart of Albania’s comparative advantage, competiveness, and growth,
and they have a direct impact on the well-being of the poor. Much of Albania’s growth and export potential
has been linked to nature-based sectors such as coastal tourism, agriculture, hydropower, and mining. This high
dependence on natural resources and highly volatile water resources creates extreme vulnerabilities. Albania’s
economy is the most vulnerable in Europe to climate change and one of the most vulnerable in the world to
natural disasters. Its substantial exposure and sensitivity to the quality of natural assets, disaster risks, and
climate change directly affect sectors such as agriculture, energy, and tourism, but also the livelihoods of large
parts of the population, especially the less well off. Furthermore, Albania must align its environmental policies,
institutions, and outcomes with EU directives to maintain its path to EU accession, which is a complex and
expensive process.
A range of policy actions is required to allow the country to take advantage of its natural wealth to
accelerate and sustain inclusive growth and address growing environmental and climate risks. These
policy actions include support for and the enhancement of existing nature-based endowments, jobs, and
livelihoods in the poorest uphill areas with the most heavily degraded lands; measures to prevent the irreversible
degradation of coastal assets; improvements in waste collection, which is impacting the economic performance
of several major sectors (for example, agriculture, tourism); and cleaning up hazardous hot spots. In addition,
improving the capacities and the governance framework for managing natural and the environmental risks that
deplete valuable natural assets and expose people to harmful pollution and waste, protecting critical ecological
resources, and improving the management of hydro resources through integrated river basin approaches,
including through regional cooperation, will strengthen the ability of Albania to manage environmental risks.
While the impact of some policy actions on the twin goals will occur mostly in the medium to long term, these
actions remain critical for ensuring the environmental sustainability of Albania’s development.

                IMPROVING QUALITY, EFFICIENCY, AND EQUITY OF HEALTH SERVICES
Inequitable access to quality health services, inequities in health and nutrition outcomes, the
increasing burden of noncommunicable diseases, and high out-of-pocket expenditures for services
erode the quality of human capital. While Albania has made strides in improving health outcomes in recent
years, challenges remain. Life expectancy is relatively high compared with rates in neighboring countries, and
significant disparities persist in health and nutrition outcomes between rich and poor, among minorities, and
across geographical regions. The quality of health service provision is weak overall, but health service quality
and access are significantly worse among lower-income groups. Despite some improvements, the public health
system is the sector most associated with informal payments. Overall, out-of-pocket spending for health is high,
but much higher among the poor than among the wealthy, contributing to increased poverty and reduced access
to health care. The distributional impact of addressing these constraints is therefore high.
The policy priorities in this area include steps to build up the quality of human capital by improving
efficiency, quality, and equity in health service provision and reducing poverty by decreasing the size
of out-of-pocket catastrophic spending, including through informal payments. Strengthening preventive
medicine and primary care to ensure equitable access and quality services for all is expected to improve the
quality of human capital (healthy workers), which, in turn, will entail medium- to long-term positive dividends
in growth through increased productivity. In addition, reforms in hospital services to improve the quality of
care and efficiency would free up the public resources for productive expenditures.
Several reforms will be key to reducing vulnerabilities to income shocks among the poor and the less
well off. These include strengthened pharmaceutical policies to reduce costs and out-of pocket spending; the
expanded coverage of health insurance, particularly among the bottom 40, and expanding coverage to the poor
and in the informal sector, while ensuring the sustainability of public health insurance benefits and enhancing
accountability to reduce informal payments.

The sections above set out a policy agenda in each of the twelve broad priority areas for eliminating
constraints to growth and accelerating progress in reducing poverty and increasing shared prosperity
in Albania. This broad agenda is useful for Government and its stakeholders to define and sequence reforms
over the medium term. Overall, this SCD shows that the rapid economic growth until 2008 was the key driver
of poverty reduction and shared prosperity, but that the domestic demand-driven and foreign-financed growth
model of those years is no longer sufficient to propel the country toward EU living standards. A change in
course is needed to raise the productivity and competitiveness of the economy, create more and better
employment opportunities, include the poor and the less well off in the growth process, and guard against risks
to the sustainability and equity of growth.

This SCD goes further in its prioritization to identify five top priorities to accelerate growth and
achieve the twin goals: (1) restoring fiscal sustainability and financial stability; (2) establishing a high-quality
business environment that promotes firm growth and job creation; (3) providing clean energy efficiently,
equitably, and in a sustainable manner; (4) formalizing and enhancing the inclusiveness and sustainability of the
land market; and (5) enhancing governance, transparency, and the accountability of government toward citizens.
The World Bank Group’s strategy to support Albania will be built around these five top priorities, with
additional selectivity within these priority areas based on political feasibility, institutional capacity, the World
Bank Group’s comparative advantage vis a vis other partners and our history of engagement in Albania.

Government is already pursuing reforms in each of these five priority areas as part of its broader set of
development priorities. With support from the World Bank Group and other partners, Government has
already made notable progress in addressing fiscal deficits and public sector arrears, including through bold
reforms to improve the fiscal sustainability and targeting of pension and social protection systems. Several
notable reforms in the business environment have been implemented, which began improving Albania’s global

                                                                           120
ranking on the Doing Business Index. Government also has moved aggressively to resolve a failed privatization
and tackle weak governance and rampant losses in the energy sector. The administration is beginning to address
illegal land settlements and restitution issues, and have made a commitment to enhancing trust in Government
through transparency and accountability. To this end, Government has embarked on a citizen centric service
delivery model, with introduction of citizen feedback mechanisms and progressive reengineering of public
service delivery. Government’s strong commitment to these top SCD priorities puts the World Bank Group in
a position to define a robust and ramped-up program of support through the upcoming Country Partnership
Framework.

ANNEX 1: Prioritization Approach

This Annex details the approach taken in conducting the priority setting exercise in the SCD. It
comprises sequential two-stage logic (Figure 88): Stage I Extensive Margin identifies the broad areas, key
constraints, and policy priorities for progress toward the twin goals, based on the evidence and analysis in the
SCD; Stage II Intensive Margin derives a qualitative impact (based on experts opinions) of the policy
priorities on the twin goals. The process is described in details below.

                                          • Specific policies identified to achieve the policy priority


First, based on the conceptual framework and the evidence in this diagnostic report, 12 critical
constraints are identified for Albania to advance the welfare of its population and to reduce poverty.
Specifically, at this extensive margin of selectivity, a long list of constraints identified directly from the analysis
in the building Blocks of the SCD is narrowed down to 12 key constraints, signaled in each of the Emerging
Issues sections of the report. They relate, therefore, to the patterns of economic growth and the distribution of
the benefits of growth necessary to strengthen the foundations of the Albanian economy (SCD Block 1); the
build-up and more effective use of the assets that households and firms require to enhance their capacity to
generate income (Block 2); promoting an enabling environment for supporting the accumulation and efficient
use of resources by firms and households (Block 3); and ensuring that the results are lasting by managing well
macroeconomic, social and environmental risks to sustainability (Block 4).

The key identified constraints and the corresponding policy priorities for unlocking them are presented
in Table 7. For example, the diagnostic shows that the constraints in the buildup and accumulation of education
as human capital in Albania are centered on the “inequitable access to quality preprimary and higher education; overall
poor learning outcomes stemming from weak quality of the education system; and the weak links of education and training systems
with labor demand”. Accordingly, the high-level policy priority from removing this constraint would be “Improving
quality, access and relevance of education and training systems”. Similarly, the key constraints in the accumulation of
financial assets is identified in terms of “limited access to finance and savings, given low penetration of financial services, and

markets”. Unlocking the key selected constraints in each of the 12 areas leads to the formulation of the top
policy priorities which Albania needs to address to make a notable leap in reducing poverty and boosting the
incomes of the less well off

Second, at the “intensive margin” of selectivity, we drill down into the policy priorities by identifying
the top priority areas for Albania and detailing country-specific policy actions that have the highest
payoff in terms of potential impacts on accelerating poverty reduction and shared prosperity in a
sustainable manner. Assessing the maximum impact of the policy priorities in achieving progress toward
reducing poverty and boosting the incomes of the bottom 40 is at the core of the prioritization process. To do
so, we qualitatively evaluate the potential overall impact of the realization of the policy priorities on the twin
goals.

The intensive margin of the prioritization exercise uses the SCD conceptual framework to assess the
impact on the twin goals along two filters:

a.   Overall economic growth, that is, capturing the impacts of reigniting overall economic growth (expanding
     the “size of the pie”)
b. Equitable growth, that is how the policy priorities affect income growth of the bottom 40, including
     through improvements in the quality of the labor market engagement.

Based on the experts’ scoring, the policy priorities are grouped on the basis of their overall impact
score (index) and ranked. Three groupings emerge: fundamental policy priorities, supporting policy priorities
and sustaining impact policy priorities Further, we propose specific policy actions (or What would it take?) to
achieve each one of the policy priorities, giving more specificity to the policy agenda.

While assessing the impact of each of the policy priorities through the two filters, the impact of managing
effectively the risks identified in Block 4 on the twin goals is considered (where relevant). As such, the
sustainability dimension is taken into account to ensure that the impacts of the 12 policy priorities are lasting.

The evidence presented in the SCD was used to assess the impact on each of the policy priorities on the twin
goals. In addition, we carried out a complementary scoring exercise to assess the potential size of the impact
in each priority area (the policy priorities). A team that included the SCD task team leaders and additional SCD
contributors—who had specific knowledge of the country, but who were not associated directly and solely with
only one area of the analysis—used a scale of one through five to rate the potential impact of the removal of
the constraints and the achievement of the policy priorities and its effect on overall and equitable economic
growth (the two filters). These two filters are weighted equally for the quantitative analysis of the scores
presented below. The conclusions of the intensive-margin analysis taken in to account in this prioritization
exercise are based on results obtained using different weighting schemes to which results are robust. The rating

priorities. Table 6 summarizes the results of the prioritization exercises.

The overall impact scores have been constructed based on the consolidated summary ratings of the through
the two filters (economic growth and equity), taking into account also sustainability considerations where
relevant in each policy priority. The indices range between 1 (min) and 5 (max) for each policy priority as well
as for the short and the medium to long term. The overall index combines the impact of the achievement of
the policy priority. Impact indices assume equal weights of impacts between the short and the medium term,
and the two filters. Low impact (marked in green) comprise scores less than 1.67; Medium-low impact (marked
                                                                  124
in yellow) comprise scores higher than 1.67 but lower than 2.5; Medium-high impact (marked in orange)
comprise scores higher than 2.51 but lower than 3.3. High impact (marked in red) comprise scores higher than
3.31. The conclusions of the intensive-margin policy analysis are based on results obtained using different
weighting schemes to which results are robust, in particular when it comes to addressing short-term versus
long-term policy priorities. The results from the scoring exercise are robust, using different weighting schemes,
in particular when it comes to addressing short-term versus long-term policy priorities. Namely, we have
constructed overall potential impact indexes (I) formed as I=w1*IST+ w2*IMT, ST and MT indicate short and
medium- to long term, respectively and w1 and w2 are the weights. The analysis is based on w1= w12=0.5, and
in the robustness check weights varied (w1, w2=0; .25; 0.5; 0.75; 1).

Based on the impact, the policy priorities are ranked to form three distinct groups, summarized in Table 5:

       Fundamental: These are policy priorities assessed to have “high” overall impact index (red cells). This
        group of policy priorities covers the identified challenges in the areas of: macroeconomic stability,
        improvement in the quality of the business environment, energy security, formalization of land
        markets, governance and the application of the rule of law.
       Supporting: This group comprises policy priorities assessed to exert medium-high impact on the twin
        goals. It includes specific priorities in four areas: and in the labor market engagement of households,
        education, delivery of public services, financial inclusion. Importantly, this group of policy priorities
        amplifies the effect of the fundamental impact group of priorities.
       Sustaining: This group comprises the rest of the policy priorities. The impact they exert is rather in
        the medium- to long- term, through promoting sustainability for the build-up, accumulation and use
        of assets by households and firms as an input to the economic growth process. They are seen as critical
        for enhancing economic, social, and environmental sustainability. The group includes addressing
        challenges in three areas: social protection, the environment, and health,

There are complementarities and trade-offs in the process of identifying priorities. The benefits or costs that
arise from unlocking the constraints can affect more than one of the policy priorities. In addition, there are
trade-offs (particularly in terms of the time horizon) in addressing or in sequencing the proposed areas for
reform. Where possible, the prioritization exercise has accounted for these complementarities and trade-offs.
However, there are often also second-round effects of policies that are difficult to capture ex ante. In addition,
there is path dependence among policy choices, and where possible, these have also been taken into account.
Lastly, the prioritization comes with its design limitations: while the impact assessment was performed at the
level of policy priorities, within each of the 12 policy priorities, the individual specific policy actions may
ultimately have different impact on the twin goals. There are high priority policies that can be found within
lower overall policy priority and vice versa.

ANNEX 2: Desired Policy Results and Capacity to Develop and Implement Policies

We assess the capacity of Albania to develop and implement the twelve revealed priorities using
clustering analysis. Clusters of priorities can be identified according to the combination of policy priorities
and capacity scores. Threshold estimation techniques can be applied to each one of the two dimensions to
identify high-impact, high-capability policy pathways. The outcomes of clustering the policy priorities (equally
weighted for short-term and long-term horizons) and the capacity scores according to this technique are shown
in Figure A2.1. Among the twelve policy priorities spelled out above, the capacity to carry out reforms aimed
at restoring fiscal sustainability and ensuring financial sector stability (the policy priority with the highest score)
appears to be present. The results of the prioritization analysis highlights also the importance of policies targeted
at enhancing the quality of the business environment, achieving a formalized and inclusive land market,
removing barriers for formal employment and strengthening the quality of labor market engagement (that is
the top right quadrant in Figure A2.2). Thus, if we prioritize the impacts associated with short-term and long-
term outcomes in line with the fulfillment of the twin goals, we find the following ordering within the high-
impact, high-capability cluster: the need for macroeconomic stability, improving the business environment,
reforming the land market and expanding the quality of engagement on the labor market.

ANNEX 3: SCD Consultations

The Albania SCD preparation benefitted from extensive public consultations that were held
throughout the country and attended by diverse groups of stakeholders. The main objectives of the
consultations were to solicit stakeholders’ views on the development priorities, challenges and
opportunities of Albania. The input and feedback received during the SCD consultations from
Albania’s partners and citizens informed the identification and assessment of the country’s
development challenges and opportunities. The consultations helped enhance the broad ownership
base of the document.

Two round of consultations were conducted by the World Bank Group (see Table 6 for a summary).
In the first round stakeholder nine consultations were held in July 2014, including sessions with the
Council of Ministers, central and local government representatives, members of parliament,
opposition, development partners, the business community, academia, think tanks, civil society
organizations, citizens, and media outlets. Five more consultations were held in November 2014 to
discuss the priorities emerging from the Diagnostics.

In the first round of consultations, the process was opened with a high level event chaired by the
Deputy Prime Minister with all Ministers participating. To guide the discussions, the team presented
Albania’s the proposed conceptual framework and the emerging the key constraints and challenges
from the existing analytical work conducted by the World Bank Group and other stakeholders. The
discussions centered around accelerating economic growth in a sustainable manner for poverty
eradication and boosting shared prosperity for bottom 40. The stakeholders appreciated the work

initiated under the SCD for its evidence-based, data-driven and consultative approach for
understanding Albania’s growth opportunities and challenges. They welcomed the proposed
framework and the early findings presented during the consultative forums. The stakeholders agreed
with the main proposition of the SCD for a need for a new economic model for achieving lasting
poverty reduction and shared prosperity, based on propelling exports and increasing employment
opportunities for Albanians. The stakeholders agreed that identifying development priorities for
Albania will help achieving sustainable economic growth for reducing poverty, increasing the living
standards of the population and supporting Albania’s EU aspirations.

The regional consultations in the first round were organized to ensure representative regional
engagement. The consultations were conducted in a workshop format, with groups guided by a set of
questions on Albania’s growth priorities, opportunities, and challenges. All regional consultations
revealed largely similar findings with minor variations. The consultations highlighted the need to focus
on growth enhancement and job creation activities, with careful natural resources management. While
the first round consultations presented the direction of the SCD as well as the emerging priority areas
for the country, stakeholder groups also indicated priority areas for future World Bank Group future
support, noting the need for focusing on growth enhancing and job creating areas.

The second round of consultations focused the discussion on the SCD draft report’s findings and the
priorities emerging from the SCD. The SCD emerging conclusions and priorities were broadly
endorsed by stakeholders.

ANNEX 5: CPIA Assessment

The World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) assesses the conduciveness of a
country’s policy and institutional framework to poverty reduction, sustainable growth, and the effective use of
development assistance. It rates countries against a set of 16 criteria grouped in four clusters: (a) economic
management; (b) structural policies; (c) policies for social inclusion and equity; and (d) public sector
management and institutions. For each of the 16 criteria, countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high).

Albania’s most recent overall CPIA rating in 2013 was 3.6. Its highest score among the clusters is with regard
to structural policies (3.8). Its relative policy weaknesses are in the areas of: fiscal policy conduct (2.5), property
rights and rule-based governance (3.0) and policies and institutions for environmental sustainability (3.0).
