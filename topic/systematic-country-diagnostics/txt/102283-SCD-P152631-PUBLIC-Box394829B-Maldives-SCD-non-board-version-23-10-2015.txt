THE SYSTEMATIC
COUNTRY DIAGNOSTIC
Under its new approach to working with its country partners, the
World Bank Group (WBG) requires the preparation of a Systematic
Country Diagnostic (SCD) to precede the development of
Country Partnership Frameworks which guide programming.
The objective of an SCD is to identify the most critical constraints
and opportunities facing a country in accelerating progress
toward the goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting
shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The SCD is expected
to produce an objective, evidence-based, candid assessment
of the main challenges facing the country, without limitation to
the areas where the WBG is currently engaged.

acknowledgements
The World Bank Group would like to thank the Government of Maldives, in particular staff at the
Ministry of Finance and Treasury, for their hospitality and feedback during the preparation of
this document. Similarly the World Bank would like to thank participants from the Ministry of
Fisheries and Agriculture, the Ministry of Tourism and the Maldives Monetary Authority, youth
groups, Civil Society Organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations, student bodies, academia,
the private sector and development partners for candidly sharing their perspectives during the
SCD consultations. The SCD relied on analytical work produced by the World Bank Group, the
Government of Maldives and other development partners and civil society organizations.

The team was led by Emanuel Salinas (Program Leader, Trade & Competitiveness), Ralph Van
Doorn (Senior Economist) and Silvia Redaelli (Senior Economist). The team received guidance
from Francoise Clottes (World Bank Country Director) and Adam Sack (IFC Country Manager).
Andrea Gallina and Hafiz Zainudeen coordinated consultations with stakeholders in Maldives. The
peer reviewers were Gabriela Inchauste, Rafael Munoz, and Raju Singh.

The team was further composed of the staff across the World Bank Group’s Global Practices,

Data disclaimer

The systematic analysis of opportunities and obstacles for poverty reduction and shared prosperity in
Maldives is limited by shortcomings in official statistics. The lack of consistent and comprehensive data on
micro and macro-economic aspects in Maldives has been identified as a significant obstacle for evidence-
based policymaking and policy advice.

Understanding of poverty issues in Maldives is limited by shortcomings in the current poverty measurement
framework and by data quality and comparability constraints. The latest available household survey data to
assess evolution of poverty was conducted in 2009-10; differences in survey instruments and possibly in data
quality limit ability to profile the evolution of poverty.

Due to the open nature of the economy and capacity constraints, macroeconomic, balance of payments and
fiscal data are not always accurate. In particular, it has been suggested that the size of the tourism sector,
even after recent revisions, is still underestimated. On the other hand, the official fiscal expenditure may be
underreported.

The analysis of the real sector trends is constrained by lack of information on industries composition and
out-of-date enterprise surveys. Lack of recent reliable labor force data, especially within the tourism sector,
limits potential for analysis of youth labor market challenges. Similarly, data on role, size, management and
fiscal risk of SOEs is not publicly available.

In undertaking this diagnostic, the team has aimed at complementing official sources of data with information
from stakeholders gathered through surveys, focus groups and consultations. The team acknowledges the
limitations in these approaches and thus data stemming from these exercises is duly identified throughout
the document and used only as means of identification of main issues, rather than as a basis for conclusive
assessment of policies.

Data and knowledge gaps are identified in the relevant sections of the document.

Executive summary

                        Maldives is an island nation scattered in the Indian Ocean comprising 1,190 small coral islands
                        of which 190 are inhabited by a local population of 341,000. Maldives’ unique archipelagic coral
                        island provides the country with an extremely rich and diverse marine ecological system. With
                        more territorial sea than land, marine resources have played a vital role shaping the contours of
                        economic development, with nature-based tourism being the key driver of economic growth and
                        fisheries an important sector of employment for the local population.

                        foreign workers. Fiscal revenues generated in the tourism sector have been used to address some

                        on imported goods, labor and finance. While tourism accounts for about a third of the country’s
                        GDP, it only contributes to 16 percent of the employment in the country. Linkages between
                        resorts and local economy are similarly limited, with very few products and services supplied by
                        local enterprises. The employment of Maldivian women in the tourism industry faces particular

                       obstacles. Apart from tourism and fisheries, which is a large employment and export revenue
                       generator, there are few sizable economic activities in the country.


                       The development of the tourism sector in Maldives has created sizable rents, which, through
                       taxation and other fiscal means, have been used to address some of the structural development
                       challenges of Maldives’ economy. In particular, tourism revenues have been used to support job
                       creation in the public sector, to finance the provision of public services and expand access to
                       primary health and education facilities beyond the capital area Malé. They also have helped insulate
                       the local economy from international price fluctuations through a system of universal subsidies
                       on food. The new constitution introducing democracy in the late 2000s has been accompanied
                       by an increase in the level of redistribution: (i) the introduction of explicit electricity subsidies;
                       (ii) the introduction of a universal health insurance scheme; and (iii) an increase in coverage and
                       generosity of pension system.


                       Poverty reduction and shared prosperity
                       Poverty incidence in Maldives is substantially in line with that of an upper middle-income country.
Poverty declined
                       According to the latest available Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) collected in
nationwide but not
                       2009/10, the share of population living with less than $1.25 in 2005 PPP a day was 4.9 percent,
uniformly across
Maldives’ territory.   whereas the corresponding share using the $2 a day poverty line was 17.02 percent. These figures
                       are very similar to the average poverty outcomes of upper middle-income countries (UMIC), two
                       of the small Pacific islands, and neighboring Sri Lanka. Maldives performs better than the other
                       countries in South Asia with respect to several socio-economic indicators. Maldives ranks first in
                       terms of per-capita GDP and second only to Sri Lanka based on the Human Development Index
                       ranking.


                       Over the seven years between 2003 and 2010, poverty declined nationwide but not uniformly
                       across Maldives’ territory. Poverty declined in the Atolls while it remained stable in the capital area
                       Malé. The poverty rate is the highest in the Central North and Southern atolls, while the capital area
                       Malé is home to the largest share of poor individuals. Sustained migration from the atolls to the
                       capital accounts for most of the diverging poverty trends at the subnational level.


                       Despite progress, the pace of poverty reduction has been below potential when considering the
                       fast GDP growth of the Maldivian economy between 2003 and 2010 due to growing inequality.
                       The growth elasticity of poverty reduction (GEPR) in Maldives of about 1.2 percent is relatively low
                       by international standards. This is evident in comparison to other countries. For example, while
                       Maldives and Sri Lanka shared the same growth rate (approximately 4.8 percent a year over the
                       period), poverty reduction in Maldives was one-third less than experienced in Sri Lanka.1 Given the
                       slow pace of poverty reduction, Maldives will be able to reduce extreme poverty under 1 percent

                       1	   Poverty decreased at about 0.5 percent per year in Maldives as opposed to 1.6 percent in Sri Lanka.

                         by 2040, a much longer period than upper middle-income countries, and other countries in South
                         Asia. The lack of shared prosperity in Maldives is the main determinant of the limited impact of
                         growth on poverty reduction. The unequal impact of growth is further reflected by an increase in
                         the gap between the poorest and richest segments of the population.


                         Limited jobs opportunities, especially for low-skilled labor might have played an important role in
                         limiting contribution of growth to poverty reduction. In particular, the lack of growth in fisheries

                         Political and institutional risks
                         As Maldives’ transition to a democratic system is still in progress, powers and relationships among
                         democratic institutions remain to be settled. Institutional and political uncertainty constrain the

                         Economic opportunities in Maldives are out of sync with growth and shared prosperity. The interplay
                         of socio-demographic trends and fiscal constraints adds to the social sustainability challenge of
                         Maldives’ development model. Particularly vulnerable to these challenges are youth and women.

                          to long-term growth. Potential for agriculture is limited due to the scarcity and dispersion of
                          arable land and high cost of fresh water for irrigation, and the country will remain dependent on

                        to improving the inclusiveness of tourism going forward: (1) enhancing the implementation of

                        sources of growth
                        Economic diversification and competitiveness in Maldives are hampered by significant structural and spatial
                        constraints, but improving the enabling environment will enhance the potential for entrepreneurship, creation
                        of new firms and growth of existing ones. Maldives faces similar structural challenges of other small island
                        states that restrict the extent to which the country can attain competitiveness across the board. However,
                        there are visible untapped opportunities where potential (in terms of existing demand and proved production
                        capacity) exists, both within value chains of existing industries, as well as potential new economic activities.

                        Better management of its resources may also make Maldives more resilient to external shocks. Maldives
                        will remain exposed to external shocks from tourism under its current development model. While it cannot
                        eliminate its vulnerability to shocks Maldives has opportunities to reduce its vulnerability and increase its
                        resilience within limits by: (1) reducing exposure to shocks by diversifying its sources of tourism and reducing
                        its reliance on fossil fuel; (2) improving international conditions to reduce the domestic transmission of
                        shocks by reforming public expenditure and reducing the risk of the public debt portfolio; and (3) increasing
                        its risk management through improving institutional quality, including public financing management and
                        planning capacity, and increasing policy space.

                             Maldives is an island nation in the Indian Ocean comprising 1,190 small coral islands of which 199
                             are inhabited by a local population of 341,000.2 Maldives’ unique archipelagic coral island provides the

                             land, marine resources have played a vital role shaping the contours of economic development, with

                        Over the past 30 years, Maldives has successfully built on its extraordinary natural assets to promote
                        growth and socio-economic development. Maldives shares many of the Small Island Developing
                        States development challenges, such as: a small domestic market; a narrow and fragile resource
                        base; a shortage of skilled manpower; difficult inter-island transport and communication; high
                        cost of social and economic infrastructure provision; and heavy dependence on external trade
                        and vulnerability to external shocks and natural disasters. However, in the case of Maldives, these
                        challenges are compounded by its high geographic dispersion with 1,190 coral islands (199 of which
                        are inhabited) grouped in 26 atolls, spread over roughly 90,000 square kilometers. Nevertheless,

                        Maldives’ model of socio-economic development relies on tourism-led growth and redistribution
                        of tourism-generated revenue (Figure 3). The redistribution of revenue through public service
                        delivery is complicated by the geographical dispersion of the archipelago that prevents achieving
                        economies of scale, and ultimately leads to question whether this model is sustainable. The
                        performance of this development model will be assessed on its ability to: (1) generate growth;
                        (2) include as much of the population as possible in the growth process though productive forms
                        of employment: and (3) efficiently redistribute resources towards the neediest segment of the
                        population to facilitate poverty reduction and shared prosperity.

                                 Growth
                                 Bound by structural constraints and endowed with extraordinary natural assets Maldives
                                 developed a high-end tourism sector, which has resulted in a very high pace of economic growth
                                 over the past three decades. GDP per capita increased from $275 in 1980 to $6,666 in 2013
                                 (Figure 4). This growth rate, which averaged 7 percent between 2002 and 2013 is mainly driven
                                 by tourism and non-tradable tourism-related activities (including construction, transport and
                                 communications) (Figure 5). This impressive track record of economic growth has been supported
                                 by capital accumulation through investment in resorts, and by an increase in the labor force mainly
                                 benefiting foreign workers.


                                 Economic growth in Maldives has been reliant on the development of tourism, with very limited
                                 contribution of other economic activities. Tourism accounts directly for around 30 percent of
                                 nominal GDP,5 and has accounted for about 28 percent of real GDP growth between 2002 and
                                 2013. Including tourism-related sectors,6 these numbers increase to 64 percent of nominal GDP
                                 and 65 percent of real growth. There are few other primary industries contributing to economic
                                 growth, and they are small in relative size. Manufacturing, fisheries and agriculture combined
                                 accounted for 9.6 percent of GDP in 2013, and private sector-led growth outside of the tourism
                                 sector has been limited.

                         But Maldives’ form of tourism-led growth has followed an enclave model, reliant on imported
                         goods, labor and finance. Accordingly, while tourism accounts for about a third of the country’s
                         GDP, it only contributes to an estimated 16 percent of the employment in the country. Even when
                         including sectors that benefit indirectly from tourism employment increases to only 22 percent of
                         the total (Figure 35). Linkages between resorts and local economy are similarly limited, with very
                         few products and services supplied by local enterprises. Manufacturing firms are small in size and
                         lack the quality and reliability demanded by high-end resorts.

                         The participation of women in tourism jobs has been low. Even when Maldivians are employed, only
                         about 30 percent are women, according to data from the 2009/10 HIES. Research suggests that
                         social dynamics influence employment decisions such that families are reluctant to allow young
                         women to take jobs in the tourism sector because they would have to travel from home to other
                         islands and because the tourism sector is associated with “immoral and unethical” practices.7
                         A lack of child-care or residential facilities for employed women in the tourism sector further
                         exacerbates familial unwillingness to allow young women to work away from home. Women’s
                         limited control of transportation means to travel to and from resorts adds another hurdle.8

                                   The tourism industry has contributed to an already large geographical spread of activity. Starting
                                   in the atolls around the main international airport in Malé (Central North), the tourism sector is
                                   still largely concentrated around Malé, with 84 percent of resorts within 130 kilometers from Malé
                                   airport. However, the industry has been slowly taking advantage of advances in transportation
                                   opening up atolls to the north and south. In fact, the first resort outside this range was opened in
                                   2005 and there has been a steady increase since. (Figure 6).

                                    and expatriate manpower, have meant that health services come at substantially higher costs
                                    when compared with other countries in the region. Maldives spent 9.2 percent of its GDP on

                                economic indicators and gender equality. Compared to other countries in South Asia, Maldives
                                ranks first in terms of per-capita GDP and it is second only to Sri Lanka based on the Human
                                Development Index ranking (Figure 13, left panel). In 2010, life expectancy at birth was 76.8, three

                                 Maldives fares significantly better than many countries when it comes to gender equality, ranking
                                 49th on the Gender Inequality Index in the 2014 Global Human Development Report of UNDP, in
                                 comparison with its Human Development Index ranking of 103th. The island nation has the least

                                 countries as well as its South Asian neighbors. The country has attained gender parity in primary
                                 and secondary enrollment, and the number of Maldivian women attaining university degrees is at

                                 Over the seven years between 2003 and 2010, Maldives achieved a substantial decline in poverty.
                                 The poverty headcount based on the national poverty line declined by seven percentage points,
                                 from 23 percent in 2003 to approximately 16 percent in 2010. Depth and severity of poverty
                                 declined from 6 to 4 percent and from 2.3 to 1.6 percent, respectively. Similar positive trends are
                                 observed considering the $2 PPP international poverty line. On the other hand, no statistically
                                 significant poverty decline is registered when considering the $1.25 PPP international poverty line
                                 (Figure 14).

                               Poverty declined in the atolls while remaining stable in the capital area Malé. The decline in poverty
                               observed at national level is the result of opposite poverty trends at regional level. In particular,
                               while poverty remained substantially stable at around 18 percent in the capital area Malé, it
                               declined markedly in the atolls – going from 25 percent in 2003 to 14 percent in 2010. Similar
                               patterns are observed using the international poverty lines (see Figure 15).

                               is home to the largest share of poor individuals. The Central North region of the archipelagos is
                               the poorest in both years, with poverty rates of 35 percent in 2003 and 25 percent in 2010. This is
                               followed by the Southern region, with 28 percent poor individuals in 2003 and 21 percent in 2010.
                               The Central region reduced its poverty rate by more than 80 percent in seven years (see Figure 16).

Growth is not equally        The lack of shared prosperity in Maldives is the main determinant of the limited impact of growth
shared by all sections       on poverty reduction. Shared prosperity remains a major challenge for Maldives. As shown in

                                 Employment at the lower spectrum of the skill distribution is associated with higher poverty rates.
                                 In particular, poverty rates are higher when the head of household is employed in construction (26
                                 percent), manufacturing (18 percent) and fisheries/agriculture (17 percent). Taken together, these
                                 three sectors account for more than 50 percent of the poor individuals with working household
                                 heads, and the fisheries sector alone accounts for about 26 percent of the total (Figure 23).
                                 Fisheries development is particularly important in the atolls, where 30 percent of the household
                                 heads work in the fishery sector (as opposed to only 1 percent in Malé). In the atolls, the fisheries
                                 sector alone accounts for 41 percent of poor individuals with a working household head.


                                 As labor income is the main source of household income for the poor, an inclusive development
                                 of the labor market is key for reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Labor income
                                 accounts for more than 70 percent of the total household income of the poor, and it is the main

                                 comes primarily from wages. In the atolls, where 45 percent of employed household heads work
                                 in fisheries and manufacturing, labor income is mainly self-employment income (see Figure 23).

                            Recent macroeconomic and fiscal trends
                            After hitting 1.3 percent in 2012, economic growth has been steadily recovering and is estimated
                            to amount to 5 percent in 2014.19 Most other service sectors are estimated to have grown as well
                            in 2014, while the industrial sector expanded by 13.2 percent in 2014, driven by construction,
                            following a contraction of 1.5 percent the previous year. However, the agriculture and fisheries
                            sector is estimated to have contracted by 2.1 percent in 2014 after posting growth of 5 percent in
                            2013. (Figure 24). See also Box 2 for a discussion on macro data.


                            Average stay continued its secular decline as the composition of tourism changes further. The
                            average stay of tourists declined to 6.1 days, down from a recorded average of 7.1 days between
                            2009 and 2013, reflecting a structural shift in the composition of tourism. Between 2010 and
                            2014 the share of European tourists fell by 20 percentage points from 63.8 to 43.9 percent due to
                            weaker economic conditions in Europe. The simultaneous increase in the number of Asian tourists
                            and demand from Middle East mitigated the weakening European demand. During the 2010-2014
                            period the Asian share of tourists expanded by 15.2 percent while the share of Middle Eastern
                            tourists grew by 1.6 percent (Figure 25).

                               Annual average inflation moderated even further in 2014, falling to 2.4 percent, down from 4
                               percent in 2013 driven by low food prices and international crude prices. The fall is particularly
                               steep considering the 10.9 percent inflation rate recorded in 2012. As measured by the overall
                               consumer price index, inflation in Malé has been unstable since 2009 with large fluctuations.

2009.                          the second half of 2014, inflation fell even further, driven largely by a drop in food prices (Figure
                               27). Prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages grew at a pace of 1 percent in 2014, as opposed
                               to 7.5 percent in 2013.


                               New taxes in 2011 and 2012, mainly on the tourism sector, have increased fiscal revenue
                               structurally; however, the fiscal deficit widened to an estimated 11.6 percent of GDP in 2014.
                               These taxes include the new Tourism Goods and Services Tax (TGST, which was increased from 8
                               to 12 percent in November 2014) and an increase in the Airport Departure Tax. All these taxes are

                               However, persistent and widening fiscal deficits have led to a high level of public debt, which stood
                               at 74.6 percent of GDP at end of 2014. This represented a net increase of 36.8 percent from 2003.
                               This increase was driven by persistent deficits, while fast GDP growth relative to the average real
                               interest rate on debt provided some downward pressure on the level of debt.

deficits have led to           at a lower rate), increases in import duties, a one-off revenue boost from Special Economic Zones

                               properly implemented, will help reduce the deficit, they are unlikely to be sufficient to decrease

                         At the end of 2014, gross international reserves increased, but net usable reserves remained low
                         at only $120 million, covering less than a month of imports. As a result of the large improvement
                         in net capital inflows, gross official reserves have increased from $368 million at the end of 2013
                         to $614 million at the end of 2014, covering 3.7 months of imports of goods and services. However,
                         the stable exchange rate and the parallel market premium do not signal any shortages. In practice,
                         the amount of reserves in the economy may be much larger, and the tourism industry appears to
                         supply sufficient quantities of foreign exchange at a stable premium over the official exchange
                         rate. The exchange rate remained at MVR 15.4 per USD, while the premium declined, as major
                         SOEs abstained from the secondary market.

Box 2. A real crisis or a macro data crisis?
It has often said that Maldives is perennially at the verge of a crisis. When looking at the
macro data the question is indeed why the country is not in a crisis.

According to the IMF’s 2013 Debt Sustainability Analysis update, Maldives was at high risk
of debt distress. In particular, the country had a persistent current account deficit of around
20 percent of GDP; public domestic and external debt was 73 percent of GDP at end-2011,
while private external debt was estimated at 38 percent of GDP. By February 2013, official
reserves amounted to $304 million, equivalent to just 1.6 months of imports, and freely
usable reserves amounted to only $99 million. Despite these challenges, stores were stocked
with imported items and the exchange rate premium was modest.

How can this puzzle be explained?
First, the tourism industry seems to hold sufficient amounts of reserves at home and abroad
to be able to supply sufficient quantities to the parallel market to keep the premium stable.
Second, given the extreme openness of the economy, the measurement of financial flows
through the current and capital account are inaccurate. Similarly, poor financial management
and recording practices contribute to underreporting on the expenditure side.

The national accounts were revised recently according to international practice resulting in
an increase of nominal GDP over previous estimates (e.g., by 13 percent in 2013, Figure 2.1).a
At the same time, significant revisions have been made to the balance of payments data
using new data sources, better methods and new data in line with IMF technical assistance
recommendations. This resulted in large changes to the services balance (mostly tourism),
goods balance (imports) and financial accounts, leading to a substantially narrower current
account deficit (Figure 2.2), higher estimates of FDI inflows and reduced private-sector
borrowing. Moreover, surveys and anecdotal evidence suggest that the tourism exports could
still be underestimated.

As a result of these adjustments, the current account deficit in 2013 has been revised from
20.5 percent of GDP to 6.5 percent of GDP. The level of public debt at end-2011 has been
revised down to 59 percent of GDP, while the estimated level of private external debt has been
revised down to 13 percent of GDP.

                           Maldives development model is inherently vulnerable to shocks and increasingly not
                           sustainable. In particular:
                           ∫	 Maldives is highly vulnerable to external macro shocks
                           ∫	 Maldives democratic transition is still in progress and political instability high
                           ∫	 Maldives social contract is at risk due to lack of inclusiveness, especially of youth

                         Recent socio-economic and political developments have raised concerns regarding the
                         sustainability of Maldives’ development model. Despite a long period of sustained economic
                         growth, the vulnerability of Maldives’ model of development is increasing over time, especially with
                         respect to its fiscal, social, political and environmental sustainability.

heavy reliance on        heavy reliance on imports. Furthermore, increasing macroeconomic imbalances and escalating
imports.                 public debt represent a growing source of external vulnerability. While the Maldivian economy has
                         shown resilience in the past, the country may currently lack appropriate buffers to cope with a
                         shock that would affect the tourism sector, terms of trade or interest rates.



                           Box 3. How “special” is Maldives?
                           Before the tsunami hit in 2004, expenditure levels were in line with other island states, such
                           as Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, Barbados and Dominica, which are all countries with
                           higher tourist receipts, large fiscal deficits, large current account deficits and a soft-peg
                           exchange rate. Moreover, expenditure was in the 20th to 80th percentile of emerging and
                           developing countries. After the tsunami and the introduction of democracy, expenditure has
                           moved to the top 20th percentile and has stayed there (Figure 3.1).

                           Maldives is also an outlier in many ways compared to the rest of the world. Its exports
                           and imports are the 97th percentile of the world, its current account in the 8th percentile
                           (although the recent revision makes the current account deficit less exceptional), and
                           expenditure in the 77th percentile (Figure 3.2).

                              Especially in recent years, the development model has led to an increasing share of revenue
                              dependent on tourism, while an increasing share of expenditure has become “rigid”. That is, an
                              increasing share of expenditure consists of items that are not easily adjusted in the event of a
                              downturn in revenue: subsidies and transfers, social welfare contributions, salaries and wages and
                              interest payments (Figure 31).


                              The lack of macro policy buffers leaves the country with few instruments to stabilize the economy
                              in the event of a downturn in tourism. With high debt and an already high fiscal deficit, it will be

                                Moreover, the widening fiscal deficit has led to rising interest rates. The widening fiscal deficit has
                                forced the country to accumulate more and more domestic debt. As a result, the government has
                                resorted to central bank debt financing (until May 2014) and domestic arrears28 as additional
                                financing sources. As market interest rates started to increase strongly by mid-2013, the
                                authorities put a cap on interest rates (called a “tap” system), which has temporarily stabilized
                                interest cost on domestic debt.


                                Accumulated domestic arrears add an additional fiscal burden. The stock of accumulated domestic
                                arrears was estimated at 6.2 percent of GDP at the end of 2012. About 82 percent was owed to
                                SOEs, in particular to the government-owned importer of fuel, medicine and basic food, and to the
                                Aasandha Company (health insurance). The emergence of arrears is the result of both unrealistic
                                budget envelopes and a lack of expenditure controls.29

                      This points to weaknesses in public financial management as a source of fiscal risk. The budget
                      as a policy document suffers from a lack of credibility and limited policy orientation. Expenditure
Shortcomings in       composition variations are significant at more than 15 percent of the original budget. Furthermore,
the operations        there is no credible medium-term macro-fiscal framework and it has a weak and inefficient system
and oversight of      of budget review. Existing cash constraints limit the predictability and control of the budget.
SOEs contribute to    Moreover, although consolidated financial statements have been produced since 2011, data
macro-fiscal risks,   quality and consistency are a concern. The government does not meet the basic practices of fiscal
due to inadequate     risk disclosure and analysis on contingent liabilities and actual liabilities. There is no complete
regulation and        picture of contingent liabilities that may arise from loan guarantees that have been issued as the
supervision.          government does not report on the main risks to its fiscal forecasts.30


                      SOEs may pose further risks to fiscal sustainability as most are loss-making and depend on
                      government support, with only nine companies having contributed dividends to the budget in
                      the last four years. Shortcomings in the operations and oversight of SOEs contribute to macro-
                      fiscal risks, due to inadequate regulation and supervision. Most SOEs operate at a loss, and
                      represent a drain to the budget and a source of risk associated to costly fuel imports, foreign
                      exchange transactions, and payment arrears. Capital transfers to SOEs and subsidy transfers have
                      contributed substantially to the growth in expenditures in recent years (Figure 34). An independent
                      centralized ownership entity (the Privatization and Corporatization Board) was established under
                      a comprehensive legal framework in 2013, but final decisions on the appropriate institutional
                      arrangements are still under consideration.

                               Maldives democratic transition started recently. The country adopted a new constitution in 2008,
                               ushering in multi-party elections as well as a set of new state institutions at central and local levels,
                               often with mandated high degrees of independence. The new constitution enacted a mechanism
                               for separation of powers by creating independent branches of the Legislature, Executive and
                               Judiciary for the first time in the history of the country.


                               Powers of and relationships among democratic institutions are still being defined. For instance,
                               until recently parliamentarians were able to simply add expenditures to the budget on their own
                               initiative without concern for expenditure limits and all independent commissions created their own
                               human resource regimes. More importantly, Maldives is a split polity where political contestation is
                               not always handled through institutional channels. There have been frequent incidences of political
                               unrest over the past 10 years and election processes have been criticized by observers as lacking
                               credibility in many key aspects. Institutional incoherence and political instability currently hamper
                               the ability of the government to provide goods and services and to carry out its redistribution
                               function, which is central to social and economic inclusion in Maldives. It poses a longer-term risk
                               to improving government operations and, more generally, public trust in the state.


                               Institutional and political instability constrain the sustainability of Maldives’ development
                               model moving forward. There is widespread consensus that political stability was critical to the
                               development of the tourism industry in Maldives. The current polarization of the political party
                               system, resulting political unrest and the limits of checks and balances between powers, all
                               contribute to aggravating political and institutional risks as well as macro and social sustainability
                               issues.

                         Social sustainability and vulnerability
                         Economic opportunities in Maldives are out of sync with growth and shared prosperity. Public
                         administration is the primary sector of employment in Maldives, particularly for the educated
                         local workforce. Alone, it accounts for 17 percent of total employment and one-fourth of the
                         employment for workers with secondary or higher levels of education. The tourism industry, while
                         driving the growth process and being the main contributor to GDP, accounts for only 16 percent
                         of employment and relies disproportionally on expatriate workforce for both high- and low-skilled
                         jobs. The fisheries sector, which is a crucial sector for poverty reduction and shared prosperity,
                         accounts for 11 percent of total employment and one-fourth of the workforce with less than
                         secondary education (Figure 35).

                           by the public sector and a skills mismatch in the private sector has contributed to high youth
                           unemployment. In 2010, according to HIES data, the unemployment rate for individuals in
                           the 15 to 24 age group was 25 percent, more than double the unemployment rate of the total
                           workforce (11.8 percent). The lack of economic opportunities for the youth is contributing
                           to other social ills, such as drug abuse and gang-related violence, especially among male

                        These dynamics might further limit opportunities for socio-economic inclusion, particularly of
                        Maldivian women. According to the HIES (2010), while the major reason given by both women and
                        men for being unemployed was their inability to find suitable employment, 22 percent of women
                        cited household chores as a reason, and another 3 percent were deterred by objection from family
                        members. Thus, lack of supporting environment in the family was a major factor discouraging a
                        significant number of women from seeking employment. In particular, marriage and pregnancy
                        at a young age, geographical isolation, and social norms restricting women’s mobility are factors
                        that limit women’s contribution to national development.


                        Environmental vulnerability and sustainability issues
                        Natural resources represent the country’s main asset but there are growing concerns in terms of
                        sustainability. Climate change could cause annual economic losses of more than 12 percent of
                        Maldives’ GDP by 2100.37 Due to rising sea levels, the entire country could be submerged before the
                        end of the century as 80 percent of land is less than 1 meter above sea level. With 42 percent of the
                        population and more than 70 percent of critical infrastructure within 100 meters of shoreline, this
                        would have dire social and economic consequences, notably for the poorer and most vulnerable.
                        Despite past efforts, the country is not prepared to withstand a rise in sea levels, as most lifeline
                        infrastructure (such as power houses, hospitals and harbors), population centers (such as

                        In order to partially address this, the government prepared a Strategic National Action Plan in
                        June 2011 to integrate Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation, but its actual
                        implementation appears to be limited.39

The most pressing         However the most pressing issues relate to shortcomings in the management of natural resources,
issues relate to          particularly with regard to sewage and solid waste management. An estimated 248,000 tons of
shortcomings in           solid waste was generated in 2007, most coming from urban areas (Figure 38), and this figure is
the management of         expected to increase to 660,000 tons by 2020.40 Despite the scale of the challenge, most of the
natural resources,        134 Island Waste Management Centers, covering 66 percent of the islands, are not fully functional,
particularly with         as no program for transport of waste from these centers to a regional or central waste-processing
regard to sewage          center has been established.41 Regulation seems to be poorly enforced. Resorts, in particular, have

                          39), although this assertion has not been documented. Adequate management of solid waste
                          is hindered by the high cost of service delivery in the country, associated with the low volume of
                          waste on each island and the high cost of transportation. Land scarcity also limits the options for
                          establishing and managing adequate landfills. The issue of sewage and solid waste is particularly
                          challenging, as it has a direct impact on the country’s most valuable natural resources – coral
                          reefs and fisheries. Uncontrolled waste disposal and floating debris at tourist resorts are the most
                          visible threats to the country’s reputation as a pristine high-end tourist destination. They also
                          affect the quality of ground water, with a direct impact on island communities.

3. Vulnerability and sustainability issues (contd.)



                         Most of the Maldivian population depends on the ground water and rain water as source of fresh
                         water, which are at high risk due to climate change. As Maldives consists of low-lying islands,
                         the rise in sea-levels would force salt water intrusion into fresh water lens. Minimum projected
                         sea level rise of 1mm per year shows that the groundwater safe yield will decrease at least by
                         3 percent between 2012 and 2030. In addition, in most inhabited islands the groundwater is
                         contaminated due to untreated sewage disposal into the ground. It is estimated that per capita
                         water availability will decline by 34 percent from the 2009 level of 103 cubic meters per year
                         to 76.6 cubic meters per year by 2035. The shifting in the rainfall pattern from drier and more
                         inter-annually variable rainfall regime over the next 20 years and increase in temperature of
                         0.5°C to 3.5°C expected by 2100 will increase water demand leading to high competition over
                         scarce resources, making water security for potable and irrigation purposes continue to be a
                         serious problem.42 Confronted by diminishing resources, more than 100 islands have requested

                         The country is also vulnerable to shocks to drinking water supply due to the lack of back-up
                         arrangements. This vulnerability was shown clearly by the water crisis in December 2014, when
                         a fire in a water treatment plant in Malé led to acute shortages of drinking water and required

                        Institutional capacity for managing the country’s natural resources is relatively weak. Because of
                        limited resources, environmental management is largely done on a limited and voluntary basis
                        on the islands. Governmental environmental agencies face important issues in retaining scarce
                        qualified staff.

                         dominated by tourism, while tradable sectors and physical exports are largely limited to fisheries.
                         Tourism has leveraged the country’s endowments to underpin a very rapid growth, but the largely
                         high-end tourism industry has developed in an enclave way, with limited linkages with the local
                         communities. Fisheries are a significant source of employment, particularly for the poor, but the
                         industry has stalled and much of the value is lost through low-added-value exports. The small size
                         of the economy, together with other structural environment factors, has limited the development
                         of other economic activities. Accordingly, the rapid overall economic growth of the country has
                         not been accompanied by a commensurate growth in opportunities and jobs for the Maldivian
                         population – especially for the youth, and for women whether youth or adult.

                              Tourism is the most important industry in Maldives. Tourism constitutes by far the biggest
                              contributor to GDP at 28 percent, and is the greatest generator of foreign exchange earnings at
                              more than 60 percent in 2014. Revenue from the sector accounts for 38 percent of government
                              revenue, derived from various taxes and lease of islands.44 Additional contributions from airport
                              service charges, import duty and revenue from ancillary industries increase the overall impact of
                              the tourism sector in the economy.


                              Tourism in Maldives has grown steadily since 1970s and Maldives has managed to position itself as
                              a high-end destination (Figure 40). Tourism in Maldives has developed as a supply-driven industry
                              whose development was initially led by the private sector - as opposed to through government
                              policies or support programs. Notably, while the supply for touristic facilities is constantly
                              increasing, the country so far has been largely able to maintain both high occupancy rates (Figure
                              41) as well as a high premium (deemed as high as 40 percent45 over other touristic destinations).
                              Such premium is deemed to be based on the unique natural resources of the country, as well as on

                                However, the sustainability of such premium cannot be taken for granted. The tourism industry
                                has been susceptible to external shocks and changes in global trends. Most recently, the global
                                financial crisis prompted a structural shift in the composition of arrivals, from Europe to Asia.
                                Between 2008 and 2013, the share of European tourists fell by 26 percentage points mainly due
                                to weaker economic conditions in Europe. Conversely, the share of Chinese tourists expanded by
                                23 percentage points (Figure 42). This shift in demand was pursued by the industry, which made
                                important marketing efforts in China and Middle East to compensate for the declining demand
                                from Europe. While this shift helped maintain the volume of arrivals and occupancy, the overall
                                profitability of the industry appears to be declining. The average length of stay fell from eight
                                nights in 2008 to 6.1 in 2014 and is expected to continue declining as Chinese travelers favor

                              for tourism allows for open and competitive bidding on resorts, although islands in which the
                              government makes an investment are exempted from the bidding process.48 In practice it
                              appears that there are significant barriers to entry,49 which may have prevented the country
                              from maximizing the benefits from its natural resources. As a result, as of the end of 2013, the
                              four largest tourism groups (including two of the pioneers) control 31 percent of resorts and 38
                              percent of the resort beds. Their influence has remained strong over the decades. For example,
                              of the resorts established in the 1990s and after 2010, the four groups account for 52 and 44
                              percent of the beds, respectively (Figure 44).50

                              Second, the current methods for allocating leases has translated into sub-optimal investment
                              levels, with a large number of leased islands remaining undeveloped or suffering severe delays
One-third of the
                              in construction. At present there are 106 licenses granted for new resorts, but there have been
licensed resorts
                              significant delays in construction of the planned resorts. Indeed, one-third of the licensed resorts
have not come into
                              have not come into operation more than five years after the license was granted, and 22 licensed
operation more
than five years after         resorts have experienced delays of around 10 years. Altogether, the licensed but unfinished resorts
the license was               would account for 21,000 additional beds51 that are planned but have not materialized as a source
granted, and 22               of income for the country (which would increase by 78 percent the capacity in the country; create
licensed resorts have         31,000 additional direct jobs;52 and provide significant revenue flows to the country through taxes
experienced delays of         and duties). The significant delays in construction of resorts after a license is granted have been
around 10 years.              blamed on a host of factors, including lack of financing. While these factors may indeed become
                              hurdles once a license has been granted, the delays in construction appear to evidence significant
                              shortcomings in the process followed to grant the licenses in the first place. Stringent and clear
                              criteria for licensing of resorts would have enabled the country to ensure that licenses are granted
                              to investors than can demonstrate the qualifications, experience and financial ability to develop the
                              resorts shortly after licenses are granted. Clear enforcement processes would enable authorities
                              to cancel non-performing leases and grant them to better qualified investors.

sector.                        Third, entities set up to promote the development of tourism may be helping to undermine the
                               governance of the sector. The Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Cooperation (MMPRC) is
                               as a state-owned enterprise formed in 2009 to promote and market the tourism industry. The
                               Maldives Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) was set up in 2006 as an entity with 47
                               percent government ownership and 53 percent private shareholding. Both MMRPC and MTDC can
                               acquire leases for resort islands without being subjected to the standard bidding process and, in
                               some cases, at below market rates. In turn, these leases can be developed or subleased to private
                               parties. While the Ministry of Tourism has aimed to strengthen governance of leases through
                               implementation of standard operation procedures, these subleases are not subject to the standard
                               operating procedures of the Ministry of Tourism and both MTDC and MMRPC lack procedures to
                               ensure transparency in subleases and prevent corruption. Further, the composition of the boards
                               of directors of MTDC and MMPRC has raised concerns on lack of transparency on appointments
                               and potential conflicts of interest. The later stems from the fact that board members include
                               heads of private tourism companies that can benefit from subleases.53 Notably, MTDC holds five
                               leases that were granted nine years ago and represent an expected capacity of 1,280 beds that
                               have not come into operation. This, together with governance concerns on their operations, calls
                               into question the extent to which these two organizations are contributing to development of the
                               tourism industry in a way that maximizes the benefits to the country.

                                                            MMPRC.

                         reputable investors in the future. Recent political unrest (which prompted travel advisories from
                         various countries) together with international media reports highlighting the risk of radicalization
                         have created concerns among tourism private stakeholders of a potential slowdown in demand

                      linkages between tourism and local enterprises is likely modest and probably limited to a handful
                      of products.


                      Tourism is a large and rapidly growing source of jobs, but most of them are not seized by local
                      population due to a host of factors. While tourism creates a large number of jobs, the Maldivian
                      population does not take advantage of them. Across the board, only 15 percent of employed
                      Maldivian men and 4 percent of employed Maldivian women work in the tourism sector, while the
                      number of foreign nationals employed in the sector has increased constantly over time (Figures
                      45and 46). A government-imposed quota (requiring 55 percent of employees in tourism to be
                      Maldivian nationals) is customarily unmet56 and, in general, appears to have failed to sustainably
                      enhance the participation of Maldivian nationals in tourism. Tourism in Maldives has created
                      more than 28,000 direct jobs57 and government targets for new resorts58 imply an added annual
                      requirement for 3,300 new staff. The relative importance of this figure is evident when compared
                      to the unemployment figures in the country. The total number of the unemployed in Maldives is
                      estimated around 11,000, of which around 8,000 are young people. The lack of participation in
                      tourism jobs is particularly dire among women, who account for less than 3 percent of the labor
                      in the industry.

                      The obstacles to enhance broader participation of the Maldivian nationals in tourism appear to
                      be manifold. Information collected from stakeholders, civil society and youth through interviews
                      and consultations during the preparation of this diagnostic identified a number of factors that
                      appear to be at play in restricting broader participation of the local population on tourism. These
                      include: (1) reservation wage that is too high for unskilled jobs; (2) lack of skills for technical and
                      managerial jobs (see section on skills below); (3) social norms (see section on youth below); and
                      (4) lack of adequate transport (resorts that are close to inhabited islands and have good transport
                      links have a much higher proportion of Maldivian workers). However, data does not currently exist
                      to validate these perceptions in a conclusive manner.59



                      56	   According to the 2014 census (published by the National Bureau of statistics) the foreign nationals account for 58.4 percent of all
                            tourism employees, but anecdotal evidence suggests that this figure may me significantly higher.
                      57	   According to the 2014 census (published by the National Bureau of statistics) there were 11,425 Maldivian employees (10,991
                            male and 435 female) at resorts, and 16,342 foreign employees (14,339 male and 2,003 female). However, according to the Ministry
                            of Tourism, by early 2015, a total of 23,917 resort beds creates an approximate total employment demand (at a ratio of 1:1.5) of
                            31,000 staff.
                      58	   The Government’s plans for development of tourism consider ten resorts (average bed capacity is 220) each year. Source: Ministry

                               of their support services and ancillary functions65 due to factors including geo-spatial challenges

                         Maldives has benefited in terms of both food security and trade. Along with the tourism sector,
                         the productive fisheries sector has been a leader in the country’s growth and development. The
                         fisheries sector has remained vital in terms of trade, employment and subsistence especially on
                         islands not dominated by the tourism industry. With a fishing-fleet of about 800 national vessels66,
                         close to 10,000 individual fishers and their families depend on fishing. In addition, fish is a staple
                         food across the archipelago and it remains the main source of protein for the population, covering
                         around 88 percent of the total animal protein intake (FAO, 2011). Maldives is among the highest fish

                         do not include jobs in processing and ancillary industries, the reduction in direct employment is
                         particularly concerning given the fact that fisheries represent the single most important source
                         of jobs in many islands, especially those that are not close to the capital or touristic resorts. The
                         reduction in women’s employment in fisheries is particularly dire; the increased mechanization
                         of the fisheries has largely taken over the fish processing activities that were the foundation of
                         female employment in this sector. Thus women’s work in fisheries has been phased out such that
                         female employment is practically nil in this sector.69 In spite of these negative trends, the value of
                         fisheries exports has increased over the same period, reflecting higher prices for fisheries exports
                         and thus signaling the unrealized potential economic contribution that a more thriving fisheries
                         industry could make to the country.

                               a premium product benefiting both from high quality fish stocks as well as sustainable fishing

                                  past years due to a mix of factors including overfishing, higher fuel costs, temperature rise

                                  two market segments have evolved in a very different manner. For skipjack tuna, the catch
                                  volumes have plummeted, the tuna is largely exported as raw commodity to intermediary
                                  markets and its export price is low and volatile. On the contrary, the (unlicensed) market for
                                  yellowfin tuna has a different pattern of development, with rapid growth in catch volume,

                                  including the industry’s ability to reap the value of the country’s stocks and develop ancillary

                                  licensing framework for skipjack tuna. If licenses for processing are maintained, it appears
                                  necessary to revise the licensing process in order to ensure that: licenses are granted in a
                                  transparent and competitive manner, and; the selection criteria for licensees emphasizes

                               Environmentally friendly fishing methods for tuna have enhanced Maldives’ ability to access
                               premium markets. The Maldivian pole-and-line fishery is one of the largest coastal fisheries in
                               the Indian Ocean, and is estimated to account for 18-20 percent of the total catch of skipjack
                               tuna in the region72 . The fishery received considerable attention as a potential model for coastal
                               states, owing to both its commercial success and its adherence to ecological best practices. Pole-
                               and-line fishery has been promoted for its environmentally friendly nature73. That has enabled
                               a pathway to the export-markets of Europe and allowed it to extract a premium compared to
                               other similar fisheries. However, it is important to note that while pole and line fishing is deemed
                               environmentally friendly due to low by-catch, it does not prevent over-fishing, which has indeed

                               mentioned above. Destructive fishing methods (especially for reef fish) and over-exploitation of reef
                               fish74 also raise issues of sustainability. This is mostly due to sub-optimal fisheries management,
                               environmental change resulting in increased sea surface temperature, and the estimated high

                               and management of capture fisheries is governed by the Fisheries Law of Maldives. However, the
                               emphasis of the law is mainly on protecting local fishers and the sovereignty of Maldivian waters,
                               with less consideration of fisheries management. Other than two tuna fisheries, there are currently
                               few management measures in place for the local harvesting sector. Some important steps have,
                               however, already been undertaken: a fisheries licensing scheme75 was introduced in 2010, and
                               the Environmental Protection and Conservation Act contains provisions to limit fishing for the

                         Overfishing of reef fish is a risk to the sustainability of the tuna fisheries as well as tourism. The
                         sustainability of reef fish is threatened by three factors: (1) The tuna fishery in Maldives is heavily
                         dependent on the coral reefs for bait. For every 7-10 kg of tuna caught, a kilogram of live bait is
                         required, suggesting a bait conversion ratio of 8:1 on average76 ; (2) anecdotal evidence identifies
                         negative impacts of bait fishing on the ecosystem due to removal of juvenile reef fish and on
                         physical environment due to anchoring pole-and-line boats in coral areas; and (3) demand for
                         reef fish has increased threefold77 in the last 15 years, with the increasing demand coming from
                         tourist resorts and export industry. While there are no reliable statistics to validate over-fishing of
                         reef fisheries, if overfished the health of the coral reef ecosystem (a major touristic attraction) can
                         be significantly affected. If unchecked, there is a high potential of over-fishing, which could result
                         in exhausting of stocks as experienced for giant clam fishery in 199078 and the near collapse of
                         sea cucumber fishery in 1997. Fishery bans were imposed on black coral, giant clams in 1991,

                         further vulnerable due to dependency of reproduction on environmental conditions. Similarly, tuna

                         In light of declining trends in the capture fisheries, marine aquaculture is nascent in Maldives and

                         been implementing pilot aquaculture projects for a decade with pearl oysters, Maldivian clownfish,
                         and brown marbled groupers. A private aquaculture farm is also producing sea cucumbers,

                   development of aquaculture is however hindered by limited availability of financing and technology.
                   Operators are also expressing the need to better define the legal and policy framework to clarify
                   the business environment, develop the value-chains and facilitate longer-term investments and
                   research.


                   Agriculture
                   Maldives produces less than an estimated 10 percent of its food requirements, reaching self-
                   sufficiency in fish only. All other staples are imported (Figure 55). As a result, food items account
                   for 21 percent of imports81 . Food imports are required not only to meet domestic food demand
                   for the Maldivian people but are also essential to cater to the tourism industry in Maldives. Outside
                   of Malé, fishing and subsistence agriculture are the main sources of food security and livelihoods
                   for the vast majority of the people. Except for coconut and fresh tuna, 90 percent of all food items
                   are imported.


                   Food security concerns have revitalized interest in the development of the local agriculture
                   production. Import dependency, limited storage facilities and ad hoc distribution pose food
                   security risks. In response to the recent food and fuel crises, Maldives has integrated food security
                   considerations into national planning. It has removed tariffs on imported food items, agricultural
                   inputs and fuel, and is looking for ways to intensify and diversify agriculture and fisheries. The
                   government is working with international agencies and private-sector partners to develop
                   agriculture by introducing new and innovative techniques and technology to strengthen the
                   contribution of farming to rural development.


                   Agriculture is a relatively minor activity in Maldives and has contributed only marginally to long-
                   term growth. Agriculture accounts for 1.7 percent of GDP (even though its value has grown in real
                   terms over the past 20 years). Agriculture has traditionally been undertaken as subsistence crops
                   in 12 atolls, and only recently higher volume production has been developed (Figure 56).


                   Maldives total land area is around 30,000 hectares of which 4,000 hectares are estimated to be
                   arable. In 2013, approximately 50 islands large enough to support commercial agriculture activity
                   had been leased for agricultural production, spanning a total area of about 1,300 hectares.
                   Bananas, coconuts, fresh fruits and vegetables (papaya, eggplant, melons, pineapple and chilies)
                   are the main commercial crops produced locally in Maldives.

                        There are however, a number of opportunities to capitalize on agriculture for local income growth.
                        Though no official data exist, the linkages between local agricultural production and the tourism
                        industry are still limited. Anecdotal evidence suggests that concerns on volume, quality and reliability
                        of local production significantly reduce the incentives for resorts to source agricultural produce
                        locally, in favor of imports. In spite of that, market participants from both supply and demand
                        consider that there may be potential to further and more systematically exploit comparative local
                        advantage in the production of various fruits and vegetables to cater to the resorts (see section on
                        tourism). Such an emphasis may also have the added benefit of increasing women’s employment,
                        since agriculture has a predominantly female labor force (women represent 60 percent of total
                        employment in agriculture). Currently, mostly bananas, melons, papaya are produced locally for
                        resorts but it may be worthwhile to analyze more systematically what other high-value fruits and
                        vegetable are suitable for cultivation.


                        In addition to broadening production choices and testing cultivation feasibility of a larger pool of
                        fruits and vegetables, the feasibility of low-cost smallholder greenhouse technologies combined
                        with household based-irrigation/ ‘fertigation’82 systems could be explored. Producer groups or
                        cooperatives of smallholders could help to bundle extension and marketing/ branding support,
                        including the operating of local collection, grading, cooling and storage facilities, as well as

                        Structural constraints
                        The geography and population dispersion in Maldives creates a unique set of structural constraints,

                        to external shocks. In fact, the volatility of its GDP growth is among the highest of all countries in
                        the world (Box 3). Similarly, Maldives has a narrow economic base (tourism and fisheries), and the
                        small size of the economy limits its ability to sustainably develop local production of other goods
                        or services, enhancing its reliance on imports. While the tourism resort industry is able to access

                           faces the choice whether to address the challenge of the high cost of service delivery through
                           consolidation of population closer to Malé or through improving services and connectivity to
                           populations at their current locations. Each choice will generate different demands on public
                           services such as health, education and infrastructure, and will require a strengthening public
                           investment management capacity.

5. Constraints to growth and shared prosperity (Contd.)




                    Box 4. Small states challenges
                    More than 40 countries have a population under 1.5 million, out of which 26 are small island states.
                    These countries vary greatly in their level of development and the size of their economies. They
                    are also spread out geographically, with most of them clustered in the Caribbean, the Pacific and
                    in Africa. Despite their diversity, these countries share a common set of development challenges.


                    Size
                    Vulnerability to economic shocks and income volatility. Because of the small size of their
                    economies, growth strategies in small states rely on foreign markets. A high degree of openness
                    however means that they are heavily exposed to external shocks in global markets. Moreover, their
                    narrow resource base and small domestic markets prevent small economies from diversifying
                    into a wide range of activities, making them more vulnerable to terms of trade shocks. When one
                    dominant activity declines, it has an impact throughout the economy, exposing the population
                    to income volatility that can create additional hardships as the poorest are less able to weather
                    shocks to their incomes. Government revenues are also volatile because they rely more heavily
                    on taxing imports as a source of revenue. As tariffs are reduced, so is the government’s income.


                    Limited capacity. Because of their size, small states are traditionally face challenges in training
                    and retaining the right skills in the public sector. They also tend to have larger public sectors
                    than other countries. In some states, a widely scattered population adds to the challenge. Small
                    states also lack sufficient institutional capacity to participate fully in international fora, which can
                    profoundly affect their economies.


                    Difficulty accessing external capital. Access to global capital markets is important for small states,
                    and is one way to compensate for adverse shocks and income volatility. But private markets tend
                    to see small states as more risky than larger countries, so spreads are higher and market access
                    is more difficult.


                    Geography
                    Limited competitiveness. Three out of four of developing small states are islands or widely
                    dispersed multi-island states; others are land-locked, and some are located far from major
                    markets. Their remoteness and isolation make it difficult and costly for these states to access
                    world markets to compensate for small domestic markets — a situation that increases the cost of
                    intermediated inputs and imports and prevents efficiency and innovation. Domestic competition
                    is also limited, which hampers successful development.

                                  Susceptibility to natural disasters and climate change. Most small states are vulnerable
                                  to climate-change-related impacts and natural disasters such as hurricanes, cyclones,
                                  droughts, and volcanic eruptions that typically affect an entire population and economy. The
                                  impact on the government’s finances can be overwhelming, limiting a country’s ability to
                                  build cushions for development programs and future needs.


                                  A combination of a narrow production of export base combined with a vulnerability to shocks
                                  can to lead to persistent fiscal and external imbalances and high levels of debt. Indeed,
                                  among the 20 countries with the highest levels of public debt relative to GDP, small island
                                  states account for 10 countries, and other small states for another three.

                            Meanwhile, there has been a steady migration of smaller to larger islands, in particular to the Malé
                            City area. Internal migration has happened for a long time, often in response to natural disasters,
                            including the 2004 tsunami, the difference in the cost of living (the high cost of food and other
                            goods and services in the atolls compared to Malé),86 quality of service delivery, and economic
                            opportunities. Recent data shows a net decline of population in many small islands; indeed, all
                            islands that lost population between 2006 and 2014 had a population below 3,000 in 2006 (Figure
                            58). During that period Malé and Hulhumalé saw increases in population of 37 percent (by 34,524)
                            and 450 percent (by 12,903), respectively (see also section on Poverty).

                         in the World Bank’s Doing Business ranking (out of 189 economies ranked). This ranking was two

                         ∫	 Competition law and industrial property law are missing in Maldives. These are key elements

                            investors. The absence of these laws likely undermines the ability of Maldives to attract and
                            retain investment beyond tourism.

                         economic diversification through foreign and local investment, its ability to attract FDI into other
                         industries or sectors will likely be affected by investment climate challenges.

                               coincide on the view that investment climate shortcomings have had a major negative impact on entrepreneurship in Maldives.
                               However, the lack of statistics including recent business surveys significantly limit the ability to substantiate these views.

5. Constraints to growth and shared prosperity (Contd.)



                          Recent events have the potential to undermine the confidence of foreign investors on Maldives
                          and reduce its competitiveness as a long-term investment destination in favor of jurisdictions that
                          can provide a higher degree of certainty to foreign investors. A recent survey of global investors
                          identified the main factors that drive selection of investment destinations. After macroeconomic
                          stability, the second most important factor for global investors97 when selecting an investment
                          destination is political risk98. Recent events in Maldives – including civil disturbances in Malé;,a
                          high-profile dispute related to a contract for investment in the international airport, and anecdotal
                          evidence reported in international media of radicalization and urban violence – have the potential
                          to undermine the attractiveness of Maldives to foreign investments, including PPPs.

Credit growth
has recently been             And some sectors of the economy are more affected than others. As discussed above, while
driven by lending             70 percent of manufacturing firms surveyed reportedly have difficulties accessing bank credit,
to real estate                this proportion is much lower for other sectors such as construction (50 percent) and trade (32
and commerce,

substantially since           bank loans (4 percent for fisheries, 2 percent for manufacturing and 0.1 percent for agriculture).
2007                          Moreover, credit growth has recently been driven by lending to real estate and commerce, while
                              credit to tradable sectors has decreased substantially since 2007 (Figures 64 and 65). A breakdown
                              of banks’ portfolios by size of the borrower is not available, but anecdotal evidence suggests that
                              large enterprises (both public and private) enjoy easier access to bank credit than SMEs and small
                              entrepreneurs.

                         to help bridge the disadvantage women face in accessing credit. For instance, in 2011 only one-
                         third of the Bank of Maldives borrowers for development schemes or loans and advances were
                         women.102 In response to the lack of access to finance for entrepreneurs overall in Maldives, the
                         government had put in place a program to provide financing to young entrepreneurs. The program
                         (GETSET) considered the provision of non-collateralized loans with subsidized interest rates. While
                         the ultimate objective of the program (enhancing access to finance for entrepreneurs) is laudable,
                         it does not address the shortcomings limiting the adequate functioning of the financial sector
                         and thus does not represent a lasting or sustainable solution to the needs of enterprises and
                         entrepreneurs. On the contrary, concessional directed lending programs often aggravate access
                         to finance deficiencies by helping erode the credit culture in the population, reducing incentives
                         for established commercial lenders to innovate, and crowding out the financial sector by creating
                         dependence of entrepreneurs on subsidized interest rates.

                        Sustainable enhancement of access to finance in Maldives will require the development and
                        implementation of a strategy for financial sector development that addresses the shortcomings
                        faced by the sector. The factors limiting the willingness and ability of financial intermediaries to
                        provide credit on a sustainable and fair basis to the various sectors of the private sector are wide-
                        ranging. Included in Table 2 is a list of shortcomings that have been identified in the past103 that
                        illustrate the range of challenges facing the sector, including deficiencies in the legal framework
                        governing credit activities, shortcomings in credit infrastructure and underdeveloped financial
                        institutions. However, this list is not exhaustive and additional factors may be at play. Enhanced

                        will be needed in order to further identify obstacles and opportunities, as well as to prioritize

                        Public-sector management suffers from inefficiencies. The public sector plays an important role
                        in Maldives’ overall economic model in redistributing some of the rents generated by the resort
                        sector to the rest of the population. This is done both through transfers and directly in the form
                        of relatively large public employment in both civil administration and state-owned enterprises.
                        In both cases there are significant inefficiencies that undermine both the effectiveness of the

                       regulation. With civil service skewed towards relatively young workers, its effectiveness is far lower
                       than what might be expected of a middle-income country. Public financial management suffers
                       from inadequate accounting and poor cost controls.


                       The unsettled political and institutional framework impairs the state’s effectiveness. Maldives has
                       been undergoing a contentious political transition for the past 10 years. The 2008 Constitution
                       created an extensive set of governance institutions and confrontational elections characterized
                       by interference of state bodies that has undermined credibility. Branches of government and
                       independent commissions are frequently in conflict, reflecting the interests of individuals in what
                       is a sharply divided polity. The lack of political and institutional settlement diverts the attention
                       of the state from carrying out public-sector functions and prompts decision-making driven to an
                       unusual degree by short-term political issues.

fundamental gaps       This has led in particular to weak rule of law. Maldives’ legal system is based on several foundations,

                       and increase jobs for young people. The country ranked only 103rd in the Human Development
                       Index for 2014, which is low for a middle-income country approaching $9,900 GNI per capita.


                       Maldives has performed well in providing access to primary and lower secondary education, but
                       there is room for improvement. The primary gross enrollment rate is 104 percent and the primary
                       net enrollment rate 99 percent. The lower secondary gross enrollment rate is 107 percent (Figure
                       66), while the lower secondary net rate is 82 percent. This suggests that, while participation in
                       primary and lower secondary education is high, there is considerable grade repetition and early/
                       late entry, especially in lower secondary education. The country needs to improve the internal
                       efficiency of the education system.

                                 The country lags sharply behind in education attainment at the higher secondary level. The
                                 gross higher secondary net enrollment rate is about 35 percent (Figure 67). This is very low by
                                 international standards. The average higher secondary gross enrollment rate for middle-income
                                 countries is 61 percent, and for upper middle-income countries 76 percent. The main reason for
                                 the low enrollment in higher secondary education in Maldives is the limited number of schools that
                                 offered grades 11-12 until recently, although almost each atoll has at least one school providing
                                 higher secondary education. The government has now expanded this number to 51 schools: three
                                 schools in Malé and 48 schools in the atolls (Figure 67). Many of these schools are over-crowded
                                 and congested and require more facilities and equipment. In addition, higher secondary schools
                                 require greater management and leadership capability, and the professional development of
                                 teachers. At present, the higher secondary school system relies heavily on human resources from

                                 Higher education participation is extremely low for a middle-income country. The gross higher
                                 education enrollment rate is only about 6 percent in Maldives, (Figure 67) whereas the gross
                                 higher education enrollment rate for middle-income countries is around 30 percent. The low
                                 proportion of Maldivians with higher education qualifications means that the country lacks
                                 sufficient professionals, managers and technical experts to support economic growth and social
                                 development. The main reasons for the low enrollment in higher education are: (1) the small
                                 number of students completing higher secondary education and moving onto higher education;

                              and (2) limited access to higher education in the country. Higher education is mainly provided
                              by Maldives National University (MNU) and about seven private higher education institutions.
                              However, over 85 percent of enrollment in these private higher education institutions is actually in
                              pre-degree level diploma and certificate programs. A considerable proportion of enrollment in the
                              MNU, too, is in pre-degree level qualifications.

                              The quality of education at all levels is a major challenge facing Maldives, both in terms of inputs

                              primary and lower secondary education are weak. There are also substantial regional disparities
                              (Figure 69). Learning outcomes are considerably higher in Malé than in the atolls, especially in a
                              subject such as English language, which is vitally important for employment in a tourism-based
                              economy. The low levels of cognitive skills results in poor performance of students at national
                              examinations. For instance, at the General Certificate of Examinations (GCE O/L) only about 40
                              percent students pass in five subjects, while just 19 percent students pass in eight subjects.

                          Maldives lacks a comprehensive, effective and efficient system of social protection. Maldives’
                          safety net programs have undertaken major changes since the government’s Strategic Action
                          Plan 2009-2013 was drawn up.107 While tremendous progress has been made towards adding
                          new programs and expanding coverage of existing ones, Maldives is still far from its policy goal
                          of transforming fragmented social safety net programs into a comprehensive social protection
Maldives lacks a          system. Universal subsidies on food and electricity and universal health insurance represent
comprehensive,            the bulk of social expenditure together with social pension (Old Age Basic Pension) and Senior

                          The increase in spending on universal subsidies is a challenge to shared prosperity and poverty

Poor targeting and        boosting shared prosperity has been lackluster. While there is no recent poverty data to confirm this

                                 Similarly, the generosity of the pension system has exacerbated inter-generational equity issues
                                 and potentially contributed to increase distortions on the labor market. In particular, increasing

6. Opportunities and trade-offs for sustainable
poverty reduction and shared prosperity
                        The Systematic Country Diagnostic aims to identify the most important opportunities and
                        obstacles to poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Maldives. Based on evidence presented
                        thus far and analysis conducted as part of this Systematic Country Diagnostic, this section creates
                        a framework to identify the highest priority areas for reform and lays out a potential path forward
                        for shared and sustainable growth and poverty reduction in Maldives.


                        The identification of the priorities areas is the result of a three-step process. First, during the
                        concept stage, hypotheses on the functioning of Maldives’ development model and on the drivers
                        of its vulnerabilities were formulated, and knowledge gaps identified. Second, during the SCD
                        development stage, these hypotheses were confirmed by additional analysis and knowledge gaps
                        filled whenever feasible under the given timeline. Third, consultations with local stakeholders were
                        used to further validate hypotheses and analysis (Annex 2).


                        Priority area 1: Enhancing opportunities for the local population to benefit from existing industries.
                        Enhancing these opportunities would contribute to poverty reduction and shared prosperity.

                        to better jobs. These priorities are discussed below.


                        Priority area 3: Improving efficiency and efficacy of public resource management and reducing
                        macro fiscal risk. Addressing the challenges identified in this priority area would make the economic
                        model in Maldives more sustainable and resilient to shocks. More directly, better management of
                        public resources would free up space to benefit the poor and increase opportunities for the youth
                        through, for example, better education. The impact of reform of subsidies and the public wage bill
                        would have an immediate and medium-term impact on fiscal sustainability, but they require both
                        careful planning to mitigate the negative impact on the poor and political courage. Improving the
                        preparedness for disasters and climate change would have a medium- to long-term impact.

                           islands, where poverty levels are higher.


                        Third: Enabling local employment. Tourism is a large and growing source of jobs. According to the
                        census, tourism generated 28,000 jobs in 2014, only 40 percent of which are filled by Maldivian staff.

which are filled by     of staff to be Maldivian, the tourism industry consistently reports significant difficulties finding and

                            technical graduates while making it easier for the tourism sector to find qualified local staff.

                         the volume of catch. Currently, most of Maldives fisheries operate under free and open-access
                         conditions. The sector’s growth is based largely on traditional policy goals of maximizing
                         production through increased fish landings, supported by improved technology that can lead to
                         increased fishing yields. Global experience shows, however, that this approach usually results in

                                 segments of the population, and to limit losses of utility providers. Such strategy would aim at:

                                 (2) reducing expenditure on overseas treatment through negotiation of close-ended package
                                 rates with providers; and (3) improving attention to early detection and secondary prevention of
                                 chronic diseases at the primary care level, which will be helpful in slowing down disease progress
                                 and delaying the occurrence of complications. Substantial capacity building of the National Social

                                 such as lack of coherence between public sector and SOE investment plans. Procurement by SOEs
                                 could be made more transparent to assess whether it delivers enough value for money. As SOEs
                                 play a key role in many utility sectors (e.g., electricity, water and waste management), improvement
                                 in their performance could also help alleviate some of the environmental constraints on growth.

                             tourists from other parts of the world and by attracting more tourists to its guest houses and
                             other offerings outside resorts. Accessing different markets that are not perfectly synchronized
                             could reduce the current volatility of tourist arrivals. The added benefit is the guest-house
                             tourism is more inclusive for the local population (Priority area 1).
                          ∫	 Reducing reliance on imported fuel. Maldives is interested in introducing solar power to replace
                             imported diesel. With diesel imports accounting for around 20 percent of total merchandise

     imports, this could have a significant effect on vulnerability to commodity price fluctuations.
     Installing and maintaining solar panels could have the added benefit of providing local
     employment for engineers. It should be noted that existing suppliers of diesel-based power
     may initially try to hinder efforts to switch to solar energy until they make the switch themselves.
∫	 Reforming in public expenditure. Reforms in the system of wages, subsidies and transfers
   would make the budget more flexible to deal with revenue shocks without continuously
   increasing public debt. Moreover, it could reduce overconsumption of subsidized electricity
   and certain imported goods, which would reduce external exposure as well. However, this type
   of reform may be politically difficult, and will need a social safety net (such as targeted cash
   transfers) to protect the poorest.
∫	 Decreasing risk of debt portfolio. As Maldives becomes richer, concessional external debt
   may become less available. Public domestic debt has a very short maturity, and is subject to
   refinancing and interest risk.134 Extending the maturity profile would reduce the risk but could
   increase the cost of debt. There are natural buyers of longer-term public debt, such as pension
   funds and insurance companies. Establishing a yield curve beyond one year could also help the
   financial market better price risk, and it could deepen the financial market and make it easier
   for local SMEs to obtain credit.
∫	 Improving public sector governance and planning capacity. Improvements in public financial
   management would lead to more credible budgets, expenditure controls, commitment to
   decreasing public debt and better selection and planning of investment projects. Improvement
   in planning capacity is needed to deal with the challenges of natural resource management,
   and to address the dilemma between consolidating the population closer to Malé and improving
   services and connectivity to populations at their current locations, and to plan the associated
   infrastructure needs.
∫	 Increasing policy space. The low level of usable foreign exchange reserves leaves little space
   to manage the exchange rate and import essential goods. Mitigating this lack of space is
   the existence of a parallel market with sufficient quantities of foreign exchange. The country
   appears to have access to ad-hoc support from partners, but more formalized access to a
   credit line would reduce macroeconomic uncertainty. Fiscal space can be built up by reducing
   the budget deficit and reducing the level of public debt. As a dispersed island state with a
   commitment to provide social services to remote atolls, Maldives faces limits to how much
   expenditure savings can be made but, as explained in the previous section, there appears
   to be scope for efficiency gains. On the other side of the balance, there may be scope for
   increased revenue, including income tax revenue or a wealth tax, ideally from sources that are
   less correlated with fluctuations in tourism.




134	 In the current situation of apparent excess liquidity in the financial market and the absence of good investment opportunities in the
     private sector, this risk seems to be low. Under the “tap” system for Treasury bills, which fixes interest rates, interest rate risk is also
     low.

Annex 1. Poverty measurement in Maldives
Understanding of poverty issues in Maldives is limited by data quality and comparability constraints and by pitfalls in the
current poverty measurement framework.

Data limitations
The primary concern relates to data quality and comparability. The first household survey in Maldives (Vulnerability and
Poverty Analysis - VPA) was conducted in 1998/99, with a panel followup in 2003/04. The VPA survey series was then
replaced by Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) – mostly focused on household budget measurement –
which was implemented in 2003/04 and 2009/10. Differences in instruments and sample design do not permit comparison
between the results obtained from VPA and HIES surveys. Moreover, differences in survey instruments and possibly in data
quality within the two HIES rounds further limits the ability to profile the evolution of poverty in Maldives.

Poverty measurement framework
The most widespread poverty indicator is the share of individuals whose per capita consumption falls below the official
poverty line. This indicator is usually defined in the literature as headcount index and it is a measure of the incidence of
poverty. Antecedent to computing the headcount index are two steps: defining a welfare aggregate, e.g. the dimension with
respect to which we define the minimally acceptable standard of living; and establishing a minimum acceptable standard of
that indicator to separate the poor from the non-poor (the poverty line).

Maldives lacks an official and unique national poverty line. Since the first household survey in 1997/98, poverty measurement
has relied on the use of several relative poverty lines, defined in terms of median or a fraction of median consumption of the
population living in the atolls, excluding the capital Malé. No efforts had so far been made to assess which of these poverty
lines actually corresponds to a reasonable minimum threshold by the standards of living prevailing in Maldives.

The consumption aggregate is the sum of the consumption expenditures of all food and non-food items of each household.
Due to data limitations, the consumption aggregate does not include spending in durables and the flow of services from
the primary dwelling (usually intended as rent for tenants, and imputed rent for home owners). The validity of official
poverty profiles is severely hindered by the lack of any adjustment of the consumption aggregate for spatial differences
in living costs. The lack of spatial price adjustment represents a fundamental flaw of the current poverty measurement
methodology, especially given the unequal distribution of economic opportunities throughout the Maldivian archipelago,
relevance of transport costs and differential access to goods and services between the capital area Malé and other atolls.

Poverty methodology adopted for the SCD
In order to improve the comparability of the two HIES surveys, and to overcome the shortfalls of the official poverty
methodology, a new consumption aggregate and a new poverty line have been estimated.

The new consumption aggregate is defined as the sum of all food and non-food household expenditures, excluding housing,
lumpy expenditures (purchase of vehicles, major tools and equipment, household appliances, durables, furniture), and rare
expenditures (jewelry, hay, wedding and parties). The consumption aggregate so defined is then divided by the household
size, defined as the sum of family members and paying guests. To take into account the spatial price differences, the
consumption aggregate is deflated using regional food poverty lines.




118
                                                                                           Maldives Systematic Country Diagnostic




Using the Cost of Basic Needs approach and HIES 2009-10 data, the national poverty line has been estimated at MVR
787.5. This value is equivalent to the minimum necessary to consume 1,826 Kilocalories per capita per day plus a non-
food allowance equal to the average non-food expenditure of households with food expenditure just enough to reach the
minimum caloric requirement.

The World Bank uses as extreme poverty line $1.25 a day in 2005 PPP terms, which represents the mean of the poverty
lines found in the poorest 15 countries ranked by per capita consumption among 88 surveyed countries over the period
1990-2005 (Ravallion, Chen and Sangraula, 2009). Maldives’ national poverty line is about $1.90 a day in 2005 PPP. Other
commonly used poverty lines for international comparisons across middle-income countries are $2 and $2.50 a day in 2005
PPP, which correspond, in turn, to MVR 821.3 and MVR 1,034.2 a month in 2010 prices. In addition to the national poverty
line, the SCD use the international poverty lines for cross-country comparisons.

The depth and severity of poverty
Although the headcount index is the most widespread measure of poverty, it has a serious shortcoming in that it does not
take into account the intensity of poverty, i.e. how far from the poverty line the poor are. A measure of poverty that overcomes
this problem is the poverty gap index. The poverty gap index is the average shortfall of the total population from the poverty
line as a share measured as a percentage of the poverty line itself, and it defines the depth of poverty. The squared poverty
gap gives a higher weight on households furthest away from the poverty line and it is a measure of the severity of poverty.
Both of these measures will complement the analysis of headcount poverty in the context of the SCD.

Shared prosperity
The World Bank has adopted two new targets to make explicit its goal of “A world free of poverty.” The two targets are:
ending extreme poverty by 2030 and promoting shared prosperity. Sustainability is an overarching priority in the pursuit of
these goals: achieving them requires promoting environmental, social, and fiscal sustainability. The emphasis on reducing
extreme poverty is in line with the commitment to halve extreme poverty enshrined in the first target of the Millennium
Development Goals, which were adopted globally in 2000. Shared prosperity focuses explicitly on the less well off more
broadly. Promoting shared prosperity is defined as maximizing income (or consumption) growth for the bottom 40 percent
of the population. In Maldives, the consumption cut-off line for the bottom 40 percent (the threshold below which the
poorest 40 percent of population falls) in 2010 is 1,266 MVR a month, or $3.06 a day in 2005 PPP.

Annex 2. Summary of SCD consultations
SUMMARY OF SCD CONSULTATIONS IN MALDIVES
APRIL 27 – 30, 2015

OVERVIEW
A series of seven consultations involving nearly 100 participants was carried out as part of the preparation of this Systematic
Country Diagnostic in Malé. Participants were drawn from government agencies, civil society organizations, youth groups,
non-governmental organizations, student bodies, academia, development partner, and the private sector to ensure that
diverse perspectives were represented.


The consultations were arranged under four thematic groups: (1) Opportunities for private-sector development and economic
diversification; (2) Improving government delivery performance; (3) Addressing social risks; and (4) Tackling environmental
vulnerability. In all sessions, the WBG highlighted the key messages that were emerging in the preparation of the Systematic
County Diagnostic for Maldives and presented a broad overview of issues that were considered important to be addressed.
The consultation process also included two technical meetings in Malé with representatives of the Government of Maldives.
These meetings were used as a means of further understanding the current government strategy and as an opportunity to
engage with the government team that was preparing the National Development Strategy.


Three objectives guided the consultation process:

∫	 Obtaining perspectives from stakeholders on key economic, social and environmental challenges facing Maldives.

∫	 Presenting an overview of the key findings of the SCD and validating the data used.

∫	 Sharpening key messages in the SCD and identifying any new trends that were emerging .

Participants broadly agreed with the key areas identified as priorities facing Maldives and the main thrust of the SCD in
this context. Tourism and fisheries remain the two main engines of growth. Participants agreed that while tourism has
remained largely an enclave industry, fisheries has unrealized potential. Key vulnerabilities were also highlighted. They
included: (1) a weak macro fiscal environment (largely linked to unsustainable cost of service provision to a small and
dispersed population, coupled with inefficiencies in government expenditures); (2) social trends, (youth unemployment
especially among women); (3) environmental vulnerabilities, (related to the lack of institutional capacity to adequately
manage natural resources, deficiencies in waste, sewerage and management leading to pollution, and lower prioritization
of environmental issues in government policies); and (4) governance issues. The following report presents recurring points
noted during consultations.

1.	Opportunities for private-sector development and economic diversification
  Agriculture
  Increasing linkages between agriculture SMEs and high-value sectors such as tourism were described as important
  income-generating activities for island communities. Agriculture was identified as a sector that could have significant
  impact on promoting shared prosperity. Participants explained that although demand for locally sourced produce exists
  in the tourism industry (as its cheaper and involves less wastage), the lack of a single aggregated market and high
  transportation costs make imports more feasible for resorts. On the supply side, the lack of extension services and
  limited willingness of Maldivians famers to cooperate on decisions related to the type of produce to grow on the limited
  land were also cited as key obstacles for the growth of agricultural SMEs.


  The establishment of cooperative societies on islands have seen mixed results. Participants highlighted several
  instances where the establishment of cooperatives has led to significant income generation for farmers with value-
  added agricultural produce being sold resorts. However, there have also been several instances where cooperatives
  failed due to the inability of farmers to reach consensus on the type of crops to be grown and the manner in which scarce
  resources (water and land) were to be utilized. Some participants expressed concern that the lessons learned from
  previous failed attempts were not being analyzed and used in the implementation of new schemes. Participants further
  explained that the lack of quality extension services and access to finance were further obstacles to the development
  of agriculture in Maldives.


  Fisheries
  While investment in the fisheries sector is lucrative, low budget allocations, low reliance on technology and the lack of
  data sharing has impeded growth in this subsector. Participants highlighted the fact that the fisheries sector has been
  a source of steady income (with earnings in excess of $1,000/month per fisherman). However, declining revenues in
  the last five years was cited as a cause for concern. Participants pointed out that increased national budget allocations
  for the development of the sector would promote opportunities for substantially scaling up the fisheries industry. Low
  cooperation among fishermen to identify prime fishing sites, limited knowledge of and low use of technology, and
  unreliable data (specifically on harvesting trends) were identified as other issues impeding growth in the sector. The
  creation of better linkages with resorts was also cited as a possible step towards increasing revenues and expanding
  the fisheries industry. Labor regulations that prevented the use of migrant workers for harvesting of fish was cited as a
  possible factor in allowing all income generated by the industry to benefit Maldivians directly.

      Access to finance
      A conservative lending culture is impeding SME growth. Participants explained that access to finance was severely
      constrained for SMEs. Most SMEs (especially new ventures) do not have sufficient collateral to obtain loans and the lack
      of tailored financial products and instruments impede capital requirements for their expansion.. Loans for agriculture, in
      comparison, were cited as more easily obtained. However, as sufficient monitoring and evaluation was not being carried
      out in the sector, some loans were being used for private consumption and not for agricultural expansion. Participants
      also explained that conducting a needs assessment to identify the specific financial instruments required for SME
      development is an important first step to increase access to finance and also reduce the cost of finance.


2.	Improving government delivery performance
      Issues concerning weak governance and the lack of strong public institutions were cited as key concerns for Maldivians
      at present. While participants were satisfied with overall government service provision, improving both the standard
      of education (from early childhood education to tertiary and vocational education) and health facilities was cited as
      important. Participants explained that the absence of sufficient checks and balances between the key arms of state, the
      perceived limited independence of the Judiciary, and low levels of transparency and accountability in the administration
      resulted in a weak institutional framework. This undermined public trust in the institutional framework and also led to
      the erosion of investor confidence. Participants cited examples such as bringing the Environment Protection Agency
      under the purview of the Ministry of Tourism (thus limiting the autonomy of the agency), the reversal of policies, and
      the lack of transparency in the granting of students loans and SME development loans as key instances where the
      governance mechanism had failed. Participants also described political instability as a major impediment in tackling
      key issues involving solid and liquid waste management, urban development and climate change resilience. Additionally
      participants indicated that the absence of a transparent, open and safe space for dialogue between public- and
      private-sector stakeholders and the lack of a participatory approach to policy making as key obstacles to improving the
      governance framework within Maldives.


3.	Addressing social risks
      Youth unemployment
      Resolving issues related to youth, such as unemployment and skills development, was consistently cited as a key priority
      by participants at all four sessions. Employers and employees provided contradictory viewpoints as to why unemployment
      continued to a significant issue. Youth unemployment was attributed several factors by employers. Perceptions of poor
      work ethic among Maldivian youth, the inability to obtain the required skill sets (instances of difficulties in finding
      Maldivians with an adequate command of English were highlighted) and practical difficulties (such as the provision of
      transport to island communities to work in resorts) were key reasons cited by employers. Employees highlighted the bias
      against the hiring of Maldivians by Maldivians (specifically in the tourism sector for positions beyond a supervisor role and
      in the health sector for nurses), the lack of vocational training opportunities for employment as electricians, plumbers
      and carpenters (where significant labor demand exists), and the lax implementation of labor regulations (specifying

  that half of employees should be Maldivians) in the tourism sector. Beyond skills, the consultations highlighted that
  youth unemployment stems from a disconnect between the aspirations of an ‘ideal’ job among the current generation
  of youth and their parents on the one hand, and the reality of the kinds of jobs that are available in a small island
  country with limited human capacity. Youth unemployment was cited as the key reason for increased drug abuse and
  the participation of young people in gangs. Current policy initiatives were also cited as being insufficient to address key
  youth issues and required the adoption of a holistic and contextual approach for increased success.


  Intergenerational relations were highlighted as another driver exacerbating youth unemployment. Social norms that
  favor young people continuing to live at home relieve the young of the financial and social pressures to search for jobs.
  Even as affordable housing remains elusive and the size of homes shrinks, multigenerational homes continue to be the
  norm, and continue to provide a financial buffer for unemployed youth. The lack of space and house overcrowding had
  also encouraged many young people to look for a space outside the home in search of an identity. This helped lead to
  the proliferation of gangs and drug use.


  Gender roles
  While the civil law structure in Maldives promotes gender egalitarianism, the consultations revealed that gender norms
  in Maldives are strongly influenced by social dynamics. Participants explained that in the recent years Maldivian society
  has been shifting towards a form of conservatism that has strengthened taboos and social stigmas. This was described
  as having a negative impact on women’s choices to enroll in education and search for jobs. Participants highlighted the
  need for focused policy initiatives to combat the decrease in the number of women seeking employment and disengaging
  from playing an active role in Maldivian society.


4.	Tackling environmental vulnerability
  Efficient usage of land requires the analysis of the efficiency of allocation together with strengthened monitoring and
  evaluation frameworks within institutions. Participants explained that key decisions such as the allocation of islands
  for tourism should be juxtaposed in the context of using such land for the expansion of agriculture. With the inability
  to analyze the extent to which agricultural livelihoods have been lost due to the construction of resorts (especially for
  resorts where construction was not totally completed) owing to the lack of data, due consideration must be given to
  determining what effect future allocations will have in this regard. Although monitoring and evaluation is carried out on
  islands that have been leased out for agriculture, further cost benefit analysis will ensure allocative efficiencies.


  Strong monitoring and evaluation frameworks are required to ensure the sustainable use of natural resources. Participants
  explained that while tuna fishery is heavily regulated (in line with obligations to the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission) and
  fishing for sharks is banned to prevent over-exploitation, no such protection exists for reef fish. Participants said that
  reef fish such as groupers were possibly over-fished on some reefs, thereby damaging ecosystems. Resource-sharing
  and linked management between the fisheries and tourism sectors (specifically in the sustainable management of the
  reef fish population) were also highlighted as being vital.




                                                                                                                           123
5.	Recommendations
      Future government strategies must incorporate integrated planning encompassing all sectors. Participants identified
      the lack of integrated planning (combining different sectors) as being a key obstacle for the successful implementation
      of new initiatives undertaken by the government. Integrated planning was seen as key means of ensuring success in
      high-growth sectors, such as tourism, which could benefit from increased linkages with the fisheries sector, (where
      the health of coral reefs are directly dependent on sustainable fishing practices). Participants explained that issues
      concerning the disposal of waste and sewerage, access to fresh water and the use of renewable energy sources could
      have been more easily resolved if integrated urban planning was consistently incorporated into government policy
      initiatives.


      “The failure to equally address both environmental and fiscal challenges could potentially destroy Maldives in the near
      future.”


      While public infrastructure investments remain a priority for government, market-based solutions are required to
      induce behavior change. Public investments, specifically in port and airport infrastructure, were cited as priority to
      combat constraints to international trade. However, increasing social welfare, while ensuring fiscal consolidation, would
      require market-based solutions.


      Improving statistics
      Improving the reliability and consistency of key statistical data was seen as vital for the development of effective policy
      measures. Participants highlighted that critical discrepancies in statistics considerably distorted the policy planning
      process. Vital statistical data, such as income and employment generation in the fisheries and agriculture sectors,
      was described as severely under represented. Data was also described as sparse for various aspects of consumption,
      such as the quantum of public services being consumed by expatriates. Even critical analysis on issues such as youth
      unemployment was hindered by the lack of accurate data on the proportion of unemployed youth. Enacting legislation
      to ensure quality control of statistics was cited as one measure that could lead to accurate statistical data.

      Creation of a consistent consultative process
      The consultative process with both the private sector and civil society should be improved to ensure inclusive and
      sustainable development. Participants explained that private-sector involvement in policy discussions has been
      initiated several times but the outcomes were consistently undermined by political changes that led to the initiation of
      unfeasible plans based on election pledges. Participants also highlighted significant gaps between decisions reached
      by policymakers and technocrats. This led to government manifestos not being aligned with technical plans, resulting in
      changes to existing policy structure when governments changed. The creation of a central focal point for carrying out
      consultations and initiating central planning was also cited as key reform measures that would promote transparency
      in policy decisions and ensure successful collaboration with the private sector.

A snap poll (in the form of a written questionnaire) was also conducted among participants. The questionnaire consisted
of five questions – two on the top three challenges for Maldives (immediately and in the medium-term), one on
possible solutions to these challenges and two on potential steps to be taken immediately and in medium-term on the
government reform agenda. Although the questionnaire drew a 95 percent response rate, the small sample size was
a key drawback for obtaining conclusive results on the overall trend of responses. The exercise provided the means
for obtaining information on issues that participants were reluctant to discuss (such as corruption). It also provided
further assessment of the key thematic areas, verification of response patterns, and enabled the further prioritization
of proposed reform actions to be initiated.

      1	   According to banks interviewed, loans backed by properties take up to 10 years for settlement in case of default.
      2	 Courts ruled in two cases against MFLC, the largest leasing company denying access to enforce claims on the leased assets, against the basic principle
         of leasing, which is based on the ownership of the asset by the leasing company and usually provides for an expedite repossession of the asset in case of
         default.
      3	 Leasing has potential favorable tax treatment over a purchase of equipment. In a true lease, many jurisdictions allow the deduction of the entire amount
         of the monthly payment as an operating expense. This often result into a more favorable tax treatment for investment over the common depreciation of
         equipment in purchases.
      4	   Operations of MFLC, the largest leasing company in Maldives reduced sharply following the negative ruling on their ability to enforce claims on leased assets.
           It is estimated that following the ruling the company’s leasing portfolio decreased by 21 percent, its borrowing by 38 percent, and its net worth by 18 percent.
           Management is using its cash to pay off debt and declare dividends rather than for funding new leases. Its management is now limiting new leasing primarily
           to repeat customers with whom it has been able to sign standard contractual end of term asset transfer options that will reduce risks of loss on the lease
           contracts.
