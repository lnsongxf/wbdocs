                               The Systematic Country Diagnostic:
                       A New World Bank Group Tool for Country Engagement


Under its new approach to working with its country partners, the World Bank Group (WBG) requires the
preparation of a Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) to precede the development of Country Partnership
Frameworks that guide programming. The objective of an SCD is to identify the most critical constraints
and opportunities facing a country in accelerating progress toward the goals of ending extreme poverty
and promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The SCD is expected to produce an objective,
evidence-based and candid assessment of the main challenges facing the country, without limitation to
the areas where the Bank is currently engaged.

Executive summary

1.       Maldives is an island nation scattered in the Indian Ocean comprising 1,190 small coral
islands of which 190 are inhabited by a local population of 341,000. .Maldives’ unique archipelagic
coral island provides the country with an extremely rich and diverse marine ecological system. With
more territorial sea than land, marine resources have played a vital role shaping the contours of economic
development, with nature-based tourism being the key driver of economic growth and fisheries an
important sector of employment for the local population.

2.       Maldives developed a successful high-end tourism sector, whose sizeable rents have been
redistributed to the population to address its development challenges. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
per capita increased from $275 in 1980 to $6,666 in 2013. This growth rate, which averaged 7 percent
between 2002 and 2013, is mainly driven by tourism and non-tradable tourism-related activities. This
impressive track record of economic growth has been supported by capital accumulation through
investment in resorts, and by an increase in the labor force mainly benefiting foreign workers. Fiscal
revenues generated in the tourism sector have been used to address some of the structural development
challenges of Maldives’ economy.

3.       However, Maldives’ development model has not been sufficiently inclusive and its immediate
fiscal, environmental and social sustainability is at stake. Although this economic model based on
tourism-led growth and redistribution of tourism-generated revenues has contributed to improving well-
being of Maldivian population, poverty reduction has been below potential and the level of inequality –
and lack of shared prosperity – remain a major challenge. Moreover, recent political and socio-economic
developments have brought to evidence the inherent vulnerability of Maldives’ development model and
raise immediate concerns about its fiscal, environmental and social sustainability.

4.      This Systematic Country Diagnostic for Maldives aims at identifying the most critical constraints
and opportunities facing the country as it works towards promoting sustainable growth, reducing
poverty and boosting shared prosperity. In addition to serving as a public good for the government, civil
society, research and academic community, and local and international development partners, the
findings of the SCD will be used as key inputs in the preparation of the WBG strategy, the Country
Partnership Framework, which will outline how the Bank Group’s engagement in Maldives can best
contribute towards achieving the twin goals.


Growth and redistribution

5.      Bound by structural constraints and endowed with extraordinary natural assets Maldives
developed a high-end tourism sector, which has resulted in a very high pace of economic growth over
the past three decades. However, its form of tourism-led growth has followed an enclave model, reliant
on imported goods, labor and finance. While tourism accounts for about a third of the country’s GDP, it
only contributes to 16 percent of the employment in the country. Linkages between resorts and local


                                                                                                        8
economy are similarly limited, with very few products and services supplied by local enterprises. The
employment of Maldivian women in the tourism industry faces particular obstacles. Apart from tourism
and fisheries, which is a large employment and export revenue generator, there are few sizeable economic
activities in the country.

6.       The development of the tourism sector in Maldives has created sizeable rents, which, through
taxation and other fiscal means, have been used to address some of the structural development
challenges of Maldives’ economy. In particular, tourism revenues have been used to support job creation
in the public sector, to finance the provision of public services and expand access to primary health and
education facilities beyond the capital area Malé. They also have helped insulate the local economy from
international price fluctuations through a system of universal subsidies on food. The new constitution
introducing democracy in the late 2000s has been accompanied by an increase in the level of
redistribution: (i) the introduction of explicit electricity subsidies; (ii) the introduction of a universal health
insurance scheme; and (iii) an increase in coverage and generosity of pension system.


Poverty reduction and shared prosperity

7.       Poverty incidence in Maldives is substantially in line with that of an upper middle-income
country. According to the latest available Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) collected in
2009/10, the share of population living with less than $1.25 in 2005 PPP a day was 4.9 percent, whereas
the corresponding share using the $2 a day poverty line was 17.02 percent. These figures are very similar
to the average poverty outcomes of upper middle-income countries (UMIC), two of the small Pacific
islands, and neighboring Sri Lanka. Maldives performs better than the other countries in South Asia with
respect to several socio-economic indicators. Maldives ranks first in terms of per-capita GDP and second
only to Sri Lanka based on the Human Development Index ranking.

8.      Over the seven years between 2003 and 2010, poverty declined nationwide but not uniformly
across Maldives’ territory. Poverty declined in the Atolls while it remained stable in the capital area Malé.
The poverty rate is the highest in the Central North and Southern atolls, while the capital area Malé is
home to the largest share of poor individuals. Sustained migration from the atolls to the capital accounts
for most of the diverging poverty trends at the subnational level.

9.      Despite progress, the pace of poverty reduction has been below potential when considering the
fast GDP growth of the Maldivian economy between 2003 and 2010 due to growing inequality. The
growth elasticity of poverty reduction (GEPR) in Maldives of about 1.2 percent is relatively low by
international standards. This is evident in comparison to other countries. For example, while Maldives and
Sri Lanka shared the same growth rate (approximately 4.8 percent a year over the period), poverty
reduction in Maldives was one-third less than experienced in Sri Lanka. 1 Given the slow pace of poverty
reduction, Maldives will be able to reduce extreme poverty under 1 percent by 2040, a much longer period
than upper middle-income countries, and other countries in South Asia. The lack of shared prosperity in

1   Poverty decreased at about 0.5 percent per year in Maldives as opposed to 1.6 percent in Sri Lanka.

                                                                                                                 9
Maldives is the main determinant of the limited impact of growth on poverty reduction. The un-equalizing
impact of growth is further reflected by an increase in the gap between the poorest and richest segments
of the population.

10.      Limited jobs opportunities, especially for low-skilled labor might have played an important role
in limiting contribution of growth to poverty reduction. In particular, the lack of growth in fisheries is an
important determinant of the limited contribution of growth to poverty reduction, especially in the Atolls.
As labor income is the main source of household income for the poor, an inclusive development of the
labor market is key for reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity.


Sustainability

11.      Recent socio-economic and political developments have raised concerns regarding the fiscal,
political, social and environmental sustainability of Maldives’ development model.

Macro and fiscal sustainability
12.      Maldives is highly vulnerable to shocks due to its small size, lack of economic diversification
outside tourism and heavy reliance on imports, while its rigid budget adds more risk. Especially in recent
years, the development model has led to an increasing share of revenue dependent on tourism, while an
increasing share of expenditure has become “rigid.” The lack of macro policy buffers leaves the country
with few instruments to stabilize the economy in the event of a downturn in tourism.

13.      Unless adjustments are made to revenues and expenditures, the current development model
raises immediate fiscal sustainability concerns. At current trends it is projected to lead to ever increasing
levels of public debt and interest payments, even after the fiscal consolidation measures budgeted in
2015. The widening fiscal deficit has forced the country to accumulate more and more domestic debt at
ever higher interest rates. Weaknesses in the Public Financial Management system and management of
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) pose further short-term risks to fiscal sustainability.

Political and institutional risks
14.      As Maldives’ transition to a democratic system is still in progress, powers and relationships
among democratic institutions remain to be settled.. Institutional and political uncertainty constrain the
sustainability of Maldives’ development model moving forward.

Social sustainability and vulnerability
15.      Economic opportunities in Maldives are out of sync with growth and shared prosperity. The
interplay of socio-demographic trends and fiscal constraints adds to the social sustainability challenge of
Maldives’ development model. Particularly vulnerable to these challenges are youth and women.

16.     A growing gap between aspirations and opportunities for socio-economic inclusion contributed
to fostering disenfranchisement among Maldivian youth. Limited education opportunities and skill


                                                                                                          10
endowments challenge youth capacity to realize their aspirations though a productive labor market
engagement. High levels of actual and perceived inequality coupled with a progressive deterioration of
the social contract further contribute to widening youth aspiration gap. State and familial structures
combine to create a situation where youth and their families do not have the incentive to temper youth
aspirations, gain skills or search for jobs, feeding into young people’s limited productive engagement with
the economy and society. Social ills such as gang violence and drug abuse are on the rise, and further
contribute to strengthening the exclusion of “youth at risk” from the social fabric. Moreover, a growing
support of more conservative religious practices among the youth and negative perceptions towards the
tourism industry challenge the inclusiveness and social sustainability of Maldives’ development model.


Environmental vulnerability and sustainability issues
17.     Climate change is major threat in the long run. Climate change could cause annual economic
losses of more than 12 percent of Maldives’ GDP by 2100. Due to rising sea levels, the entire country could
be submerged before the end of the century as 80 percent of land is less than one meter above sea level.
With 42 percent of the population and more than 70 percent of critical infrastructure within 100 meters
of shoreline, this would have dire social and economic consequences, notably for the poorer and most
vulnerable.

18.      There are also short-term threats to environment sustainability. The most pressing issues relate
to shortcomings in the management of natural resources, particularly with regard to sewage and solid
waste management. There is also a growing demand for ground water and rain water as source of fresh
water, which are at high risk due to climate change and are vulnerable to shocks due to the lack of back-
up arrangements. Loss of coral reef due to rising sea temperatures, pollution and damage represents a
threat to the sustainability of the tourism industry and fisheries, and is also compounding the effects of
climate change. Meanwhile, the institutional capacity for managing the country’s natural resources is
relatively weak. The cost of electricity generation through imported diesel in Maldives is the highest in
South Asia, especially in the atolls, while subsidies have led to overconsumption and underinvestment in
renewable sources of energy.

Opportunities for growth

Tourism
19.      Tourism is the most important industry in Maldives, but the linkages with the local economy
are limited. Although Maldives has managed to position itself as a high-end destination, the sustainability
of such premium cannot be taken for granted and an increase in the number of hotels may lead to lower
profitability in the tourism sector. Governance shortcomings in the current model for allocation of resort
leases may be hampering the development of tourism and preventing the country from maximizing
benefits and enhancing inclusive growth, while concerns over the investment climate and political risk
may undermine the ability of Maldives to attract reputable investors in the future. The industry has
developed as an enclave, with limited positive spillovers to the local communities.



                                                                                                        11
20.     A more inclusive industry may hold the key to shared prosperity in the country. Better linkages
between the resorts and the local enterprises may help to leverage tourism growth for development of
other tradable sectors. Tourism is a large and rapidly growing source of jobs, but most of them are not
seized by local population due to a host of factors, including: (1) reservation wage that is too high for
unskilled jobs; (2) lack of skills for technical and managerial jobs; (3) social norms; and (4) lack of adequate
transport. A nascent segment of community-based tourism, such as locally owned guesthouses, may
represent a valuable option for diversification and inclusive growth through integration with local
communities. Growth in this segment has some limitations and risks. There are still unrealized
opportunities for linkages between tourism and local providers of fish and agriculture products, while
opportunities for service-provision linkages are more limited, as many resorts already own and operate
their support services and ancillary functions.

Fisheries
21.      The fisheries sector is a critical contributing sector for the country’s national economy and in
almost all of the country’s inhabited islands. The sector traditionally provides employment, exports and
food security. Environmentally friendly fishing methods have enhanced Maldives’ ability to access
premium markets. Marine aquaculture is nascent in Maldives, supported by government pilot aquaculture
projects and a private aquaculture farm This can be an important source of economic growth and
diversification, poverty alleviation and foreign exchange earnings, but the future development of
aquaculture is hindered by the limited availability of financing and technology and a lack of clarity on the
legal and policy framework.

22.     The sustainability of fisheries is jeopardized by inadequate fisheries management and
overfishing. The industry is experiencing a declining trend, with both catch and employment falling.
Employment of women in the downstream fish processing industry has been reduced to practically nil.
Maldives fisheries sector benefits from high value stocks, but its recent trends highlight vulnerability to a
mix of factors, including overfishing, higher fuel costs, temperature rise leading to change in schools
aggregation and lack of more effective regional eco-systemic management of the shared skipjack tuna
stock. Governance deficiencies (limited number of skipjack tuna processing licenses) appear to have
hampered the development of fisheries and the value they bring to the economy. Overfishing of reef fish
and climate change present risks to the sustainability of the tuna fisheries as well as tourism. Threats to
the health of the coral reefs that are significant to the fishery sector also come from habitat degradation
and loss due to pollution, harbor construction and reclamation.

Agriculture
23.     Food security concerns have revitalized the interest in development of the local agriculture
production. Agriculture is a relatively minor activity in Maldives and has contributed only marginally to
long-term growth. Potential for agriculture is limited due to the scarcity and dispersion of arable land and
high cost of fresh water for irrigation, and the country will remain dependent on imported food into the
future. There are opportunities as well: there may be more potential to cater to resorts, growth in
agriculture will benefit women who form the majority of employment in the sector, other higher-value


                                                                                                             12
fruits and vegetables could be tried tested for cultivation, and low-cost smallholder greenhouse
technologies combined with household based-irrigation/ ‘fertigation’ systems could be explored.


Constraints
24.      Maldives suffers from the same size and geography challenges as other small island states,
limiting its production base and competitiveness. As a result of these challenges, the cost of providing
basic services in a fragmented country is raised across the board. Public expenditure in Maldives is
structurally high, although Maldives remains an outlier in terms of spending even if accounting for its size,
insularity and openness, and the duality of its economy.. With its small population dispersed over many
islands across long distances, the country faces the choice whether to address the challenge of the high
cost of service delivery through consolidation of population closer to Malé or through improving services
and connectivity to populations at their current locations. There has been a steady migration from smaller
to larger islands -- in particular to the Malé City area -- leading to conditions of overcrowding in Malé, a
development successive governments have tried to address with limited success.

25.      The investment climate in Maldives features important constraints for new entrepreneurs and
for the growth of existing firms. The investment climate in Maldives is much more challenging than that
of similar island economies and other South Asian countries. Challenges extend beyond what is captured
by Doing Business rankings (enabling environment for a firm to start operations, grow its business and
resolve disputes or unwind operations in an orderly, swift and fair manner). They include lack of access to
foreign currency and sudden changes in the legal and regulatory environment taking place in absence of
sufficient consultation with private-sector stakeholders. Addressing investment climate shortcomings will
be essential in order to enable the creation of inclusive economic activities in Maldives.

26.      The uniqueness of Maldives’ natural resources has enabled the country to attract large amounts
of foreign direct investment (FDI) in spite of shortcomings in the investment climate. However, this type
of FDI, typically into the development of single-island resorts, has had limited positive spillover to the
economy. Moreover, recent events, such as civil disturbances in Male and a high-profile dispute and costly
legal proceedings related to the contract for investment in the international airport, have the potential to
significantly undermine the confidence of foreign investors on Maldives. That could reduce its
attractiveness as a long-term investment destination in favor of jurisdictions that can provide a higher
degree of certainty to foreign investors.

27.      Access to finance has been identified as a major constraint for the development of enterprises
in Maldives. Financing to the private sector has been lower than the pace of economic growth, reflecting
a lack of investment opportunities in the local economy. In particular, this has affected manufacturing,
fisheries and agriculture credit, which has fallen since 2007. High collateralization requirements represent
major hurdles to borrowers, especially for small and medium enterprises and new entrepreneurs. Lack of
access to finance has been identified by authorities as a major obstacle for entrepreneurship in Maldives,
but this challenge will not be resolved through concessional credit initiatives. Instead, sustainable



                                                                                                          13
enhancement of access to finance in Maldives will require the development and implementation of a
strategy for financial sector development that addresses the shortcomings faced by the sector.

28.      Maldives is facing important governance challenges that affect the business environment and
the soundness and sustainability of economic and fiscal management. In the public sector, limited
capacity, a complex institutional framework and inter-institutional conflicts also limit the ability of the
state to support social and economic progress. Institutional capacity remains much lower than that of an
average upper middle -income country. A significant amount of procurement in the country is carried out
by SOEs and the Ministry of Health outside the scope of national rules and central government controls,
leading to doubts if public resources are spent in the most effective and efficient manner. Public-sector
management suffers from inefficiencies. The lack of settlement in the political and institutional framework
impairs the state’s effectiveness, which has led in particular to weak rule of law. Governance issues also
these extend to the resort tourism sector, where a few business groups control a large share of the
market.

29.     Expanding and improving human capital will be of vital importance to promote economic
prosperity and increase jobs for young people. Maldives has performed well in providing access to
primary and lower secondary education. However, the country lags sharply behind in education
attainment at the higher secondary level, while higher education participation is extremely low for a
middle-income country. The quality of education at all levels is a major challenge facing Maldives, both in
terms of inputs and outcomes. A major challenge is to equip school and university graduates with the
“soft skills” demanded by employers in the country, the lack of which is linked to high youth
unemployment. The quality of current Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) services
needs to be improved so that it becomes both more attractive for youth and more relevant for employers.
For this, the gap between youth aspirations for employment (white-collar jobs) and the actual
opportunities for employment (e.g., perceived lower-status jobs) needs to be addressed.

30.      The contribution of social spending to poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Maldives is
declining over time. Recently introduced social insurance schemes have created perverse economic
incentives that challenge poverty reduction and shared prosperity moving forward. In particular, universal
electricity subsidies disproportionately benefit the richer households, while the generosity of the social
pension system has exacerbated intergenerational equity issues and potentially contributed to increasing
distortions on the labor market. (Increasing trends for inter-generational transfers within the household
and increasing reservation wages might challenge direct participation of the youth in the growth process.)
Moreover, the defined contribution pension schemes disadvantage elderly women, given the gender
income and wage disparity in Maldives.


Prioritization

31.    Based on existing evidence and analysis conducted as part of the Systematic Country Diagnostic,
the team identified three priority areas to promote growth, poverty reduction and shared prosperity in

                                                                                                        14
a sustainable way in Maldives. The first is improving opportunities in tourism and fisheries for the local
population. The second is enhancing the enabling environment, including investment climate, access to
finance and skills. The third is improving the efficiency and efficacy of public resource management and
reducing macro fiscal risk. These priority areas were confirmed in consultations with local stakeholders
and used to further validate hypotheses and analysis.

32.     Governance issues appear in many of these priority areas as an important cross-cutting
constraint. Various dimensions of governance constraints can be identified, including lack of transparency
in tourism, overlapping roles of government agencies in fisheries, incomplete legal and regulatory
framework hampering the investment climate, weakness of capacity, in particular in natural resource
management, and deficiencies in the management of SOEs.

Priority area 1: Enhancing opportunities in tourism and fisheries for the local population

33.     Given the importance of tourism in Maldives, a more inclusive industry represents a major
opportunity for shared prosperity going forward. There are four potential complementary avenues to
improving the inclusiveness of tourism going forward: (1) enhancing the implementation of the current
resort model; (2) enabling sustainable economic diversification within the tourism sector; (3) enabling
local employment; and (4) strengthening linkages between tourism and local providers of goods and
services.

34.     Maldives also has the opportunity to further develop its fisheries sector, and to capitalize on
the potential benefits to enhance economic growth and sustainable development at a national level.
As sustainable and inclusive growth of the fisheries sector will likely not be based on increasing the volume
of catch, a transition to a wealth-based fisheries management system may hold promise for the future.
There are a range of targeted options for exploiting the opportunities presented to Maldives fisheries
sector at present, but effective strategies and plans will need to be developed in order to identify not only
economic potential, but also environmental impact.

Priority area 2. Enabling opportunities for creation of new sources of growth

35.     Economic diversification and competitiveness in Maldives are hampered by significant
structural and spatial constraints, but enhancing the enabling environment will enhance the potential
for entrepreneurship, creation of new firms and growth of existing ones. Maldives faces similar
structural challenges of other small island states that restrict the extent to which the country can attain
competitiveness across the board. However, there are visible untapped opportunities where potential (in
terms of existing demand and proved production capacity) exists, both within value chains of existing
industries, as well as potential new economic activities.

36.      Enabling the local population to seize these opportunities will require addressing a host of
factors that represent the overall enabling environment in the country. These factors include enhancing
the investment climate, access to finance and human capital.




                                                                                                          15
Priority area 3: Improving the efficiency and efficacy of public resource management and reducing macro
fiscal risk

37.     The sustainability of Maldives’ development model is dependent on how well the authorities
manage the country’s wealth-generating natural resources and its financial resources to redistribute
this wealth, and how resilient the country is to external and domestic shocks. Maldives’ natural
resources are its marine life and its coral reefs, but there are weaknesses in the exploitation of its natural
resources and in its preparedness for natural hazards. It appears that a lack of planning capacity at the
local and national government level is the main constraint to dealing with the challenge of sustainability.

38.      The main mechanisms to redistribute the wealth generated by tourism are public sector
employment, social services, subsidies and transfers. The sustainability of the positive outcomes
achieved through this redistribution system crucially depends on improving its efficiency and cost-
effectiveness. The public sector employment freeze contributes to managing the wage bills and improving
fiscal sustainability, and fiscal savings can be used to mitigate the negative impact on employment. While
it is important to continue to provide wide access to health and education services, more careful planning
based on the demographic distribution of the population could improve efficiency of spending and free
resources to improve quality. Targeting reform of electricity and food subsidies could improve efficiency
of spending while freeing resources to protect the poor. Operational savings in the universal health
insurance system Aasandha could cut its cost significantly, while preserving the principle of universal
health insurance. Finally, there could be fiscal savings from improving SOE management and procurement.

39.      Better management of its resources may also make Maldives more resilient to external shocks.
Maldives will remain exposed to external shocks from tourism under its current development model.
While it cannot eliminate its vulnerability to shocks Maldives has opportunities to reduce its vulnerability
and increase its resilience within limits by: (1) reducing exposure to shocks by diversifying its sources of
tourism and reducing its reliance on fossil fuel; (2) improving international conditions to reduce the
domestic transmission of shocks by reforming public expenditure and reducing the risk of the public debt
portfolio; and (3) increasing its risk management through improving institutional quality, including public
financing management and planning capacity, and increasing policy space.

Section 1. Country context


40.      Maldives is an island nation in the Indian Ocean comprising 1,190 small coral islands of
which 190 are inhabited by a local population of 341,000 2. Maldives’ unique archipelagic coral island
provides the country with an extremely rich and diverse marine ecological system. With more
territorial sea than land, marine resources have played a vital role shaping the contours of economic
development, with nature-based tourism being the key driver of economic growth and fisheries an
important sector of employment for the local population. The population geography in Maldives is
strongly polarized. The capital Malé, strategically located at the center of the archipelago and served by
the first and busiest international airport, is the single most populous island of Maldives, with density as
high as 53,700 people per square kilometer 3 against an average of approximately 1.900 people per square
kilometer in the atolls (Figures 1 and 2). 4

41.      Over the past 30 years, Maldives has successfully built on its extraordinary natural assets to
promote growth and socio-economic development. Maldives shares many of the Small Island Developing
States development challenges, such as: a small domestic market; a narrow and fragile resource base;
a shortage of skilled manpower; difficult inter-island transport and communication; high cost of social
and economic infrastructure provision; and heavy dependence on external trade and vulnerability to
external shocks and natural disasters. However, in the case of Maldives, these challenges are
compounded by its high geographic dispersion with 1,190 coral islands (199 of which are inhabited)
grouped in 26 atolls, spread over roughly 90,000 square kilometers. Nevertheless, the development of a
profitable high-end tourism sector has fueled sustained growth rates and supported public investments
in health and education. In the early 1980s, Maldives was one of the world’s 20 poorest countries. Thirty
years later, its inhabitants enjoy the same levels of GDP per capita and human development outcomes as
a middle-income country.

42.      However, Maldives’ model of economic development has not been inclusive and its future
sustainability is at stake. Although this economic model based on tourism-led growth and redistribution
of tourism-generated revenues has contributed to improving well-being of Maldivian population, poverty
reduction has been below potential and the level of inequality – and lack of shared prosperity – remain a
major challenge. Moreover, recent political and socio-economic developments have brought to evidence
the inherent vulnerability of Maldives’ development model and raise immediate concerns about its fiscal,
environmental and social sustainability.

43.     This Systematic Country Diagnostic for Maldives aims to help identify the most critical
constraints and opportunities facing the country as it works towards promoting sustainable growth,
reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. In addition to serving as a public good for the
government, civil society, research and academic community, and local and international development
partners, the findings of the SCD will be used as key inputs in the preparation of the WBG strategy, the
Country Partnership Framework, which will outline how the Bank Group’s engagement in Maldives can
best contribute towards achieving the twin goals.



 Data disclaimer

 The systematic analysis of opportunities and obstacles for poverty reduction and shared prosperity in
 Maldives is limited by shortcomings in official statistics. The lack of consistent and comprehensive data
 on micro- and macro-economic aspects in Maldives has been identified as a significant obstacle for
 evidence-based policymaking and policy advice.
 Understanding of poverty issues in Maldives is limited by pitfalls in the current poverty measurement
 framework and by data quality and comparability constraints. The latest available household survey
 data to assess evolution of poverty was conducted in 2009-10; differences in survey instruments and
 possibly in data quality limit ability to profile the evolution of poverty (see Box 1).
 Due to the open nature of the economy and capacity constraints, macroeconomic, balance of payments
 and fiscal data are not always accurate. In particular, it has been suggested that the size of the tourism
 sector, even after recent revisions, is still underestimated. On the other hand, the official fiscal
 expenditure is underreported (Box 2).
 The analysis of the real sector trends is constrained by lack of information on industries composition
 and out-of-date enterprise surveys. Lack of recent reliable labor force data, especially within the
 tourism sector, limits potential for analysis of youth labor market challenges. Similarly, data on role,
 size, management and fiscal risk of SOEs is not available.
 In undertaking this diagnostic, the team has aimed at complementing official sources of data with
 information from stakeholders gathered through surveys, focus groups and consultations. The team
 acknowledges the limitations in these approaches and thus data stemming from these exercises is duly
 identified throughout the document and used only as means of identification of main issues, rather
 than as a basis for conclusive assessment of policies.
 Data and knowledge gaps are identified in the relevant sections of the document.

                                             Key Messages

 •   Maldives development model is based on tourism-led growth and redistribution of tourism
     generated revenue
 •   Maldives development model has led to a very high pace of growth
 •   Poverty reduction in Maldives is below potential due to lack of shared prosperity
 •   Public expenditure has increased over past five years
 •   Maldives’ fiscal deficit has been widening leading to high public debt, while its foreign exchange
     reserves are very low

                                            Knowledge Gaps

 •   Latest household survey data available to assess evolution of poverty was conducted in 2009-10


44.      Maldives’ model of socio-economic development relies on tourism-led growth and
redistribution of tourism-generated revenue (Figure 3). The redistribution of revenue through public
service delivery is complicated by the geographical dispersion of the archipelago that prevents achieving
economies of scale, and ultimately leads to question whether this model is sustainable. The performance
of this development model will be assessed on its ability to: (1) generate growth; (2) include as much of
the population as possible in the growth process though productive forms of employment: and (3)
efficiently redistribute resources towards the neediest segment of the population to facilitate poverty
reduction and shared prosperity.

Growth
45.     Bound by structural constraints and endowed with extraordinary natural assets Maldives
developed a high-end tourism sector, which has resulted in a very high pace of economic growth over
the past three decades. GDP per capita increased from $275 in 1980 to $6,666 in 2013 (Figure 4). This
growth rate, which averaged 7 percent between 2002 and 2013 is mainly driven by tourism and non-
tradable tourism-related activities (including construction, transport and communications) (Figure 5). This
impressive track record of economic growth has been supported by capital accumulation through
investment in resorts, and by an increase in the labor force mainly benefiting foreign workers.

46.      Economic growth in Maldives has been reliant on the development of tourism, with very limited
contribution of other economic activities. Tourism accounts directly for around 30 percent of nominal
GDP, 5 and has accounted for about 28 percent of real GDP growth between 2002 and 2013. Including
tourism-related sectors 6, these numbers increase to 64 percent of nominal GDP and 65 percent of real
growth. There are few other primary industries contributing to economic growth, and they are small in
relative size. Manufacturing, fisheries and agriculture combined accounted for 9.6 percent of GDP in 2013,
and private sector-led growth outside of the tourism sector has been limited.

47.      But Maldives’ form of tourism-led growth has followed an enclave model, reliant on imported
goods, labor and finance. Accordingly, while tourism accounts for about a third of the country’s GDP, it
only contributes to an estimated 16 percent of the employment in the country. Even when including
sectors that benefit indirectly from tourism employment increases to only 22 percent of the total (Figure
35). Linkages between resorts and local economy are similarly limited, with very few products and services

6Transport, communication, financial services and business services benefit directly from tourism activity and tend to be highly
correlated to tourism bed-nights, while real estate and construction are heavily determined by investment in the tourism sector.

supplied by local enterprises. Manufacturing firms are small in size and lack the quality and reliability
demanded by high-end resorts.

48.       The participation of women in tourism jobs has been low. Even when Maldivians are employed,
only about 30 percent are women, according to data from the 2009/10 HIES. Research suggests that social
dynamics influence employment decisions such that families are reluctant to allow young women to take
jobs in the tourism sector because they would have to travel from home to other islands and because the
tourism sector is associated with “immoral and unethical” practices. 7 A lack of child-care or residential
facilities for employed women in the tourism sector further exacerbates familial unwillingness to allow
young women to work away from home. Women’s limited control of transportation means to travel to
and from resorts adds another hurdle. 8

49.        The tourism industry has contributed to an already large geographical spread of activity.
Starting in the atolls around the main international airport in Malé (Central North), the tourism sector
is still largely concentrated around Malé, with 84 percent of resorts within 130 kilometers from Malé
airport. However, the industry has been slowly taking advantage of advances in transportation
opening up atolls to the north and south. In fact, the first resort outside this range was opened in
2005 and there has been a steady increase since. (Figure 6).

50.      Other economic activities also show large geographic dispersion. While public service jobs
are also concentrated on Malé, with limited spread to the atolls, agricultural production takes place
mainly in the Central North and Central South regions. For households in the outer atolls, public and
private transfers are important source of household income (Figure 7).

51.     Apart from tourism, there are few sizeable economic activities in the country. Fisheries make
up the second most prominent industry in the country after tourism, and are the largest goods export
earner. Maldives benefits from access to high quality fisheries stock, but a large share of its value is lost
through export of fish as commodities to intermediary markets. As opposed to tourism, fisheries accounts
for a very small contribution to GDP (1.7 percent) but a larger share of employment (10.5 percent). 9
Agriculture provides 2.3 percent of GDP and 4.5 percent of employment, but it does not export. However,
while the economy doubled in size between 2002 and2013, fisheries shrunk by 21 percent, and agriculture
grew by only 24 percent over that period (Figure 8).

Role of the state and redistribution
52.      The development of the tourism sector in Maldives has created significant sources of revenues
to the country. Since the nationalization of all land in the country in 1979 and the revocation of all permits
to operate guesthouses on inhabited islands in 1984, the development of the tourism sector in Maldives
has been largely dominated by a limited number of local businessmen. 10 Barriers to entry and capacity
controls contributed to limiting competition and diversification of investors, but also have increased rents
for the state as it has managed to extract increasing fees from concessions and lease agreements 11 (Figure
9).

53.     Revenues generated in the tourism sectors have been used to address some of the structural
development challenges of Maldives’ SIDS economy. In particular, tourism revenues have been used to
support job creation in the public sector, 12 to finance the provision of public services and expand access
to primary health and education facilities beyond the capital area Malé; to provide social insurance against
financial risks of old age and out-of-pocket health expenditures, as well as to insulate the local economy
from international price fluctuations through a system of universal subsidies on food and energy (Figure
10).




10 Mihdha (2008).
11 The tourism sector is taxed directly through the Tourism Tax (or bed-night tax), the Airport Departure Tax, the Goods and
Services Tax on Tourism (TGST), while tourism also has a significant impact on import duty and Business Profit Tax revenue. Resort
lease rent provides a large share of non-tax revenue.
12 Jobs in the public sector account for 17.3 percent of total employment, while jobs in education, health and social services

account for 20.5 percent of employment (as of 2010).

54.      The large number of SOEs further contributes to strengthening the role of the state in Maldives’
economy. SOEs play a dominant role in many sectors, including trade, fisheries, finance,, construction,
transport, health and utilities. Although their contribution in total fiscal revenue has declined from 19
percent in 2003 to 4 percent in 2013, thanks to the shift towards new forms of taxation, combined revenue
of the main three SOEs was still equivalent to 37 percent of GDP in 2013. There are currently around 84
SOEs 13, about half of which require active monitoring, whereas 28 have been identified by the government
for liquidation. 14

55.     The new constitution introducing democracy in the late 2000s has been accompanied by an
increase in the level of redistribution. In particular, the increase in public spending has been mostly driven
by:

•      The introduction of explicit electricity subsidies. Due to high costs of domestic electricity production
       and distribution, the country has a long history of subsidized energy prices. 15 The current system of
       explicit electricity subsidies was introduced in 2009 in parallel with the reform of electricity tariffs.
       While the electricity tariff reform was meant to curb utility providers’ losses by allowing a cost-
       recovering pricing, the contemporaneous introduction of subsidies had the effect of transferring the
       cost of the electricity tariff reform and of any future increase in fuel prices onto the government’s


13 Because of complex ownership structures, the number of firms in which the state has a combined direct and indirect stake of

at least 5 percent increases to 92. The state has a control of at least 50 percent in 61 firms, out of which it has 100 percent control
of 46.

15 Due to Maldives’ reliance on imported diesel for electricity generation and inefficiencies in generators’ capacity, the cost of

electricity production in Maldives is up to five times as high as in neighboring countries. In particular, electricity production in
Maldives is 2.5, 3.3 and 5 times more expensive than in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, respectively.

                                                                                                                                                 24
       budget. Over the last four years, spending on electricity subsidies increased nine times, escalating
       from 0.3 percent of GDP in 2010 to 2.7 percent in 2014 (Figure 11).
•      The introduction of a universal health insurance scheme. The country’s geography and dispersed
       population, along with its high dependence on imports of medical consumables and expatriate
       manpower, have meant that health services come at substantially higher costs when compared with
       other countries in the region. Maldives spent 9.2 percent of its GDP on health in 2011, about half of
       which came from the government treasury and the rest from household sources. Responding to a
       growing demand for financial assistance to cope with out-of-pocket health expenditure, the
       government introduced a universal health insurance system, Aasandha, in January 2012. However,
       the piecemeal nature of the reform, continuing capacity issues within the government and inadequate
       preparation and planning for these reforms have contributed to continuing efficiency, impact and cost
       challenges. In its first year of introduction, the scheme received claims for MVR 943.6 million
       (corresponding to 2.4 percent of GDP), well in excess of the amounts approved in the government
       budget. 16
•      An increase in coverage and generosity of pension system. The 2009 Pension Act extended old-age
       protection beyond workers employed in the civil sector and mandated the introduction of a two-pillar
       pension system comprising of Maldives Retirement Pension Scheme – a new contributory pension
       scheme based on a defined contribution model -- and the Old Age Basic Pension (OABP) – a universal
       non-contributory pension system for individuals 65 and older. While the extension of coverage of the
       pension system is aimed at closing protection gaps between the public and private sector,
       implementation challenges during the reform and the particular generosity of the OABP scheme have
       contributed to increasing government spending.

UMICs and Sri Lanka, the second best of the South Asia region. Further, Maldives performance is better
than the average UMC also with respect to infant mortality rate, although it is second to Sri Lanka in the
South Asia region (Figure 13, right panel). Maldives fares significantly better than many countries when it
comes to gender equality, ranking 49th on the Gender Inequality Index in the 2014 Global Human
Development Report of UNDP, in comparison with its Human Development Index ranking of 103th. The
island nation has the least disparities between men and women, when compared with other medium
human development countries as well as its South Asian neighbours. The country has attained gender
parity in primary and secondary enrollment, and the number of Maldivian women attaining university
degrees is at par with that of men.

In particular, while poverty remained substantially stable at around 18 percent in the capital area Malé, it
declined markedly in the atolls – going from 25 percent in 2003 to 14 percent in 2010. Similar patterns
are observed using the international poverty lines (see Figure 15).

60.     The poverty rate is the highest in the Central North and Southern atolls, while the capital area
Malé is home to the largest share of poor individuals. The Central North region of the archipelagos is
the poorest in both years, with poverty rates of 35 percent in 2003 and 25 percent in 2010. This is followed
by the Southern region, with 28 percent poor individuals in 2003 and 21 percent in 2010. The Central
region reduced its poverty rate by more than 80 percent in seven years (see Figure 16).

  Source: Staff elaboration based on HIES data.         of the Maldivian economy between 2003 and
                                                        2010. The GEPR in Maldives is relatively low by
international standards. In particular, considering the $2 PPP poverty line, the GEPR in Maldives is about
1.2 percent, meaning that for each percent increase in Maldives’ per capita GDP, poverty fell by a mere
1.2 percent. The limited contribution of growth to poverty reduction in Maldives is evident when
compared to other countries. For example, while Maldives and Sri Lanka shared the same growth rate
(approximately 4.8 percent a year over the period), poverty reduction in Maldives was one-third less than
experienced in Sri Lanka. 17 Even Nepal and Pakistan managed to reduce poverty faster than Maldives,
although in these two countries GDP growth was, respectively, 2 and 2.5 percentage points lower (Figure
18, left panel). Maldives’ limited performance in terms of poverty reduction is even more striking when
considering its relatively high potential as suggested by the initial level of per capita income. With a per
capita GDP of $3,360 in 2003, Maldives started with the highest poverty reduction potential of the South
Asia region. Despite the large income lever that could have helped lift individuals out of poverty, Maldives’
elasticity of poverty to GDP growth was significantly lower than countries starting from similar levels of
per capita GDP, and closer to that of countries with lower levels of per capita GDP such as India or
Bangladesh (Figure 18, right panel).

63.     Given the slow pace of poverty reduction, Maldives will be able to reduce extreme poverty
under 1 percent by 2040, a much longer period than similar upper middle-income countries, and other
countries in South Asia. If poverty keeps decreasing at the same rate as in the period 2003-2010, Maldives
will reduce extreme poverty below 1 percent in 30 years, as opposed to only eight years needed to Sri
Lanka, and more than double the time of the average middle-income country (14 years). Even Pakistan
and Nepal, which start with much higher poverty rates, will be two years faster than Maldives in defeating
extreme poverty (see Figure 19).




17   Poverty decreased at about 0.5 percent per year in Maldives as opposed to 1.6 percent in Sri Lanka.

64.     The lack of shared prosperity in Maldives is the main determinant of the limited impact of
growth on poverty reduction. Shared prosperity remains a major challenge for Maldives. As shown in
Figure 20, growth is not equally shared by all sections of the distribution: the bottom 40 percent is growing
less than average, while people in the upper part of the distribution are growing much faster. This un-
equalizing impact of growth slowed down poverty reduction. Had all the segments of the population
benefited equally from growth (i.e. had growth been distribution neutral), poverty would have declined
by as much as 11 percentage points (Figure 21).

65.      The un-equalizing impact of growth is further reflected by an increase in the gap between the
poorest and richest segments of the population. The increase in inequality induced by growth deepened
the polarization of welfare distribution in Maldives. While inequality as measured by the Gini index
declined slightly from 39.9 percent in 2003 to 38.6 in 2010, the polarization as measured by quintile ratios
increased 18. In particular, if in 2003 the poorest individual in the top 10 percent of the distribution was
consuming four times more than the richest individual in the bottom 10 percent of the distribution, in
2010 that individual was consuming 5.3 times more. Polarizing trends are reflected by the unequal
distribution of resources: in 2010, the top 20 percent of the population commanded as much as 45 percent
of total consumption against only 17 percent of the bottom 40 percent.

66.     Limited job opportunities, especially for low-skilled labor, might have played an important role
in limiting the contribution of growth to poverty reduction. Low education levels, inactivity and
unemployment are strongly associated with a higher risk of poverty. According to HIES 2009/10 data, the
lower the educational attainment of the household head, the higher is the likelihood that the household

poorly suited to capturing polarization and changes around the tails.

is poor. About 88 percent of the poor (and 84 percent of those in the bottom 40 percent) live in households
whose head has only completed primary education (see Figure 22). Looking at labor market outcomes,
Maldivian households whose head is unemployed or inactive are on average 1.5 and 1.2 times more likely
to be poor than average.

67.      Employment at the lower spectrum of the skill distribution is associated with higher poverty
rates. In particular, poverty rates are higher when the head of household is employed in construction (26
percent), manufacturing (18 percent) and fisheries/agriculture (17 percent). Taken together, these three
sectors account for more than 50 percent of the poor individuals with working household heads, and the
fisheries sector alone accounts for about 26 percent of the total (Figure 23). Fisheries development is
particularly important in the atolls, where 30 percent of the household heads work in the fishery sector
(as opposed to only 1 percent in Malé). In the atolls, the fisheries sector alone accounts for 41 percent of
poor individuals with a working household head.

68.      As labor income is the main source of household income for the poor, an inclusive development
of the labor market is key for reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Labor income accounts
for more than 70 percent of the total household income of the poor, and it is the main source of income
for 70 percent of poor individuals. In Malé, where two-thirds of employed household heads work in public
administration, education and health and services, labor income comes primarily from wages. In the atolls,
where 45 percent of employed household heads work in fisheries and manufacturing, labor income is
mainly self-employment income (see Figure 23).

                                    Box 1. Poverty measurement in Maldives

 Understanding of poverty issues in Maldives is limited by data quality and comparability constraints
 and by pitfalls in the current poverty measurement framework.

 Data limitations

                                                                                                                             32
The primary concern relates to data quality and comparability. The first household survey in Maldives
(Vulnerability and Poverty Analysis - VPA) was conducted in 1998/99, with a panel followup in 2003/04.
The VPA survey series was then replaced by Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) – mostly
focused on household budget measurement – which was implemented in 2003/04 and 2009/10.
Differences in instruments and sample design do not permit comparison between the results obtained
from VPA and HIES surveys. Moreover, differences in survey instruments and possibly in data quality
within the two HIES rounds further limits the ability to profile the evolution of poverty in Maldives.

Poverty measurement framework
The most widespread poverty indicator is the share of individuals whose per capita consumption falls
below the official poverty line. This indicator is usually defined in the literature as headcount index and
it is a measure of the incidence of poverty. Antecedent to computing the headcount index are two
steps: defining a welfare aggregate, e.g. the dimension with respect to which we define the minimally
acceptable standard of living; and establishing a minimum acceptable standard of that indicator to
separate the poor from the non-poor (the poverty line).

Maldives lacks an official and unique national poverty line. Since the first household survey in 1997/98,
poverty measurement has relied on the use of several relative poverty lines, defined in terms of median
or a fraction of median consumption of the population living in the atolls, excluding the capital Malé.
No efforts had so far been made to assess which of these poverty lines actually corresponds to a
reasonable minimum threshold by the standards of living prevailing in Maldives.

The consumption aggregate is the sum of the consumption expenditures of all food and non-food items
of each household. Due to data limitations, the consumption aggregate does not include spending in
durables and the flow of services from the primary dwelling (usually intended as rent for tenants, and
imputed rent for home owners). The validity of official poverty profiles is severely hindered by the lack
of any adjustment of the consumption aggregate for spatial differences in living costs. The lack of spatial
price adjustment represents a fundamental flaw of the current poverty measurement methodology,
especially given the unequal distribution of economic opportunities throughout the Maldivian
archipelago, relevance of transport costs and differential access to goods and services between the
capital area Malé and other atolls.

Poverty methodology adopted for the SCD
In order to improve the comparability of the two HIES surveys, and to overcome the shortfalls of the
official poverty methodology, a new consumption aggregate and a new poverty line have been
estimated.

The new consumption aggregate is defined as the sum of all food and non-food household
expenditures, excluding housing, lumpy expenditures (purchase of vehicles, major tools and
equipment, household appliances, durables, furniture), and rare expenditures (jewelry, hay, wedding
and parties). The consumption aggregate so defined is then divided by the household size, defined as
the sum of family members and paying guests. To take into account the spatial price differences, the
consumption aggregate is deflated using regional food poverty lines.

Using the Cost of Basic Needs approach and HIES 2009-10 data, the national poverty line has been
estimated at MVR 787.5. This value is equivalent to the minimum necessary to consume 1,826

 The World Bank uses as extreme poverty line $1.25 a day in 2005 PPP terms, which represents the
 mean of the poverty lines found in the poorest 15 countries ranked by per capita consumption among
 88 surveyed countries over the period 1990-2005 (Ravallion, Chen and Sangraula, 2009). Maldives’
 national poverty line is about $1.90 a day in 2005 PPP. Other commonly used poverty lines for
 international comparisons across middle-income countries are $2 and $2.50 a day in 2005 PPP, which
 correspond, in turn, to MVR 821.3 and MVR 1,034.2 a month in 2010 prices. In addition to the national
 poverty line, the SCD use the international poverty lines for cross-country comparisons.

 The depth and severity of poverty
 Although the headcount index is the most widespread measure of poverty, it has a serious shortcoming
 in that it does not take into account the intensity of poverty, i.e. how far from the poverty line the poor
 are. A measure of poverty that overcomes this problem is the poverty gap index. The poverty gap index
 is the average shortfall of the total population from the poverty line as a share measured as a
 percentage of the poverty line itself, and it defines the depth of poverty. The squared poverty gap gives
 a higher weight on households furthest away from the poverty line and it is a measure of the severity
 of poverty. Both of these measures will complement the analysis of headcount poverty in the context
 of the SCD.

 Shared prosperity
 The World Bank has adopted two new targets to make explicit its goal of “A world free of poverty.” The
 two targets are: ending extreme poverty by 2030 and promoting shared prosperity. Sustainability is an
 overarching priority in the pursuit of these goals: achieving them requires promoting environmental,
 social, and fiscal sustainability. The emphasis on reducing extreme poverty is in line with the
 commitment to halve extreme poverty enshrined in the first target of the Millennium Development
 Goals, which were adopted globally in 2000. Shared prosperity focuses explicitly on the less well off
 more broadly. Promoting shared prosperity is defined as maximizing income (or consumption) growth
 for the bottom 40 percent of the population. In Maldives, the consumption cut-off line for the bottom
 40 percent (the threshold below which the poorest 40 percent of population falls) in 2010 is 1,266 MVR
 a month, or $3.06 a day in 2005 PPP.


Recent macroeconomic and fiscal trends

69.     After hitting 1.3 percent in 2012, economic growth has been steadily recovering and is
estimated to amount to 5 percent in 2014. 19 Most other service sectors are estimated to have grown as
well in 2014, while the industrial sector expanded by 13.2 percent in 2014, driven by construction,
following a contraction of 1.5 percent the previous year. However, the agriculture and fisheries sector is
estimated to have contracted by 2.1 percent in 2014 after posting growth of 5 percent in 2013. (Figure
24). See also Box 2 for a discussion on macro data.

70.     Average stay continued its secular decline as the composition of tourism changes further. The
average stay of tourists declined to 6.1 days, down from a recorded average of 7.1 days between 2009
and 2013, reflecting a structural shift in the composition of tourism. Between 2010 and 2014 the share of
European tourists fell by 20 percentage points from 63.8 to 43.9 percent due to weaker economic
conditions in Europe. The simultaneous increase in the number of Chinese tourists and demand from

 Middle East mitigated the weakening European demand. During the 2010-2014 period the Chinese share
 of tourists expanded by 15.2 percent while the share of Middle Eastern tourists grew by 1.6 percent

 71.      Annual average inflation moderated even further in 2014, falling to 2.4 percent, down from 4
 percent in 2013 driven by low food prices and international crude prices. The fall is particularly steep
 considering the 10.9 percent inflation rate recorded in 2012. As measured by the overall consumer price
 index, inflation in Malé has been unstable since 2009 with large fluctuations. Following a spike in inflation
 in 2011, when the currency was floated and sharply devalued, inflation started showing signs of
 moderation and fell to a low of 2.4 percent in 2014 (Figure 26). During the second half of 2014, inflation
 fell even further, driven largely by a drop in food prices (Figure 27). Prices for food and non-alcoholic
 beverages grew at a pace of 1 percent in 2014, as opposed to 7.5 percent in 2013.

 72.     New taxes in 2011 and 2012, mainly on the tourism sector, have increased fiscal revenue
 structurally; however, the fiscal deficit widened to an estimated 11.6 percent of GDP in 2014. These
 taxes include the new Tourism Goods and Services Tax (TGST, which was increased from 8 to 12 percent
 in November 2014) and an increase in the Airport Departure Tax. All these taxes are borne by tourists,
 who, according to the authorities, have an inelastic demand curve. 20 In addition, a Business Profits Tax 21
 and a General GST have been introduced. The net impact has been to increase revenue from 21.9 percent
 of GDP in 2010 to 32.4 percent of GDP in 2014 (Figure 28).

73.      However, persistent and widening fiscal deficits have led to a high level of public debt, which
stood at 74.6 percent of GDP at end of 2014. This represented a net increase of 36.8 percent from 2003.
This increase was driven by persistent deficits, while fast GDP growth relative to the average real interest
rate on debt provided some downward pressure on the level of debt.

74.     Recognizing the unsustainable outlook of its fiscal accounts, government has proposed fiscal
consolidation measures in its 2015 budget. On the revenue side this includes a “green tax” on tourism
(which effectively replaces the Tourism Tax, which was abolished in late 2014, although at a lower rate),
increases in import duties, a one-off revenue boost from Special Economic Zones (SEZ) acquisition fees
and the extension of resort leases. On the expenditure side, the budget proposes to better target subsidies
and freeze public employment. Although these measures, if properly implemented, will help reduce the

deficit, they are unlikely to be sufficient to decrease the upward path of public debt, and further fiscal
consolidation through expenditure and revenue measures will be needed in the short and medium term.

75.     Driven by high fiscal expenditure, the current account has been persistently in deficit, reaching
an estimated 8.4 percent of GDP in 2014. The goods trade deficit is roughly offset by tourism revenue,
but net income outflows (such as dividends and interest payments on external debt) and remittance
outflows lead to an overall structural current account deficit. The deficit has been financed through
foreign direct investment, while net capital outflows by private banks reflect the limited investment
opportunities in the non-tourism sector.

76.      Indeed, apart from buying Treasury bills, the banking sector shows limited appetite to invest in
the domestic economy. While the government has started to borrow increasingly from banks in recent
years, a significant proportion of remaining bank assets are parked at the central bank, earning a very low
overnight night rate, 22 or are sent abroad. 23

77.      Meanwhile, credit to the private sector growth has mostly stagnated since 2008. In addition,
credit to the private sector is concentrated in tourism, which is a legacy of a large increase in resorts leased
out in the mid-2000s when local branches of banks borrowed from foreign head offices to lend to the
domestic tourism sector. Since the global financial crisis, credit growth has been close to zero, with a
write-off of non-performing loans in 2012. 24 The focus has now moved to construction, electricity and real
estate and other loans and advances (Figure 30).

78.     At the end of 2014, gross international reserves increased, but net usable reserves remained
low at only $120 million, covering less than a month of imports. As a result of the large improvement in
net capital inflows, gross official reserves have increased from $368 million at the end of 2013 to $614
million at the end of 2014, covering 3.7 months of imports of goods and services. However, the stable
exchange rate and the parallel market premium do not signal any shortages. In practice, the amount of
reserves in the economy may be much larger, and the tourism industry appears to supply sufficient
quantities of foreign exchange at a stable premium over the official exchange rate. The exchange rate
remained at MVR 15.4 per USD, while the premium declined, as major SOEs abstained from the secondary
market.

                                   Box 2. A real crisis or a macro data crisis?

 It has often said that Maldives is perennially at the verge of a crisis. When looking at the macro data
 the question is indeed why the country is not in a crisis.
 According to the IMF’s 2013 Debt Sustainability Analysis update, Maldives was at high risk of debt
 distress. In particular, the country had a persistent current account deficit of around 20 percent of GDP;
 public domestic and external debt was 73 percent of GDP at end-2011, while private external debt was
 estimated at 38 percent of GDP. By February 2013, official reserves amounted to $304 million,
 equivalent to just 1.6 months of imports, and freely usable reserves amounted to only $99 million.
 Despite these challenges, stores were stocked with imported items and the exchange rate premium
 was modest.
 How can this puzzle be explained?
 First, the tourism industry seems to hold sufficient amounts of reserves at home and abroad to be able
 to supply sufficient quantities to the parallel market to keep the premium stable.a Second, given the
 extreme openness of the economy, the measurement of financial flows through the current and capital
 account are inaccurate. Similarly, poor financial management and recording practices contribute to
 underreporting on the expenditure side.


                                                                                                                         38
The national accounts were revised recently according to international practice resulting in an increase
of nominal GDP over previous estimates (e.g., by 13 percent in 2013, Figure 2.1).a At the same time,
significant revisions have been made to the balance of payments data using new data sources, better
methods and new data in line with IMF technical assistance recommendations. This resulted in large
changes to the services balance (mostly tourism), goods balance (imports) and financial accounts,
leading to a substantially narrower current account deficit (Figure 2.2), higher estimates of FDI inflows
and reduced private-sector borrowing. Moreover, surveys and anecdotal evidence suggest that the
tourism exports could still be underestimated.b

As a result of these adjustments, the current account deficit in 2013 has been revised from 20.5 percent
of GDP to 6.5 percent of GDP. The level of public debt at end-2011 has been revised down to 59 percent
of GDP, while the estimated level of private external debt has been revised down to 13 percent of GDP.

On the other hand, the actual fiscal deficit is estimated much higher than the reported deficit. The fiscal
deficit (reported by the Ministry of Finance) cannot be reconciled with net external and domestic
borrowing by the government (reported by the Maldives Monetary Authority). While current
expenditure in 2013 was reported as 32.6 percent of GDP by the authorities, the IMF estimates it to be
36.5 percent of GDP, mainly a result of the authorities underreporting interest payments, and
incomplete and underreporting of subsidies and social welfare schemes, operations and maintenance
payments.

Although the country looks less vulnerable now, it is still considered on an unsustainable fiscal path, as
the most recent joint World Bank-IMF DSA of 2015 points out.

Section 3. Vulnerability and sustainability issues


                                              Key Messages

 Maldives development model is inherently vulnerable to shocks and increasingly not sustainable. In
 particular:
 • Maldives is highly vulnerable to external macro shocks
 • Maldives democratic transition is still in progress and political instability high
 • Maldives social contract is at risk due to lack of inclusiveness, especially of youth
 • Environmental sustainability is at risk due to climate change, lack of preparedness for natural
     disasters, waste management and lack of access to potable water
 • Electricity generation cost is the highest in South Asia

                                             Knowledge Gaps

 •   Lack of labor force data limit potential for analysis of youth labor market challenges
 •   Analysis of the role, size, management and fiscal risk of SOEs
 •   Analysis of impact of climate change in Maldives


79.       Recent socio-economic and political developments have raised concerns regarding the
sustainability of Maldives’ development model. Despite a long period of sustained economic growth, the
vulnerability of Maldives’ model of development is increasing over time, especially with respect to its
fiscal, social, political and environmental sustainability.


Macroeconomic vulnerability and sustainability


80.      Maldives is highly vulnerable to shocks due to its small size, lack of economic diversification and
heavy reliance on imports. Furthermore, increasing macroeconomic imbalances and escalating public
debt represent a growing source of external vulnerability. While the Maldivian economy has shown
resilience in the past, the country may currently lack appropriate buffers to cope with a shock that would
affect the tourism sector, terms of trade or interest rates.




                                    Box 3. How “special” is Maldives?

 Before the tsunami hit in 2004, expenditure levels were in line with other island states, such as Cape
 Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, Barbados and Dominica, which are all countries with higher tourist
 receipts, large fiscal deficits, large current account deficits and a soft-peg exchange rate. Moreover,
 expenditure was in the 20th to 80th percentile of emerging and developing countries. After the tsunami
 and the introduction of democracy, expenditure has moved to the top 20th percentile and has stayed
 there (Figure 3.1).


                                                                                                         40
Maldives is also an outlier in many ways compared to the rest of the world. Its exports and imports are
the 97th percentile of the world, its current account in the 8th percentile (although the recent revision
makes the current account deficit less exceptional), and expenditure in the 77th percentile (Figure 3.2).
In terms of growth volatility as measured by the standard deviation of real GDP growth over 2003-13,
Maldives ranks in the 94th percentile compared to all countries, and it has the highest standard
deviation among all five peer island states mentioned above.

81.     As a small island state with a high level of imports, the country is vulnerable to food and fuel
commodity prices through the balance of payments. Moreover, as it subsidizes flour, rice and sugar, and
diesel-based electricity generation, the fiscal accounts are equally vulnerable to price shocks. Indeed,
2011, the year of the exchange rate devaluation, saw a one-off spike in subsidies of 0.7 percent of GDP.

82.      Tourism has created additional channels of external vulnerability to shocks, which has created
significant volatility for the economy as a whole. The trends over the past decade have highlighted the
fact that tourism can be affected by a host of factors beyond the control of the country. These include
environmental events (the tsunami affecting Maldives directly), global economic trends (the 2001
recession and the recent global financial crisis affecting wealth of European travelers), and even security
concerns abroad (September 11 terror attacks limiting air travel). These external shocks have been passed
on to the economy as a whole, given the high dependence of Maldives on tourism.

 Note: Rigid expenditure defined as salaries, wages and allowances, social welfare contributions,
 interest payments and subsidies and transfers. Tourism-related revenue defined as tourism tax, GST
 on tourism, Airport Service Charge, royalties, land and resort rent, (part of) import duty revenue and
 Business Profit Tax.

83.     Especially in recent years, the development model has led to an increasing share of revenue
dependent on tourism, while an increasing share of expenditure has become “rigid”. That is, an
increasing share of expenditure consists of items that are not easily adjusted in the event of a downturn
in revenue: subsidies and transfers, social welfare contributions, salaries and wages and interest
payments (Figure 31).

84.      The lack of macro policy buffers leaves the country with few instruments to stabilize the
economy in the event of a downturn in tourism. With high debt and an already high fiscal deficit, it will
be difficult to increase expenditure or reduce taxes in the case of a downturn. Moreover, for a small island
state with most consumption goods imported and a high pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations into

                                                                                                          42
inflation, 25 exchange rate stability is of utmost importance. The country’s official foreign exchange
reserves have frequently reached levels below three month’s import coverage. 26 This limits the country’s
ability to respond to pressure on the exchange rate, which has led to devaluations in 2001 and 2011 and
to balance of payment support in 2005 after the tsunami and in 2009 after the global financial crisis.

85.     Maldives’ already high level of public debt and fiscal path leads to immediate fiscal
sustainability concerns. Unless adjustments are made to revenue and expenditure, the current
development model will lead to ever increasing levels of public debt, even after the fiscal consolidation
measures budgeted in 2015. Overall public debt (including domestic debt) is estimated at 74.6 percent of
GDP at the end of 2014, well above the benchmark of 56 percent of GDP established under the LIC-Debt
Sustainability Framework. 27 It is projected to continue to grow throughout the projection horizon, driven
by a persistent primary fiscal deficit. An increasing share of the budget will be devoted to paying interest
on debt. Moreover, growth shocks and fiscal slippages would lead to even higher levels of debt.
Meanwhile, the persistent current account deficit has led to an increasing level of external debt, and the
country is at “moderate risk of debt distress.” Although the level of debt is below the policy-dependent
thresholds, a shock to tourism exports could make it difficult for the country to service its external debt
(Figure 32 and 33).

86.      Moreover, the widening fiscal deficit has led to rising interest rates. The widening fiscal deficit
has forced the country to accumulate more and more domestic debt. As a result, the government has
resorted to central bank debt financing (until May 2014) and domestic arrears 28 as additional financing
sources. As market interest rates started to increase strongly by mid-2013, the authorities put a cap on
interest rates (called a “tap” system), which has temporarily stabilized interest cost on domestic debt.

25 88 percent of a change in the nominal effective exchange rate is passed to consumer prices within one year (Masha and Park,
2012).
26 It should be noted though that a lot of foreign exchange remains outside the central bank, and private agents are often able to

find foreign exchange when needed.
27 A joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) has been carried out.
28 The IMF estimates arrears in order of 6.3 percent of GDP in 2013 (World Bank and IMF, 2015).

87.     Accumulated domestic arrears add an additional fiscal burden. The stock of accumulated
domestic arrears was estimated at 6.2 percent of GDP at the end of 2012. About 82 percent was owed to
SOEs, in particular to the government-owned importer of fuel, medicine and basic food, and to the
Aasandha Company (health insurance). The emergence of arrears is the result of both unrealistic budget
envelopes and a lack of expenditure controls. 29

88.       This points to weaknesses in public financial management as a source of fiscal risk. The budget
as a policy document suffers from a lack of credibility and limited policy orientation. Expenditure
composition variations are significant at more than 15 percent of the original budget. Furthermore, there
is no credible medium-term macro-fiscal framework and it has a weak and inefficient system of budget
review. Existing cash constraints limit the predictability and control of the budget. Moreover, although
consolidated financial statements have been produced since 2011, data quality and consistency are a
concern. The government does not meet the basic practices of fiscal risk disclosure and analysis on
contingent liabilities and actual liabilities. There is no complete picture of contingent liabilities that may
arise from loan guarantees that have been issued as the government does not report on the main risks to
its fiscal forecasts. 30

89.     SOEs may pose further risks to fiscal sustainability as most are loss-making and depend on
government support, with only nine companies having contributed dividends to the budget in the last
four years. Shortcomings in the operations and oversight of SOEs contribute to macro-fiscal risks, due to
inadequate regulation and supervision. Most SOEs operate at a loss, and represent a drain to the budget
and a source of risk associated to costly fuel imports, foreign exchange transactions, and payment arrears.
Capital transfers to SOEs and subsidy transfers have contributed substantially to the growth in
expenditures in recent years (Figure 34). An independent centralized ownership entity (the Privatization
and Corporatization Board) was established under a comprehensive legal framework in 2013, but final
decisions on the appropriate institutional arrangements are still under consideration.

Political and institutional risks


90.      Maldives democratic transition started recently. The country adopted a new constitution in
2008, ushering in multi-party elections as well as a set of new state institutions at central and local levels,
often with mandated high degrees of independence. The new constitution enacted a mechanism for
separation of powers by creating independent branches of the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary for the
first time in the history of the country.

91.      Powers of and relationships among democratic institutions are still being defined. For instance,
until recently parliamentarians were able to simply add expenditures to the budget on their own initiative
without concern for expenditure limits and all independent commissions created their own human
resource regimes. More importantly, Maldives is a split polity where political contestation is not always
handled through institutional channels. There have been frequent incidences of political unrest over the
past 10 years and election processes have been criticized by observers as lacking credibility in many key
aspects. Institutional incoherence and political instability currently hamper the ability of the government
to provide goods and services and to carry out its redistribution function, which is central to social and
economic inclusion in Maldives. It poses a longer-term risk to improving government operations and,
more generally, public trust in the state.

92.     Institutional and political instability constrain the sustainability of Maldives’ development
model moving forward. There is widespread consensus that political stability was critical to the
development of the tourism industry in Maldives. The current polarization of the political party system,
resulting political unrest and the limits of checks and balances between powers, all contribute to
aggravating political and institutional risks as well as macro and social sustainability issues.

Social sustainability and vulnerability

93.     Economic opportunities in Maldives are out of sync with growth and shared prosperity. Public
administration is the primary sector of employment in Maldives, particularly for the educated local
workforce. Alone, it accounts for 17 percent of total employment and one-fourth of the employment for
workers with secondary or higher levels of education. The tourism industry, while driving the growth
process and being the main contributor to GDP, accounts for only 16 percent of employment and relies
disproportionally on expatriate workforce for both high- and low-skilled jobs. The fisheries sector, which
is a crucial sector for poverty reduction and shared prosperity, accounts for 11 percent of total
employment and one-fourth of the workforce with less than secondary education (Figure 35).

94.     The interplay of socio-demographic trends and fiscal constraints adds to the social sustainability
challenge of Maldives’ development model. The progress in health indicators, notably the reduction in
mortality rates over the past decades, has contributed to Maldives demographic transition. With a
reduction in the total fertility rate to population replacement rates, the population growth has stabilized,
creating the opportunity for a demographic dividend (Figures 36 and 37). The increase in the working age
population, with a shift toward a relatively more educated young labor force, puts enormous pressure on
the absorption capacity of Maldives labor market. That is especially the case in view of the hiring freeze
of the public sector – which constitutes the main employer for high-skilled jobs – and the increasing
competition coming from a relatively cheaper (low-skilled jobs) and better educated (high-skilled jobs)
expatriate workforce.

95.     Youth and women are particularly vulnerable to the social sustainability challenges of Maldives
development model:
• The increasing supply of educated youth in a context characterized by limited labor demand by the
    public sector and a skills mismatch in the private sector has contributed to high youth unemployment.
    In 2010, according to HIES data, the unemployment rate for individuals in the 15 to 24 age group was

                                                                                                                                                                                   46
     25 percent, more than double the unemployment rate of the total workforce (11.8 percent). The lack
     of economic opportunities for the youth is contributing to other social ills, such as drug abuse and
     gang-related violence, especially among male youth.
•    The public sector has traditionally been the biggest employer of women in Maldives, with 34 percent
     of female employment in the health and education sector and 15 percent employment in public
     administration. Limited working hours and availability of jobs on inhabited islands have made public
     employment particularly appealing for women and contributed to sustaining relatively high female
     labor force participation (58 percent). Fiscal constraints to job creation in the public sector have
     contributed to increasing female unemployment vis-à-vis males.

96.      A growing gap between aspirations and opportunities for socio-economic inclusion has
contributed to fostering disenfranchisement among Maldivian youth. After 30 years of sustained
economic growth and social development, the current generation of youth is the first faced with the
prospect of not being able to achieve the same level of wellbeing as their parents. Increasing competition
from foreign labor for high- and low-end jobs and limited opportunities for employment in the public
sector contribute to worsening social mobility prospects for the new generation. Disenfranchisement and
frustration are growing, especially in the capital area Malé were many youth migrated with the hope of
building a future.

97.     Limited education opportunities and skills challenge youth capacity to realize their aspirations
though a productive labor market engagement. Employment status is crucial to shape life satisfaction,
wellbeing and self-esteem, especially among young males (WDR 2013) 31. Facing competition from foreign
labor and lacking sufficient skills to face the challenge, Maldivian youth are increasingly confronted with
bleak labor market opportunities and a failure to meet their aspirations in terms of social mobility. The
current economic model has proved unable to provide the youth with the skills and knowledge necessary
to compete on a globalized labor market 32 and low productivity public sector jobs are becoming
increasingly unappealing and scarce due to government budget constraints.

98.      High levels of actual and perceived inequality coupled with a progressive deterioration of the
social contract further contribute to widening youth aspiration gap. As discussed in Chapter 2, high and
increasing levels of inequality between the poorest and the richest segments of the population, as well as
unequal opportunities between Malé and the atolls, all contribute to the emergence of social cleavages
that work against cohesion and social development 33. Moreover, governance constraints, such as the lack
of transparency and accountability, together with the inability of politics to address the most urgent social

31 As discussed in the WDR (2013), job opportunities contribute to determine individuals’ status within a society and how people

view themselves in relation to others.
32 This lack of skills includes technical skills, as well as the so-called ‘soft skills’ to secure employment, and when employed, to

stay in a job, such as positive attitudes toward work and learning, respectful professional relationships, time management and
good attendance, self-esteem and confidence, and sound professional decision-making. Consequently, young Maldivians may not
get the jobs they desire because they are perceived to be less responsible, and have a poorer work ethic than the older generation
or the large numbers of migrant workers. Employers interviewed for a recent gender assessment of the Maldives opined that
they are unwilling to hire young Maldivians because those they had hired in the past regularly came to work late, take
unscheduled leave, are unresponsive to supervisor input, and sometimes vanish altogether without any explanation. World Bank,
(2014c).
33 Empirical evidence strongly points out that income inequality leads to greater social and political instability. See Alesina and

Rodrik, 1994, Alesina et al 1996. Briguglio et al. (2006) include social development among the essential components of economic
resilience in SIDS. According to the authors (ibid: 275), “Social development […] indicates the extent to which social relations in a
society are properly developed, enabling an effective functioning of the economic apparatus without the hindrance of civil unrest.
Social development can also indicate the extent to which effective social dialogue takes place in an economy, which would in turn
enable collaborative approaches towards the undertaking of corrective measures in the face of adverse shocks.”

                                                                                                                                 47
and economic concerns, add to youth frustration and challenge future prospects of inclusive economic
development in Maldives. These ongoing social dynamics contribute to widening the gap between the
adult generation – currently in power and benefiting from the security associated with the redistribution
of the rents from past economic development -- and a young generation struggling to find social space
and identity under uncertain socio-economic circumstances.

99.      Social ills such as gang violence and drug abuse are on the rise, and further contribute to
strengthening the exclusion of “youth at risk” from the social fabric. Anecdotal evidence suggests that
gang participation and violence is on the rise among young men. In Malé alone there are 20-30 active
gangs, each with 50-400 members, a majority of whom have suffered from violence or perpetrated
violence. Moreover, the intensity of gang violence is reportedly rising. 34 This increase in gang violence is
likely an effect of the social, political and economic exclusion of the country’s youth because of their
disengagement from the labor market and other spheres of public life. Gangs offer a form of inclusion by
offering a sense of identity and group belonging, and provide financial rewards: a significant proportion
of young men in gangs are deemed to be engaged in drug dealing. 35 Illicit drug use among gang members
is also increasingly problematic, and is further fueling gang-related and broader social violence. Though
drug users are overwhelmingly male, there is evidence to suggest that it is an increasing problem for
women who are increasingly subject to sexual and gender-based violence. 36

100.     These dynamics might further limit opportunities for socio-economic inclusion, particularly of
Maldivian women. According to the HIES (2010), while the major reason given by both women and men
for being unemployed was their inability to find suitable employment, 22 percent of women cited
household chores as a reason, and another 3 percent were deterred by objection from family members.
Thus, lack of supporting environment in the family was a major factor discouraging a significant number
of women from seeking employment. In particular, marriage and pregnancy at a young age, geographical
isolation, and social norms restricting women’s mobility are factors that limit women’s contribution to
national development.


Environmental vulnerability and sustainability issues
101.     Natural resources represent the country’s main asset but there are growing concerns in terms
of sustainability. Climate change could cause annual economic losses of more than 12 percent of
Maldives’ GDP by 2100. 37 Due to rising sea levels, the entire country could be submerged before the end
of the century as 80 percent of land is less than 1 meter above sea level. With 42 percent of the population
and more than 70 percent of critical infrastructure within 100 meters of shoreline, this would have dire
social and economic consequences, notably for the poorer and most vulnerable. Despite past efforts, the
country is not prepared to withstand a rise in sea levels, as most lifeline infrastructure (such as power
houses, hospitals and harbors), population centers (such as schools) and dwellings are not adequately
designed. Indeed, “the most serious underlying driver of increasing vulnerability to climate change in
Maldives appears to be the absence of systematic adaptation planning and practice. Climatic risks and
long-term resilience are not adequately integrated into island land use planning or into coastal

36 According to data from the most recent DHS, over one-quarter (28.4%) of Maldivian women have experienced physical and/or

sexual violence at some point in their lives by either partners or non-partners. Though this proportion is lower than other South
Asian countries, it is higher than in other middle-income Asian countries like Malaysia (14.5%), Indonesia (3.7%) or the Philippines
(23.6%).

development and protection policies and practice, and past autonomous risk reduction efforts have
sometimes had mal-adaptive effects”. 38 In order to partially address this, the government prepared a
Strategic National Action Plan in June 2011 to integrate Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change
Adaptation, but its actual implementation appears to be limited. 39

102.      However the most pressing issues relate to shortcomings in the management of natural
resources, particularly with regard to sewage and solid waste management. An estimated 248,000 tons
of solid waste was generated in 2007, most coming from urban areas (Figure 38), and this figure is
expected to increase to 660,000 tons by 2020. 40 Despite the scale of the challenge, most of the 134 Island
Waste Management Centers, covering 66 percent of the islands, are not fully functional, as no program
for transport of waste from these centers to a regional or central waste-processing center has been
established. 41 Regulation seems to be poorly enforced. Resorts, in particular, have been accused of
dumping waste in the sea and not using incinerators as mandated by law (Figure 39), although this
assertion has not been documented. Adequate management of solid waste is hindered by the high cost
of service delivery in the country, associated with the low volume of waste on each island and the high
cost of transportation. Land scarcity also limits the options for establishing and managing adequate
landfills. The issue of sewage and solid waste is particularly challenging, as it has a direct impact on the
country’s most valuable natural resources – coral reefs and fisheries. Uncontrolled waste disposal and
floating debris at tourist resorts are the most visible threats to the country’s reputation as a pristine high-
end tourist destination. They also affect the quality of ground water, with a direct impact on island
communities.

103.     Most of the Maldivian population depends on the ground water and rain water as source of
fresh water, which are at high risk due to climate change. As Maldives consists of low-lying islands, the
rise in sea-levels would force salt water intrusion into fresh water lens. Minimum projected sea level rise
of 1mm per year shows that the groundwater safe yield will decrease at least by 3 percent between 2012
and 2030. In addition, in most inhabited islands the groundwater is contaminated due to untreated
sewage disposal into the ground. It is estimated that per capita water availability will decline by 34 percent

from the 2009 level of 103 cubic meters per year to 76.6 cubic meters per year by 2035. The shifting in
the rainfall pattern from drier and more inter-annually variable rainfall regime over the next 20 years and
increase in temperature of 0.5°C to 3.5°C expected by 2100 will increase water demand leading to high
competition over scarce resources, making water security for potable and irrigation purposes continue to
be a serious problem. 42 Confronted by diminishing resources, more than 100 islands have requested
emergency fresh water shipments since 2005, and the challenge is likely to increase over time due to
continued population pressure. 43 The institutional framework for managing fresh water supply needs
strengthening, as the government does not have any single and unifying body overseeing the water and
sanitation sector and therefore no quality checks are performed.

104.    The country is also vulnerable to shocks to drinking water supply due to the lack of back-up
arrangements. This vulnerability was shown clearly by the water crisis in December 2014, when a fire in
a water treatment plant in Malé led to acute shortages of drinking water and required emergency supplies
from neighboring countries.

105.    The loss of coral reef represents a threat to the sustainability of the tourism industry and
fisheries, and is also compounding the effects of climate change. Coral reefs are a major tourist attraction
in Maldives but are affected by the rise in sea temperature and pollution However, the damage to coral
reefs caused by harbor dredging and reclamation are much more significant now as a result of the current
development model. Other pressures include damage caused by divers, illegal collection of corals and
unsustainable exploitation of high-value reef resources. As coral reefs also play an important role in
protecting shores against rising sea levels, their destruction may also aggravate the impact of climate
change. Furthermore, the loss of coral reef is resulting in the loss of valuable bait fish which are used for
tuna fisheries, a major source of food and income in outer atolls.

106.     Institutional capacity for managing the country’s natural resources is relatively weak. Because
of limited resources, environmental management is largely done on a limited and voluntary basis on the
islands. Governmental environmental agencies face important issues in retatining scarce qualified staff.

107.     Maldives has a significant potential for lowering the cost of electricity generation through wider
use of renewable energy. At the present time power is supplied by diesel generators through isolated,
island-specific grids, spread over 900 square kilometers. The country relies almost entirely on imported
fossil fuel to supply the generators, costing about 15 percent of GDP in 2013. Furthermore, due to the
high costs of domestic electricity production and distribution, the country has a long history of subsidized
energy prices that have contributed to over-consumption and limited incentives opportunities to invest
in alternative and environmentally sustainable renewable energy sources. Currently, the cumulative
installed photovoltaic-based generation capacity is less than 2 MW, spread across several islands and
programs. While the installed PV capacity is still limited, it has demonstrated its viability as a source of
cheaper and cleaner energy. Going forward, wider adoption of renewable energy will require, among
other things, innovative financing approaches such as PPPs and a review of the incentives scheme,
including the current subsidies on diesel-based electricity generation.

                                              Key Messages

 •   Maldives main challenge is to improve inclusiveness of the development model
 •   Tourism has developed as enclave model; opportunities for inclusiveness require improving:
         o Transparency lease allocation for resorts’ development
         o Linkages to local economy
         o Employment opportunities for local population
         o Opportunities for sustainable community-based tourism development
 •   Fisheries development is key sector for improving incomes of the poor; opportunities for sector
     development require improving:
         o Industry competitiveness
         o Management of natural resources
         o Investment opportunities in sub-industries
 •   Agriculture has untapped potential for growth and employment generation; opportunities for
     sector development require improving:
         o Linkages between supply and demand/value chains with tourism
         o Adoption of new technologies

                                             Knowledge Gaps

 •   Lack of value chain analysis of the tourism industry/key agriculture crops
 •   Lack of standard statistics of the fisheries/agriculture sector
 •   Lack of analysis of sustainability risk in fisheries sector
 •   Lack of clarity about government’s plans for Special Economic Zones and large infrastructure
     projects



108.    Maldives has experienced a high pace of growth, but the main challenge will be to enhance its
inclusiveness going forward. As discussed in previous sections, the Maldivian economy is dominated by
tourism, while tradable sectors and physical exports are largely limited to fisheries. Tourism has leveraged
the country’s endowments to underpin a very rapid growth, but the largely high-end tourism industry has
developed in an enclave way, with limited linkages with the local communities. Fisheries are a significant
source of employment, particularly for the poor, but the industry has stalled and much of the value is lost
through low-added-value exports. The small size of the economy, together with other structural
environment factors, has limited the development of other economic activities. Accordingly, the rapid
overall economic growth of the country has not been accompanied by a commensurate growth in
opportunities and jobs for the Maldivian population – especially for the youth, and for women whether
youth or adult.

Tourism


109.    Tourism is the most important industry in Maldives. Tourism constitutes by far the biggest
contributor to GDP at 28 percent, and is the greatest generator of foreign exchange earnings at more than
60 percent in 2014. Revenue from the sector accounts for 38 percent of government revenue, derived
from various taxes and lease of islands. 44 Additional contributions from airport service charges, import

110.    Tourism in Maldives has grown steadily since 1970s and Maldives has managed to position itself
as a high-end destination (Figure 40). Tourism in Maldives has developed as a supply-driven industry
whose development was initially led by the private sector - as opposed to through government policies or
support programs. Notably, while the supply for touristic facilities is constantly increasing, the country so
far has been largely able to maintain both high occupancy rates (Figure 41) as well as a high premium
(deemed as high as 40 percent 45 over other touristic destinations). Such premium is deemed to be based
on the unique natural resources of the country, as well as on the exclusivity of facilities – which, in turn,
is underpinned by the geographic dispersion of islands and the enclave conditions of resorts.

111.     However, the sustainability of such premium cannot be taken for granted. The tourism industry
has been susceptible to external shocks and changes in global trends. Most recently, the global financial
crisis prompted a structural shift in the composition of arrivals, from Europe to Asia. Between 2008 and
2013, the share of European tourists fell by 26 percentage points mainly due to weaker economic
conditions in Europe. Conversely, the share of Chinese tourists expanded by 23 percentage points (Figure
42). This shift in demand was pursued by the industry, which made important marketing efforts in China
and Middle East to compensate for the declining demand from Europe. While this shift helped maintain
the volume of arrivals and occupancy, the overall profitability of the industry appears to be declining. The

average length of stay fell from eight nights in 2008 to 6.1 in 2014 and is expected to continue declining
as Chinese travelers favor shorter stays than European ones (Figure 43) and have a lower demand for
ancillary activities such as diving and fishing, which generate additional revenue for the industry.

112.    And increase in supply may enhance downward pressures on the profitability of tourism. The
volume of development of new tourism capacity has been growing and is expected to continue growing.
At the present time, there are 89 new resorts under development with a planned capacity of 14,153
additional beds 46. If completed, these new resorts would increase the supply of beds by 52 percent over
the established capacity at the end of 2014. This evolution could translate into an increase in revenues as
has been the case in the past, but it could also reach an inflection point where increased capacity will start
driving down prices and premium. Lack of planning has led to sub-optimal growth and development
proposition as potential resort developments are brought to market with little analysis or coordination
with other sectors (such as transport 47 or skills training). While investor interest has remained strong,
these challenges often threaten the financial viability of new projects and their ability to attract financing.

113.    Governance shortcomings in the current model for allocation of resort leases may be hampering
the development of tourism and preventing the country from maximizing benefits and enhancing
inclusive growth in three main ways. First, although the resort sector is open to competition on paper, in
practice the sector is dominated by a few large groups. In theory the legal framework for tourism allows
for open and competitive bidding on resorts, although islands in which the government makes an
investment are exempted from the bidding process. 48 In practice it appears that there are significant
barriers to entry, 49 which may have prevented the country from maximizing the benefits from its natural
resources. As a result, as of the end of 2013, the four largest tourism groups (including two of the pioneers)
control 31 percent of resorts and 38 percent of the resort beds. Their influence has remained strong over

114.     Second, the current methods for allocating leases has translated into sub-optimal investment
levels, with a large number of leased islands remaining undeveloped or suffering severe delays in
construction. At present there are 106 licenses granted for new resorts, but there have been significant
delays in construction of the planned resorts. Indeed, one-third of the licensed resorts have not come into
operation more than five years after the license was granted, and 22 licensed resorts have experienced
delays of around 10 years. Altogether, the licensed but unfinished resorts would account for 21,000
additional beds 51 that are planned but have not materialized as a source of income for the country (which
would increase by 78 percent the capacity in the country; create 31,000 additional direct jobs; 52 and
provide significant revenue flows to the country through taxes and duties). The significant delays in
construction of resorts after a license is granted have been blamed on a host of factors, including lack of
financing. While these factors may indeed become hurdles once a license has been granted, the delays in
construction appear to evidence significant shortcomings in the process followed to grant the licenses in
the first place. Stringent and clear criteria for licensing of resorts would have enabled the country to
ensure that licenses are granted to investors than can demonstrate the qualifications, experience and
financial ability to develop the resorts shortly after licenses are granted. Clear enforcement processes
would enable authorities to cancel non-performing leases and grant them to better qualified investors.

115.     Third, entities set up to promote the development of tourism may be helping to undermine the
governance of the sector. The Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Cooperation (MMPRC) is as a
state-owned enterprise formed in 2009 to promote and market the tourism industry. The Maldives
Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) was set up in 2006 as an entity with 47 percent government
ownership and 53 percent private shareholding. Both MMRPC and MTDC can acquire leases for resort
islands without being subjected to the standard bidding process and, in some cases, at below market
rates. In turn, these leases can be developed or subleased to private parties. While the Ministry of Tourism
has aimed to strengthen governance of leases through implementation of standard operation procedures,
these subleases are not subject to the standard operating procedures of the Ministry of Tourism and both
MTDC and MMRPC lack procedures to ensure transparency in subleases and prevent corruption. Further,
the composition of the boards of directors of MTDC and MMPRC has raised concerns on lack of
transparency on appointments and potential conflicts of interest. The later stems from the fact that board
members include heads of private tourism companies that can benefit from subleases. 53 Notably, MTDC
holds five leases that were granted nine years ago and represent an expected capacity of 1,280 beds that
have not come into operation. This, together with governance concerns on their operations, calls into
question the extent to which these two organizations are contributing to development of the tourism
industry in a way that maximizes the benefits to the country.

116.     Investment climate and political risk concerns may also undermine the ability of Maldives to
attract reputable investors in the future. Recent political unrest (which prompted travel advisories from
various countries) together with international media reports highlighting the risk of radicalization have
created concerns among tourism private stakeholders of a potential slowdown in demand from Western
tourists as well as potential long-term deterioration of Maldives brand. Future additional investment may
also be affected by investors’ perception of instability in regulatory environment. This includes: a lack of
formal consultation between government agencies, private sector and civil society on key policy decisions;
a regulatory environment in a state of constant flux that leaves businesses financially exposed and unable
to plan; and a potentially insufficient implementation period for the industry to adapt to new compliance

53At least one case has been identified of a private company linked to a board member which has been granted a sublease
from MMPRC.

                                                                                                                          55

in Maldives (see also section on investment climate below).

117.     And the industry has developed as an enclave, with limited positive spillovers to the local
communities. The country’s unique island geography presents many natural as well as socio-cultural
barriers to integration. It is spatially dispersed with small surface areas, and has limited transport
connections and a small population. As a result, the tourism industry has grown up in relative economic
isolation with heavy reliance on foreign capital, foreign labor and limited economic linkages. There are
also significant structural and social barriers to Maldivian women’s employment in the tourism sector that
contribute to its lack of inclusiveness.

118.    Given the importance of tourism in Maldives, a more inclusive industry may hold the key to
improving shared prosperity in the country. The industry is dominated by luxury enclave resorts, which
have grown with heavy reliance on foreign capital and foreign labor and limited linkages to the rest of the
economy. While there are a number of ancillary industries that have grown alongside tourism (notably
through demands on the transport, construction and communication sectors), the linkages between
tourism and the local economy remain modest. The participation of women in either the tourism sector
per se or in ancillary industries is low. Tourism generated 38 percent of government tax revenue (2013) 55
and 83 percent of the country’s foreign exchange earnings from exports of goods and services, but
substantial leakages undermine the economic and social benefits of the industry. A large proportion of
the revenue generated through tourism is lost through import of products, import of labor and financial
outflows related to dividends and external debt servicing (as external debt largely fuels resorts
development) and offshore booking of revenues originated by resorts. These areas are further discussed
below.

119.     Better linkages between the resorts and the local enterprises may help to leverage on tourism
growth for development of other tradable sectors. According to anecdotal evidence, close to 100 percent
of the goods required by resorts are imported. It is suggested that local enterprises lack the ability to
provide goods with the quality and reliability needed to cater to the expectations of the high-end resorts.
Government policies supporting import substitution have not translated into a visible growth in the real
sector, which remains hampered by, among other things, the small size of the economy (with limited
economies of scale), high dispersion of the population, and high transport costs. Given the structural
limitations of the country, the potential for backward linkages between tourism and local enterprises is
likely modest and probably limited to a handful of products.

120.    Tourism is a large and rapidly growing source of jobs, but most of them are not seized by local
population due to a host of factors. While tourism creates a large number of jobs, the Maldivian
population does not take advantage of them. Across the board, only 15 percent of employed Maldivian
men and 4 percent of employed Maldivian women work in the tourism sector, while the number of foreign
nationals employed in the sector has increased constantly over time (Figures 45and 46). A government-
imposed quota (requiring 55 percent of employees in tourism to be Maldivian nationals) is customarily
unmet 56 and, in general, appears to have failed to sustainably enhance the participation of Maldivian


54 A commonly-cited example is the T-GST, increased from 8 percent to 12 percent in November 2014, and a green tax of US$6 a
bed-night that will be introduced at the end of 2015, replacing the bed tax.
55 Tourist tax, Goods & Services Tax on Tourism, Airport Service Charge
56 According to the 2014 census (published by the National Bureau of statistics) the foreign nationals account for 58.4 percent of

all tourism employees, but anecdotal evidence suggests that this figure may me significantly higher.

                                                                                                                              56
nationals in tourism. Tourism in Maldives has created more than 28,000 direct jobs 57 and government
targets for new resorts 58 imply an added annual requirement for 3,300 new staff. The relative importance
of this figure is evident when compared to the unemployment figures in the country The total number of
the unemployed in Maldives is estimated around 11,000, of which around 8,000 are young people. The
lack of participation in tourism jobs is particularly dire among women, who account for less than 3 percent
of the labor in the industry.

121.     The obstacles to enhance broader participation of the Maldivian nationals in tourism appear to
be manifold. Information collected from stakeholders, civil society and youth through interviews and
consultations during the preparation of this diagnostic identified a number of factors that appear to be at
play in restricting broader participation of the local population on tourism. These include: (1) reservation
wage that is too high for unskilled jobs; (2) lack of skills for technical and managerial jobs (see section on
skills below); (3) social norms (see section on youth below); and (4) lack of adequate transport (resorts
that are close to inhabited islands and have good transport links have a much higher proportion of
Maldivian workers). 59 However, data does not currently exist to validate these perceptions in a conclusive
manner.

122.     A nascent segment of community-based tourism may represent a valuable option for
diversification and inclusive growth (Figures 47 and 48). Most importantly, this segment appears to
create opportunities for tourism that is well integrated with local communities. Guesthouse development
is the fastest growing segment. New legislation in 2009 allowed islanders to develop their homes into
guesthouses. This new product has grown rapidly, totaling approximately 238 facilities with 3,565 rooms,
with likelihood of doubling in the next three years. Every atoll (bar one) is now hosting some kind of
guesthouse or hotel on inhabited islands, with the majority concentrated in the urban centers of


57 According to the 2014 census (published by the National Bureau of statistics) there were 11,425 Maldivian employees (10,991
male and 435 female) at resorts, and 16,342 foreign employees (14,339 male and 2,003 female). However, according to the
Ministry of Tourism, by early 2015, a total of 23,917 resort beds creates an approximate total employment demand (at a ratio of
1:1.5) of 31,000 staff.

123.    Notably, the potential for integration of this market segment
with local communities appears high. First, the proportion of Maldivian
                                                                                    34 guesthouses (+6
nationals working in this market segment (estimated by the industry at                   pipeline)
75 percent of total workforce, see box) is significantly higher than in          4 cafes/ restaurants
resorts (estimated below 45 percent). Second, there is evidence of a
nascent ‘ecosystem’ of local suppliers of goods and services around                3 dive centers
guesthouses. Third, closer interaction between tourists and islanders in
an every-day setting has been relatively positive in this situation, and
                                                                                      1 laundry

18.      Growth in this segment has some limitations and risks. It is
likely to be highly concentrated around transport hubs (airports) since
                                                                                75% Maldivian staff
elasticity of demand will be lower in this segment. Most importantly, the
rapid and unplanned growth of this market segment has already
translated into visible negative impact on the environment
compounding the existing challenges in inhabited islands. Waste
management, land-use planning, population displacement and
environmental management are some of the issues at the forefront of
inhabited islands already. Simply supporting the increase of supply will
put pressure on island resources to the detriment of all.

124.    There are still unrealized opportunities for linkages between tourism and local providers of
goods and services. The tourism industry is a large and rapidly growing source of demand for goods. In
2014, food items alone (grains, fruit, meat, beverages) were imported at a total cost of$407 million 60 and
demand is expected to increase substantially as the sector grows over time (see figure). The tourism

sector’s demand for inputs represents a major opportunity for local producers (Figure 49). But at the
present time most of the goods are imported, given limitations in local supply. Resorts report 61 a high
willingness to purchase inputs locally and are prepared to pay a premium for fresh produce. Maldives is
deemed to have potential for competitiveness in producing a number of agriculture and fishery goods, 62
which are already being produced successfully, but in quantities still lower than demand. 63 Local
cooperatives and agricultural-focused islands 64 have already demonstrated the viability for local
production, but they are still hampered by infrastructure, quality and scale shortcomings. Encouraging
women’s participation in such local production could also have a beneficial impact on women’s
unemployment, which is higher than that of men, and in addressing high poverty levels among women-
headed households.

125.     Opportunities for service-provision linkages more constrained. Most resorts own and operate
all of their support services and ancillary functions 65 due to factors including geo-spatial challenges and
quality in service provision. Accordingly, opportunities may be limited to:
     • A small number of services that Maldivians have a competitive advantage in providing, and are
         equally in demand by the tourism sector. These include authentic and cultural-heritage based

Applying other filters such as consistent and growing demand from the tourism industry, and a low barrier to entry for Maldivian
producers yields a list that includes; bananas, papaya, coconuts, lettuce, cucumber, flowers and tuna amongst others.
63 For example, according to Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture’s estimates (no country-wide statistics exist) local producers

are deemed to produce around 400,000 kgs of bananas, a 52 percent of the estimated demand from resorts (755,000 kgs per
year).

Fisheries

126.     The fisheries sector is a critical contributing sector for the country’s national economy and forms
the most important primary economic activity in almost all of the country’s inhabited islands. Before
the development of tourism, fisheries was the most important industry and source of growth for Maldives
and, to a large extent, fisheries remains an important reference in Maldives culture. Although the relative
importance of the fisheries sector has declined since the late 1970s (due mainly to the rapid growth of
tourism), its role in the Maldivian economy remains significant. Fisheries remain a large, source of
employment (see below), the largest source of physical exports, one of the few local industries supplying
the touristic resorts, and a major source of food supply for the local market. In 2011, it accounted directly
for 1.4 percent of GDP and, and currently generates $110 million in export revenue.

127.    Maldives has benefitted in terms of both food security and trade. Along with the tourism sector,
the productive fisheries sector has been a leader in the country’s growth and development. The fisheries
sector has remained vital in terms of trade, employment and subsistence especially on islands not
dominated by the tourism industry. With a fishing-fleet of about 800 national vessels 66, close to 10,000
individual fishers and their families depend on fishing. In addition, fish is a staple food across the
archipelago and it remains the main source of protein for the population, covering around 88 percent of
the total animal protein intake (FAO, 2011). Maldives is among the highest fish consuming countries in
the world 67; 49 percent of the fish catch is consumed locally. 68 Fish and fish products account for almost
98 percent of Maldives physical exports.

128.     However, the industry is experiencing a declining trend (Figures 50 and 51 and Table 1). A
marked decrease (-28 percent) in catch volumes between 2006 and 2013 has undermined the
contribution of fisheries to GDP (-54 percent) and translated into rapidly decreasing employment in direct
fishing activities (32 percent reduction between 2006 and 2013 69). While these figures do not include
jobs in processing and ancillary industries, the reduction in direct employment is particularly concerning
given the fact that fisheries represent the single most important source of jobs in many islands, especially
those that are not close to the capital or touristic resorts. The reduction in women’s employment in
fisheries is particularly dire; the increased mechanization of the fisheries has largely taken over the fish
processing activities that were the foundation of female employment in this sector. Thus women’s work
in fisheries has been phased out such that female employment is practically nil in this sector. 69 In spite of
these negative trends, the value of fisheries exports has increased over the same period, reflecting higher
prices for fisheries exports and thus signaling the unrealized potential economic contribution that a more
thriving fisheries industry could make to the country.



66 The Maldivian government imposed the termination of foreign long-line licensing in May 2010.
67 It is assessed that 341 kcal of fish are consumed per capita per day (FAO, 2011).
68 Worldwide, about a billion people rely on fish as their main source of animal proteins. About 20% of the world’s population

derives at least one-fifth of its animal protein intake from fish, and some small island states depend almost exclusively on fish.

129.      Maldives fisheries sector benefits from high value stocks, but its recent trends highlight
vulnerability to external factors. While the country benefits from access to vast fishing resources spread
over 90,000 sq. km of territorial waters, the bulk of fisheries catch (82 percent) is dominated by two types
of tuna (skipjack and yellow fin), which are exported. The Maldivian tuna is considered as a premium
product benefitting both from high quality fish stocks as well as sustainable fishing methods (pole and
line). In 2013, 95 percent of the 130,000 tons of fish catch was tuna 70. The current fish catch consists of
skipjack tuna (57 percent), yellowfin tuna (35 percent), and other kinds of tuna (3 percent). Catches of
skipjack tuna have decreased drastically over the past years due to a mix of factors including overfishing,
higher fuel costs, temperature rise leading to change in schools aggregation and lack of more effective
regional, eco-systemic management of the shared skipjack stock. Conversely, catches of yellowfin tuna
are increasing thanks to its increasing price in foreign markets and the rapid growth of the hand-line
fishery (Figures 52 and 53). Reef fish, which account for 16 percent of catch, are mainly used for internal

130.     Governance deficiencies appear to have hampered the development of fisheries and their value
to the economy. The market for skipjack tuna is controlled by a four processing licenses. 71 On the contrary,
yellowfin tuna is not regulated through similar licenses. Interestingly, these two market segments have
evolved in a very different manner. For skipjack tuna, the catch volumes have plummeted, the tuna is
largely exported as raw commodity to intermediary markets and its export price is low and volatile. On
the contrary, the (unlicensed) market for yellowfin tuna has a different pattern of development, with rapid
growth in catch volume, development of 12 EU-certified processing facilities, which give it access to final
markets, and a more stable and higher export price (estimated at 2.5 higher than that of skipjack tuna,
Figure 54). Accordingly, governance issues seem to influence the development of fisheries, including the
industry’s ability to reap the value of the country’s stocks and develop ancillary processing industries, as
well as the levels of investment that the private sector undertakes in the fisheries industry. The very
different development trends of the licensed and the unlicensed market segments call into question the
need and/or the suitability of the current licensing framework for skipjack tuna. If licenses for processing
are maintained, it appears necessary to revise the licensing process in order to ensure that: licenses are
granted in a transparent and competitive manner, and; the selection criteria for licensees emphasizes
technical and financial capabilities as well as fit-for-purpose considerations.

131.    Environmentally friendly fishing methods for tuna have enhanced Maldives’ ability to access
premium markets. The Maldivian pole-and-line fishery is one of the largest coastal fisheries in the Indian
Ocean, and is estimated to account for 18-20 percent of the total catch of skipjack tuna in the region 72.
The fishery received considerable attention as a potential model for coastal states, owing to both its
commercial success and its adherence to ecological best practices. Pole-and-line fishery has been
promoted for its environmentally friendly nature 73. That has enabled a pathway to the export-markets of
Europe and allowed it to extract a premium compared to other similar fisheries. However, it is important

71 There are 4 skipjack tuna collection permit holders, who have exclusive contracts with the government to purchase, process
and export skipjack fish from designated fishery zones.
72 Adam, M.S. and Kolody, Dale, (2011).
73 In 2012, the Maldivian skipjack tuna fishery successfully completed the process of official certification by the Marine

Stewardship Council (MSC) recognizing the best practice nature of this fishery.

                                                                                                                                                         62
to note that while pole and line fishing is deemed environmentally friendly due to low by-catch, it does
not prevent over-fishing, which has indeed been a problem (see below).

132.     However, the sustainability of fisheries is jeopardized by inadequate fisheries management.
Tuna and reef fisheries are either fully or over-exploited and catches are stagnating or declining as
mentioned above. Destructive fishing methods (especially for reef fish) and over-exploitation of reef fish 74
also raise issues of sustainability. This is mostly due to sub-optimal fisheries management, environmental
change resulting in increased sea surface temperature, and the estimated high levels of illegal, unreported
and unregulated fishing in the Exclusive Economic Zone. Development and management of capture
fisheries is governed by the Fisheries Law of Maldives. However, the emphasis of the law is mainly on
protecting local fishers and the sovereignty of Maldivian waters, with less consideration of fisheries
management. Other than two tuna fisheries, there are currently few management measures in place for
the local harvesting sector. Some important steps have, however, already been undertaken: a fisheries
licensing scheme 75 was introduced in 2010, and the Environmental Protection and Conservation Act
contains provisions to limit fishing for the conservation of biological diversity through 33 protected areas
and natural reserves.

133.     Overfishing of reef fish is a risk to the sustainability of the tuna fisheries as well as tourism. The
sustainability of reef fish is threatened by three factors: (1) The tuna fishery in Maldives is heavily
dependent on the coral reefs for bait. For every 7-10 kg of tuna caught, a kilogram of live bait is required,
suggesting a bait conversion ratio of 8:1 on average 76; (2) anecdotal evidence identifies negative impacts
of bait fishing on the ecosystem due to removal of juvenile reef fish and on physical environment due to
anchoring pole-and-line boats in coral areas; and (3) demand for reef fish has increased threefold 77 in the
last 15 years, with the increasing demand coming from tourist resorts and export industry. While there
are no reliable statistics to validate over-fishing of reef fisheries, if overfished the health of the coral reef
ecosystem (a major touristic attraction) can be significantly affected. If unchecked, there is a high potential
of over-fishing, which could result in exhausting of stocks as experienced for giant clam fishery in 1990 78
and the near collapse of sea cucumber fishery in 1997. Fishery bans were imposed on black coral, giant
clams in 1991, turtles in 1995 and sharks in 2010. However, there is little adequate monitoring to ensure
the effectiveness of these bans.

134.     The sustainability of fisheries is also threatened by climate change. Climate change impacts such
as dilution of seawater with the sea level rise and higher temperatures can result in the mortality of corals.
Changes in surface water temperature and ocean acidification can compromise the calcification potential
of coral reefs due to changes in the association between corals and their symbiotic micro-organisms;
hence, result in slow growth and productivity. 79 Coral reefs are made further vulnerable due to

75 According to the “Licensing regulation for fishing, processing and aquaculture intending for export” every fisher intending to

export fish or sell to an exporter is required to get licensed under the regulation. The license is renewed annually after paying a
nominal fee

dependency of reproduction on environmental conditions. Similarly, tuna is highly attuned to the
biophysical conditions of the pelagic environment, particularly El Nino Southern Oscillation and associated
changes in surface sea temperatures. Recent observations of changes in tuna aggregation and migration
patterns observed is partly attributed to the rising ocean temperatures and ocean acidification that are
altering marine ecosystems and impacting the fish distribution. Tuna movement and abundance in the
Indian Ocean is closely linked to the climate-change-driven ocean productivity. 80

135.    Threats to the health of the coral reefs that are significant to the fishery sector also come from
habitat degradation and loss due to pollution, harbor construction and reclamation. However, the
extent of the damage that these activities inflict on the health of coral reefs and marine species has not
been quantified (see also section on environmental sustainability).

136.    In light of declining trends in the capture fisheries, marine aquaculture is nascent in Maldives
and can be an important source of economic growth and diversification, poverty alleviation and foreign
exchange earnings. With a view to diversifying the country’s fisheries sector, the government has been
implementing pilot aquaculture projects for a decade with pearl oysters, Maldivian clownfish, and brown
marbled groupers. A private aquaculture farm is also producing sea cucumbers, producing the larvae in
hatcheries before growing them in mangroves and lagoons. The future development of aquaculture is
however hindered by limited availability of financing and technology. Operators are also expressing the
need to better define the legal and policy framework to clarify the business environment, develop the
value-chains and facilitate longer-term investments and research.


Agriculture

137.     Maldives produces less than an estimated 10 percent of its food requirements, reaching self-
sufficiency in fish only. All other staples are imported (Figure 55). As a result, food items account for 21
percent of imports 81. Food imports are required not only to meet domestic food demand for the Maldivian
people but are also essential to cater to the tourism industry in Maldives. Outside of Malé, fishing and
subsistence agriculture are the main sources of food security and livelihoods for the vast majority of the
people. Except for coconut and fresh tuna, 90 percent of all food items are imported.

138.    Food security concerns have revitalized interest in the development of the local agriculture
production. Import dependency, limited storage facilities and ad hoc distribution pose food security risks.
In response to the recent food and fuel crises, Maldives has integrated food security considerations into
national planning. It has removed tariffs on imported food items, agricultural inputs and fuel, and is
looking for ways to intensify and diversify agriculture and fisheries. The government is working with
international agencies and private-sector partners to develop agriculture by introducing new and
innovative techniques and technology to strengthen the contribution of farming to rural development.

139.    Agriculture is a relatively minor activity in Maldives and has contributed only marginally to long-
term growth. Agriculture accounts for 4 percent of GDP (even though its value has grown in real terms
over the past 20 years). Agriculture has traditionally been undertaken as subsistence crops in 12 atolls,
and only recently higher volume production has been developed (Figure 56).

arable. In 2013, approximately 50 islands large enough to support commercial agriculture activity had
been leased for agricultural production, spanning a total area of about 1,300 hectares. Bananas, coconuts,
fresh fruits and vegetables (papaya, eggplant, melons, pineapple and chilies) are the main commercial
crops produced locally in Maldives.

141.     Maldives, however, faces a number of structural challenges and resource constraints that will
limit the country’s potential for agriculture development. Arable land is extremely limited and scattered
among many locations, inhibiting the horizontal expansion of farming areas and the achievement of
economies of scale. Soils are generally infertile or unsuitable for productive agriculture, requiring high
levels of supplemental fertilization. Fresh water resources for irrigation purposes are limited and new
irrigation technologies and technologies to desalinize seawater for agriculture production purposes may
be prohibitively costly. Start-up investments in high-tech agriculture, including production facilities,
storage and transport infrastructure, and the associated economic risks are high as well. Ensuring
predictable product quantities from smallholder producers and ensuring product quality that meet
expectations and standards of resorts will be challenging. Public R&D and extension support systems will
be costly to establish domestically (as opposed to R&D systems in fisheries where the potential for
expansion and take by private sector is significantly larger). Given these constraints, Maldives will remain
dependent on imports (and vulnerable to the associated risk of price shocks) for most if its food demand
into the future.

142.    There are however, a number of opportunities to capitalize on agriculture for local income
growth. Though no official data exist, the linkages between local agricultural production and the tourism
industry are still limited. Anecdotal evidence suggests that concerns on volume, quality and reliability of
local production significantly reduce the incentives for resorts to source agricultural produce locally, in
favor of imports. In spite of that, market participants from both supply and demand consider that there
may be potential to further and more systematically exploit comparative local advantage in the
production of various fruits and vegetables to cater to the resorts (see section on tourism). Such an
emphasis may also have the added benefit of increasing women’s employment, since agriculture has a
predominantly female labor force (women represent 60 percent of total employment in agriculture).
Currently, mostly bananas, melons, papaya are produced locally for resorts but it may be worthwhile to
analyze more systematically what other high-value fruits and vegetable are suitable for cultivation.

143.      In addition to broadening production choices and testing cultivation feasibility of a larger pool
of fruits and vegetables, the feasibility of low-cost smallholder greenhouse technologies combined with
household based-irrigation/ ‘fertigation 82’ systems could be explored. Producer groups or cooperatives
of smallholders could help to bundle extension and marketing/ branding support, including the operating
of local collection, grading, cooling and storage facilities, as well as transport to markets or consumers.
Most likely, direct marketing arrangements between producer groups and selected resorts will be the
most viable model for high-value agriculture. Corporate Social Responsibility schemes of international
resort brands to promote community-based organic agriculture could be explored with support from and
in partnership with specialized NGOs and government. Although there might be potential to strengthen
the linkages between local producers and the tourism sector through such arrangements, local producers
will continue to face production risks, as well as demand fluctuations due to the seasonality of tourist
arrivals.

                                                    Key Messages

 Constraints to growth and shared prosperity include:
 • Challenging investment climate constraining creation of new firms and growth of existing ones
 • Limitations in access to finance reduce the ability of the private sector to grow
 • Governance shortcomings undermine the ability of the private sector to grow in a sustainable and
    equitable manner and have hampered the ability of Maldives to maximize the benefits from its
    natural resources as a foundation for shared growth
 • Limitations of education sector and mismatch between supply and demand for skills.
 • High, unsustainable and increasingly regressive social spending

Structural constraints

144.     The geography and population dispersion in Maldives creates a unique set of structural
constraints, beyond those experienced by other small island states. In line with other small island states,
size challenges limit Maldives’ production base and competitiveness (Box 4). The country is vulnerable to
external shocks. In fact, the volatility of its GDP growth is among the highest of all countries in the world
(Box 3). Similarly, Maldives has a narrow economic base (tourism and fisheries), and the small size of the
economy limits its ability to sustainably develop local production of other goods or services, enhancing its
reliance on imports. While the tourism resort industry is able to access foreign capital through FDI and
borrowing, most other sectors are not, thereby further limiting their ability to grow. Beyond that, as
opposed to many small island states, which are composed of a single island, Maldives is a widely dispersed
multi-island state with population disperse among more than 190 inhabited islands.

145.     As an illustration, island transport facilities are limited leading to high inter-island transport
costs and limited connectivity. Maldives’ islands are dispersed within 90,000 square kilometers of
territorial waters. As of 2005 only 105 inhabited islands (58 percent of all inhabited islands) had adequate
harbor and access facilities. 83 As of 2011, 25 islands still had no harbor facilities. 84 To illustrate this point
further, while transporting a 20-foot container from Singapore to Male would cost about $1,200, the cost
for transporting building materials to an island would be about the same ($1,000-1,100) with additional
costs incurred due to lack of jetty facilities in some of the islands. 85

146.     As a result of these challenges, the cost of providing basic services in a fragmented country is
raised across the board, and public expenditure in Maldives is structurally high. Maldives’ public
spending is well above the level predicted for countries with a similar GDP per capita, although a number
of other highly dispersed island states (Kiribati, Micronesia, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands) have
an even higher level of public spending (Figure 57). Indeed, when taking into account its small size (leading
to relatively high fixed costs of government), its insularity (a scattered population across an archipelago
increases the marginal cost of service delivery), the duality of its economy (using taxing and spending to
redistribute resort rents) and its openness (larger government provides insurance against volatile
incomes), Maldives moves closer to but still above the predicted level of spending.

147.     The small and dispersed population presents the country with a public service and
infrastructure dilemma. With its population dispersed over many islands across long distances, the
country faces the choice whether to address the challenge of the high cost of service delivery through
consolidation of population closer to Malé or through improving services and connectivity to populations
at their current locations. Each choice will generate different demands on public services such as health,
education and infrastructure, and will require a strengthening public investment management capacity.

More than 40 countries have a population under 1.5 million, out of which 26 are small island states.
These countries vary greatly in their level of development and the size of their economies. They are
also spread out geographically, with most of them clustered in the Caribbean, the Pacific and in Africa.
Despite their diversity, these countries share a common set of development challenges.
Size
Vulnerability to economic shocks and income volatility. Because of the small size of their economies,
growth strategies in small states rely on foreign markets. A high degree of openness however means
that they are heavily exposed to external shocks in global markets. Moreover, their narrow resource
base and small domestic markets prevent small economies from diversifying into a wide range of
activities, making them more vulnerable to terms of trade shocks. When one dominant activity declines,
it has an impact throughout the economy, exposing the population to income volatility that can create
additional hardships as the poorest are less able to weather shocks to their incomes. Government
revenues are also volatile because they rely more heavily on taxing imports as a source of revenue. As
tariffs are reduced, so is the government’s income.
Limited capacity. Because of their size, small states are traditionally face challenges in training and
retaining the right skills in the public sector. They also tend to have larger public sectors than other
countries. In some states, a widely scattered population adds to the challenge. Small states also lack
sufficient institutional capacity to participate fully in international fora, which can profoundly affect
their economies.
Difficulty accessing external capital. Access to global capital markets is important for small states, and
is one way to compensate for adverse shocks and income volatility. But private markets tend to see
small states as more risky than larger countries, so spreads are higher and market access is more
difficult.
Geography
Limited competitiveness. Three out of four of developing small states are islands or widely dispersed
multi-island states; others are land-locked, and some are located far from major markets. Their
remoteness and isolation make it difficult and costly for these states to access world markets to
compensate for small domestic markets — a situation that increases the cost of intermediated inputs
and imports and prevents efficiency and innovation. Domestic competition is also limited, which
hampers successful development.
Susceptibility to natural disasters and climate change. Most small states are vulnerable to climate-
change-related impacts and natural disasters such as hurricanes, cyclones, droughts, and volcanic
eruptions that typically affect an entire population and economy. The impact on the government’s
finances can be overwhelming, limiting a country’s ability to build cushions for development programs
and future needs.
A combination of a narrow production of export base combined with a vulnerability to shocks can to
lead to persistent fiscal and external imbalances and high levels of debt. Indeed, among the 20 countries
with the highest levels of public debt relative to GDP, small island states account for 10 countries, and
other small states for another three.

148.    Meanwhile, there has been a steady migration of smaller to larger islands, in particular to the
Malé City area. Internal migration has happened for a long time, often in response to natural disasters,
including the 2004 tsunami, the difference in the cost of living (the high cost of food and other goods and
services in the atolls compared to Malé), 86 quality of service delivery, and economic opportunities. Recent
data shows a net decline of population in many small islands; indeed, all islands that lost population
between 2006 and 2014 had a population below 3,000 in 2006 (Figure 58). During that period Malé and
Hulhumalé saw increases in population of 37 percent (by 34,524) and 450 percent (by 12,903),
respectively (see also section on Poverty).

149.     Conditions of overcrowding in Malé show that there are limits to centering activity on Malé.
Between 2003 and 2010 household expenditure on housing, water and electricity in Malé more than
doubled, and overtook food and beverages as the single largest expenditure item. Between 2010 and
2013, the number of vehicles in Malé increased by 23 percent, and currently there are about 36 vehicles
per 100 inhabitants in Malé compared to 5.5 in the atolls excluding Addu City and Hulhumalé. As noted
earlier, Malé’s population density of 53,700 per square kilometer puts it well ahead of large, densely
populated cities, such as Mumbai and Dhaka (Footnote 3).

150.    Successive governments, including the current one, tried to address the structural constraints,
while attempting to stem the net migration into Malé, through various programs investment and
voluntary resettlement programs. The current government’s party manifesto for 2013-17 pledged to
address these issues through a number of actions, including: 87
    • Malé City area. 88 Reduce congestion in Malé, develop Hulhumalé as a modern cosmopolitan city,
        construct bridges to link different parts of Malé City area, develop Thilafushi as an industrial zone.
    • Housing. Provide social housing and loans to renovate housing.
    • Infrastructure. Establish adequate harbors in islands, establish effective sewerage systems,
        ensure safe drinking water through desalination plants for islands with large populations and
        increased water storage capacity.
    • Reliable transport. Construct airport in islands and connecting ferry services, establish permanent
        system to enable transport of agricultural produce between islands.
    • Special Economic Zones. Establish SEZs for tourism, business incubation, free ports, ICT, etc.,
        granting special incentives including exemptions from Goods and Services Tax for 10 years,
        Business Profit Tax and Import Duty. 89

in Malé and to attract residents from islands with small populations. Reclamation of 188 hectares of
land and primary development took place between 1997 and 2004, leading to a population of just over
1,000. A resident population of 60,000 is targeted by 2020. 90 The next phase of development consists of
a further reclamation of 240 hectares, catering to a population of 100,000. 91 The president recently issued
a call to residents of islands with small populations to migrate, as the government is unable to meet the
socio-economic needs of small islands. 92

152.    Beyond structural constraints, a number of shortcomings associated with investment climate,
access to finance, governance and human capital restrict the potential for existing economic activities
in Maldives to grow and for new ones to be created.


Investment climate

153.     The investment climate in Maldives features important constraints for new entrepreneurs and
for the growth of existing firms. The investment climate in Maldives is much more challenging than that
of similar island economies and other South Asian countries. In 2015 Maldives ranked 116th in the World
Bank’s Doing Business ranking (out of 189 economies ranked). This ranking was two places lower than the
previous year, signaling a lower conduciveness of the investment climate in the country as compared to
other economies ranked. According to Doing Business rankings (Figure 59), while it is relatively easy to
register a new firm in Maldives, there are significant deficiencies in the enabling environment for that firm
to start operations (register property, obtain electricity connection, access finance), to grow its business
(access finance, import and export) and to resolve disputes or unwind operations in an orderly, swift and
fair manner (enforce contracts, protect investors and resolve insolvency). A comparison with other small
island states highlights the significantly higher challenges across the board in the investment climate in
Maldives.

154.     However, it is important to highlight the fact that the business environment obstacles faced by
firms in Maldives go beyond those areas identified by global indicators such as Doing Business.
Enterprises interviewed during the preparation of this diagnostic identified various other obstacles in the
investment climate in Maldives, including difficulties in accessing foreign currency, 93 that limit the ability
of firms to operate, invest in foreign capital goods and trade. Other factors cited by firms include sudden
changes in the legal and regulatory environment taking place in absence of sufficient consultation with
private-sector stakeholders.

due to the timing of the reports or to the difference between macro and micro observations.

155.     There are major gaps in the legal framework governing activities of private enterprise. A number
of issues have been identified 94 that restrict the effectiveness of the legal framework governing firms’
activities, including:
     • The need to define basic legal foundations of a system of commercial justice in order to reduce
         legal uncertainly. Courts function without a complete and adequate set of legal rules;
         enforcement mechanisms were found to be non-functional; the system of appeals was deemed
         to generate long delays; and there is lack of technical expertise and knowledge of business
         concepts. There are no alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in place.
     • Lack of clarity concerning legal sources further undermines legal certainty. The position of Sharia
         law in the private law system has not been fully established; it is unclear whether the laws
         governing commercial activities and Sharia law are compatible.
     • Lack of basic regulation in the area of secured transactions and registration of rights. Legislation
         regulating financial distress and insolvency was found to be incomplete and outdated. This was
         also the case with a number of basic private law regulations, including contract law, tort law and
         statute of limitations. In turn, the lack of adequate laws governing secured transactions severely
         undermines the ability of the financial sector to provide credit to enterprises, as it enhances the
         risk of losses in case of borrowers’ defaults due to unpredictable, lengthy and costly legal
         resolution. These deficiencies contribute to reducing the availability of credit, increasing its cost
         and enhancing the amount of collateral required by lenders.
     • Competition law and industrial property law are missing in Maldives. These are key elements of
         the legal framework needed in order to ensure a level playing field and fair treatment of investors.
         The absence of these laws likely undermines the ability of Maldives to attract and retain
         investment beyond tourism.

                                                                                                                 73
156.     Addressing investment climate shortcomings will be essential in order to enable the creation of
inclusive economic activities in Maldives. Evidence worldwide demonstrates 95 that investment climate
hurdles reduce incentives for entrepreneurship, reduce the attractiveness of the country as investment
destination, foster informality and significantly affect the competitiveness of enterprises. So far, in spite
of the investment climate shortcomings, Maldives has been able to develop a tourism industry leveraging
the uniqueness of its natural resources. However, investment climate deficiencies have played a
significant role 96 in preventing the development of an ecosystem of local enterprises around tourism as
suppliers of goods and services. That, in turn, has translated into the current model whereby tourism
remains largely an enclave industry. Investment climate shortcomings also undermine the ability of the
country to diversify its economy through creation of new firms in new economic activities.

157.     Governance issues contribute negatively to development of the private sector in Maldives. The
large state presence in economic activities (through SOEs) is not only a fiscal sustainability concern, but it
also undermines the ability of the private sector to flourish by crowding it out of large segments of the
market. This is demonstrated by a large number of SOEs that are mostly loss-making (paragraphs 54 and
89), the large size of public workforce (Figure 35) that may lead to higher reservation wages on the part
of the domestic labor force (section on Human Capital), and large public-sector borrowing that may be
crowding out the private sector (paragraph 161). This, together with the governance issues affecting
tourism and fisheries (paragraphs 113 and 130), contribute to create a set of significant challenges to
private enterprises that go beyond the difficulties stemming from business regulation bottlenecks.

Investment climate and FDI

158.     Maldives has been able to attract large volumes of FDI to tourism, but it has had limited positive
spillovers to the economy (Figure 59). The uniqueness of Maldives’ natural resources has enabled the
country to attract large (and frequently lumpy) amounts of FDI (Figure 60) in spite of shortcomings in the
investment climate. However, FDI inflows have been largely focused on development of single-island
resorts, with a very limited proportion reaching sectors of the economy that are associated with networks
of production. In turn, this has contributed to the current enclave model of the tourism industry. Going
forward, as the country seeks to foster economic diversification through foreign and local investment, its
ability to attract FDI into other industries or sectors will likely be affected by investment climate
challenges.

159.      Recent events have the potential to undermine the confidence of foreign investors on Maldives
and reduce its competitiveness as a long-term investment destination in favor of jurisdictions that can
provide a higher degree of certainty to foreign investors. A recent survey of global investors 97 identified
the main factors that drive selection of investment destinations. After macroeconomic stability, the
second most important factor for global investors when selecting an investment destination is political
risk 98. Recent events in Maldives – including civil disturbances in Malé;,a high-profile dispute related to a
contract for investment in the international airport, and anecdotal evidence reported in international


95 World Bank (2015c)
96 Anecdotal evidence collected through interviews and consultations with stakeholders undertaken during the preparation of
the SCD coincide on the view that investment climate shortcomings have had a major negative impact on entrepreneurship in
Maldives. However, the lack of statistics including recent business surveys significantly limit the ability to substantiate these
views.

Access to finance constraints


160.     Access to finance has been identified as a major constraint for the development of enterprises
in Maldives. A World Bank survey of enterprises 99 in Maldives in 2005 found that 66 percent of firms
identified access to finance as the most significant constraint to firms’ growth. While these figures are
admittedly old, other recent statistics and anecdotal evidence suggests that the situation has not
improved since then. Indeed, a business survey by Ministry of Finance in 2013 found that up to 70 percent
of companies in manufacturing have difficulties accessing finance (Figure 61). Similarly, views expressed
by private-sector participants during interviews and consultations undertaken during the preparation of
this diagnostic highlighted significant difficulties in accessing finance, which restricts their ability to make
long-term capital investments as well as to finance working capital requirements for day-to-day business
(Figure 62).

161.     Financing to the private sector has been lower than the pace of economic growth. Credit to the
private sector as a proportion of GDP decreased from 69 percent in 2008 to 44 percent in 2013, a
proportion that is much lower than that of economies with similar income level (Figure 63). These
economy-wide aggregate figures support private-sector stakeholders’ perception of a narrowing
availability of financing to private enterprises and entrepreneurs beyond tourism.

162.     And some sectors of the economy are more affected than others. As discussed above, while 70
percent of manufacturing firms surveyed reportedly have difficulties accessing bank credit, this proportion
is much lower for other sectors such as construction (50 percent) and trade (32 percent). None of the
firms in tourism surveyed reported difficulties in accessing finance. This is consistent with the breakdown
of banks’ credit portfolio, which is highly concentrated in tourism and, to a lesser extent, in commerce,
while tradable sectors account for a marginal proportion of bank loans (4 percent for fisheries, 2 percent
for manufacturing and 0.1 percent for agriculture). Moreover, credit growth has recently been driven by
lending to real estate and commerce, while credit to tradable sectors has decreased substantially since
2007 (Figures 64 and 65). A breakdown of banks’ portfolios by size of the borrower is not available, but
anecdotal evidence suggests that large enterprises (both public and private) enjoy easier access to bank
credit than SMEs and small entrepreneurs.

163.     High collateralization requirements represent major hurdles to borrowers. Companies surveyed
        100
in 2006 reportedly were required by banks to post collateral amounting to more than 150 percent of
the value of the loan on average101. Views collected through interviews and consultations during the
preparation of this diagnostic confirm that high collateral requirements still represent a significant
obstacle to credit, especially for SMEs and new entrepreneurs.

164.    Lack of access to finance has been identified by authorities as a major obstacle for
entrepreneurship in Maldives, but this challenge will not be resolved through concessional credit.
Enhancing access to finance for entrepreneurs is one of the priority areas under the Government
Manifesto as well as in the draft National Development Strategy. The government’s 2009-2013 National
Strategic Action Plan also recommended that the government provide women with self-help grants for
small- and medium-sized enterprises and promote microcredit programs. This focus was intended to help
bridge the disadvantage women face in accessing credit. For instance, in 2011 only one-third of the Bank
of Maldives borrowers for development schemes or loans and advances were women. 102 In response to
the lack of access to finance for entrepreneurs overall in Maldives, the government had put in place a
program to provide financing to young entrepreneurs. The program (GETSET) considered the provision of
non-collateralized loans with subsidized interest rates. While the ultimate objective of the program
(enhancing access to finance for entrepreneurs) is laudable, it does not address the shortcomings limiting
the adequate functioning of the financial sector and thus does not represent a lasting or sustainable
solution to the needs of enterprises and entrepreneurs. On the contrary, concessional directed lending
programs often aggravate access to finance deficiencies by helping erode the credit culture in the
population, reducing incentives for established commercial lenders to innovate, and crowding out the
financial sector by creating dependence of entrepreneurs on subsidized interest rates.

165.    Sustainable enhancement of access to finance in Maldives will require the development and
implementation of a strategy for financial sector development that addresses the shortcomings faced
by the sector. The factors limiting the willingness and ability of financial intermediaries to provide credit
on a sustainable and fair basis to the various sectors of the private sector are wide-ranging. Included in

Table 2 is a list of shortcomings that have been identified in the past 103 that illustrate the range of
challenges facing the sector, including deficiencies in the legal framework governing credit activities,
shortcomings in credit infrastructure and underdeveloped financial institutions. However, this list is not
exhaustive and additional factors may be at play. Enhanced public-private dialogue between all
stakeholders (authorities, financial institutions and borrowers) will be needed in order to further identify
obstacles and opportunities, as well as to prioritize actions. These issues are addressed in more detail in
Annex 3.


Governance constraints


166.     Maldives is facing important governance challenges that affect the business environment and
the soundness and sustainability of economic and fiscal management. Overall, an indeterminate but
significant connection between a few parties and the political system – related to the absence of basic
legislation in many areas, including procurement – and a lack of legal clarity weigh on the economic
activity. In particular, a significant amount of procurement in the country is carried out by SOEs and the
Ministry of Health outside the scope of national rules and central government controls, leading to doubts
about whether public resources are spent in the most effective and efficient manner. In the public sector,
limited capacity, a complex institutional framework, and inter-institutional conflicts also limit the ability
of the state to support social and economic progress. Institutional capacity remains much lower than that
of an average upper middle-income country.

167.     Governance deficiencies have hampered the ability of Maldives to maximize the benefits from
its natural resources as a foundation for shared growth. Significant governance constraints appear to
have undermined the development of the two main industries in the country (tourism and fisheries).
These shortcomings appear to have translated into sub-optimal investment, unrealized potential for job
creation and loss revenues for the government (see tourism and fisheries sections). Deficiencies include:
lack of transparency in allocation of licenses for exploitation of natural resources; suboptimal selection of
licensees, and: lack of mechanisms to minimize conflict of interest (see paragraphs sections on tourism
and fisheries).

168.     Public-sector management suffers from inefficiencies. The public sector plays an important role
in Maldives’ overall economic model in redistributing some of the rents generated by the resort sector to
the rest of the population. This is done both through transfers and directly in the form of relatively large
public employment in both civil administration and state-owned enterprises. In both cases there are
significant inefficiencies that undermine both the effectiveness of the redistributive model and the
fulfillment of public-sector functions in service provision and regulation. With civil service skewed towards
relatively young workers, its effectiveness is far lower than what might be expected of a middle-income
country. Public financial management suffers from inadequate accounting and poor cost controls.

169.    The unsettled political and institutional framework impairs the state’s effectiveness. Maldives
has been undergoing a contentious political transition for the past 10 years. The 2008 Constitution created
an extensive set of governance institutions and confrontational elections characterized by interference of
state bodies that has undermined credibility. Branches of government and independent commissions are

                                                                                                          78
frequently in conflict, reflecting the interests of individuals in what is a sharply divided polity. The lack of
political and institutional settlement diverts the attention of the state from carrying out public-sector
functions and prompts decision-making driven to an unusual degree by short-term political issues.

170.     This has led in particular to weak rule of law. Maldives’ legal system is based on several
foundations, including both common law and the sharia, with lack of harmonization evident in much
legislation, particularly for commercial activity. There are fundamental gaps in law, including: the lack of
a civil procedure code; seemingly non-functional enforcement mechanisms; a system of appeals that
generates long delays, and; weak capacity among judges, particularly on commercial matters.
Uncertainties about the legal framework are amplified by the diverse legal backgrounds of judges (all
judicial education is obtained outside of Maldives), which leads to inconsistency in adjudication. More
generally, while the 2008 Constitution provided grounds for strong independence of the judiciary, the
composition of the judicial service commission has led to strong politicization of the courts according to
many observers (most notably the UN Special Rapporteur on Judicial Independence). The judiciary has
been highly proactive in recent political and electoral disputes.


Human capital constraints

171.    Expanding and improving human capital will be of vital importance to promote economic
prosperity and increase jobs for young people. The country ranked only 103rd in the Human Development
Index for 2014, which is low for a middle-income country approaching $9,900 GNI per capita.

172.    Maldives has performed well in providing access to primary and lower secondary education,
but there is room for improvement. The primary gross enrollment rate is 104 percent and the primary
net enrollment rate 99 percent. The lower secondary gross enrollment rate is 107 percent (Figure 66),
while the lower secondary net rate is 82 percent. This suggests that, while participation in primary and
lower secondary education is high, there is considerable grade repetition and early/late entry, especially
in lower secondary education. The country needs to improve the internal efficiency of the education
system.

173.     The country lags sharply behind in education attainment at the higher secondary level. The
gross higher secondary net enrollment rate is about 35 percent (Figure 67). This is very low by
international standards. The average higher secondary gross enrollment rate for middle-income countries
is 61 percent, and for upper middle-income countries 76 percent. The main reason for the low enrollment
in higher secondary education in Maldives is the limited number of schools that offered grades 11-12 until
recently, although almost each atoll has at least one school providing higher secondary education. The
government has now expanded this number to 51 schools: three schools in Malé and 48 schools in the
atolls (Figure 67). Many of these schools are over-crowded and congested and require more facilities and
equipment. In addition, higher secondary schools require greater management and leadership capability,
and the professional development of teachers. At present, the higher secondary school system relies
heavily on human resources from overseas.

174.    Higher education participation is extremely low for a middle-income country. The gross higher
education enrollment rate is only about 6 percent in Maldives, (Figure 67) whereas the gross higher
education enrollment rate for middle-income countries is around 30 percent. The low proportion of
Maldivians with higher education qualifications means that the country lacks sufficient professionals,
managers and technical experts to support economic growth and social development. The main reasons
for the low enrollment in higher education are: (1) the small number of students completing higher
secondary education and moving onto higher education; and (2) limited access to higher education in the
country. Higher education is mainly provided by Maldives National University (MNU) and about seven
private higher education institutions. However, over 85 percent of enrollment in these private higher
education institutions is actually in pre-degree level diploma and certificate programs. A considerable
proportion of enrollment in the MNU, too, is in pre-degree level qualifications.

175.      The quality of education at all levels is a major challenge facing Maldives, both in terms of inputs
and outcomes. The teacher-student ratio varies between 6 (Vaavu Atoll) and 16 (Malé), but lower teacher-
student ratios tend to be associated with a larger share of untrained teachers (Figure 68). At the same
time, learning outcomes in primary and secondary education are low. The average score for English among
students at grade 4 is just 32 percent, and the average score for mathematics only 39 percent. At grade 7
the average score for English is merely 29 percent, while the average score for mathematics is just 30
percent. These very low averages show that learning levels in both primary and lower secondary
education are weak. There are also substantial regional disparities (Figure 69). Learning outcomes are
considerably higher in Malé than in the atolls, especially in a subject such as English language, which is
vitally important for employment in a tourism-based economy. The low levels of cognitive skills results in
poor performance of students at national examinations. For instance, at the General Certificate of
Examinations (GCE O/L) only about 40 percent students pass in five subjects, while just 19 percent
students pass in eight subjects.

176.     High youth unemployment is linked with skills deficiencies. The share of the labor force ages 15-
24 without work but available for and seeking employment was 27 percent in 2013. The average youth
unemployment rate for upper middle-income countries is 14 percent. Due to the lack of well-educated
Maldivians the country also faces a severe shortage of qualified personnel for technical, and middle and
senior management, jobs. According to private-sector stakeholders consulted during the preparation of
this diagnostic (Annex 1), the above-mentioned deficiencies in “soft skills” together with shortcomings in
technical and vocational education contribute to the high level of expatriate workers, especially for up-
market tourism and commercial and financial activities.

177.     The quality of existing TVET services needs to be improved so that it becomes both more
attractive for youth and more relevant for employers. The government has established the Technical and
Vocational Education Program (TVET) with aim of creating a skilled workforce that meets labor market
demands. The program has been diversified to offer training in hospitality and tourism, construction and
building, agriculture, electrical wiring and engineering and handicrafts. There are more than 80 training
providers in the country. However, the quality of these TVET programs is considered limited and youth
graduating with technical and vocational qualifications can face lengthy job search periods. Another
important constraint is that technical and vocational education and training is considered an inferior
option to academic qualifications by Maldivian youth, so that the demand for TVET is limited. The
education and training system has not yet developed career guidance and counselling to help youth
identify their aptitudes and talents, nor a method to stream students into knowledge and/or skills-based
programs depending on these aptitudes and talents. One possible experiment that could be further
studied in this regard is the Ministry of Education’s UFAA program, which attempts to connect high
schools, counselors and employers, and provide at-risk youth the technical and soft skills to enhance
employability.

178.    The gap between youth aspirations for employment and the actual opportunities for
employment needs to be addressed. The rapidity of economic growth for Maldives has altered the
perceptions of the ‘ideal’ desired job for today’s youth. Qualitative data reveal that young educated
Maldivian men and women – and their households – aspire to white-collar, high-paying jobs and are

                                                                                                              81
unwilling to settle for the perceived lower-status (if not lower-paying) jobs in fisheries or other non-white-
collar sectors. Financial pressures on unemployed youth are deemed to be reduced through parental
support even for unemployed adult children. These factors create a high reservation wage for youth. 104
Parents supporting a large family do not, in turn, feel any financial pressure because of government
subsidization of daily necessities, such as basic food items, fuel, electricity and education. Thus, parents
have little motivation to temper their own high aspirations and pressure their children to settle for a job
that may be less than ideal. In Maldives and elsewhere this phenomenon is referred to as ‘voluntary
unemployment.’ 105 The resultant high youth unemployment might inhibit Maldives’ future growth
trajectory and the ability of its development to be inclusive.



Social spending constraints

179.     Maldives’ geography and polarized population distribution throughout the archipelago
contribute to high cost of service delivery. Maldives’ population is scattered over 194 inhabited island
over an archipelago of more than 800 kilometers in length. Guaranteeing access to services throughout
this territory is further complicated by a very polarized distribution of the population, characterized by
high density in the capital area Malé, which is home to two-thirds of the population, and very low density
in the atolls. 106 In 2014, education and health services together accounted for 22 percent of total
government spending. Maldives is the country in South Asia spending the highest share of GDP on health
and education (Figures 70 and 71). Interestingly, and despite a spending on education that is significantly
above international average, the Maldivian government has been so far unable to improve access to
secondary education and address outstanding learning and education-quality issues.

180.     Maldives lacks a comprehensive, effective and efficient system of social protection. Maldives’
safety net programs have undertaken major changes since the government’s Strategic Action Plan 2009-
2013 was drawn up. 107 While tremendous progress has been made towards adding new programs and
expanding coverage of existing ones, Maldives is still far from its policy goal of transforming fragmented
social safety net programs into a comprehensive social protection system. Universal subsidies on food and
electricity and universal health insurance represent the bulk of social expenditure together with social
pension (Old Age Basic Pension) and Senior Citizens Allowance (Table 3). Smaller safety net programs
include disability and single parent allowances. 108 Poor targeting and weak coordination in administration
greatly reduce the potential impact of safety net programs and challenge their fiscal sustainability and,
ultimately, the quality of assistance to those most vulnerable.


181.     The increase in spending on universal subsidies is a challenge to shared prosperity and poverty
reduction in Maldives. As discussed in Chapter 2, Maldives’ performance in reducing poverty and boosting
shared prosperity has been lackluster. While there is no recent poverty data to confirm this hypothesis,
the increase in public spending during the past few years might not have contributed to better poverty
and shared prosperity outcomes, especially because most of the increase has been driven by spending on
universal subsidies. 109 In fact, as revealed in the poverty and social impact analysis, while the poor spend
a significantly higher share of their budget on food and utilities, the rich benefit the most from universal
subsidies due to their higher levels of consumption (Figures 72 and 73). Because of their inherently
regressive nature, universal subsidies represent an inefficient instrument for guaranteeing affordability of
basic needs for the poorest segments of the population. Nevertheless, lacking a coherent safety net
system explicitly targeting the poor, universal subsidies are the only mechanism of “income support”
currently available.

182.    Moreover, recently introduced social insurance schemes have created perverse economic
incentives that challenge poverty reduction and shared prosperity moving forward. While the
introduction of universal health insurance (Aasandha) has benefited disproportionally the poorest
segments of the population, 110 poor design and limited implementation capacity have contributed to
increasing utilization trends and escalating costs that challenge its future fiscal sustainability. Similarly,
the generosity of the pension system has exacerbated inter-generational equity issues and potentially
contributed to increase distortions on the labor market. In particular, increasing trends for inter-
generational transfers within the household and increasing reservation wages might challenge direct
participation of the youth in the growth process (as noted above) and add to fiscal and social sustainability
concerns moving forward. 111

Section 6. Opportunities and trade-offs for sustainable poverty reduction
and shared prosperity

183.    The Systematic Country Diagnostic aims to identify the most important opportunities and
obstacles to poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Maldives. Based on evidence presented thus far
and analysis conducted as part of this Systematic Country Diagnostic, this section creates a framework to
identify the highest priority areas for reform and lays out a potential path forward for shared and
sustainable growth and poverty reduction in Maldives.

184.    The identification of the priorities areas is the result of a three-step process. First, during the
concept stage, hypotheses on the functioning of Maldives’ development model and on the drivers of its
vulnerabilities were formulated, and knowledge gaps identified. Second, during the SCD development
stage, these hypotheses were confirmed by additional analysis and knowledge gaps filled whenever
feasible under the given timeline. Third, consultations with local stakeholders were used to further
validate hypotheses and analysis (Annexes 1 and 2). The framework for prioritization is further explained
in Annex 4.

185.     Priority area 1: Enhancing opportunities for the local population to benefit from existing
industries. Enhancing these opportunities would contribute to poverty reduction and shared prosperity.
However, the impact may not be immediate and indeed relies on improving infrastructure, training and
regulations, among other things. It also could reduce social risk by improving employment opportunities
for the most vulnerable segments of the population, notably for youth and women. Actions under this
pillar appear politically feasible as both the current and the previous government have endorsed reforms
in both sectors to make them more inclusive.

186.    Priority area 2: Enabling opportunities for creation of new sources of growth. Enabling the local
population to seize opportunities for entrepreneurship will require addressing a host of factors that
combined represent the overall enabling environment in the country. These factors include: minimizing
the regulatory burden and consequent cost to doing business; enhancing the ability of creditworthy firms
and entrepreneurs to access finance; and enhancing human capital through the formation of professionals
and technicians with the skills that are in demand and are the key to better jobs. These priorities are
discussed below.

187.    Priority area 3: Improving efficiency and efficacy of public resource management and reducing
macro fiscal risk. Addressing the challenges identified in this priority area would make the economic
model in Maldives more sustainable and resilient to shocks. More directly, better management of public
resources would free up space to benefit the poor and increase opportunities for the youth through, for
example, better education. The impact of reform of subsidies and the public wage bill would have an
immediate and medium-term impact on fiscal sustainability, but they require both careful planning to
mitigate the negative impact on the poor and political courage. Improving the preparedness for disasters
and climate change would have a medium- to long-term impact.


                                                                                                        85
188.     The analysis identified governance and labor market as a fundamental cross-cutting issues
constraining growth, poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Maldives. Governance and labor
market issues are at the heart of many of the constraints that challenge the inclusiveness and
sustainability of Maldives’ socio-economic model of development. A strong public-sector presence in key
sectors of the economy and a lack of transparency and accountability in SOEs’ management negatively
impact fiscal sustainability as well as private sector’s ability to flourish. Moreover, the weakness of the
overall legal framework together with the poor management of the country’s natural assets challenge the
sustainability of the economic model moving forward. Similarly, labor market distortions and an increasing
mismatch between labor demand and supply make it harder for the growth process to be inclusive and
put the social contract at great risk. Given the fundamental role played by governance and labor market
constraints, the SCD has identified the need to fill existing knowledge gaps in these areas to more
effectively identify policy priorities moving forward.


Priority area 1. Sharing prosperity - Enhancing opportunities for the
local population to benefit from existing industries
Opportunities and obstacles to enhance inclusiveness of tourism growth

189.     Given the importance of tourism in Maldives, a more inclusive industry represents a major
opportunity for shared prosperity going forward. Maintaining underlying growth of tourism will be a key
factor for the sustainability of growth in the economy as a whole. However, growth in itself will not be
enough to ensure the inclusiveness of the tourism industry and the realization of its potential positive
spillovers. There are four potential complementary avenues to enhance the inclusiveness of tourism:

190.    First: Enhancing the implementation of the current resort model. Adequate planning and
transparent implementation of resorts development can help to enhance the benefits for the economy
as a whole and result in positive spillovers for local communities by attracting reputable international
investors with extensive industry know-how and networks. Realizing this opportunity will require, among
other things:
        • Holistic planning and implementation of integrated destination management components
             (transport, infrastructure, skills training, marketing, economic clustering) to increase the
             viability of new resort projects, particularly in outer atolls where there are higher incidences
             of poverty.
        • A more strategic and transparent approach to ensure that leases are awarded to reputable
             investors with demonstrable track record in the tourism industry to enhance the viability of
             new developments and lead to positive spillovers to the local communities.
        • Transparency in the management of leases to avoid numerous non-performing leases.
        • Strategic planning to reduce the risk of over-supply in key market segments.




                                                                                                          86
191.    Second: Enabling sustainable economic diversification within the tourism sector. Non-resort
market niches (e.g. guesthouses and safari boats) have demonstrated the viability of business models that
are more closely integrated with local communities, through local ownership, higher local employment
(deemed as high as 75 percent of total staff) and reportedly higher ability to mobilize women as part of
the workforce. These new market niches have also demonstrated the ability to co-exist with the higher-
end resorts, providing lower-cost options to other demand segments. Realizing this opportunity will
require, among other things:
        • Destination planning and management. The sustainability of the growth in guesthouses will
            depend on adequate planning and regulation of tourism development in inhabited islands.
            This includes sufficient analysis of carrying capacities, consistent management of land-use
            plans and a requirement for Environmental Impact Assessments. The absence of these
            foundations in the most developed case (Maafushi Island) had led to an increasingly
            overburdened infrastructure system (especially waste management), and, anecdotally, to
            property inflation and displacement of local population.
        • Better and more cost-effective infrastructure to mitigate the high cost of transport, which
            limits the potential of new market niches to islands clustered close to the capital (as they cater
            to more price-sensitive tourists). This would facilitate the development of new market niches
            in remote islands, where poverty levels are higher.

192.     Third: Enabling local employment. Tourism is a large and growing source of jobs. According to
the census, tourism generated 28,000 jobs in 2014, only 40 percent of which are filled by Maldivian staff.
By 2015 the industry was deemed to generate 31,000 jobs. The implementation of industry growth in line
with government plans would imply an additional demand for 3,300 new employees in the mainstream
resort industry 112. Despite a government-imposed quota requiring at least 45 percent of staff to be
Maldivian, the tourism industry consistently reports significant difficulties finding and retaining qualified
local staff. Unlocking the access of Maldivian population to more and better jobs in tourism will require
addressing a number of factors, including:
         • Establishing a partnership between the government and the private sector to identify and
              address the obstacles to local employment. The normative approach (government-imposed
              quotas) to enforce localization of employment has not lead to a sustainable inclusiveness in
              the tourism industry. Anecdotal evidence suggests that local employment in the industry is
              lower than the government-imposed quota. 113
         • Improving the alignment between technical training and demand. Market participants
              interviewed consistently highlighted a major gap between the quality and relevance of the
              technical training provided by TVET and the demands of the market. This prompts many
              resorts to implement their own trainee programs for local youth. However, the high cost of
              these programs and the high turnover of trained local staff are incentives to hire experienced
              foreign staff. A closer collaboration between the technical education institutions and the


112 Government plans target ten resorts per year with an average capacity of 220 beds each year. An industry standard considers
a ratio of 1.5 staff per bed. This implies an annual requirement for 3300 new staff.
113 The absence of credible and comprehensive official figures make it difficult to verify this.



                                                                                                                           87
              private sector may help to enhance the relevance and quality of the technical training
              provided by TVET. That, in turn, could enhance the employability of technical graduates while
              making it easier for the tourism sector to find qualified local staff.
         •    Addressing social perceptions that appear to limit the desirability of technical jobs within and
              outside the tourism industry to young people. Anecdotal evidence collected through
              extensive consultations with youth and private-sector stakeholders consistently identified
              social norms that appear to prevent the willingness of the youth to get training and seek
              technical jobs in spite of great demand from various industries for qualified technical staff.
              These norms appear to include social conventions, family expectations and social media role
              models.
         •    Addressing transport limitations that restrict the ability of Maldivians living in inhabited
              islands to commute to work in resorts. While many resorts provide accommodation to
              employees, anecdotal evidence suggests that Maldivians place a high premium on the ability
              to live on their home island and commute to work. Such evidence is supported by a much
              higher proportion of local employment 114 in resorts that are close to inhabited islands and
              with good transport connections.
         •    Mitigating social and structural barriers that restrict the ability of young women to work in
              the tourism sector. Social norms dictating appropriate employment for young women
              contribute to making families reluctant to allow young women to take tourism-related jobs
              because they would have to travel from home to other islands and because the tourism sector
              is associated with “immoral and unethical” practices. 115 Structural barriers that further
              exacerbate familial unwillingness to allow young women to work away from home include
              the lack of child-care or residential facilities for employed women in the tourism sector.
              Women’s limited control of transportation adds an economic hurdle to their ability to travel
              to resort islands for work. 116

193.     Fourth: Strengthening linkages between tourism and local providers of goods and services. The
tourism industry is a large and rapidly growing source of demand for goods and services. The tourism
sector’s demand for inputs represents a major opportunity for local producers. But at the present time,
given limitation in local supply, most of the goods are imported. The potential for creation of supply chains
between local producers and tourism industry is hampered by a number of obstacles, including:
         • Fundamental challenges to local supply due to the small size of the economy, limited
             economies of scale, high dispersion of the population and high transport costs. However,
             there is ample potential for production focused on specific products and crops, signaling the
             need for specialization.

         •    Shortcomings in quality, quantity and consistency of supply affect the development potential
              for many local producers. According to anecdotal evidence, previous attempts by
              cooperatives and grower associations to enhance reliability and professionalism have failed
              to radically improve the reliability of supply. In light of that, many tourism operators prefer to
              reduce uncertainty through imports. A large proportion of agricultural products come from
              small producers. Aggregation and coordination has been attempted by cooperatives and
              corporate sponsors, but it remains challenging. 117
         •    Limited collaboration between supply and demand of agricultural products. While there have
              been some success stories in production in agricultural islands, of the 52 leased islands, only
              eight are actually operating, signaling potential missed opportunities for enhancement of the
              local production. Further analysis of priority crop production, the calculation of supply and
              demand, key constraints including inputs, logistics, knowledge and employment desirability,
              and availability of land may help to enhance the certainty in supply.
         •    The fact that, at present, agricultural production throughout the country is centralized in Malé
              due to lack of market places for fresh produce in other atolls 118. This reduces the
              competitiveness of local production by increasing transport costs and reducing the freshness
              of products.


Opportunities and obstacles for unleashing the potential of fisheries and ancillary industries.


194.     Maldives has the opportunity to further develop its fisheries sector, and to capitalize on the
potential benefits to enhance economic growth and sustainable development at a national level.
Unlike the fisheries sectors in many countries throughout the world, Maldives has a range of factors in its
favor that provide the opportunity for further development. The fisheries sector can generate a range of
sustainable benefits for Maldives – direct benefits such as employment, income and food for fish-workers
and indirect benefits such as contributions to the national exchequer through various fiscal mechanisms.
Yet, significant challenges lay ahead to undertake sector development within an economically efficient
and sustainable fisheries management system.

195.    Enhancing the governance of the sector will be necessary to unleash its potential. The
development of the skipjack tuna (a segment regulated through processing licenses) and yellowfin tuna
(a segment that does not have similar licensing in place) highlights two widely varying trends. Where the
licensed market segment is characterized by plummeting catch, low added-value exports and declining
employment, the unlicensed segment is characterized by increasing catch volumes, high-value exports to
prime markets and increasing employment. While other factors may contribute to these trends, it is worth
reviewing the governance framework in the sector, including the rationale for licensing of particular


117 While there are various examples of successful cooperatives, notably the Addu Meedhoo cooperative supplying the Shangri-
La Hotel, the concept is not well suited to the Maldives and is not inherently replicable across Atolls
118 Effectively, a product may be produced in a remote Atoll, brought to Malé at great cost and transport time, bought in Malé

and returned to the same Atoll by the buyer.

                                                                                                                          89
activities and whether such framework has a positive contribution to the economy as a whole. If licenses
are maintained, a transparent licensing process should be put in place with emphasis on ensuring that
licenses are granted to the most qualified enterprises with demonstrated ability to contribute to the
sustainable growth of the sector.

196.    The sustainable and inclusive growth of the fisheries sector will likely not be based on increasing
the volume of catch. Currently, most of Maldives fisheries operate under free and open-access conditions.
The sector’s growth is based largely on traditional policy goals of maximizing production through
increased fish landings, supported by improved technology that can lead to increased fishing yields.
Global experience shows, however, that this approach usually results in low levels of success in generating
sustained economic benefits. In some cases, this leads to reduced revenues form the fishery, diminishing
profitably and, in the worst case, stock collapse from overfishing 119 and waste 120. Many countries that
once had ample fish resources are now faced with overcapitalized fishing fleets, overfished stocks and
unsustainable levels of public subsidies to their fishery sectors.

197.     A transition to a wealth-based fisheries management system may hold promise for the future.
Rather than pursuing the traditional goal of increasing fish landings, wealth-based fisheries management
systems focus on maximizing net returns in fishery-sector development within an economically efficient
fisheries management system. For inshore reef and lagoon fisheries, such systems can involve the
development of local community-based management systems. For coastal and high-seas fisheries, such
systems might be based around the design and introduction of rights-based fishing within a sound
management planning framework. These approaches have worked well for other countries. However, it
is important to note that a transition process requires a careful implementation and a long-term planning
horizon. Prudent management of the marine environment also underpins the valuable tourism industry
and the perception of Maldives as a pristine environment. It is essential, therefore, to capitalize on
emerging international best practice in fisheries and reef management to ensure that Maldives’ fisheries
management system is economically efficient, sustainable and profitable in the future.

198.    There are a range of targeted options 121 for exploiting the opportunities presented to the
Maldives’ fisheries sector at present, but effective strategies and plans will need to be developed in
order to identify not only economic potential, but also environmental impact.
        • With tuna harvesting and processing, there are possibilities for developing new domestic
            fisheries such as long-lining, and for re-organizing the current system for collecting and buying
            fish to overcome seasonal gluts and enhance the share of returns for the producers of (dried)
            Maldives fish. Onshore, there are possibilities for locating new processing and fish- handling
            facilities on different islands to take advantage of the seasonal changes in fishing grounds and
            fish concentrations and new infrastructure, such as harbors and airports. The impact of

119 The classic example is the Canadian Atlantic cod fishery in the 1980s, culminating in the closure of the fishery in 1992, with
massive economic costs to local fishers, processors, and governments. In Maldives, there are some indications of fleet
overcapitalization in the tuna fisheries.
120 Another systemic issue is the logistical and capacity problems between harvesters and processors during peak fishing periods.
121 These options stem from technical background analyses as well as stakeholders’ consultations.



                                                                                                                              90
    selecting a particular development option on local communities, on livelihoods and on the
    economies of scale and logistics of the value chain will need careful consideration and
    cooperation between both private and public actors.
•   There are strong possibilities for developing new products and entering new markets, in
    particular capitalizing on Maldives pole- and line-caught tuna as an individually caught,
    ‘ecologically-friendly’ product from one of the world’s cleanest environments. The culture of
    high-value, small-volume products can also capitalize on the environmental image of
    Maldives. But, international seafood markets are highly competitive and demanding, and
    Maldives will need to exploit its comparative advantage for seafood exports by building a
    careful business and investment strategy.
•   There are opportunities for addressing infrastructure and logistical constraints that affect
    some fishing islands. The trade in fish products will depend on better facilities and transport
    links to access export markets, but investments will require sound financial and technical
    assessments and close public-private cooperation, including PPPs, particularly given the
    government’s current fiscal situation.
•   The need to increase stakeholder involvement in decision-making and policy implementation
    is constrained by the overlapping mandates of different ministries. The lack of a clear
    definition of the respective roles of the public and private actors has major implications for
    the longer-term functioning and effectiveness of the sector, especially in a transition towards
    a wealth-based fisheries management system. Enhanced and more balanced stakeholder
    involvement between fishers, industry and government in decision-making will help chart a
    steadier course at the national level. It is particularly imperative that fishers have a stronger
    voice in policy development at the national level.
•   Finally, the issue of international partnerships also presents options for Maldives. The extent
    to which Maldives’ participation in the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission has benefitted the
    country over shared stocks, and the options for entering into partnerships with foreign
    investors for the further development of enterprises such as the tuna transshipping trade are
    the types of major issues that need to be considered in the context of sectoral and national
    development policy.

Priority area 2. Enabling opportunities for creation of new sources of
growth

199.    Economic diversification and competitiveness in Maldives are hampered by significant
structural and spatial constraints, but enhancing the enabling environment will increase the potential
for entrepreneurship, creation of new firms and growth of existing ones. Maldives faces similar
structural challenges of other small island states that restrict the extent to which the country can attain
competitiveness across the board. However, as discussed in previous sections, there are visible untapped
opportunities where potential (in terms of existing demand and proved production capacity) exists, both
within value chains of existing industries, as well as potential new economic activities.

200.    Enabling the local population to seize these opportunities will require addressing a host of
factors that combined restrict the overall enabling environment in the country. These factors include:
minimizing the regulatory burden and consequent cost of doing business; enhancing the ability of
creditworthy firms and entrepreneurs to access finance, and; enhancing human capital through the
formation of professionals and technicians with the skills that are in demand and are the key to better
jobs. These priorities are discussed below.


Enhancing Investment Climate
201.     Enhancing the investment climate will be essential to facilitate entrepreneurship and attract
investment. As discussed in previous sections, the challenges related to the investment climate are higher
in Maldives than in other small island states and other countries in the region. Global research documents
extensively the negative link between investment climate challenges and growth and competitiveness in
the private sector. As the government of strives to enhance entrepreneurship and economic
diversification in the country, the opportunities for improvement of the investment climate are significant,
including:
     • Reducing the cost of regulatory compliance. Global indicators such as Doing Business identify a
          number of regulatory shortcomings that currently create additional transaction costs to
          entrepreneurs at all stages of the business cycle (from firm creation and connection to basic
          utilities, to expansion and resolution of disputes and insolvency). These deficiencies in the
          regulatory framework have the potential to discourage entrepreneurship and to reduce the
          overall competitiveness of enterprises. Minimizing unnecessary regulatory hurdles will be
          essential in order to foster entrepreneurship in Maldives..
     • Addressing shortcomings in the legal framework governing private-sector activities. Deficiencies
          in basic legal foundations of the system of commercial justice create legal uncertainty and
          diminish incentives for investment. Key elements of the legal framework needed in order to
          ensure a level playing field and fair treatment of investors (competition and industrial property
          laws) are missing, further undermining the confidence of potential new investors. The lack of
          adequate laws governing secured transactions severely undercuts the ability of the financial
          sector to provide credit to enterprises because it increases the risk of losses in case of borrowers’


                                                                                                            92
         defaults due to unpredictable, lengthy and costly legal resolution. Addressing these shortcomings
         in the legal framework, together with the capacity of the judiciary to implement laws in a
         consistent and objective way, will be important to increase investor confidence and provide
         entrepreneurs with legal certainty.
    •    Enhancing the participation of the private sector in the reform of the investment climate. While
         global indicators provide a benchmark of some key areas of the investment climate, identifying
         and addressing the key constraints faced by enterprises and entrepreneurs in Maldives will
         require the active and continuous participation of the private sector. Development of a formal
         public-private dialogue platform on investment climate can provide a channel for the private
         sector to inform government policies and define priorities for reform. The close consultation with
         private sector can also help to reduce the risk of disruption in enterprises’ operations from
         sudden changes in laws and regulations.
    •    Addressing governance issues affecting the development of the private sector. In particular, SOEs
         have the potential to crowd out private enterprises from major economic activities through unfair
         advantages, including wider access to financial services, broader ability to attract the limited
         human capital available in the country, and preferential treatment related to business
         regulations. Rethinking the role of SOEs and the rationale for their participation in economic
         activities that could be undertaken by private enterprises is necessary to ensure that SOEs do not
         become an obstacle to entrepreneurship and private-sector-led growth.


Enhancing access to financial services

202.    Improving access to adequate financial services will be essential to enhance the ability of
creditworthy firms and entrepreneurs to invest and reduce transaction costs. Enterprises and
entrepreneurs have identified access to finance as a major constraint for their day-to-day operations and
longer-term growth. The high dependence of banks’ credit decisions on real estate collateral, together
with the inability of mechanisms for entrepreneurs with viable business plans to demonstrate their
creditworthiness, has translated into concentration of credit in a few segments of the economy, most
particularly larger borrowers in tourism-related activities. Recognizing these challenges, authorities in
Maldives have tried to provide concessional credit to foster entrepreneurship. However, sustainably
enhancing access to financial services will likely require addressing a range of factors that currently
undermine the efficient operations of the financial sector, including:
    • Improving credit infrastructure. Enhancing the depth and scope of information included in the
        credit registries will be necessary to increase the ability of lenders to identify borrowers with good
        track records. The inception of an electronic collateral registry will improve the ability of
        borrowers in remote atolls to post use their assets as collateral.
    • Enhancing financial inclusion of population in remote islands. Development of mobile banking will
        help the population in remote atolls to have access to basic financial services and reduce the
        currently very high transaction costs of financial operations.
    • Improving the legal framework governing financial activities. Lack of clarity and certainty on
        application of laws translates into lengthy and costly legal processes. This increases the risk

                                                                                                           93
        aversion of lenders, which, increases the collateralization requirements. Losses stemming from
        these deficiencies are passed on to new clients in the form of higher interest rates. More clarity
        and consistent application of the laws governing foreclosure, together with the clarification of the
        application of Shariah law in financial disputes will be necessary to minimize uncertainty and risk
        aversion.
    •   Enhancing the development of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs). NBFIs can increase
        accessibility to financial services by reaching out to segments of the market not covered by large
        commercial banks. Important types of NBFIs (including microfinance, leasing and factoring) are
        currently either missing or underdeveloped in Maldives. Previous experience in the country
        demonstrates the potential for some of these NBFIs, but also shows that challenges in the legal
        framework contributed to diminish that potential over time. Creating an enabling environment
        that fosters the orderly and sustainable development of NBFIs, including adequate oversight, can
        enhance supply of financial services to currently underserved market segments.


Addressing human capital constraints

203.     Expanding and improving human capital will be of vital importance to promote economic
prosperity and increase jobs for young people. From the demand side, enterprises have consistently
identified the lack of staff with the adequate skills and qualifications as a major constraint to growth. Over
the last few years, this has led to vast employment of expatriates. From the supply side, young people in
Maldives aspire to high-paid jobs, but often lack the required skills. While there are various factors at play
affecting the participation of youth in employment, the gap between the skills demanded and those in
supply is wide at the present time. Reducing this gap presents a significant potential for shared prosperity,
and will require, among other factors, the following:
    • Enhancing Maldivian youths’ ‘soft skills’. Soft skills (including workplace ethics and the ability to
         collaborate effectively within an organization and be responsive to clients) are missing from
         academic programs, but are widely identified as priorities for employers in the country. Such skills
         often rank higher than technical skills as decision elements for employment. The introduction of
         these skills in education programs will increase the employability of the Maldivian youth and will
         likely have a positive impact on their contribution to firms’ productivity.
    • Improving the quality and relevance of technical and vocational education. While Maldives has a
         Technical and Vocational Education Program (TVET) in place, the quality and relevance of the
         training provided has failed to meet the demands from the private sector. This, together with the
         prevailing perception of Maldivian youth that vocational education and training is an inferior
         option to academic qualifications, has contributed to further lower the interest in TVET. A closer
         collaboration between the private sector and TVET will be necessary to increase the relevance of
         programs provided, and participation of industry experts may enhance the quality of the degrees.
         Ensuring responsiveness of TVET and other relevant academic institutions to the private sector
         will be necessary to unleash the potential for technical and vocational education.
    • Enhancing participation and relevance of higher education. Enrollment in higher education is
         much lower in Maldives than in countries of similar income level. The low proportion of

                                                                                                           94
Maldivians with higher education qualifications means that the country lacks sufficient
professionals, managers and technical experts to support economic growth and social
development. Enrollment in higher education in Maldives is affected by the high dispersion in
population (with tertiary education provided mainly in Male), but other factors – such as low
completion rates in higher secondary education (which is provided in the atolls) play a role. While
enrollment in higher education will remain hampered by Maldives spatial constraints, enhancing
the relevance and quality of the programs will be essential to ensure that they are responsive to
the needs of the country.

204.    The sustainability of Maldives’ development model is dependent on how well the authorities
manage the country’s wealth-generating natural resources and its financial assets to redistribute this
wealth, and how resilient it is to external and domestic shocks.


Managing natural resources

205.    Maldives’ natural resources are its marine life, coral reefs and its islands. As discussed earlier,
there are weaknesses in the exploitation of its natural resources and in its preparedness for natural
hazards 122 .
    • Continued population development will lead to more sewage and solid waste, which impacts
        tourism and fisheries, and growing demand for clean water for island communities, a
        development that is compounded by a growing competition between water for potable and
        irrigation purposes.
    • Loss of coral reefs due to the warming of ocean water and pollution may result in the loss of bait
        fish for tuna fisheries.
    • In the tourism sector, de facto high barriers to entry and the lack of transparency in the allocation
        of leases for resort islands makes it difficult to assess if the government maximizes the benefits
        from its main natural resource.
    • The government’s plan to increase passenger arrivals from 1.2 million 123 in 2014 to 5 million 124
        will add more environmental pressure through the construction of new airports and facilities and
        increased flights.
    • Much of the population and critical infrastructure reside within 100 meters of the shoreline,
        making them vulnerable to both disaster and sea-level rise, while climate change itself will also
        affect the quality of its coral reefs.

206.    A number of dimensions of governance problems prevent the government from managing its
natural resources well and dealing with the emerging challenge of sustainability.
   • Environment and natural resource management issues are typically complex, often uncertain and
        dynamic, and affect multiple sectors, organizations and individuals. As a result, it requires strong
        leadership, a high degree of coordination, stakeholder involvement, expertise and resources to
        ensure sustainability.

      •   Although there are multiple public institutions mandated to conserve and protect the natural
          resources with backing of legal instruments, their overlapping roles, undefined relationships and
          lack of incentive to coordinate have a negative impact on management effectiveness.
      •   Lack of funds, human resources and expertise are making enforcement weak. Poor stakeholder
          involvement, especially local authorities and communities in management efforts, reduces
          enforcement capability.
      •   Poor capacity of civil servants is impacting implementation and monitoring of policies, strategies
          and programs. The private sector, which is the biggest beneficiary of natural resources and who
          can play a significant role in bringing resources, monitoring and managements, is playing only a
          limited role due to lack of opportunity and effort to mainstream.


Managing public financial resources

207.    The main mechanisms to redistribute the wealth generated by tourism are public sector
employment, social services, subsidies and transfers. The current system of redistribution has
contributed to achieving important development outcomes.
  • Public-sector employment, including education, health and social services 125 has played an
      important role in Maldives, accounting for 35 percent of employment in 2010. 126 Moreover,
      employment in the public sector has contributed to Maldives’ relatively high female labor force
      participation, as well as to poverty reduction 127.
  • Public services, and in particular the expansion of education and health services provision to
      populations living in the atolls, have contributed to a significant improvement of human
      development outcomes and human capital accumulation.
  • Electricity and food subsidies have contributed to mitigating the high cost of energy and food supply
      in Maldives, thereby improving living standards of the population. Similarly, the introduction of
      universal social pensions and health insurance have helped extend protections against the
      challenges of old age and the risk of catastrophic health expenditure to the entire population.

208.    Apart from the food and electricity subsidies delivered through SOEs, capital contributions to
SOEs are another large public expenditure item. Although a few SOEs returned annual average dividends
equal to 1.8 percent of GDP between 2011 and 2014 to the budget, annual average capital contributions
to SOEs amounted to 1.3 percent of GDP over the same period.

209.     However, sustainability of the positive outcomes achieved through the redistribution system
crucially depends on improving its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Given the already widening fiscal


125 Although health and education are not necessarily government activities, in Maldives about 90 percent of employment in the
health sector is in the public sector (Maldives Health Statistics 2013). In the education sector, about 70 percent of students are
enrolled in government schools (Maldives Statistical Yearbook 2013), and it is assumed that a similar percentage of teachers are
employed in government schools.
126 This does not include employment at SOEs.
127 See section on Poverty and shared prosperity.



                                                                                                                              97
deficits and high public debt, these mechanisms are not fiscally sustainable at current trends, and the
government will need to carefully weigh the fiscal costs and social benefits of each of the expenditure
items.

210.     The public sector employment freeze contributes to managing the wage bills and improve fiscal
sustainability. A more structural solution, which could include a review of local government pay structures
and a public-sector-wide pay scale, could be helpful to ensure consistency of wages and salaries across
public service and drive public service reform. 128 It is important that structural reform be accompanied by
efforts to improve conditions for employment in the private sector, especially for women.

211.     While it is important to continue to provide wide access to health and education services, more
careful planning based on the demographic distribution of the population could improve efficiency of
spending and free resources to improve quality. There is growing evidence that the expansion of access
to services to the atolls has been accompanied by a decline in the overall quality of service provision. 129
The failure to close the quantity and quality gap in service provision between Malé and the atolls
contributes to continued population migration toward the capital and exacerbates the (per capita) cost
of service provision in the atolls (Figure 74). Still, tailoring service provision on the demographic profile of
the population in the different parts of the country (Figure 75) could result in significant cost savings and
potentially free up resources to improve quality of service provision.

129The lack of supply of qualified medical and education professionals within the local Maldivian population, forced the central
Government to rely on expatriate workforce for expanding service delivery outside Malé (Maldives Health Statistics 2013,
Ministry of Health; School Statistics 2014, Ministry of Education). However, high turnover and limited integration of these
professionals with the local population resulted suboptimal quality of service provision.

                                                                                                                                                                           98
212.     Targeting reform of electricity and food subsidies could improve efficiency of spending while
freeing resources to protect the poor. Building on international experience, a cut to explicit subsidies
would need to be accompanied by interventions to protect the most vulnerable segments of the
population, and to limit losses of utility providers. Such strategy would aim at: (1) enabling consumption
efficiency; (2) increasing supply-side efficiency; and (3) substituting universal subsidies with a targeted
transfers system. The government has already started to target electricity subsidies by reassessing who is
eligible to receive them.

213.    Operational savings in Aasandha could cut its cost significantly, while preserving the principle
of universal health insurance. These savings could be achieved mainly through three channels: (1)
reducing the cost of medicines through the bulk procurement of essential and generic drugs; (2) reducing
expenditure on overseas treatment through negotiation of close-ended package rates with providers; and
(3) improving attention to early detection and secondary prevention of chronic diseases at the primary
care level, which will be helpful in slowing down disease progress and delaying the occurrence of
complications. Substantial capacity building of the National Social Protection Agency would also be
needed to plan, implement and monitor these reforms. 130

214.     Improving SOE governance could improve fiscal and environmental sustainability. The key
sources of fiscal risks include: (1) political interference in the management of the SOEs, in the form of
uncompensated subsidies, service requirements, and tolerance of soft budget constraints resulting in
inter-SOE debts; (2) lack of macroeconomic planning capacity, leading to potential losses as
macroeconomic variables develop differently than expected; and (3) management challenges, such as lack
of coherence between public sector and SOE investment plans. Procurement by SOEs could be made more
transparent to assess whether it delivers enough value for money. As SOEs play a key role in many utility
sectors (e.g., electricity, water and waste management), improvement in their performance could also
help alleviate some of the environmental constraints on growth.


Increasing macroeconomic resilience

215.     Better management of its resources may also make Maldives more resilient to external shocks
and help it mitigate risks. As a small island state Maldives is inherently vulnerable to external shocks, and
its heavy reliance on tourism adds a channel of exposure. Indeed, besides the exposure it shares with
other island states to natural disasters and commodity prices, Maldives is also vulnerable to recessions in
certain key tourism sectors and the indirect impact on tourism of events such as the 9/11 attacks,
Additionally, recent domestic unrest may lead to negative travel advisories.


130Systematic costing, adequate autonomy at the facility level, and appropriate incentive mechanisms being put in place at the
design stage, to encourage high productivity and cost containment, would be pre-requisites for such reform. Improved
information systems making possible continuous analysis of Aasandha’s administrative data would be important for internal
controls and informing ongoing reforms, as would be regular compilation and analysis of household survey data to periodically
check on the scheme’s performance and distributional implications.

                                                                                                                          99
216.     Maldives will remain exposed to external shocks from tourism under its current development
model so it needs to decrease its vulnerability to other shocks and increase its resilience. In order to
analyze the options to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience, vulnerability is decomposed into three
parts: (1) exposure to shocks; (2) internal conditions that may amplify or attenuate shocks domestically;
and (3) risk management in the form of ex-ante institutional quality and ex-post policy space to mitigate
the impact of shocks. 131
    • Exposure: Maldives is mainly exposed to external demand shocks through tourism, external
         supply shocks from commodity prices and natural disasters.
    • Internal conditions: Fiscal revenue is highly dependent on tourism, while a large part of public
         expenditure is rigid and difficult to adjust. Combined with high public debt, this makes the fiscal
         accounts also vulnerable to shocks. In addition, the country is structurally highly open to trade,
         and any countercyclical fiscal policy would lead to more imports and potentially destabilizing the
         external sector.
    • Institutional quality: Maldives has low ratings for policies and institutions, in particular for fiscal
         policy and for debt policy and management. 132
    • Policy space: The country has limited macroeconomic and fiscal space to deal with an external
         shock. It has low usable official foreign exchange reserves, 133 and it runs a persistent fiscal deficit.


217.   While it cannot eliminate its vulnerability to shocks, Maldives has opportunities to reduce its
vulnerability and increase its resilience within limits by:
    • Diversifying sources of tourism. Maldives can try to diversify its sources of tourism by attracting
       tourists from other parts of the world and by attracting more tourists to its guest houses and
       other offerings outside resorts. Accessing different markets that are not perfectly synchronized
       could reduce the current volatility of tourist arrivals. The added benefit is the guest-house tourism
       is more inclusive for the local population (Priority area 1).
    • Reducing reliance on imported fuel. Maldives is interested in introducing solar power to replace
       imported diesel. With diesel imports accounting for around 20 percent of total merchandise
       imports, this could have a significant effect on vulnerability to commodity price fluctuations.
       Installing and maintaining solar panels could have the added benefit of providing local
       employment for engineers. It should be noted that existing suppliers of diesel-based power may
       initially try to hinder efforts to switch to solar energy until they make the switch themselves.
    • Reforming in public expenditure. Reforms in the system of wages, subsidies and transfers would
       make the budget more flexible to deal with revenue shocks without continuously increasing public
       debt. Moreover, it could reduce overconsumption of subsidized electricity and certain imported
       goods, which would reduce external exposure as well. However, this type of reform may be
       politically difficult, and will need a social safety net (such as targeted cash transfers) to protect
       the poorest.

     •    Decreasing risk of debt portfolio. As Maldives becomes richer, concessional external debt may
          become less available. Public domestic debt has a very short maturity, and is subject to refinancing
          and interest risk. 134 Extending the maturity profile would reduce the risk but could increase the
          cost of debt. There are natural buyers of longer-term public debt, such as pension funds and
          insurance companies. Establishing a yield curve beyond one year could also help the financial
          market better price risk, and it could deepen the financial market and make it easier for local
          SMEs to obtain credit.
     •    Improving public sector governance and planning capacity. Improvements in public financial
          management would lead to more credible budgets, expenditure controls, commitment to
          decreasing public debt and better selection and planning of investment projects. Improvement in
          planning capacity is needed to deal with the challenges of natural resource management, and to
          address the dilemma between consolidating the population closer to Malé and improving services
          and connectivity to populations at their current locations, and to plan the associated
          infrastructure needs.
     •    Increasing policy space. The low level of usable foreign exchange reserves leaves little space to
          manage the exchange rate and import essential goods. Mitigating this lack of space is the
          existence of a parallel market with sufficient quantities of foreign exchange. The country appears
          to have access to ad-hoc support from partners, but more formalized access to a credit line would
          reduce macroeconomic uncertainty. Fiscal space can be built up by reducing the budget deficit
          and reducing the level of public debt. As a dispersed island state with a commitment to provide
          social services to remote atolls, Maldives faces limits to how much expenditure savings can be
          made but, as explained in the previous section, there appears to be scope for efficiency gains. On
          the other side of the balance, there may be scope for increased revenue, including income tax
          revenue or a wealth tax, ideally from sources that are less correlated with fluctuations in tourism.




134 In the current situation of apparent excess liquidity in the financial market and the absence of good investment opportunities

in the private sector, this risk seems to be low. Under the “tap” system for Treasury bills, which fixes interest rates, interest rate
risk is also low.

                                                                                                                                 101

                    SUMMARY OF SCD CONSULTATIONS IN MALDIVES

                                          APRIL 27 – 30, 2015

OVERVIEW

A series of seven consultations involving nearly 100 participants was carried out as part of the
preparation of this Systematic Country Diagnostic in Malé. Participants were drawn from government
agencies, civil society organizations, youth groups, non-governmental organizations, student bodies,
academia, development partner, and the private sector to ensure that diverse perspectives were
represented.

The consultations were arranged under four thematic groups: (1) Opportunities for private-sector
development and economic diversification; (2) Improving government delivery performance; (3)
Addressing social risks; and (4) Tackling environmental vulnerability. In all sessions, the WBG highlighted
the key messages that were emerging in the preparation of the Systematic County Diagnostic for Maldives
and presented a broad overview of issues that were considered important to be addressed. The
consultation process also included two technical meetings in Malé with representatives of the
Government of Maldives. These meetings were used as a means of further understanding the current
government strategy and as an opportunity to engage with the government team that was preparing the
National Development Strategy.

Three objectives guided the consultation process:

•   Obtaining perspectives from stakeholders on key economic, social and environmental challenges
    facing Maldives.
•   Presenting an overview of the key findings of the SCD and validating the data used.
•   Sharpening key messages in the SCD and identifying any new trends that were emerging .

Participants broadly agreed with the key areas identified as priorities facing Maldives and the main
thrust of the SCD in this context. Tourism and fisheries remain the two main engines of growth.
Participants agreed that while tourism has remained largely an enclave industry, fisheries has unrealized
potential. Key vulnerabilities were also highlighted. They included: (1) a weak macro fiscal environment
(largely linked to unsustainable cost of service provision to a small and dispersed population, coupled with
inefficiencies in government expenditures); (2) social trends, (youth unemployment especially among
women); (3) environmental vulnerabilities, (related to the lack of institutional capacity to adequately
manage natural resources, deficiencies in waste, sewerage and management leading to pollution, and
lower prioritization of environmental issues in government policies); and (4) governance issues. The
following report presents recurring points noted during consultations.

    1. Opportunities for private-sector development and economic diversification

“No new industries have been set up in Maldives for the last 30 years.”


                                                                                                        108
Agriculture

Increasing linkages between agriculture SMEs and high-value sectors such as tourism were described as
important income-generating activities for island communities. Agriculture was identified as a sector
that could have significant impact on promoting shared prosperity. Participants explained that although
demand for locally sourced produce exists in the tourism industry (as its cheaper and involves less
wastage), the lack of a single aggregated market and high transportation costs make imports more feasible
for resorts. On the supply side, the lack of extension services and limited willingness of Maldivians famers
to cooperate on decisions related to the type of produce to grow on the limited land were also cited as
key obstacles for the growth of agricultural SMEs.

The establishment of cooperative societies on islands have seen mixed results. Participants highlighted
several instances where the establishment of cooperatives has led to significant income generation for
farmers with value-added agricultural produce being sold resorts. However, there have also been several
instances where cooperatives failed due to the inability of farmers to reach consensus on the type of crops
to be grown and the manner in which scarce resources (water and land) were to be utilized. Some
participants expressed concern that the lessons learned from previous failed attempts were not being
analyzed and used in the implementation of new schemes. Participants further explained that the lack of
quality extension services and access to finance were further obstacles to the development of agriculture
in Maldives.


Fisheries

While investment in the fisheries sector is lucrative, low budget allocations, low reliance on technology
and the lack of data sharing has impeded growth in this subsector. Participants highlighted the fact that
the fisheries sector has been a source of steady income (with earnings in excess of $1,000/month per
fisherman). However, declining revenues in the last five years was cited as a cause for concern.
Participants pointed out that increased national budget allocations for the development of the sector
would promote opportunities for substantially scaling up the fisheries industry. Low cooperation among
fishermen to identify prime fishing sites, limited knowledge of and low use of technology, and unreliable
data (specifically on harvesting trends) were identified as other issues impeding growth in the sector. The
creation of better linkages with resorts was also cited as a possible step towards increasing revenues and
expanding the fisheries industry. Labor regulations that prevented the use of migrant workers for
harvesting of fish was cited as a possible factor in allowing all income generated by the industry to benefit
Maldivians directly.

Access to finance

A conservative lending culture is impeding SME growth. Participants explained that access to finance
was severely constrained for SMEs. Most SMEs (especially new ventures) do not have sufficient collateral
to obtain loans and the lack of tailored financial products and instruments impede capital requirements
for their expansion.. Loans for agriculture, in comparison, were cited as more easily obtained. However,
as sufficient monitoring and evaluation was not being carried out in the sector, some loans were being

                                                                                                         109
used for private consumption and not for agricultural expansion. Participants also explained that
conducting a needs assessment to identify the specific financial instruments required for SME
development is an important first step to increase access to finance and also reduce the cost of finance.



    2. Improving government delivery performance

“The number one issue we have in Maldives is governance.”

Issues concerning weak governance and the lack of strong public institutions were cited as key concerns
for Maldivians at present. While participants were satisfied with overall government service provision,
improving both the standard of education (from early childhood education to tertiary and vocational
education) and health facilities was cited as important. Participants explained that the absence of
sufficient checks and balances between the key arms of state, the perceived limited independence of the
Judiciary, and low levels of transparency and accountability in the administration resulted in a weak
institutional framework. This undermined public trust in the institutional framework and also led to the
erosion of investor confidence. Participants cited examples such as bringing the Environment Protection
Agency under the purview of the Ministry of Tourism (thus limiting the autonomy of the agency), the
reversal of policies, and the lack of transparency in the granting of students loans and SME development
loans as key instances where the governance mechanism had failed. Participants also described political
instability as a major impediment in tackling key issues involving solid and liquid waste management,
urban development and climate change resilience. Additionally participants indicated that the absence of
a transparent, open and safe space for dialogue between public- and private-sector stakeholders and the
lack of a participatory approach to policy making as key obstacles to improving the governance framework
within Maldives.



    3. Addressing social risks

“Currently, the mindset of Maldivians is very strange.”

Youth unemployment

Resolving issues related to youth, such as unemployment and skills development, was consistently cited
as a key priority by participants at all four sessions. Employers and employees provided contradictory
viewpoints as to why unemployment continued to a significant issue. Youth unemployment was attributed
several factors by employers. Perceptions of poor work ethic among Maldivian youth, the inability to
obtain the required skill sets (instances of difficulties in finding Maldivians with an adequate command of
English were highlighted) and practical difficulties (such as the provision of transport to island
communities to work in resorts) were key reasons cited by employers. Employees highlighted the bias
against the hiring of Maldivians by Maldivians (specifically in the tourism sector for positions beyond a
supervisor role and in the health sector for nurses), the lack of vocational training opportunities for
employment as electricians, plumbers and carpenters (where significant labor demand exists), and the lax

                                                                                                       110
implementation of labor regulations (specifying that half of employees should be Maldivians) in the
tourism sector. Beyond skills, the consultations highlighted that youth unemployment stems from a
disconnect between the aspirations of an ‘ideal’ job among the current generation of youth and their
parents on the one hand, and the reality of the kinds of jobs that are available in a small island country
with limited human capacity. Youth unemployment was cited as the key reason for increased drug abuse
and the participation of young people in gangs. Current policy initiatives were also cited as being
insufficient to address key youth issues and required the adoption of a holistic and contextual approach
for increased success.

Intergenerational relations were highlighted as another driver exacerbating youth unemployment.
Social norms that favor young people continuing to live at home relieve the young of the financial and
social pressures to search for jobs. Even as affordable housing remains elusive and the size of homes
shrinks, multigenerational homes continue to be the norm, and continue to provide a financial buffer for
unemployed youth. The lack of space and house overcrowding had also encouraged many young people
to look for a space outside the home in search of an identity. This helped lead to the proliferation of gangs
and drug use.

“Maldivian youth lack an identity and this is creating problems.”


Gender roles

While the civil law structure in Maldives promotes gender egalitarianism, the consultations revealed
that gender norms in Maldives are strongly influenced by social dynamics. Participants explained that in
the recent years Maldivian society has been shifting towards a form of conservatism that has
strengthened taboos and social stigmas. This was described as having a negative impact on women’s
choices to enroll in education and search for jobs. Participants highlighted the need for focused policy
initiatives to combat the decrease in the number of women seeking employment and disengaging from
playing an active role in Maldivian society.




    4. Tackling environmental vulnerability


“We should do more than only talk about Maldives going under water.”

Efficient usage of land requires the analysis of the efficiency of allocation together with strengthened
monitoring and evaluation frameworks within institutions. Participants explained that key decisions
such as the allocation of islands for tourism should be juxtaposed in the context of using such land for the
expansion of agriculture. With the inability to analyze the extent to which agricultural livelihoods have
been lost due to the construction of resorts (especially for resorts where construction was not totally

                                                                                                         111
completed) owing to the lack of data, due consideration must be given to determining what effect future
allocations will have in this regard. Although monitoring and evaluation is carried out on islands that have
been leased out for agriculture, further cost benefit analysis will ensure allocative efficiencies.

Strong monitoring and evaluation frameworks are required to ensure the sustainable use of natural
resources. Participants explained that while tuna fishery is heavily regulated (in line with obligations to
the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission) and fishing for sharks is banned to prevent over-exploitation, no such
protection exists for reef fish. Participants said that reef fish such as groupers were possibly over-fished
on some reefs, thereby damaging ecosystems. Resource-sharing and linked management between the
fisheries and tourism sectors (specifically in the sustainable management of the reef fish population) were
also highlighted as being vital.

    5. Recommendations

“What we need is national development strategy bounded by a sustainable public financial plan.”

Future government strategies must incorporate integrated planning encompassing all sectors.
Participants identified the lack of integrated planning (combining different sectors) as being a key obstacle
for the successful implementation of new initiatives undertaken by the government. Integrated planning
was seen as key means of ensuring success in high-growth sectors, such as tourism, which could benefit
from increased linkages with the fisheries sector, (where the health of coral reefs are directly dependent
on sustainable fishing practices). Participants explained that issues concerning the disposal of waste and
sewerage, access to fresh water and the use of renewable energy sources could have been more easily
resolved if integrated urban planning was consistently incorporated into government policy initiatives.

“The failure to equally address both environmental and fiscal challenges could potentially destroy
Maldives in the near future.”

While public infrastructure investments remain a priority for government, market-based solutions are
required to induce behavior change. Public investments, specifically in port and airport infrastructure,
were cited as priority to combat constraints to international trade. However, increasing social welfare,
while ensuring fiscal consolidation, would require market-based solutions.

Improving statistics

Improving the reliability and consistency of key statistical data was seen as vital for the development
of effective policy measures. Participants highlighted that critical discrepancies in statistics considerably
distorted the policy planning process. Vital statistical data, such as income and employment generation
in the fisheries and agriculture sectors, was described as severely under represented. Data was also
described as sparse for various aspects of consumption, such as the quantum of public services being
consumed by expatriates. Even critical analysis on issues such as youth unemployment was hindered by
the lack of accurate data on the proportion of unemployed youth. Enacting legislation to ensure quality
control of statistics was cited as one measure that could lead to accurate statistical data.

Creation of a consistent consultative process

                                                                                                         112
The consultative process with both the private sector and civil society should be improved to ensure
inclusive and sustainable development. Participants explained that private-sector involvement in policy
discussions has been initiated several times but the outcomes were consistently undermined by political
changes that led to the initiation of unfeasible plans based on election pledges. Participants also
highlighted significant gaps between decisions reached by policymakers and technocrats. This led to
government manifestos not being aligned with technical plans, resulting in changes to existing policy
structure when governments changed. The creation of a central focal point for carrying out consultations
and initiating central planning was also cited as key reform measures that would promote transparency
in policy decisions and ensure successful collaboration with the private sector.

                                                   Box A.1

A snap poll (in the form of a written questionnaire) was also conducted among participants.
The questionnaire consisted of five questions – two on the top three challenges for Maldives
(immediately and in the medium-term), one on possible solutions to these challenges and two on
potential steps to be taken immediately and in medium-term on the government reform agenda.
Although the questionnaire drew a 95 percent response rate, the small sample size was a key drawback
for obtaining conclusive results on the overall trend of responses. The exercise provided the means for
obtaining information on issues that participants were reluctant to discuss (such as corruption). It also
provided further assessment of the key thematic areas, verification of response patterns, and enabled the
further prioritization of proposed reform actions to be initiated.

                     Tax advantages 137 on leasing commonly present in
                     other countries are missing in Maldives.                  The lack of reasonable tax advantages reduces the

135 According to banks interviewed, loans backed by properties take up to 10 years for settlement in case of default.
136 Courts ruled in two cases against MFLC, the largest leasing company denying access to enforce claims on the leased assets,
against the basic principle of leasing, which is based on the ownership of the asset by the leasing company and usually provides
for an expedite repossession of the asset in case of default.
137 Leasing has potential favorable tax treatment over a purchase of equipment. In a true lease, many jurisdictions allow the

deduction of the entire amount of the monthly payment as an operating expense. This often result into a more favorable tax
treatment for investment over the common depreciation of equipment in purchases.
138 Operations of MFLC, the largest leasing company in Maldives reduced sharply following the negative ruling on their ability to

enforce claims on leased assets. It is estimated that following the ruling the company’s leasing portfolio decreased by 21 percent,
its borrowing by 38 percent, and its net worth by 18 percent. Management is using its cash to pay off debt and declare dividends
rather than for funding new leases. Its management is now limiting new leasing primarily to repeat customers with whom it has
been able to sign standard contractual end of term asset transfer options that will reduce risks of loss on the lease contracts.

Annex 4. Prioritization framework

The identification of the priorities areas is the result of a three-step process. First, during the concept
stage, hypotheses on the functioning of Maldives’ development model and on the drivers of its
vulnerabilities were formulated, and knowledge gaps identified. Second, during the SCD development
stage, these hypotheses were corroborated by additional analysis and knowledge gaps filled whenever
feasible under the given timeline. Third, consultations with local stakeholders were used to further
validate hypotheses and analysis (Annexes 1 and 2).

This process led to the identification of a number of thematic areas that appeared directly linked with
the opportunities for enhancing shared prosperity and poverty reduction in Maldives. These areas are:
(1) enhancing opportunities for the local population to benefit from existing industries; (2) enabling
opportunities for creation of new sources of growth; and (3) improving public resource management and
reducing macro-fiscal risk. These thematic areas were further assessed on four main criteria, namely:
impact on twin goals; time horizon; complementarities; and evidence base available (Table A.1).

In addition to these areas, governance issues appear in many of these priority areas as an important
cross-cutting constraint. Various dimensions of governance constraints can be identified, including lack
of transparency in tourism, overlapping roles of government agencies in fisheries, incomplete legal and
regulatory framework hampering the investment climate, and weakness of capacity, in particular in
natural resource management and deficiencies in the management of SOEs.

The consultations with stakeholders in Maldives broadly confirmed the priority areas and constraints.
The participants agreed with the focus on opportunities for private-sector development and economic
diversification, improving government delivery performance, addressing social risks and tackling
environmental vulnerability. The participants mentioned the following constraints: structural constraints
affecting agriculture; access to finance for SMEs; weak governance and lack of public trust in
institutional framework; absence of a safe space for dialog between the public and private sector; social
spending leading to youth unemployment; social dynamics having a negative impact on women; fiscal
challenges; and environmental sustainability. The participants’ recommendations can be summarized as:
integrate government strategies across all sectors; improve statistics for better policy planning; and
create a consistent consultative process with the private sector and civil society to ensure inclusive and
sustainable development. The snap surveys also suggest that social and economic issues may become
more important in the next five to 10 years.
