The Systematic Country Diagnostic:
A New World Bank Group Tool for
Country Engagement
Under its new approach to working with its country
partners, the World Bank Group (WBG) requires the
preparation of a Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD)
to precede the development of Country Partnership
Frameworks that guide programming. The objective of
an SCD is to identify the most critical constraints and
opportunities facing a country in accelerating progress
toward the goals of ending extreme poverty and
promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner.
The SCD is expected to produce an objective, evidence-
based, candid assessment of the main challenges facing
the country, without limitation to the areas where the
WBG is currently engaged.

     KEY PRIORITIES IN ADDRESSING THE FISCAL CHALLENGE
     ■■     Maintaining continued commitment to fiscal sustainability will require long-term revenue measures.
     ■■     Simplifying the tax regime and improving tax administration to increase the tax base could reverse the declining
            revenue trend.
     ■■     Low revenues and rigidity in expenditures undercut investment in human development while higher levels of
            financing and effectiveness thereof are needed to meet Sri Lanka’s needs as it transitions to a MIC.
     ■■     Inefficiencies in social protection and management of the public service particularly undermine efficient use of
            resources.

  Box 4.1 Tourism on the rise but constrained by capacity

  The sector that picked up the fastest following the end of the war was tourism, with the country receiving global acclaim as a leading tourist
  nation. The unique product offering owing to the diverse attractions in a compact area gives Sri Lanka an edge over many other Asian
  destinations. New tourist hotels have been one of the most robust sectors for increased private investment after the conflict ended. Global
  chains like Shangri-La Group (Hong Kong SAR, China/Singapore), India’s upscale ITC Group, Thailand’s Minor Group and Banyan Tree, Spain’s
  RIU Hotels & Resorts, Singapore’s Aman Resorts and Mustafa Group have begun investing in the country. In addition, international brands
  such as Sheraton, Marriott, Hyatt, Movenpick and Onyx have signed management agreements with local hotel companies. Locally, several
  of the domestic conglomerates, including Jetwing, John Keells, Aitken Spence, Hemas, Citrus and Dilmah have expanded their tourism
  investments. These new additions and upgrades are increasing both the supply and quality of medium- and high-end accommodation that
  is needed for continued growth. However, the growth of the sector could be severely hampered by inadequate capacity. It is projected that
  an additional 30,000 new rooms are required across Sri Lanka to cope with growing demand. The tourism industry would need to invest in
  different segments of new accommodation to meet different tourist needs – from city hotels, large resorts, high-end boutique hotels and
  villas, as well as tented camps and rural bungalows. Alongside this, 50,000-60,000 new hospitality staff needs to be trained to support just
  the growth in room inventory. Sri Lanka currently has the capacity to train only around 1,800 new graduates each year. At the same time, the
  tourism sector requires professionals in other disciplines, such as marketing, IT and sports/recreational training. Additionally, Sri Lanka would
  need to develop new destinations across the country (particularly in under-developed locations with natural assets in the North and East), and
  diversify the product offering in order to cater to a wider variety of tourist needs, while remaining conscious of the environmental and social
  pressures brought on by rising tourist numbers.

     Box 4.2 Global experience in attracting and retaining FDI: infrastructure and incentives are not major factors

     The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency conducted a Global Investment and Political Risk survey of investors in 2013 to identify
     the main factors that inform the selection of investment destinations. Global investors seek macroeconomic and political stability in the
     host country as a foundation. Beyond that, the availability of qualified staff is the most important decision element, and one that has
     grown rapidly in relevance over the past few years. Other factors, such as the availability of infrastructure, have substantially decreased
     in importance when investors select locations. Notably, while the size of the domestic market used to be a major decision factor, it has
     become less important owing to shifting interest towards efficiency and linkages to global markets. The views of global investors offer
     insights that can be used to determine the priorities for policies and investments aimed at attracting and retaining FDI. They also highlight
     the fact that bringing FDI to Sri Lanka will require much more than investment in infrastructure and incentives to investors. Research on
     other countries has demonstrated that: (i) incentives alone can be insufficient to attract efficiency-enhancing FDI; (ii) retention of FDI is
     low as incentives pose a significant fiscal strain and investors often switch investment destinations when incentives dry up; and (iii) fixing
     enabling-environment deficiencies can be more effective than offering incentives to cover for such deficiencies.
     Sri Lanka may consider other factors to attract investment, including:
     •	 Minimizing uncertainty and fostering investor confidence through certainty on policies and regulations.
     •	 Eliminating unnecessary regulatory and policy obstacles to FDI.
     •	 Investing in education to ensure that the population (and especially the youth) has the skills demanded by efficiency-enhancing
           enterprises (see below).
     •	 Establishing a level playing field that fosters competition and eliminates preferential treatment for specific public or private players.
     •	 Developing a well-functioning financial sector that can actively contribute to the development of local firms that can be part of the
           ecosystem around foreign enterprises.
     Minimizing uncertainty and fostering investor confidence. Governments have a major role in building investor confidence through
     ensuring predictability and consistency in regulations that govern the activities of foreign investors, as well as protecting investor rights
     and ownership. Arguably, this confidence is particularly important in attracting efficiency-seeking investors, whose business model depend
     on productivity and reliability of production (which can be easily disrupted by regulatory changes), rather than on cheap access to natural
     resources. Recent actions including the appropriation of 37 “underutilized” assets, as well as the proposed/upcoming changes to land
     laws, significantly undermine the confidence of foreign investors on Sri Lanka, and reduce its competitiveness as a long-term investment

    Investment entry barriers include both (de jure) rule-based, legal barriers and (de facto) factual barriers that arise on the ground. Although
    most countries in the world seek to attract foreign investment, very few countries maintain an entirely open investment regime. Some
    limitations may intentionally discriminate against foreign firms, such as when a country closes a sector for security or cultural reasons, or
    protects a domestic industry. Other limitations may arise as a substitute for regulation, or because of institutional dynamics and inefficiencies.
    In addition to policy obstacles, there are procedural barriers, including documentation requirements, as well as de facto barriers such as
    lack of enforcement or excessive discretion on the part of public officials. Research conducted on OECD countries, estimated FDI increases
    after the removal of specific restrictions (Table B1). While these figures may not necessarily reflect the situation in Sri Lanka, they highlight
    the potential of reforms in enhancing the attractiveness of a country as an investment destination. In the case of Sri Lanka, the World Bank
    has not undertaken a formal assessment of specific barriers. Such analysis would help in order to identify the current obstacles that may be
    further reducing the attractiveness of the country as an investment destination.

     State-owned enterprises are a subset of what are legally defined as public enterprises. The Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises
     identifies six categories of institutions that fall under its oversight: regulatory bodies, promotional agencies, state-owned enterprises,
     educational agencies, development agencies and research institutions. There are about 240 entities that fall under the committee’s ambit,
     many of which are financed by the budget. Regular monitoring and reporting is carried out by the MoF for 55 larger SOBEs, which have
     commercial income. For the purposes of the SCD, the 55 SOBEs are referred to as SOEs.

86   |    IV. Fostering Growth and Jobs for the Bottom 40 Percent
Box 4.4 State intervention in agriculture

Sri Lanka’s government plays a particularly large role in agriculture, consistent with inward-oriented policies, inefficient land markets, and
a large SOE sector, which, together, create distortions.
Agricultural trade and price policies. Sri Lanka’s agricultural policies have encouraged import substitution of basic agricultural
commodities. Border taxes on imports and exports of agricultural products and tradable agricultural inputs have to generate fiscal revenue,
support farmers engaged in import-competing activities and tax producers of export-oriented products. Import duties,and other taxes at
the border yield nominal protection rates for importables for most agricultural products in the order of 30–50 percent. For rice, the total
protection rate was 34 percent in 2011, making it a highly protected crop, mainly as result of fertilizer subsidies. Maize, potatoes and milk
are highly protected as well. Exports of tea and rubber are taxed at low rates.
The high protection of importables has created strong disincentives for crop and export diversification, providing support to expand
production of import-competing crops (rice, maize) and discouraging the production of exportables. While agricultural export promotion
is highlighted in various policy statements, Sri Lanka’s trade policy is overly complex and slows rather than accelerates export growth.
Protection also results in inefficient use of public resources, and does not benefit smallholders as intended. Additional distortions are
created by land-use restriction and policies that target subsidized fertilizers for particular sectors, such as paddy.
The distortions affect producers and consumers. Rice producers gain at the expense of consumers. Income from paddy farming is estimated
to be 36 percent higher than what it would be without government intervention. Similarly, incomes from potato and milk production are
significantly higher while the policy impact on incomes from tea and rubber production is insignificant. Coconut farmers, on other hand,
experience significant income reductions due to export taxes. The aggregate effect on agricultural income in absolute terms depends
on the levels of production of all crops and the crop mix fostered by the incentive structure. Current policies represent an implicit tax on
consumers of about 300 percent on maize and chili, 96 percent on milk, 54 percent on potatoes and 12 percent on rice.
Land tenure and rural land markets. Sri Lanka’s current land tenure policy, which restricts use rights and transferability, depresses
returns to land and the absence of a functioning rural land market constrains long-run sector performance. Smallholder farmers are, in
essence, prevented from mobilizing one of their most important assets for promoting much-need investment into an under-funded under-
invested sector.
While government policy has aimed at equitable distribution of land, it has also fostered and perpetuated smallholder agriculture. Land
legislation and settlement administration have successively limited farm size and constrained the rights of both owners and operators.
Population pressure and inheritance practices have caused substantial fragmentation, leaving average farm-size well below the public-
sector-irrigation-scheme norm of one hectare. Overall, 72 percent of farms are below one hectare. In the absence of a rural land market,
irrigation-scheme settlers wishing to exit agriculture face a choice of abandoning a valuable farm or entering the uncertain informal market
while market-based land consolidation necessary for productivity growth remains depressed.
Functioning land markets would allow farmers to adjust size to respond to changing commodity prices and increased risks. The key to
making this work is secure tenancy agreements and a stronger leasehold market. For public- sector land, long-term leases with provision
for easy transfer would be a major improvement. For private-sector land, mechanisms to resolve title disputes through administrative and
legal means as well as incentive systems are an immediate necessity. Legislation and programs to establish public- and private-sector
institutions and professions to facilitate development of land markets are also required.
The government should seek to unlock productivity potential in rural areas, particularly given the importance of the
sector for poverty reduction. Sri Lanka’s low productivity levels – and the lack of incentives for farmers to improve productivity – call
for renewed attention to basic investments in technology, extension services, irrigation, and market infrastructure. They also call for
adjustments in the broader enabling policy framework to foster diversification and productivity and improve export competitiveness. This
will not only include investments in restoring and further upgrading the country’s productive infrastructure, facilitating market linkages,
and introducing modern agricultural technologies but also creating a policy environment that favors the expansion of the private sector,
especially SMEs, and allowing for more flexibility in the rural land, labor and capital markets.

        clude potential impacts on employment in the absence of concurrent changes in labor legislation and other
        measures to reduce the cost of doing business.
   ■■   Analysis of firm productivity, entry and exit, and survival of firms, taking advantage of the results of the first

        barriers to the establishment and growth of firms.
   ■■   Analysis of the school-to-work transitions of young workers, with an emphasis on cognitive and non-cognitive
        skills, aimed at identifying policy options to bolster employment and labor force participation.
   ■■   Analysis of bottlenecks reducing the ability of creditworthy firms and economically viable projects from getting
        financing, especially among SMEs.
   ■■   Analysis of migration and mobility – both internal and external -- to identify potential constraints to labor mo-

   ■■   Using urbanization to drive inclusion. This is enhanced if there is a governance framework that empowers local
        decision-making responsive to the needs of the poor and bottom 40 percent for public services and infrastruc-
        ture.
   ■■   Multi-sector interventions to improve public service provision and promote employment opportunities in areas
        where poverty is localized -- including the Northern and Eastern provinces, Moneragala and the Estates; empha-
        sis should also be devoted to reducing nutritional deprivation.
   ■■   Promoting reconciliation and efforts to improve equality of opportunity across ethnic groups. This includes pro-
        moting employment opportunities, addressing land claims in the former conflict areas, providing assistance to
        new and former internally displaced persons (IDPs), and integrated efforts to assist widows and ex-combatants.
   ■■   Increasing female labor force participation by: increasing education and better aligning the education women
        pursue and the demands of the market; making changes to legislation that prevents or deters women from
        being hired; and promoting greater participation of women in leadership positions.

94   |   V. Social Inclusion for Shared Prosperity and Poverty Reduction
   Box 5.2 Inclusion of ex-combatants

   Persons with physical disabilities and psychological problems due to conflict, in particular ex-combatants, are particularly vulnerable to
   exclusion. An estimated 10 to 15 percent of the population in the Northern Province – a large portion of them ex-combatants -- suffers
   from a physical disability related to the conflict, In addition, epidemiological studies conducted among conflict-affected populations in
   Northern Sri Lanka show that the conflict has led to increased psychosocial problems among these populations. Although mental health
   issues are prevalent among ex-combatants, there is a lack of psychological assistance programs specifically designed for ex-combatants.
   Notwithstanding government programs to integrate former combatants, they still struggle to enter into the labor market and have relatively
   high levels of unemployment and underemployment. Social stigma -- fears of being associated with ex-combatants or perceptions that
   they are still violent -- contributes to their marginalization. In a qualitative study conducted with young female ex-LTTE fighters in the
   Eastern district of Batticaloa, Krishnan (2011) notes that job opportunities are more restrictive for female ex-combatants than their male
   counterparts, with the biggest barrier being that they are not able to use the clerical, engineering, or other non-combat skills they had
   learned. Ex-combatants face surveillance, which prompts fears that they have not been fully rehabilitated.

  Box 5.3 Gender-based violence: one of the most extreme forms of exclusion

  GBV is one of the most extreme interferences with women’s dignity, and it impacts their opportunities to participate in
  society. The forms of violence faced by the women in Sri Lanka range from rape and domestic violence to sexual harassment in public
  transportation. All these prevent women’s access to health, education and employment opportunities. Legal consequences for rapists are rare
  and, in a UN-led survey, only 34 percent of those who admitted rape felt worried or guilty about their actions, suggesting that social norms are
  permissive of this extreme form of violence against women.
  Several studies argue that violence against women has increased due to conflict and disaster. The presence of military forces,
  the setting of displacement camps, the loss of male household members to war and alcohol abuse caused by war-related trauma increase
  insecurity for women. The tsunami additionally contributed to this environment of insecurity for women, who became victims of sexual and
  domestic violence both in the immediate aftermath of the disaster and during the post-tsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction process.
  Finally, due to instability caused by the conflict and natural disaster, girls were rushed into child marriages to tsunami widowers who sought
  government subsidies for marrying and starting a family, creating vulnerability.
  Gender-based violence is linked to cultural norms and attitudes about masculinity. In a survey conducted in Colombo, Hambantota,
  Nuwara Eliya and Batticaloa districts, de Mel et al (2013) argue that male perpetration of gender-based violence is linked to cultural attitudes
  about how to be a man. The study found that majority of men as well as women linked manhood to dominance, toughness and violence. Men
  who reported committing sexual violence often were motivated by sexual entitlement – as men they perceive themselves as having right to
  have sexual relations with women. Fifty five percent of men in the sample agreed that in case of rape one would have to question whether
  the victim is promiscuous or has a bad reputation. Regarding intimate partner violence (IPV), 41 percent of male respondents agreed with
  the statement that a woman should tolerate violence in order to keep the family together. Around 78 percent of men affirmed the view that
  women should obey their husbands, while 58 percent of men stated that women could not refuse their husbands. Women also contribute to
  the persistence of inequitable gender norms: 58 percent of women (a higher percentage than men) believed that a woman should tolerate
  IPV in order to keep the family together. Moreover, 75 percent of women agreed that, “some women ask to be raped by the way they dress
  and behave.”. According to the study, male attitudes on reproductive issues, equal wages, children’s education, women associations and
  entry into politics were more equitable. Seventy percent of men agreed that women should be in public decision-making roles and 62
  percent supported the greater participation of women at the elections. Lastly, the study emphasized particular vulnerabilities that men face
  throughout their lives, which increases their risk of perpetration of violence against women. Economic pressures resulting from inadequate
  income, lack of economic assets, and financial responsibilities as breadwinners are found to be among the primary causes of male stress and
  lack of well-being. Male respondents are also found to have moderate level of depression and suicidal thoughts.

  Box 7.1 Approach to prioritization

  This Systematic Country Diagnostic was compiled in three phases: (i) a comprehensive gathering and review of existing evidence
  of constraints and factors towards progress on ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity (the twin goals); (ii) identification of
  main themes and further research based on knowledge gaps identified in the initial review; and (iii) organizing and prioritizing areas of focus
  for achieving progress towards the twin goals.
  A systematic review of potential opportunities and constraints that could affect the twin goals led to the identification of
  main themes. This SCD is based on a systematic and detailed review of key potential factors impacting progress on the twin goals by using a
  hybrid framework that combines the Hausman, Rodrik and Velasco (2005) growth diagnostics methodology with the Bussolo and Lopez-Calva
  (2014) assets-based framework. The systematic review of Sri Lanka’s performance on the 22 factors identified by this framework led to four
  major themes, which formed the basis for organizing this report: (i) fiscal sustainability and the need to ensure fiscal space for development;
  (ii) fostering growth and jobs for the bottom 40 percent; (iii) ensuring spatial and social inclusion; and (iv) the importance of more effective
  and efficient governance.
  Prioritization was then conducted in two steps. First, throughout the report, prioritization was based on technical factors, including
  comparisons of Sri Lanka to other countries that are similar or aspirational as a means of prioritizing areas. Areas where Sri Lanka demonstrated
  relatively strong performance for an LMIC, such as overall access to infrastructure and basic health outcomes were assessed as having less
  importance as a constraint, but rather reflected opportunities for Sri Lanka to capitalize on in making progress on the twin goals. These
  opportunities are summarized briefly at the beginning of Chapter IV. The first six chapters of this volume represent the result of analysis that
  was made against the general criteria of:
  •	       The potential impact on ending poverty and on promoting shared prosperity: This assessed its potential impact on ending
           poverty and ensuring a sustainable increase in the welfare of the less well off. The overall impact on achieving the twin goals will
           obviously have the highest weighting.
  •	       Complementarities: This refers to the degree to which addressing these constraints would have influence across different domains
           (growth, inequality, sustainability) and/or would magnify the positive impact of addressing other constraints.
  •	       Strength of the evidence base behind the impact. This refers to the extent to which there is a compelling argument for particular
           reforms, with the stronger cases scoring higher priority.
  •	       Time horizon of impacts: This refers to the timeframe under which the impact can be expected to be realized, and would seek to
           balance short- and longer-term impacts.
  •	       Preconditions: These are constraints that need to be addressed to unlock wider potential.
  The second step in the prioritization process involved consultations with a broad set of stakeholders after the completion of
  a first working draft. These consultations validated the analysis and served to assess the relative importance of the diagnosed constraints
  and drivers. Over 120 persons from various spheres participated in consultations. Discussions at the consultations were complemented by
  surveys to ensure a broad range of inputs. On the basis of the consultations and completed analysis, prioritization of areas against the criteria
  was finalized. A summary of this prioritization is below; for a fuller treatment, please see Annex 1.4.

Note : The MDG Country Progress Snapshot provides an overview of the progress achieved at country level since 1990 towards the Millennium Development Goals. The snapshot is
intended mainly to provide the international community easy access to the information and are not meant to replace in any way the country profiles produced at the national level in
several countries. They are also meant to reflect the contribution of country-level progress to the global and regional trends on progress towards the MDGs.
The data used in the snapshot are from the MDG global database (http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Data.aspx). The metadata and responsible agencies can be found on http://mdgs.
un.org/unsd/mdg/Metadata.aspx. Sources of discrepancies between global and national figures are due to, among others, different methodology and definitions or different choice of
data sources. At the global level, the monitoring of the progress aims to ensure better comparability of data among countries.

POVERTY INDICATORS FOR SRI LANKA

How is Poverty measured?

The official poverty figures in Sri Lanka refer to the share of individuals whose per capita consumption falls below the of-
ficial poverty line. This indicator is usually defined in the literature as headcount index and it is a measure of the incidence
of poverty. The data used for the analysis are drawn from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), which has
been collected every three to five years since 1995. The 2012/13 HIES covers all 25 districts for the first time in the history of
the Sri Lanka household budget survey.

The consumption aggregate is the sum of the consumption expenditures of all food and nonfood items of each house-
hold. The consumption aggregate is spatially deflated to take into account differences in the cost of living of the different
districts. To get the per capita consumption, the spatially deflated consumption aggregate is divided by the number of
household members (excluding the persons who are member of the household but usually live elsewhere in the country or
abroad). Once per capita household consumption is calculated, it is then compared to the national poverty line, which was
set to Rs 1,423 in 2002, equivalent to the minimum necessary to consume 2,030 kilocalories per capita per day (using the
Cost of Basic Needs approach). The poverty line has been subsequently updated using the Colombo Consumer Price Index.

The World Bank uses as extreme poverty line $1.25 a day in 2005 ppp terms, which represents the mean of the poverty lines
found in the poorest 15 countries ranked by per capita consumption among 88 surveyed countries over the period 1990-
2005 (Ravallion, Chen and Sangraula, 2009). The Sri Lanka national poverty line is about $1.50 a day in 2005 ppp. Other
commonly used poverty lines for international comparisons across middle-income countries are $2.50 a day and $4 a day
in 2005 ppp, which correspond to, in turn, Rs 6,058 and Rs 9,692 a day in 2012/13 prices. In addition to the national poverty
line, The SCD will use the US $1.25, US $2.50 poverty lines.

The poverty gap and severity of poverty

Although the headcount index is the most widespread measure of poverty, it has a serious shortcoming in that it does not
take into account the intensity of poverty, i.e. how far from the poverty line the poor are. A measure of poverty that over-
comes this problem is the poverty gap index. The poverty gap index is the average shortfall of the total population from the
poverty line as a share measured as a percentage of the poverty line itself. The severity of poverty is a measure that puts a
higher weight on households furthest away from the poverty line. Both of these measures will complement the analysis of
headcount poverty in the context of the SCD.

What is the consumption cut-off line for the bottom 40 percent?

Finally, the SCD will focus on the bottom 40 percent to discuss the welfare of the less well-off more broadly. The con-
sumption cut-off line for the bottom 40 percent (the threshold below which the poorest 40 percent of population lays) in
2012/13 is Rs 6,765, or $ 2.79 a day in 2005 ppp.

Key issues with consumption calculations in Sri Lanka

There are three main concerns about the methodology followed for building the official consumption aggregate. First, the
consumption aggregate includes some items that are usually excluded, in particular: expenditure on durable goods, rare-
ly incurred expenses (e.g. weddings, funerals, ceremonies, litigations, purchased properties), and expenses on provident
funds, insurances, payment of debts, money lending and income taxes are typically excluded (see Deaton and Zaidi, 2002).
Second, to guarantee comparability across surveys, the consumption aggregate should exclude items that were not includ-
ed in previous years’ questionnaires, or those for which the recall period has changed over time. Third, since the survey is
conducted over a period of 12 months, the use of a temporal price adjustment would be recommended.

METHODOLOGY

This Systematic Country Diagnostic was compiled in three phases: (i) a comprehensive gathering and review of
existing evidence of constraints and factors towards progress on ending extreme poverty and promoting shared
prosperity (the twin goals); (ii) identification of main themes and further research based on knowledge gaps identi-
fied in the initial review; and (iii) organizing and prioritizing areas of focus for achieving progress towards the twin
goals. A guiding principle was to have broad participation and feedback from the World Bank Group’s Sri Lanka country
team as well as external experts and stakeholders to ensure completeness of data collection and analysis. Thus, following
an initial desk review of evidence, a series of brainstorming sessions were held with a broad team of stakeholders. Ultimate-
ly an additional 14 background papers and notes were also either commissioned independently or completed in parallel
and utilized for the SCD.

Marshalling evidence

A hybrid framework combining the Hausman, Rodrik and Velasco (2005) growth diagnostics methodology with
the Bussolo and Lopez-Calva (2014) assets-based framework was used to identify a set of possible constraints and
drivers towards progress on the twin goals. The Hausman, Rodrick and Velasco (2005) growth diagnostic is a top-down
approach based on a simplified growth model that identifies for several potential distortions.165 In order to focus on the
ability of the bottom 40 percent to latch on to the growth process, this top-down approach was combined with the princi-

range of possible constraints and drivers.

ples of the Bussolo and Lopez-Calva assets framework. The Bussolo/Lopez-Calva framework postulates that the incomes of
the bottom 40 percent depend on the level of assets – human, physical, financial, social and natural capital – that people
own and accumulate, the intensity with which they are used, and the returns associated to those assets. The method aims
to consider the constraints as well as facilitating factors to asset accumulation and their use. These have a direct impact
on the income generation capacity of all households in an economy, but particularly on the poor and those belonging to
the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution. The framework in Figure A1 thus places shared prosperity as the desired
goal, which in turn depends on economic growth and the ability of the bottom 40 percent to benefit from growth. The
framework provides a breakdown of the range of possible factors contributing or constraining achievement of this out-
come.

The returns to economic activity depend on the availability of assets and the returns to those assets. Assets include
human, social, natural and physical capital, with a focus on the bottom 40 percent. Human capital includes health, edu-
cation and nutrition (Figure A1). While “social capital” refers to a specific concept and attendant literature, in fact issues of
social inclusion are central to acquiring and using assets. Social inclusion is defined as “improving the terms of individuals
and groups, disadvantaged on the basis of their identity, to take part in society”.166 This can be achieved by improving the
ability, opportunity, and dignity of such people, who are disadvantaged, inter alia, on the basis of their gender, age, disabil-
ity status, caste, ethnicity, marital status or sexual orientation. Natural capital refers to access to land, a clean environment,
and natural resources such as forests and fisheries. Physical capital refers to access to basic infrastructure, including roads,
ports, electricity, water, and sanitation. It is also important to note that that there is a strong non-monetary dimension to
“shared prosperity”. That is, the growth impact of health, education, social inclusion and natural capital may not be very

large, but their impact on “well-being” may be huge.167 Health, education, social inclusion and the environment matter for
their intrinsic value, not just for their instrumental value to boost growth.

The returns to economic activity also depend on the returns to those assets, which in turn depend on government
performance and performance of the market. Government performance is reflected in its ability to (i) maintain macro-
economic stability; (ii) ensure the effective provision of public goods and services; (iii) provide a regulatory environment
that provides a level playing field that facilitates economic activity; and (iv) mitigate individual risks through a social pro-
tection system and addressing systemic risks. Market performance depends on whether there are barriers to competition
in domestic markets as well as export competitiveness of the economy as a whole, the ability to innovate, and whether
there are distortions in markets that constrain growth of the bottom 40 percent. Special attention was paid to the labor and
agricultural markets given their effects on the bottom 40 percent. Each of these potential constraints or areas of strength
was considered, evaluating the relative strength of each as a threat to future efforts to end poverty and ensure shared
prosperity.

Access to finance depends on the availability of domestic savings and access to international finance. It also depends on
whether there are bottlenecks in local finance with respect to high cost of finance, high risk (or poor risk management),
insufficient competition, issues with banking intermediation, or lack of financial literacy.

The framework provides a means to “leave no stone unturned” while also unbundling interrelated issues, which in
turn allows for greater specificity as well as comprehensiveness. Many of the possible constraints or drivers are inter-
related or cross cutting. This is particularly the case with government performance. For instance, the government’s ability
to finance (or attract private-sector financing) and organize the delivery of public goods and services has a direct impact
on the quality and quantity of assets held by the poor, and its performance as a regulator affects markets and the cost of
finance. For the purposes of this SCD, performance of government was reviewed in terms of core government functionality
and capacity whereas its specific impacts in areas such as improving human capital were addressed in those respective
sections. Similarly, social inclusion concerns are cross cutting. They are, however, distinct in their core interest in individuals
and groups disadvantaged on the basis of their distinguishing features and how their ability, opportunity and dignity to
own, accumulate and use assets and generate returns from them can be improved.

Identification of main themes and prioritization

Prioritization was conducted in two steps. First, analysis of technical issues and outputs/outcomes among possible
constraints or, conversely, strong performance along each of the 22 dimensions identified in the framework pointed to
the relative importance of a given issue. Where possible, this analysis was complemented by comparisons of Sri Lanka to
its past performance as well as to other countries that have similarities and/or are aspirational for the country, primarily
in South and Southeast Asia. While differences in Sri Lanka’s performance compared to others did not necessarily mean
the presence of a constraint, in cases where the country was an outlier often did indicate areas of relative weakness. This
process led to the identification of four main themes in the context of wide consultation, both within the Bank as well as
through brainstorming sessions with multiple stakeholders in Sri Lanka.

The information and analysis gathered were then weighed against five criteria:
■■     The potential impact on ending poverty and on promoting shared prosperity: This assessed its potential impact on
       ending poverty and ensuring a sustainable increase in the welfare of the less well off. The overall impact on achieving
       the twin goals will obviously have the highest weighting.
■■     Complementarities: This refers to the degree to which addressing these constraints would have influence across dif-
       ferent domains (growth, inequality, sustainability) and/or would magnify the positive impact of addressing other con-
       straints.
■■     Strength of the evidence base behind the impact. This refers to the extent to which there is a compelling argument for
       particular reforms, with the stronger cases scoring higher priority.
■■     Time horizon of impacts: This refers to the timeframe under which the impact can be expected to be realized, and

144
      would seek to balance short and longer-term impacts.
■■    Preconditions: This would identify constraints that need to be addressed in order to unlock wider potential.

The second step in the prioritization process involved consultations with a broad set of stakeholders after the com-
pletion of a first working draft. The team carried out several rounds of consultations among focal points representing
global practices, cross-cutting solutions areas, and IFC operations regarding the draft of the analysis and solicited input on
priorities, based on the above criteria. External consultations on the analysis in the text and to identify priorities were held
with a broad range of stakeholders in government ministries and departments, think tanks, other civil society groups, rep-
resentatives of the private sector, and development partners. Consultations were held in Colombo and in Jaffna to capture
a broader range of views. The consultations both helped to validate the analysis in the SCD and to help assess the relative
importance of the diagnosed constraints and drivers.

On the basis of feedback from all consultations, the team substantiated priorities against the five criteria. The final-
ization of priorities against criteria is articulated in the tables below.

Sri Lanka has taken significant strides in recent years to upgrade the amount and accessibility of infrastructure.
Whereas South Asian comparators continue to have infrastructure gaps that profoundly limit access for large segments of
the population, Sri Lanka has a solid infrastructure base (Figures A3 and A4). Going forward, the main issues for Sri Lanka’s
infrastructure development lie primarily in terms of efficiency of operations and maintenance and the lack of an effective
framework for soliciting private investment or more generally setting up public-private partnerships. Infrastructure has
largely been financed by the budget, with the exception of some independent power generation plants and telecommu-
nications networks. Access issues according to 2012/13 HIES data are concentrated in conflict-affected areas in the North,
though there has been visible improvement in that region. The government has invested over 220 billion rupees, or about
4.4 percent of its total expenditures (outside of interest payments) in infrastructure in the Northern Province alone over the
past five years (Ministry of Finance 2014).

Nearly all households have regular access to electricity and power supply is expected to keep pace with an annual
increase in demand of close to 10 percent, though this increase will need to be balanced to minimize environmental
impacts. Thanks in part to increased private-sector participation, there have been strong gains in recent years in reliability
and accessibility of electricity (Figure A5). Recently added capacity has yielded a 94 percent electrification rate according
to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). HIES data for 2012/13 shows 96.6 percent of the population in general (94.2 percent
for the bottom 40 percent) had access to electricity, with post-conflict areas of Mullaitivu (58.3 percent) and Kilinochchi
(40.3 percent). as the major outliers (Figure 29). Of greater issue is the cost of electricity, which appears to be driving the
identification of power as a constraint as per the last enterprise survey in 2011, though recent tariff reductions of 25 percent
have eased this burden. Costs are driven mostly by fuel imports for thermal generation. System losses have gone down
from over 20 percent in 2000 to roughly 12 percent in 2011 (World Bank 2013). Notwithstanding this record, there is scope
for improving efficiency in the power sector through optimizing dispatch from generation plants into the grid. Thanks to
tariff reforms and a write-down of liabilities, the state-run CEB turned a net profit in 2013. Future demand for energy is
expected to be met almost entirely from coal-fired plants with a reduction in the use of fuel oil and hydropower staying
level at around 4000 GWh per year and renewable sources modestly increasing from their current levels (Figure 30). How-

in modal share of private vehicles from 2010 to
2030 coupled with limitations on available road
space as well as poor condition of public transport. Sri Lanka has built expressways connecting the Southern and Western
Provinces and has plans to build an expressway network connecting the rest of the island. Capital expenditure on roads has
been financed through foreign borrowing (over half of which is from the Chinese Government) and government resources;
private financing is expected to be sought for construction of the Northern Expressway. The major issues facing the roads
sector are deferring maintenance in a tight budget environment, contracting issues, and attracting private-sector financ-
ing. A 2013 report found in a sample of road rehabilitation contracts variations resulting in cost elevation from 38 percent
to 53 percent and contract time extensions from the initial period up to completion from 7.5 percent to 180 percent (World
Bank 2013). In addition, there are multiple cases of contracting without competitive selection, often owing to financing
conditions from external lenders.

services as a percentage of the entire mobile market is 4.4 percent compared to 41.2 percent in the Asia Pacific region. The
mobile telephony market has five major companies of which two are dominant. Competition has led to some of the lowest
data and voice rates in the world. However, the dynamics in Sri Lanka’s market are such that there is limited incentive for
players to invest in increased broadband services in rural areas and new services, which in turn may delay the introduction
of new, innovative services in the sector. Despite concerns regarding broadband quality and cost, IT-enabled services and
the software industry have grown rapidly in recent years, now accounting for $500 million in export receipts and around
70,000 employed. Despite this success, there remains a workforce deficit in the ICT industry.

Sri Lanka overall outperforms its South
Asian comparators in providing for water            Source:World Telecommunication/ICT Development Report, 2014
and sanitation, but there is substantial dif-
ferences within the country between urban, rural, and estate sectors. As shown in Figure 26, Sri Lanka has slightly
better indicators than South Asian peers and is comparable to LMICs in East Asia. Pipe borne water supply coverage stands
at 44 percent (2013, National Water Supply Drainage Board (NWSDB)) nationally; of which 34 percent is managed by the
NWSDB and the rest are mainly community managed Rural Water Supply (RWS) schemes or schemes managed by the local
authorities. The technical capacity for the operation and maintenance of an estimated 40 percent of the over 4,000 RWS
schemes in the country remains low, prompting the government to establish a new National Community Water Supply De-
partment in the past year. Approximately 75 percent of the urban population has access to pipe borne water while around
20 percent of the rural population has such access. The quality of service is also lower for communities in small towns and
rural areas, where continuous 24-hour supply is a rarity. The water and sanitation service levels in the plantations (estate
sector) remain far below the national average, with only sporadic investments having been made in these areas over the
past few decades. Yet overall access to safe drinking water, which includes protected wells, is high and reported to be 85
percent of the total population (NWSDB 2013) and 94 percent according to WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme
(JMP) figures of 2012 for water and sanitation released in 2014. Similarly, the NWSDB estimates that 85.7 percent of the
population has access to adequate sanitation; with 83.2 percent having onsite sanitation and 2.5 percent a piped system.
The 2012/13 HIES data point to lower levels of access to water (62.2 percent of all households and 55.2 percent of the bot-
tom 40 percent) and sanitation (47 percent of the overall population and 36.2 percent of the bottom 40 percent having a
toilet on premises), with much lower levels of access in the Northern districts of Kilinochchi, Mulaitivuu, and Vavuniya. The
discrepancy is due in large part to the HIES not accounting for protected wells and RWS as access to water.
