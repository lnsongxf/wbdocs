                                                   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


Twenty years after the end of the war, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has yet to achieve shared
prosperity for its citizens and approach European living standards. The country has been at peace
since the end of 1995, but its development model needs adjustment if it is to join the ranks of
prosperous European economies. BiH has a disproportionately large public sector that dates back
to Yugoslav times and has only been partly reformed since, and the constitutional arrangements
under the Dayton and Washington Agreements had as their aim the cessation of war rather
than the explicit goal of building a viable and efficient state. Financial inflows, particularly aid
and remittances, have been fueling consumption-based economic growth. These inflows were
important in post-war recovery, and propelled the country back to middle-income status. However,
reaching high levels of income, creating prosperity and eliminating poverty will only happen if BiH
shifts toward an economic model that builds on international integration, especially with the EU,
BiH’s most important trading partner and anchor of institutional reform.

In principle, BiH has a number of strengths it could leverage. The country is located next to the
EU, the world’s largest economic bloc. It has achieved macroeconomic stability with low fiscal
deficits and moderate debt levels. The large diaspora is doing well and transfers an estimated
10-11 percent of GDP back to the homeland. If BiH would reach the same volume of trade with
its neighbors as it had during the time of Yugoslavia, its exports would triple. Leveraging these
strengths could make it a vibrant economy with dynamic entrepreneurs leading a catch up with
wealthier countries in Europe.

The average BiH residents cannot expect to live a prosperous life. Measured by the World Bank’s
poverty methodology, poverty was at 15 percent in 2011 (latest available data), and around half
of the population still live in a precarious situation.1 Poverty declined from 20 percent (2001) to
14 percent (2007) but has reversed modestly since the global crisis. Poverty levels are similar in
both Entities (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, FBiH and Republika Srpska, RS) and, as in
many other countries, poverty is higher among the rural population. The most critical agenda is job
creation since unemployment is closely linked to poverty and only about one in three working-age
adults in BiH has a job (and only one in four has a formal job). Much of the population lives from
informal activities, remittances from relatives, or social welfare. If the country does not create
more jobs, many Bosnians will grow old in relative poverty.

Social and economic imbalances are acute. BiH society is split into a relatively small active part
that earns a regular salary (often abroad) and a large group which depends on transfers from
the government or relatives. Many of these welfare dependents live in rural parts of the country.
Despite higher rates of poverty among those who live in rural areas (and those who work in
agriculture), the rural population has hardly declined as a share of total population since the war.
Rural life, with reasonable access to many public services, remains the better alternative for many

                                                                                           Executive Summary



     Bosnians who do not have jobs and cannot afford the higher cost of living in cities. Other populations
     are also overly impacted by poverty including children and Roma populations. Indeed, over 40
     percent of Roma area estimated to be poor. In addition one in five adult Roma are considered to
     be illiterate (compared with close to full literacy among the rest of the population) and over half
     are malnourished.

     BiH needs to rebalance its development model in two fundamental ways in order to succeed.
     First, it needs to unleash the potential of the private sector while reducing the footprint of the
     very large public sector. Second, the economy needs to shift from an inward focus driven by local
     consumption and imports to the potential of international integration through investments and
     exports. To achieve this the country needs more (and larger) companies, vibrant small and medium
     sized enterprises and a business environment that allows them to grow and expand output,
     employment, and exports.

     Currently, incentives are misaligned for embarking on this new development model. Most
     policies support those who already have a job and benefit from a consumption-based and state-
     dominated economy. For example, high social protection spending benefits the wealthy almost as
     much as the poor, state-owned companies (SOEs) that no longer operate continue to keep people
     on their payroll (building up large arrears in unpaid social contributions), and a large tax wedge
     swallows over a third of even the lowest paid workers’ salaries, making it almost impossible for
     employers to create formal jobs for lower-skilled workers. These imbalances have been difficult to
     correct because they are deeply rooted in the country’s history and institutional structures from
     the former Yugoslav Federation. At the same time, if BiH wants to eliminate poverty, create shared
     prosperity and eventually become a high-income country, it will need to break with the present
     state of affairs and find a new and more effective development path.

     The rebalancing of BiH’s social and economic model is also made difficult due to the country’s
     demographic challenges and unique institutional set-up. At 3.8 million inhabitants, the population
     of BiH is already relatively small. Yet it is among the fastest shrinking and aging populations in
     the world, which creates challenges for service delivery, especially in rural areas. Unlike many
     other emerging economies, BiH cannot reap a demographic dividend as it reorients its economic
     model. In addition, the country’s institutional fragmentation makes economic policymaking more
     challenging. The complex institutional structure established by the Dayton Agreement ending the
     war has a negative impact on the efficiency of decision-making processes and results, at times, in
     unnecessary and expensive duplication.

   Box ES.1: Social and economic development in Bosnia and Herzegovina—Key facts

   •	 Per-capita income is US$ 4,700, which is less than half the global average and only 26 percent of the
      average income in the European Union.
   •	 Poverty is at 15 percent at around $5 per day per person and is evenly distributed across both
      Entities. The poverty rate has risen modestly since 2007.
   •	 BiH has a poor track record in governance. In SEE, only Albania and Kosovo are ranked as more
      corrupt than BiH by Transparency International. Most people in BiH believe that the current
      institutional structures are reinforcing poor governance and make reform difficult.
   •	 Unemployment is over 27 percent and labor force participation is extremely low at only around 50
      percent. Youth and long-term unemployment are of particular concern, as is extremely low female
      participation in the labor force.
   •	 When the economy grew, the bottom 40 percent (B40) benefitted disproportionately. This reflects
      the pattern of job creation and large government redistribution.
   •	 The public sector is by far the bigger player in the economy. National, sub-national and local
      government expenditures account for approximately 50 percent of GDP, not including SOEs.
   •	 Only one out of three BiH working-age adults has a job and one out of four has a formal job. Almost
      half of these formal jobs are in the public sector.
   •	 Population is declining rapidly because of low birth rate and sizable outward migration. Since 1995,
      the BiH population has shrunk from 4.5 million to an estimated 3.8 million today and there will only
      be around 3.5 million people living in BiH by 2020, if the trend continues.
   •	 BiH is one of the least urbanized countries in Europe with some 60 percent of the population living
      in rural areas.

A turbulent past

BiH has a special place in the history and development of Europe. One hundred years ago, the
assassination in Sarajevo of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand, triggered
the outbreak of the First World War. Twenty-five years ago, after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the
subsequent disintegration of Yugoslavia, BiH was again the powder keg of the region. The atrocities
and devastation of the war in BiH in 1992-1995 are well documented and still explain some of its
development challenges 20 years later.

In the 1990s, BiH suffered one of the largest economic contractions in modern history, estimated
at close to 90 percent. Following a decade of economic stasis during the 1980s, Bosnia and
Herzegovina—already one of Yugoslavia’s poorer republics—suffered during the collapse of
communism in Eastern Europe, the disintegration of Yugoslavia and then war in BiH. By many
measures, no country in Eastern Europe was hit harder.

The decline of the country’s population has been dramatic. Before the war started, BiH had an
estimated 4.5 million people. Today there are only around 3.8 million people living there. This
trend will persist due to continued emigration and low fertility: by 2020, BiH will likely be home to
only 3.5 million people. Since 2014, the number of old people exceeds the young, meaning that
reforms need to happen at a time of demographic decline (Figure ES.1).

       The Dayton Agreement of 1995 restored peace but constrained effective governing of the
       country. The Agreement divided the country administratively into a weak central government
       and two Entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska,2 with FBiH
       further divided into ten cantons. The sub-national levels of government were given considerable
       power. This institutional structure resulted in significant fragmentation and duplication of public
       services and decision-making. Two extreme examples of such fragmentation are the existence of
       11 ministries of health in FBiH alone, reducing the quality of health care and increasing its costs;
       and different train companies in RS and FBiH, requiring a change of locomotives when each train
       enters the other Entity. An international oversight organ was established known as the Office of
       the High Representative (OHR). A central bank and a local currency, pegged to the Deutsche Mark
       (later the Euro), were established and they provided one of the main anchors for the new country.

       International donor resources flooded in to help the country rebuild after the war. Aid averaged
       26 percent of GDP between 1996 and 1999. Today, the institutional structures established twenty
       years ago remain largely unchanged. While the currency board (now pegged to the Euro) has been
       the bedrock of broad macro-stability in BiH, the public sector has become one of the largest in the
       world. Aided by the establishment of the Indirect Tax Authority (ITA), BiH has become one of the
       most successful tax collectors in the region, collecting the equivalent of 45 percent of its GDP in
       revenue. The large public sector is similar in size to Scandinavian countries, yet the availability and
       quality of BiH’s public services are not reflective of the large tax contributions.

       A person who is 50 years old today—born in the mid-1960s—has lived in a country beset by
       economic turmoil for most of his or her adult life. The 1980s were a decade of economic hardship
       when the Yugoslav economy stagnated and inflation reached up to 70 percent per year. In the first
       half of the 1990s an average BiH citizen experienced territorial disintegration and war. After more
       than a decade of post-war reconstruction, the country, by some measures, never quite reached
       pre-war living standards, before falling back into economic stagnation brought on by the global
       economic crisis (Figure ES.2).3

Executive Summary



BiH has many similarities with neighboring countries and a few important differences. The
similarities build on its history as part of Yugoslavia for most of the 20th century. The key traits are a
dominant role of the state, weak economic integration (internal and external), an aging population and
a high level of perceived corruption. The main differences are the extent of destruction and trauma from
the war, which resulted in one of the most extreme declines of economic activity in modern history.
The Dayton Agreement still dominates the social and political systems today, and has exacerbated and
enshrined many social and economic weaknesses of the state-led system. This institutional architecture
also strengthened vested interests in opposing institutional and economic reforms.

Neither rich nor extremely poor

BiH is an economy relying on its domestic market. With consumption averaging over 100 per cent of
GDP between 2010 and 2013, BiH is one the world’s most consumption-driven economies. The model
is fueled by a large public sector, which favors recurrent spending over investments and is fostered
by the prevalence of remittances. A credit boom after the end of the war supported the economic
recovery until 2008 but the country failed to integrate internationally and to start its export engine.

BiH citizens’ average income has reached US$ 4,740 (US$ 8,800 in PPP). However, since the global
crisis incomes have stagnated, which means that incomes are about a quarter of the EU average
and 15 percent lower than its non-EU neighbors in South-East Europe (SEE). Incomes are relatively
evenly distributed compared to other European countries, and past growth has particularly
benefitted the poorest percent of the household income distribution (B40).

Poverty remains significant in both Entities, while it declined in Brcko District (BD). From 2007 to
2011, poverty increased slightly at the national level from 14 to 15 percent (although the change
is not statistically significant), primarily due to an increase of poverty in FBiH, now projected to
be at the same level as in RS (Table ES.1).4 In BiH, poverty is a predominantly rural phenomenon
where people are twice as likely to be poor as in urban areas. This presents a particular challenge
as BiH, which, unlike other emerging economies, remains majority rural (60 percent of the total
population); unfavorable demographics combined with lack of labor market opportunities in cities
create incentives for out-migration from the country rather than urbanization momentum.

Growth has been good for the poor via both labor income and social transfers. Over the last
decade BiH has become a more equal country. From 2004-2011, (the period for which household
data is available), the household expenditures of B40 have grown at about half a percent higher
level than the B60 (Figure ES.3). This reflects the strong growth and employment performance in
areas such as agriculture, manufacturing and construction during the pre-crisis period—sectors
which employ many of those in the B40. The income-source decomposition of income changes
during the 2004-2007 period suggests a third of the overall growth in incomes of the B40 during
this period to be due to the growth in labor earnings. During the 2004-2007 period, almost half
of the overall income growth of the B40 group was due to social assistance transfers—a more
important contribution than that of labor earnings. This safety net would not have been possible
absent strong economic growth in BiH.

    The statistical significance of the increase in the poverty headcount in FBiH is somewhat sensitive to the choice of poverty threshold.

    At the same time, public transfers are often poorly targeted and do not sufficiently cover the poor.
    The nature of redistributive fiscal policy is unsustainable and often poorly targeted, benefitting the
    rich almost as much as the poor. The targeting of social benefit spending is inefficient, with just 37
    percent being received by the poorest 20 percent and 56 percent by the B40, significantly worse
    than any other country in SEE. At the same time, over 12 percent of public spending on social
    benefits reaches the wealthiest 20 percent of the population. While BiH spends around 4 percent
    of GDP on non-contributory social assistance (the highest in SEE), but less than 10 percent of social
    assistance transfers are means-tested. The poorest population quintile receives only 17 percent
    of non-contributory benefits, while the wealthiest quintile receives 20 percent. As a result, the
    contribution of social assistance to poverty reduction is therefore considerably less than it could
    have been with a more effective social protection system.

    Between 2007 and 2011, conditions of the B40 of the population remained precarious. However,
    in relative terms, the B40 did better than the rest of the population during a difficult period; their
    consumption level declined by 0.8 percent, compared to 1.1 percent decline for the wealthiest
    60 percent of the population (T60).5 In comparison, the poor in Kosovo and Montenegro still
    experienced an improvement in their living standards during the crisis, while the B40 in Serbia
    were hit harder than the average. In Albania, the impact of the crisis on the poor was similar to
    BiH (Figure ES.4). In BiH, much of the support through the crisis period came via pensions rather
    than social assistance. The income source decomposition of income changes during 2007-11
    shows declines of salaries and self-employment incomes of the B40 during this period, which were
    partially counterbalanced by the positive growth of social assistance transfers, and in particular of
    pensions (overall, not just in the B40 group). However, the T60 benefited even more than did the
    B40 from increased pensions and assistance during 2007-11.

The B40 percent of the population have difficulty finding stable and high-quality employment
that could boost their income generating capacity. The B40 tends to have larger households to
care for, lower levels of education and training and other assets. In addition, the B40 has lower
employment rates, particularly among women, and especially high unemployment rates among
young people. Moreover, a higher share of those who are employed have temporary jobs or no
contracts, and they are also much more likely to be in occupations and sectors of activity that rely
on unskilled labor. The ability to find employment is key in determining whether someone is likely
to be in the B40.

After the end of the war, BiH experienced more Figure ES.5: Stable growth in the 2000s, stagnation since the

      During the post-war economic recovery, BiH did not create new foundations for sustainable
      economic growth. Since the early 2000s, BiH has been an economy reliant on remittances—
      averaging around 20 percent of GDP--for fueling consumption growth. These financial inflows were
      important in the recovery after the war, but when these flows rapidly declined during the global
      financial crisis, the structural problems of the economy became more evident. Growth was driven
      by consumption from the non-tradable sectors over 2000-08. Between them, wholesale/retail,
      real estate and financial services made up over a third of economic growth during the period.
      Even today, consumption remains at over 100 percent of GDP. By contrast, exports are worth only
      30 percent of GDP, one of the lowest in Europe and a sign of the country’s weak competitiveness.

      As BiH struggled to recover in the aftermath of the global crisis, the underlying challenges came
      to the forefront. BiH has a poor business environment, high labor taxes, and strict labor market
      policies, some of Europe’s worst transport infrastructure, wasteful public expenditures, Europe’s
      lowest energy efficiency, high urban pollution and vulnerability to catastrophic risks. These barriers
      made it difficult for firms to thrive and create employment, even in the best of times. During
      the crisis, firms were under undue pressure and were unable to adjust to the new economic
      environment. The non-tradable sectors such as retail, construction, services have done well since
      2000, contributing two thirds of economic growth, while tradable sectors such as manufacturing
      and agriculture contributed only a third.

      Significant structural bottlenecks make it difficult to compete internationally. The public sector
      remains large—spending close to 50 percent of GDP—more than most western European countries
      but without having the public services to match. In addition, investments—public and private—
      took a hit during the crisis, prejudicing future economic growth. Part of the challenge is the legacy
      of inefficient SOEs which have been only partially resolved. Many SOEs do not function at all,
      while others are on “life support”. Large SOE arrears, including to the social security system, make
      privatization difficult. In 2013, wages and other direct employment costs (e.g. social contributions)
      swallowed two thirds of the gross value-added of workers, leaving little room for profit, investment
      or other taxes. In addition, the gap between gross and net wages has widened in recent years,
      making it more and more difficult for firms to compete, especially as infrastructure deteriorates and
      land markets function poorly. BiH’s traditionally strong energy sector has not been well maintained
      and the country’s main port on the River Sava has become silted and difficult to access for larger
      vessels. BiH’s business climate is the poorest within the region, and it performs particularly badly
      on ease of paying taxes, getting electricity and obtaining a construction permit (Figure ES.7).

      The new borders, especially with Croatia and Serbia make it more difficult to trade. Differences
      in currencies, laws and regulations, safety standards (e.g. in agriculture or transport) as well
      as increased border crossing times are some of the recent challenges facing BiH exporters.
      Combined with the loss of a captive market for goods and services that BiH had previously
      supplied to the whole of Yugoslavia (such as energy or military equipment) and the psychological
      “border effect” it becomes clear why, even though former Yugoslav republics remain important
      partners, trade with them is far below the levels reached during the Yugoslav period. While BiH
      was exporting an estimated 98 percent of GDP prior to the war if one also includes trade with
      the previous Yugoslav republics, total exports have dropped to 31 percent today, one of the
      lowest in Europe (Figure ES.6).

The post-Yugoslav economic environment would have required a systematic and ambitious
reform effort to establish a fully functioning market economy. The absence of key economic
reforms has resulted in BiH being less integrated with its neighbors and the rest of the world than
sustainably good economic performance would require especially as smaller countries generally
need strong external trade relations. By 2012 it was rated as one of the least globally connected
countries in the region. As neighboring countries are now part of the EU (Croatia) or progressing
towards accession (Serbia, Montenegro), the cost of inaction will increase. Unless reforms
accelerate, BiH risks becoming a landlocked island surrounded by EU members. The risk is rising
that even larger economic walls will isolate BiH as EU requirements demand increased standards
(e.g. in agriculture) and upgraded border and inspections systems for trading with the EU.

Convergence with average European living standards remains elusive. With today’s per-capita
income of around US$ 4,700, BiH would need two decades of high growth to reach high-income
status. If the country repeated the performance of the period from 2000 to 2008 when per capita
growth averaged 5.1 percent, BiH would become a high-income country with a per-capita income
of US$ 12,500 in 2033.

The political economy of reform

BiH has chosen a development path that has created deep social, economic, and institutional
imbalances. Policies and incentives are such that the public sector and import-oriented industries
(typically those linked to consumption) benefit to the detriment of the private sector and export-
oriented industries (Figure ES.8). The result has been economic stagnation, emigration, and
massive unemployment and underemployment.

      Poor governance and an over-sized public sector, partially the result of institutional structures,
      reduce the effectiveness of public policy and hamper reforms. BiH performs poorly on a multitude
      of governance, corruption and institutional indicators. The Bertelsmann Transformation Index (BTI)
      suggests weakening performance in democracy status and economic management performance
      between 2006 and 2013, while the Global Integrity Scorecard (GIS) suggests declining scores in
      executive accountability, legislative accountability, judicial accountability and the budget process
      between 2007 and 2011. Despite this, the public sector controls well over half of the economy.
      The GIS suggests that the large public sector is good at passing laws, but it often fails to implement
      them effectively.

      Citizens and businesses face a sclerotic legal system and significant corruption. Businesses face
      long delays in having cases processed with disposition times nearly twice as long as the Council of
      Europe average and nearly three times as long as EU and EU-CEE averages. These delays are also
      reflected in the Doing Business Report, where in 2015, BiH ranks 95th out of 189 economies on
      the ease of enforcing contracts. Transparency International ranks BiH as one of the most corrupt
      countries in Europe (at 73rd out of 175 countries globally). Around 10 percent of firms report
      having had to pay a bribe to public officials over the past year and between a third and two thirds
      of citizens believe connections are essential to obtain jobs, education or official documentation.

      For BiH to reach high income the country would need to “turn the wheel” and fundamentally
      rebalance its social and economic model. A prosperous BiH would be achieved by creating a
      bigger, more vibrant and internationally competitive private sector, which would also create new
      incentives for the youth to stay in BiH or for the diaspora to return or invest in export-oriented
      sectors. As the domestic market is saturated, one of the keys to higher levels of growth and job
      creation is producing goods and services for export outside its territory (Figure ES.9).

      BiH is faced with the dilemma of weak winners and strong losers. The winners of reform will be
      the poor and often voiceless masses who will reap benefits only after a few years. By contrast,
      the potential losers tend to be a small group of easily identifiable people with significant ability
      to influence reforms. A dominant state sector generates many opportunities to create and share

rents. The reform effort is made even more difficult because of the fragmented political system
where the two Entities, which can sometimes behave antagonistically, are holding sway over key
economic decisions. At lower levels of government, cantons control significant powers, notably in
the health sector. The poor and vulnerable have been left out of the system, and around half of
the population can be considered at risk of social exclusion by some measures. Roma, youth and
children are particularly at risk and without obvious champions. Significant improvements in BiH’s
governance system and standards will be needed to get the country back on the path to reducing
poverty and achieving shared prosperity.

Priorities for BiH: Realigning incentives for shared prosperity and sustainable
development

The highest priority for BiH is to accelerate growth in an inclusive fashion. Experience from the
collapse of Yugoslavia and elsewhere suggests that it is easier to divide a growing pie than to
redistribute during stagnation, especially in a country with strong regional identities. In the past,
economic growth was key for tackling poverty and boosting the living standards of the B40. Survey
data show that during years of positive economic growth, the B40 saw faster consumption growth
than the T60. In addition, the current development model, focused on consumption driven by
remittances and the public sector, has reached its limits. Boosting production as a growth driver
and reducing the relative size of the public sector while sustaining consumption levels will be
almost impossible without economic growth.

People at risk of social exclusion tend to face similar challenges to the rest of the population.
Household data show that some of the main issues faced by the poor and B40 relate to employment.
Females, youth and Roma all face particularly low employment and high unemployment rates.
Similarly, consultations undertaken for this SCD reveal that youth, pensioners, Roma and the LGBT
community report, in addition to (un-)employment issues, challenges related to the business
environment and corruption.

Even though the B40 benefit from growth and tend to face similar challenges to the rest of the
population, the poor and vulnerable groups have a number of specific needs. Poorer groups,
which are often excluded from the labor market, especially formal employment, due to high labor
taxes and rigid labor market laws, would benefit more from tax and labor market reform than
wealthier groups, especially if taxes/social security contributions for low-earners are reduced.
Some specific targeted assistance is also warranted to ensure social inclusion, particularly
due to the high level of poverty among children, with the aim of reducing inter-generational
poverty transfer, and among Roma, who may suffer discrimination in some areas such as
education and employment.

BiH’s current development model is unsustainable in the long-term, especially as the country is
exposed to a number of risks. During recent years, BiH has experienced severe weather shocks,
violent protests and an economy that has been running out of fiscal buffers to respond to future
crises. BiH has been particularly vulnerable to natural disasters, especially droughts and flooding.
The losses and damages from the 2014 floods cost the country close to 15 percent of GDP, harming

      virtually all aspects of its economy and firms in many sectors. Many households are vulnerable
      to weather shocks, particularly those involved in agriculture, which occupies around one in five
      working individuals, including those who produce for own-consumption.

      This SCD has developed a prioritization methodology to identify BiH’s most important priorities
      to contribute to achieving the twin goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity in BiH.
      The methodology includes qualitative and quantitative dimensions and was tested during the
      consultation process. Several robustness checks were also undertaken. The prioritization process
      was completed in four steps (for a detailed overview of the prioritization process and methodology
      see the section 6 in the main document and Annex XV):

         •	 Step one: The team identified a series of seven initial hypotheses designed to help
            understand better the key issues. The team then tested these hypotheses based on extensive
            consultations and deeper analysis.

         •	 Step two: Based on the deeper analysis—presented in this report—and the extensive
            consultations, the team identified the emerging themes which paved the way for the
            formulation of the reform areas.

         •	 Step three: The team used two complementary methodologies to identify the most important
            priority reform areas. This included one qualitative method and one quantitative method in
            which the reform areas were rated across the dimensions of economic growth, inclusion and
            sustainability to categorize them into top priorities, high priorities and medium priorities.

         •	 Step four: The team compared the results of the different methodologies, discussed with
            internal experts on BiH (who did not have a direct interest in the results of the findings of
            the SCD) and identified the priority reform areas and secondary priorities.

      This prioritization exercise resulted in ten priorities for BiH, of which the top four focus on the
      rebalancing of the economy to create and sustain more and better jobs. The implementation
      of these reforms would realign incentives and policies toward the private sector with a specific
      focus on successful international integration. A second set of three priorities would accelerate
      BiH’s social and economic development once the “economic train” is put on the right track to
      make the reforms sustainable. A final set of three priorities concerns long-term investments in
      the social sectors and improvements for excluded groups, for which higher growth and more job
      opportunities would not be sufficient (Box ES.2).

      A successful turn-around of BiH’s economy will need a focused reform effort. Within the larger
      context of an over-sized public sector, rigid labor markets and poor competitive environment, the
      below list of priority reforms presents would help to reenergize BiH’s economy and improve service
      delivery in a sustainable way, with particular benefits for the B40. These reforms are necessary for
      economic, environmental and social stability, by way of achieving greater inclusiveness, increasing
      competitiveness and offering a possibility to build fiscal reserves to cope with the shocks to which
      BiH is prone.

Executive Summary



  Box ES.2: Priorities for BiH: Rebalancing incentives for shared prosperity and sustainable development
  Top priorities—Accelerating growth and creating jobs

  Putting BiH to work: reforming the labor market, improving social protection delivery and reducing
  the cost of labor

  Rationale: Labor market rules and the tax system are reinforcing BiH’s consumption driven economy,
  protecting insiders often at the expense of the young or socially excluded, including females and Roma.
  The tax system discourages (formal) employment—especially of the lower-paid—and production
  for export, and encourages consumption and imports. In addition, the linked health insurance and
  unemployment discourages (formal) employment and increases budget costs. The labor market rules
  also makes it difficult for enterprises to adjust in changing economic conditions, which means that they
  do not hire in the first place.

  Making it easier to do business: improving competitiveness, entrepreneurship and the investment
  climate

  Rationale: BiH is one of the worst places to do business in Europe and Central Asia (ECA). Investors do
  not trust the institutions and mainly engage in investments with short-term pay-offs (e.g. construction,
  services). By contrast, investments in agri-processing, forestry, manufacturing or tourism need a stable
  investment climate with a long-term perspective. Basic business needs such as constructing new facilities,
  securing land ownership and/or secure access rights, getting electricity, importing and exporting, and
  paying taxes are still too difficult. This is why entrepreneurship is also weak including in the services and
  IT start-up industries where BiH could succeed.

  Creating an efficient and effective government: reducing the size of the public sector while ensuring
  fiscal sustainability and improving public service delivery

  Rationale: With expenditures at close to half of GDP and SOEs adding even more government control
  to the economy, BiH has one of the world’s largest public sectors. Its size likely harms economic growth
  and employment, particularly affecting the prospects of the B40. Much of the public expenditure is
  inefficient, failing to reach the people or investment areas that most need it. The current situation also
  breeds opportunities for poor governance.

  Investing in economic infrastructure for growth and inclusion: powering and connecting BiH to the
  world

  Rationale: The current state of infrastructure services is poor and at risk of severe deterioration.
  Improving transport and ICT infrastructure would give exporters easier access to markets and generate
  employment. It would also help to improve rural connectivity and enhance the marketability of
  production, boosting shared prosperity by improving the quality of life in rural areas, where many of
  the poor and B40 live. BiH’s reasonable headline energy performance disguises one of Europe’s most
  energy inefficient and carbon intensive economies, harming firm competitiveness and contributing to
  high urban pollution, while at the same time losing major export opportunities.

  High priorities—Securing a resilient and long-term future

  Building resilience: helping BiH cope with adverse natural events.

  Rationale: BiH is highly vulnerable to adverse natural events such as flooding, some of which may result
  from climate change or environmental degradation. Boosting its resilience would help to reduce the
  social and economic impacts of such shocks and especially support the B40, some of whom still live
  partially from agriculture.

         Rationale: Education is closely linked to poverty. Some groups suffer in particular, including the B40 and
         Roma communities. BiH is lagging in early childhood education (ECE), posing risks for inter-generational
         poverty transfer, and quality standards are mixed in secondary and tertiary education. There are
         significant knowledge gaps which need to be filled, including identifying the needs of the private sector,
         which should begin quickly.

         Living healthy lives: improving health services and access to water and sanitation Rationale: Despite
         reasonable life expectancy, many health outcomes are poor, particularly with regards to non-
         communicable diseases, partly resulting from high tobacco consumption. Health outcomes are worse
         among poorer groups and over half of Roma are considered malnourished. There is large wastage in
         pharmaceutical procurement providing scope for budgetary savings. Rural poor also have low access to
         water and sanitation, forcing many to rely on expensive private facilities.

          Medium priorities—Ensuring stable and sustainable economic opportunities

         Adding financial firepower: maintaining financial stability and expanding access to finance

         Rationale: While financial sector stability has been broadly maintained new risks are emerging, including
         from non-performing loans (NPLs). Firms also face financial constraints to growth. Resolution of NPLs
         may help make additional financial resources available for credit. Access to finance could be improved for
         some groups at risk of exclusion. Although the banking system—dominated by foreign banks—appears
         broadly sound, significant pockets of vulnerability exist among banks. A number of smaller banks are
         struggling to meet capital requirements, with some facing high concentration risks and heavy reliance
         on public sector support. Moreover, significant deficiencies remain in the financial safety net, including
         with respect to resolution powers, institutional responsibility for resolution, and resolution funding.

         Cleaning BiH: reducing pollution and protecting the environment

         Rationale: BiH is wasting a lot of its resources and air pollution remains a major challenge, especially in
         cities, due to the use of traditional heating in the winters. This also contributes to BiH’s high number of
         respiratory diseases and international evidence suggests that the poor are most likely to shoulder the
         burden. In addition, large amounts of solid and liquid waste pollute BiH’s waterways and countryside.
         This poses health concerns directly and indirectly through contamination with drinking water and
         agriculture, particularly during floods.

         Boosting agriculture: increasing agricultural productivity and opportunities

         Rationale: Most of the poor live in rural areas, rural poverty rates are higher than urban ones and the
         poor are more likely to work in agriculture than wealthier groups. Improving agricultural productivity
         would improve their livelihoods. Agriculture would also receive a boost by reforming the land market
         and upgrading rural transportation networks.


        BiH’s pathway to prosperity will come from higher growth and better services, which will be
        driven both by better governance and an increased share of the private sector in the economy.
        The violent disintegration of Yugoslavia derailed the country’s quest for prosperity. After some
        progress in the decade after the war, the country is at risk of permanent stagnation if it does
        not begin to address the root causes of the current social, economic and institutional stagnation.
        Shifting from an inward-looking economic model to outward integration combined with a jobs
        strategy that unleashes the strength of the private sector will be key. If the new government
        implements these reforms, BiH can also join the group of emerging European nations that have
        already made great gains in eliminating poverty and achieving shared prosperity for its citizens.

CHAPTER ONE

The Country Context

BiH was the most ethnically diverse and one of the poorer republics in Yugoslavia. It stagnated in the 1980s
and was, by many measures, the country hardest hit by the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, the
collapse of Yugoslavia, and the war that followed in BiH in the 1990s. The Dayton Accords brought peace that
has lasted twenty years. It also brought a fragmented institutional structure, which allows for a significant
degree of self-determination of BiH’s constituent peoples. Many public services are delivered at highly
localized levels, whether appropriate or not, particularly within FBiH. As a result, the public service is large,
controlling nearly half of the economy (mostly excluding SOEs). Unfortunately, a wide range of indicators
suggest that public sector performance in BiH is sub-par. Regulatory quality is low, the judicial process is
considered poor, public financial management is weak, corruption is endemic and, while laws are considered
adequate, implementation and enforcement of them tends to be weak.

Like much of Eastern Europe, BiH is experiencing population decline and aging, with both Entities exhibiting
similar patterns. Reforms are taking place against the background of demographic decline which cannot be
reversed in the short-term, but can be mitigated if the country provides more employment opportunities
for its youth. The future of BiH lies in Europe and the country aspires to join the EU. However, even though
a Stabilization and Association Agreement was ratified in 2011, it only entered into force in mid-2015 due
to slow progress in implementing its conditions. The EU cites various factors that stop BiH from advancing,
including lack of political will, an inability to agree on reforms, lack of capacity in using EU resources, and
institutional complexities. BiH risks losing EU resources in a number of sectors due to lack of progress in
aligning laws. In some cases, BiH exporters also risk losing access to EU markets.



1.1 History: Yugoslavia and BiH in Yugoslavia
1.1	    BiH was dominated by a number of powers for most of the last 500 years. It was ruled
        by the Ottomans in 1463-1878, and then by the Austro-Hungarian Empire for a shorter
        period in 1878-1918. It was incorporated into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia after 1918 and its
        successor state, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1945, as a republic.

1.2	    Yugoslavia developed a highly decentralized structure with significant powers granted to
        republics, which exacerbated differences in living standards between them. In contrast
        to the Soviet bloc countries, “Yugoslavia was… the most decentralized of the socialist
        economies, both in terms of its economic and fiscal management and its political structures.
        The republics had significant autonomy from the very beginning… Tax reforms …gave greater
        revenue raising powers to the republics and local authorities… with ‘areas of common
        interest’ remaining the responsibility of the state.”7 Decentralization meant that wealthier
        republics had higher incomes and revenues and could allocate more to social spending—
        further revealing regional imbalances.

    1.3	      Industrial production was initially concentrated in northern Yugoslavia but there were
              some efforts to spread this in the 1960s. During the post-WWII period, most manufacturing
              took place in the north of the country, which comprised the main traditional manufacturing
              regions, whereas the sources for raw materials tended to be concentrated in the south of
              the country. In the early 1960s, the industrial policy was changed so that new manufacturing
              facilities would be built closer to raw material sources in southern Yugoslavia rather than in
              the north. The new policy led to increasing resentment among the richer northern republic
              economies (especially Croatia and Slovenia).

    1.4	      The Federal Fund for Accelerated Development of the Less-Developed Regions (including
              BiH, Macedonia,	 Montenegro	 and	 later	 Kosovo)	 was	 designed	 to	 reduce	 regional	
              disparities	 within Yugoslavia. All republics and provinces contributed to the Fund. “At its
              peak, this fund mobilized some 2 percent of Gross Social Product (GSP)—from the better
              off regions who [sic] contributed a fixed proportion of their GSP to fund it… Federal
              budgetary resources were also directed to raising the level of social outlays in the poorer
              republics.”8
    1.5	      Despite this, regional inequality in Yugoslavia was large and BiH was one of the poorer
              republics. While GDP per capita reached around $3,200 in the northern regions, it was only
              half in the southern regions; BiH’s GNP per capita at the time was $1,737 (Table 1.1). The
              combination of economic decline and rising regional inequality led to increased tensions
              between the republics including over pricing policy, customs duties, and protection.

    1.6	      The 1980s was an era of economic stagnation in Yugoslavia. Real GDP growth, which
              averaged 5.8 percent per year during the 1970s slowed to an annual average of just 1 percent
              (Figure 1.1) between 1980 and 1989. Inflation reached over 200 percent in the late 1980s.9

1. The Country Context



1.7	      During the 1980s, the north-south gap became larger. Finished goods from developed
          regions were subject to trade protection measures, whereas raw materials from the lesser-
          developed regions were subject to few if any protective measures. Below market prices
          for raw material shipments meant that less-developed areas subsidized wealthier ones to
          some extent. Disagreements over the level of contributions to the Federal Fund became
          stronger, with the wealthier republics contributing 75 percent to the Federal Fund in the
          1980s, down from 78 percent in the 1970s.10 The fall of the Berlin wall and communism
          in 1989 exacerbated the fragmentation of Yugoslavia as it disintegrated into a series of
          conflicts in the 1990s. Overall, longstanding and growing economic inequalities helped to
          drive Yugoslavia apart politically.11

1.8	      BiH was hard hit by the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the subsequent war. By some
          estimations, it suffered more than any other Eastern European country economically.
          The war, which lasted nearly four years (April 1992 to December 1995), resulted in an
          estimated 110,000 killed and 2.5 million displaced persons and refugees—or over half
          of the pre-war population, according to the International Criminal Court. The World
          Bank estimated a total of $15-20 billion in destroyed assets.12 The war ended with the
          Dayton Peace Accord in December 1995.

1.2	 Population challenges: aging and shrinking
1.9	      Apart from being one of the poorer Yugoslav republics, BiH was also the most ethnically
          diverse. It comprised three sizable ethnic groups: Bosniaks (44 percent), Serbs (31 percent);
          and Croats (17 percent) (see Annex IV). Around 0.2 percent of the population was reportedly
          Roma, although this may have been under-estimated as this group was less likely than others
          to respond or self-identify.

1.10	 The population is shrinking and getting older. BiH lost nearly a quarter of its population
      between 1989 and 1996 as a result of the war, much of it due to emigration. Its population
      declined from around 4.5 million in 1990 to fewer than 3.8 million in 2013, according to
      preliminary results from the census that year. While some people chose to return after the
      war, slightly increasing the population, the population is estimated to have fallen every year
      since 2002 due to emigration and because the natural rate of population increase turned
      negative in 2005 (i.e. deaths have outnumbered births since 2005, (Figure 1.2). In 2014 for
      the first time, the country has more old people (over 65 years of age) than young (under 15
      years). As in other aging European countries this poses significant challenges for the labor
      market (fewer working age, savings for pensions), public spending composition (e.g. more
      health, less education), public service delivery (more lifelong learning and old-age health,
      less child health and primary education).

     “There were many reasons for the breakup of Yugoslavia, [and]… quasi-fiscal and redistributional factors played…[a] role. Redistribution policies of
     this scope were bound to nourish political separatism, as prosperous republics became more and more reluctant to release and transfer resources to
     poorer republics. The lack of transparency in the system made it possible for each republic to argue that it bore the costs of the intergovernmental
     system, while the benefits accrued to others, so that ach thought the others gained, at its expense.” “Fiscal Federalism in Bosnia-Herzegovina: The

    1.11	 Both Entities are experiencing similar population challenges. RS’s demographic decline
          started a decade earlier than in FBiH with deaths exceeding births each year since 2002,
          whereas this likely only happened in FBiH in 2012 (data only to 2011). Nonetheless, the
          trend is clearly in the same direction in both Entities. Birth rates in BiH are significantly lower
          than in neighboring countries, with 8.3 births per 1,000 population in 2011 compared to 9.4
          in Croatia, 9 in Serbia and 11.6 in Montenegro (see Annex IV).

    1.3	 Institutions and political economy
    Institutional framework
    1.12	 The Dayton Accords of December 1995 brought peace to BiH and kept the territory as
          a single country split into two Entities and an autonomous town (Brcko District). The
          Dayton Accords established a highly decentralized country with a relatively weak Council
          of Ministers at the central level (and often referred to as “the State” level). It delineated
          a governmental structure comprised of two Entities for three constituent peoples: the
          Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH, composed largely of Bosniaks and Croats),
          and the Republika Srpska (RS, composed primarily of Serbs). FBiH has 10 cantons and 79
          municipalities, while RS has 63 municipalities. Finally, the constitutional architecture also
          includes the autonomous Brcko District. The Office of the High Representative (OHR) was
          created by the international community to oversee the implementation of the Dayton
          Accords. Its powers were increased in 1997 to allow it to adopt binding decisions when
          local parties were unable to act and to remove public officials in some circumstances.
          While the institution remains in place today, it rarely opts to use its powers.

    1.13	 The institutional arrangements were designed to bring peace but may have reduced the
          quality of governance in BiH. “Bosnia’s goal … [has been] a unified multiethnic state, but
          its political institutions support ethnic partition at every level of government. … Almost
          every public office -- including low-level administration jobs -- is allotted according to an

         ethnic quota, a spoils system that has led to extensive patronage networks, corruption, and
         inefficiencies.”13 The country has been plagued by governance and institutional dysfunction,
         political disagreements, paralysis and deadlock. Some of the consequences have been,
         among other things: lack of progress in reforming the economy; lack of a government in
         FBiH for over a year; a temporary interruption in debt servicing to an IFI (the IMF); high
         unemployment (especially among youth and women) and poverty levels; an unattractive
         environment for doing business and investing; corruption; lack of internal socio-economic
         and political cohesion; and slower progress toward European accession than its neighbors. A
         large public sector that consumes about half of the country’s GDP combined with institutional
         fragmentation/duplication of functions contributes to a constant and unsustainable drain
         on the country’s finances.

Institutional performance and governance
1.14	 With a public sector that controls close to 50 percent of the economy in BiH, well-functioning
      public institutions matter. While reducing the size of the public sector is advisable, it is also
      important to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public institutions. The choices
      made by public institutions can influence economic growth (e.g. capital investments,
      business environment). They are important to ensure efficient use of public resources and
      to ensure the poor and B40 have sufficient assets (such as education) to benefit from and
      contribute toward economic growth.

     The mixed evidence suggests that the indicators presented in this section should be taken as broad indications of the institutional/governance/
     political economy environment in BiH rather than precise measures of it. Different indicators measure different institutional variables suggesting
     improvement in some areas and reversals in others. In addition, some indicators measure perceptions, others measure laws, and still others measure
     implementation of laws or practices. Differences between indicators may also partly arise due to difficulties in measurement.

    1.16	 Other indicators suggest little improvement or some reversal. The Bertelsmann
          Transformation Index (BTI)17 suggests weakening performance in democracy status and
          economic management performance between 2006 and 2013 (Annex I), while the Global
          Integrity Scorecard (GIS)18 suggests declining scores in executive accountability, legislative
          accountability, judicial accountability and the budget process between 2007 and 2011.

    1.17	 Most comparative indicators rate BiH’s institutions or governance as worse than those
          of its neighbors. Low comparative ratings matter both because of the low institutional and
          governance standards they capture and because they may deter badly-needed investment
          in the country. Of particular concern are the Economist Intelligence Unit’s (EIU) country risk
          ratings, which rate political efficacy risks and legal and regulatory risks as among the worst
          in SEE and far behind the EU-CEE including in: policy formulation; quality of bureaucracy;
          excessive red tape; fairness of the judicial process; enforceability of contracts; speediness of
          judicial process; and integrity of accounting practices (Annex I).

    1.18	 A gap may exist between the intention of laws as enacted and their implementation. The
          GIS measures areas such as government oversight and controls, anti-corruption efforts, and
          public administration quality and professionalism across several dimensions. It measures
          both legal provisions (“in law”) and implementation of the laws across the measured
          dimensions (“in practice”). The difference is termed the “implementation gap” (Figure
          1.4). While the GIS in law score was rated Figure 1.4: Large gap between intention of laws and actual
          as “very strong” for BiH in 201119 (and implementation
          the fourth highest of the 31 countries Global       Integrity Scorecard, % score for laws and practices and the

          laws was considered “very weak” (and                                                                         92

        straddling the different legal regimes find it difficult to know all of the rules that might
        apply to their activities. Small businesses are particularly affected, as they are least able
        to afford the high costs of navigating the justice system, given the lack of any central
        source of information. The complexity limits the ability of businesses to enforce rights and
        resolve disputes.

1.20	 Inconsistent decision-making undermines predictability and the uniform application
      of the law. For example, disputes arising in FBiH are heard in Cantonal Courts of general
      jurisdiction, whereas disputes arising in RS are heard in specialized Commercial Courts
      with different laws and procedures, with no supreme body to reconcile them. Practices
      within courts are also uneven, which relates in part to lack of coordination, but also to the
      capacity of the judiciary to deliver high-quality decisions. Despite this, court expenditure
      is approximately 0.8 percent of GDP, which is higher than the EU and Council of Europe
      averages. However, budgets are deeply fragmented, particularly in FBiH, and capacities for
      planning remain weak, which undermines service delivery.

1.21	 These challenges are compounded due to inefficiencies within courts. Businesses face long
      delays in having cases processed. Disposition times for civil and commercial cases average
      656 days, nearly twice as long as the Council of Europe average and nearly three times as
      long as EU and EU-CEE averages. In some courts, users wait years for their first hearing date.
      These delays are also reflected in the Doing Business 2015 Report, where BiH ranks 95th out
      of 189 economies on the ease of enforcing contracts. Courts also are clogged with a large
      backlog of cases, 80 percent (1.7 million cases) of which is comprised of unpaid utility bills.
      Backlogs in civil and commercial cases are falling however, with more cases being heard than
      new ones created. Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms exist in law but are difficult to
      use in practice. 

1.22	 Judicial corruption and undue influence remain a challenge (see Box 1.1). The
      Global Corruption Barometer reports that the judiciary is among the most corrupt
      institutions.  According to the Business Environment and Enterprise Survey (BEEPS) 2014,
      18.4 percent of firms report that unofficial payments in court are required sometimes,
      frequently or very frequently, which is higher than most regional neighbors. The government’s
      attempt to reduce corruption by increasing the salaries of judges has yet to produce positive
      results. According to the 2013 Enterprise Survey, only 37.5 percent of firms believe that the
      court system is fair, impartial and uncorrupted, which is on par with the ECA average but
      significantly lower than EU and EU-CEE averages. The capacity of the police and judiciary to
      investigate and prosecute economic, financial and public procurement-related allegations is
      also weak. Appointment processes for key positions within the justice system are reportedly
      politicized, and according to the European Commission’s  2014 Progress Report, political
      parties undermine the independence of the judicial system in individual cases.

    1.23	 The B40 are particularly disadvantaged when it comes to access to justice. Notwithstanding
          the availability of legal aid, many areas remain under-served, leaving poor and vulnerable
          groups without access to basic justice services. There is no legal aid law at State level,
          resulting in a patchwork of programs. Brcko District has a particularly successful and cost-
          effective legal aid program, which could potentially be replicated across BiH.

    Public financial management
    1.24	 The challenging institutional environment and weak implementation of laws can be seen
          across several sectors of BiH, including Public Financial Management (PFM), which both
          suffers from the weaknesses and may help to create them. Sound PFM is essential to
          ensure that the limited resources are used efficiently and in ways that can most enhance
          economic growth and boost opportunities for the B40.

    1.25	 A recent Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment of all BiH
          governments pointed to several common issues across the country.20 Some of these key
          findings include:

             •	        “The process of preparing the budget and public investment program is not well
                       integrated with the medium-term macroeconomic outlook and overall/sectoral
                       strategic documents. Credible and comprehensive medium-term macro-fiscal
                       strategies are lacking at all levels.”

             •	        Inadequate procurement practices along with regular follow up on external audit
                       findings can lead to poorly informed policy decision-making. “Despite some recent
                       progress in budget execution, the lack of strong internal controls (especially in public
                       procurement) makes the PFM systems in BiH vulnerable to inefficiency and waste.”
                       The GIS indicator for procurement suggests that standards declined between 2007
                       and 2011 and of the 31 countries surveyed in 2011 only two (Jordan and Zimbabwe)
                       had a poorer rating in transparency, fairness, and conflicts of interest safeguards in
                       public procurement (Figure 1.5).

             •	        Different recording systems across the country make it difficult to consolidate public
                       expenditure data. “In budget reporting, the fact that the charts of account of the four
                       main government levels are not harmonized hampers access to consolidated data.
                       Within the Entities (primarily in FBiH), consolidation of data for all general government
                       levels (…) is complex, and data are generally not used to inform policy decisions.”

             •	        There are insufficient audits of public expenditure accounts to ensure resources are
                       used for their intended purposes. “Despite recent improvements, better follow-up of
                       external audit findings and recommendations is needed. Furthermore, the coverage/
                       quality of internal audits and of external performance audits is not comprehensive.”
                       The GIS suggests that the quality of the auditing bodies declined significantly between
                       2007 and 2011, as did oversight in other areas (Figure 1.5).

1.26	 The Global Competitiveness Report (GCR) finds that there have been improvements
      in the perception of use of public resources and some set-backs but other indicators
      suggest some set-backs. The GCR found that there was some improvement between its
      surveys in 2006/07 and 2013/14 of the perception of diversion of public funds, while
      government spending was perceived as becoming more wasteful during the period
      (Figure 1.6). Exactly what drove these changes is not clear as the Global Competitiveness
      Report is driven by perceptions.

    Box 1.1: The cost of corruption in BiH

   The lack of trust in institutions in BiH stems partly from high levels of corruption. Despite some
   efforts to combat it22, corruption is endemic in BiH (as it is in much of the Balkans), affecting all layers
   of government, making it more difficult to

           Citizens experience widespread bribery. A UN Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) (2011) survey of
           around 5,000 respondents across BiH22 reported that 20 percent of citizens had been exposed to a
          “bribery experience” with a public official in the 12 months prior to a survey, and that bribery is as
           present in rural as in urban areas. The cost of the average bribe was €112. In around 27 percent of
           cases, bribes were initiated by the citizens themselves and just over half were requested by officials.
           The remainder were jointly initiated or it was unclear.

          Bribery creates a two-tier public service and prevents a well-functioning justice system. Around a
          quarter of bribes were paid to speed up procedures (e.g. medical, passports) and around a quarter
          were to avoid fines. Over half (54 percent) of respondents had paid bribes to doctors and 31 percent
          to nurses. Over half of respondents who reported paying bribes said they paid them to police officers.

          or “essential” to secure a good government           50

          The UNODC surveyed over 12,000 firms in the
          Western Balkans on their experience of corruption in 2013. Around 10.4 percent of firms in BiH that
          had encounters with public officials (around three quarters had) reported giving money or a gift
          to at least one public official in the twelve months prior to the survey, slightly above the regional
          average of 10.2 percent (see Annex I). BEEPS data suggests that 8.3 percent of firms reported that
          gifts were required to secure public sector contracts. Of those who had paid bribes to public officials,
          the average number of times in the previous year was 6.2, below the regional average of 7.1. As in
          other countries, most bribes were reported by firms operating in the trade and construction sectors.

1. The Country Context



The road to EU accession
1.27	 BiH has been a potential candidate for EU membership since 2003. The Stabilization and
      Association Agreement (SAA) with BiH was signed in June 2008 and has been ratified by all
      EU Member States. However, the SAA entered into force only in June 2015. The 2014
      Progress Report on EU Enlargement notes that the country remains at a standstill in the
      European integration process. It reports very limited progress on political and economic
      issues and on moving towards European standards, citing a lack of collective political
      will on the part of the political leaders to address the reforms necessary for progress on
      the EU path.

1.28	 Cooperation with the EU has recently stepped up a gear and the SAA entered into force in
      June 2015. Following widespread, citizen-led protests in early 2014, the EU launched three
      initiatives to address citizens’ concerns: (i) it has expanded the EU-BiH dialogue on justice to
      additional rule of law matters, in particular the fight against corruption; (ii) it has established
      a joint EU-BiH Working Group to accelerate the implementation of EU funded projects; and
      (iii) it has developed a ‘Compact for Growth and Jobs’22 together with key actors including
      international financial institutions. Public statements by EU officials and several key member
      states reinforce this change of focus toward economic and social issues that would help
      pave the way for closer relations. The European Council adopted a decision in April 2015
      to conclude the SAA, which led to its coming into force in mid-2015, based on progress in
      jointly defining priorities for economic governance reforms.

1.29	 The EU has voiced concerns that the governance structure may make it more difficult to use
      EU resources effectively. 2014 EU Progress Report for BiH and the Country Strategy Paper
      2014-201723 note that governance is built on a highly decentralized and very costly structure,
      with competences divided between the State level, Entities, cantons and municipalities and a
      lack of functional coordination and policy-making mechanisms and processes. The fractured
      planning and budgeting processes, the lack of clear accountability and oversight lines and
      mechanisms, and the division of competences and responsibilities continues to undermine
      the efficiency and effectiveness of delivery of public services and state governance as a
      whole. This fragmentation appears to delay implementation of agreements with the EU,
      including those under the SAA, many of which have yet to be implemented. It has also made
      agreements on use of Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) resources difficult,
      leading to the cancellation of some projects, including in rural development.

1.30	 Progress is required in several areas of the economy to reach compliance with EU standards
      including but not limited to the following:
        •	 Agriculture, rural development and food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary
           standards: A countrywide rural development strategy has not yet been adopted,
           however over the past year both Entities have developed their respective  strategic
           programs that are substantially similar in terms of broad strategic objectives reflecting the

                  respective landscapes and agro-climatic situation. State-level capacity for coordination
                  and harmonization needs strengthening to integrate the two Entity documents into a
                  single coherent document representative of the perspective of both Entities vis-à-vis
                  the EU. Improving productivity and competitiveness is being hampered by the lack of an
                  efficient administration and effective rural credit schemes, and the very high collateral
                  requirements that smaller farmers do often not have. This is particularly the case in
                  absence of complete clarity of land records that would provide a basis for collateral, and
                  a very conservative approach to credit in the sector from both, lenders and borrowers.24
                  Although BiH has preferential access to EU markets for some of its agricultural products,
                  and although the majority of rural forest products are now derived from certified forests
                  that comply with EU and global standards, institutional constraints have prevented
                  BiH from achieving the full benefits. For instance, the country lacks EU-compliant and
                  harmonized food safety institutions and regulations across all governmental levels of
                  the country.25 However, the situation is improving with the strengthening of the state
                  level agencies for Food Safety, Veterinary services and Plant Health and Phyto-sanitary
                  services and the amendments currently being discussed in parliament for the State level
                  agricultural, veterinary and food safety legislation.
              •	 Education: BiH agreed to follow the Bologna Process, which harmonizes European higher
                 education systems, under the SAA, although full implementation is some way off. BiH
                 signed an agreement to participate in the EU’s student exchange program, ERASMUS in
                 2014 though much more needs to be done to ensure alignment with European standards.
              •	 Energy: Each Entity has an energy strategy but these have not been harmonized, reflecting
                 the fragmented BiH, and indeed, Balkan-wide energy markets. Energy acquis have not yet
                 been adopted according to the 2014 EU Progress Report, and tendering procedures in the
                 sector are complicated and non-transparent. An electricity market liberalization planned
                 for January 1, 2015, was not fully implemented, and there is no genuine platform to
                 determine electricity prices by the market. There are delays in implementing EU energy
                 efficiency requirements and obsolete existing thermal capacity that does not comply with
                 EU emission standards.
              •	 Health: BiH has completed National Health Accounts (NHAs) for some years but a
                 Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and quality control mechanisms still need to be
                 implemented in line with EU laws/regulations/standards.
              •	 ICT: Draft laws transposing the EU regulatory framework of 2002 was prepared in
                 September 2013, but is still being debated. The current regulatory regime fails to ensure
                 the financial and institutional independence of the regulator, which makes it difficult to
                 safeguard efficient competition and creates an uncertain legal and regulatory environment
                 for market players.26 Policies aimed to guide and promote the development of the ICT

             has not yet been approved (draft policy for 2013-2017 was prepared in 2013).
         •	 Justice: The EU broadened its dialogue on justice from reform of the judiciary and issues
            related to processing war crimes to include issues related to corruption, conflict of
            interest, and accountability and efficiency of the police force. This was partly as a result
            of the 2014 protests.
         •	 Trade: The 2014 Progress Report notes that BiH risks having some trade benefits with
            the EU suspended—including those with Croatia, a significant export partner—if it fails
            to adopt quality standards (notably in agriculture) by end of 2015. Around 19 percent of
            standardization requirements needed to join the European Committee for Standardisation
            and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation remain to be adopted.
         •	 Transport: A State-level transportation policy has yet to be adopted, and “…key strategy
            and policy documents for all transport sub-sectors have yet to be developed”.27 Legislation
            needs to be properly aligned with the EU acquis with regard to all modes of transport,
            especially for rail, road and maritime means of transportation.28 EU acquis for transport
            have barely been implemented, and the two Entities still maintain vertically integrated
            railway companies that over-employ numbers of people but lack competent staff. Better
            coordination and improvements/modernization in transportation linkages are needed
            within the country. For example, travelling by rail between the Entities still requires
            changing locomotives. 
         •	 Water: Improving wastewater management facilities to meet EU standards will be costly.
            The current lack of adequate wastewater management creates a significant health and
            environmental hazard. The recent floods resulted in solid and liquid waste being returned
            to land, for example. In addition, freshwater is contaminated by wastewater. It may
            become one of the most expensive EU requirements to comply with—compliance with
            the two main EU Directives, Drinking Water Directive and EU Urban Waste Water Directive
            is estimated to cost around €3.7 billion. This will likely result in significant tariff increases
            for water and wastewater services, potentially straining lower-income households.

CHAPTER TWO

Poverty and Shared Prosperity

BiH is one of Europe’s poorest countries, even though inequality is relatively low and life expectancy
above the average for SEE. When economic growth was strong poverty fell from around 18 percent
(2004) to 14 percent (2007). During the crisis, poverty stagnated and is now estimated at 15 percent
(latest data is from 2011). Economic growth was the major driver of poverty reduction, which
benefitted rural and urban areas equally. The poor benefitted from rising wages and from rising
transfers which were made possible due to higher state revenues. However, the social protection
contributed more to income growth during the growth period than during the crisis and the
wealthiest 60 percent of the population benefit significantly from public transfers, including
social assistance. This suggests that public sector transfers were used to re-distribute resources
toward specific groups (such as the poor) during periods of economic growth but not to cushion
families from national or individual economic hardships, when they arise.
Poverty levels are similar across entities and gender but are more than double in rural than urban
areas (19 percent vs. 9 percent). At the same time, few people choose to urbanize due to higher
cost of living in cities, lack of job opportunities, and several advantages to living in the countryside.
Poverty was particularly pronounced among large families (e.g. 35 percent among families with
three and more children), posing risks for inter-generational poverty transfer. While children were
significantly more likely than the average to live in poor households, Bosnians over 50 years are less
affected by poverty and there has been a notable decline in poverty among those of 65+ (from 13
to 11 percent) between 2007 and 2011. B40 households are much less likely than others to have an
employed female than those in the T60. Poverty is strongly associated with the level of education;
and almost a quarter of Bosnians with no education are poor.




2.1 Poverty dynamics
2.1	    Between 2004 and 2007 poverty fell and incomes of the B40 grew rapidly, and at a
        higher pace than the incomes of T60. Poverty (measured against a 205KM daily
        threshold) fell from 17.7 percent of the population to 14 percent between 2004 and
        2007 (Figure 2.1). The reduction in the poverty headcount was most pronounced in
        FBiH, where the poverty fell from almost 19 percent in 2004 to just over 13 percent in
        2007. More generally, the population in the bottom 40 percent (B40) saw average annual
        consumption growth of around 3.7 percent during the 2004-07 period. This compares to
        3.2 percent of the wealthiest.

     2.2	                          The poor and B40 in rural areas and towns outside of the capital city fared particularly well
                                   prior to the global crisis. Consumption of the B40 in rural areas grew at an annual average
                                   of 4 percent between 2004 and 2007 compared to 2 percent for the rural T60 during the
                                   same period. The rate of growth of expenditures of the rural B40 group was similar to

                                   more details in section 2.4). However, the B40 in Sarajevo did not perform as well as those
                                   elsewhere, with average annual consumption growth of just 0.4 percent. Sarajevo was,
                                   however, particularly dynamic for the T60, who had average annual consumption growth
                                   of 5 percent over the period.


     29	                      Box 2.1: Data availability and challenges in BiH

                              This SCD assembled and analyzed the existing data for producing a comprehensive diagnostic of BiH’s
                              development challenges and opportunities. However, BiH also faces a number of data limitations and
                              issues with data transparency which are important development issues for the country to unleash its
                              full potential. This has constrained the analysis, leading to some gaps in knowledge. This box notes the
                              main data constraints faced by the SCD team, while broader knowledge gaps are noted in section 6.3.

                              Household data: Nationally and Entity-representative household surveys were undertaken in 2004,
                              2007 and 2011. A new survey is in the field at the time of writing. This means that the latest available
                              data for estimating poverty dates from 2011. Analysis such as the factors driving poverty and the
                              characteristics of poor and B40 households was constrained by the vintage of the latest data.

                              Income data: While a nationally representative Labor Force Survey is undertaken each year (with results
                              reported in the SCD), broader income data relies on the household survey data and is of low quality.
                              The household survey focuses on consumption—a more reliable way to estimate living standards and
                              poverty. Unfortunately, as in much of the world, income data is considerably less reliable. Indeed,
                              reported household income amounts to only around a third of consumption. While we have made
                              efforts to understand the changes in income sources (including wage income, social assistance and
                              remittances), this analysis should be considered within the context of this caveat.

      National accounts data: The BiH Agency for Statistics (BHAS) produces the national accounts (NA) for BiH.
      The compilation of data started in 2005 with the reorganization of the BHAS and NA data are compiled
      based on the System of National Accounts (SNA)’93 and European System of Accounts (ESA)’95. The
      GDP data are collected in accordance with the production and expenditure approach, although their
      time-series availability differs and there is a discrepancy between the numbers produced under each
      method. Production approach data are available since 2000, while the expenditure approach data
      since 2006. In 2008 the estimates of GDP by production approach were compiled for the period 2000-
      2003 and the data series was revised backward for the period 2000-2007 and published. It is worth
      noting that in the period prior to 1991, the concept of material production was applied in BiH, while
      for the period 1992-1995 there were no reliable estimates of the BiH GDP due to the war.29 Aggregate
      countrywide estimates of GDP based on the production approach are prepared by the BHAS based on
      the data compiled separately for the two Entities’ statistical institutes and one in Brcko District. As for
      the expenditure approach, annual GDP estimates were compiled on an experimental basis for years:
      2004 and 2005, both at current and constant prices. These were disseminated for the first time in 2007.
      The estimates of GDP by expenditure approach are now a part of regular compilation program of NA
      estimates. Due to the fact that neither an Input-Output framework nor supply-and-use tables have been
      developed yet the discrepancy between the two approaches of GDP estimates persists. In addition the
      BHAS presented for the first time quarterly estimates of GDP by production approach on June 2013.
      Historical time series, compiled by the production approach is available from the first quarter 2006 to
      the last quarter of 2012 by NACE Rev 1.1 and for the first quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2014
      by the NACE Rev. 2.

      Fiscal data: The World Bank Group has access to public sector revenues and expenditure data at the
      Entity level (central and general government) via the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH)
      online portal and ITA publications. This is publicly available and is reported in this SCD. However, several
      caveats are warranted. Fiscal data reported by the governments, the Central Bank and the IMF have
      significant discrepancies in some years. A large part of the differences results from a lack of knowledge
      (or recording) of donor financing. Significant knowledge gaps also exist in terms of canton and municipal
      debt and contingent liabilities. In addition, State-Owned Enterprises may generate both significant
      revenues and expenditures, not all of which are believed to be captured by the fiscal accounts.

      State-Owned Enterprises: In addition to revenues and expenditures which should, in some cases, be
      captured by the fiscal accounts but are not, there is a lack of understanding even as to the number
      of SOEs (including those established at canton and municipal level), their liabilities (notably toward
      employees), the number of employees, as well as other factors. This reduces our ability to analyze the
      true extent of the public sector and its economic impact.

      Other areas: Several other areas were also found to lack information. This includes education—where
      the latest internationally comparable data date from 2007 and where there is little information on the
      skills required by firms; the size of the informal sector (though we do estimate this using Labor Force
      Survey data); and the full impact of the war on output. In addition, at the time of analysis, 2013 census
      data was available only on a municipal level and not on a sub-municipal level.

     2.2	 Drivers of poverty reduction
     2.3	       Growth was good for the poor in BiH as the B40 were able to expand their consumption
                during periods of economic growth. Overall growth in consumption accounted for three
                quarters of total poverty reduction during 2004-07 at the national level. During periods of
                economic growth, people also had a greater chance to get a good job. Around a third of
                the overall growth in incomes of the B40 over 2004-07 came from labor earnings (Figure
                2.3).30 This reflects growth in sectors that can employ lower skilled people. Growth in
                services (wholesale/retail trade, real estate, construction, transportation, administration,
                accommodation/restaurants, public services and other services) contributed over two thirds
                of overall growth during the 2001-07 period. The remainder came primarily from growth in
                manufacturing, electricity, mining and agriculture. Growth patterns/sources of growth are
                discussed in more detail in section 3.1.

     2.4	       The B40 also benefited from an expansion of public and private transfers, even during the
                economic growth period. Pensions and social assistance both made up a larger proportion
                of income among the B40 than among the T60. During the 2004-07 period, almost half
                of the overall income growth of the B40 was due to social assistance transfers—a more
                important contribution than that of labor earnings. Between 2004 and 2007 domestic
                pension coverage in FBiH expanded from 38 percent of the population to 45 percent of the
                population, and from 39 percent to 49 percent in RS. The average pension value also rose by
                78 percent in FBiH and 89 percent in RS during 2004-07. Finally, the incidence of remittances
                (both foreign and domestic) and the coverage of non-contributory transfers increased in
                FBiH during 2004-07 and declined in RS, which contributed to the faster pace of poverty
                reduction in FBiH between 2004 and 2007 (World Bank, 2010).

     2.5	       With the onset of the financial crisis, poverty stopped declining, although redistribution
                moderated very slightly the impact of slower economic growth. At 15 percent of the
                population in 2011, poverty was slightly higher than the pre-crisis 2007 estimate, although

2. Poverty and Shared Prosperity



          the difference is not statistically significant. The incidence of poverty remained stable during
          the period both in urban and rural areas of BiH. An increase in poverty was registered in
          FBiH,31 whereas poverty incidence remained stable in RS. The increase in poverty during the
          crisis was driven more by (a lack of) growth than redistribution. Between 2007 and 2011
          consumption expenditures fell across the entire distribution and in almost all consumption
          categories (and in particular for alcoholic beverages, recreation and transport), while
          consumption patterns remained stable. At the national level, changes in mean consumption
          contributed 1.4 percentage points to the overall increase in the poverty headcount.
          However, some wealth redistribution helped to reduce poverty by 0.3 percentage points.
          These figures are similar across urban and rural areas and are consistent with the marginally
          pro-poor shape of the growth incidence curves.32

2.6	      During the crisis, consumption of the B40 fell less than those of the T60 group. Between
          2007 and 2011 consumption fell at an annualized rate of 1.1 percent nationally, but
          expenditures for the B40 group fell by an annual average of 0.8 percent. Income data tends
          to be less reliable than consumption data—in the BiH case, reported household incomes are
          just a third of consumption—but nonetheless provide some evidence of income patterns.

2.7	      Despite the decline in consumption over 2007-11, household data suggest that some
          sources of income—notably pensions and social assistance—provided a cushion. Pensions
          and social assistance benefits were key contributors to the growth of incomes in the B40
          group during the crisis-affected period of 2007-11. (Social assistance and pensions are
          discussed in more detail in section 3.2). The increase in the relative importance of pensions
          during the 2007-11 period was most prominent in rural areas and urban areas outside of the
          capital. Wage income declined during 2007-11 in Sarajevo but saw positive growth outside
          of the capital. In Sarajevo, all sources of income, with the exception of pensions, shrunk
          during the crisis. The relative share of self-employed wages also decreased in rural areas
          (Figure 2.4), consistent with the negative contribution of agriculture to growth during this
          period, since a large share of those who declared themselves to be self-employed were
          employed in agriculture. Remittances played a secondary role during the pre-crisis growth
          period, at least in relative terms, and they do not appear to be counter-cyclical in that the
          economic slowdown is also associated with a fall in remittances, consistent with EU-wide
          effects of the financial crisis.

2.8	      However, BiH’s social assistance system tends to be pro-cyclical. Social assistance grew
          fast during the growth period of 2004-07 for both the B40 and T60. Social assistance
          helped to boost B40 income by more than T60 income as a share of income, the T60 also
          gained significantly from social assistance during 2004-07 (2.1 versus 1.3 percentage points
          increase annually). While social assistance did provide some cushion during the financial
          crisis, they contributed significantly less to income growth over 2007-11. In addition, they

 	
31
     This is sensitive to the level of the poverty threshold.
 	
32
     In the case of the poverty gap and the squared poverty gap, both the growth and the distribution components had positive contributions to the overall
     change in the corresponding indicators; the relative contribution of the growth and redistribution components was also more balanced in the case of
     FGT (Foster–Greer–Thorbecke)(1) and FGT(2) indices.

                     contributed slightly more to T60 income increase during the crisis than to B40 income (0.4
                     versus 0.3 percentage points per year). This suggests that (i) social assistance is poorly
                     targeted (this is discussed in more detail in section 3.2) and (ii) social assistance is partially
                     about redistributing resources to selected groups rather than supporting households in
                     need during national or individual economic downturns.

      2.3	 Persistence of characteristics of the poor and B40
      2.9	           The shared prosperity performance in BiH, both pre- and post-crisis, is tied to the
                     characteristics of the B40 group, characteristics that largely persist through time despite
                     pre-crisis income convergence. BiH has one of the lowest shares of employed individuals in
                     the working age population in the B40 in SEE (World Bank, 2014). Those in the B40 are less
                     likely to be employed (and more likely to be unemployment) than those in the T60 (Figure
                     2.5). The discrepancy between the two groups in terms of the unemployed population

2. Poverty and Shared Prosperity



          increased between 2007 and 2011. Among those in the B40 who are employed, a much
          higher share are in low-skilled occupations and/or sectors (Figure 2.6 and Figure 2.7). These
          patterns explain, on the one hand, why the strong employment performance pre-crisis was
          beneficial to the B40 group, and, on the other hand, the contribution of transfers to income
          dynamics in the B40 group, which relies on transfers more heavily.

2.10	 Education matters in getting jobs, especially for the B40. The level of human capital in the
      B40 is quite low, both in absolute terms and in comparison to other SEE countries. More
      than half of individuals in the B40 had completed at most the primary education level in
      BiH, whereas only 2 percent had completed tertiary education (Figure 2.8). By contrast,
      someone in the T60 is four times more likely to have completed tertiary education and much
      less likely (20 percentage points less likely) to have only primary (or lower) education. The
      low stock of human capital leads both to lower chances of employment and lower quality
      jobs. In the 25+ age group, among those with tertiary education over 60 percent reported
      being employed in 2011, compared to only 22 percent of those with primary education,
      and only 7 percent of those with no education (Figure 2.9). Among the employed in the
      same age group, 58 percent of those with tertiary education have professional occupations
      (and only 2 percent have elementary occupations). However, very few of those without
      tertiary education (including those with secondary education) have professional jobs, while
      the prevalence of non-skilled occupations is quite high (one third of those with primary
      education are in non-skilled occupations).

2.11	 The risks of falling into poverty are strongly associated with the type of job someone
      pursues. The poverty incidence varies considerably across occupational categories and
      sector of employment (Figure 2.10). Poverty is very low among professionals (legislators,
      scientific and other professional occupations), and it was also reasonably low in occupations
      such as technicians and clerks (comprising one third of the 25+ age cohort), while farmers
      and non-skilled professions recorded poverty rates in excess of 20 percent in 2011 (the
      situation was similar in 2007). Across sectors, those employed in the financial/real estate

                                   sector, public administration, as well as trades/services sectors are relatively unlikely to be
                                   poor, while those working in agriculture, industry and construction were much more likely
                                   to be poor. Poverty among those working in agriculture and construction increased between
                                   2007 and 2011, consistent with the macroeconomic indicators of sectoral growth during this
                                   period, which show declining output in both sectors (Figure 2.11). Economic growth and
                                   sectoral employment are discussed in more detail in sections 3.1 and 3.7. There has been
                                   a shift from agricultural occupations to trade and services occupations among younger age
                                   cohorts (20 percent of those aged 45+ were in the trade and services sector, compared to 31

     2.12	 Labor market participation by females in the B40 and in rural areas is low and persistently
           so. While males in the T60 are more likely to participate in the labor market than males in
           the T40, the gap is fairly small compared to that of women in the B40 (Figure 2.12). Around
           52 percent of males in the T60 are in the labor market, while 42 percent of males in the
           B40 are. However, females in the B40 are less than half as likely to participate in the labor
           market as their T60 counterparts (15 versus 32 percent). Among the poor (or the B40) there
           is also a large difference in the labor force Figure 2.12: Female labor force participation especially low in

                 for BiH also pointed to “discriminatory attitudes and social norms towards women” reducing

2.13	 Unemployment in the B40 group is particularly high among the youth and also among the
      Roma. Overall in 2011, the difference between the share of unemployed adults of working
      age in the B40 group and the T60 group was about 8 percentage points. Differences are
      quite small among those nearing retirement (aged 55-64) where the difference was only
      3 percentage points (Figure 2.13). On the other hand, youth (aged 15-24) in the B40
      are much more likely to be unemployed than youth in the T60, with unemployment 11
      percentage points higher in the former (Figure 2.14). Unemployment is even higher for
      Roma minority (many of them below the poverty threshold or in the bottom 40 percent),
      with 44 percent who are unemployed (compared to 27 percent non-Roma neighbors living
      in the same community).33

2.14	 BiH’s tax system is contributing to high unemployment among the youth and low-skilled
      workers. The country’s tax wedge—the indirect costs of bringing a worker into the formal
      labor market—is one of the highest in the region. Social security contributions (33 percent of
      gross wages in RS and 41.5 percent in FBiH) are the highest in SEE. The high contribution rates
      are likely to be particularly biting for low earners. Koettl and Weber (2012) show that BiH has
      a very high tax wedge for low wage earners (measured for a single worker at 33 percent of
      average wage), and a very low progressivity of the tax. This may encourage many to prefer the
      informal sector (employment is discussed in more detail in section 3.7 and taxes in 3.2).

     2.15	 Without jobs, it is difficult for the B40 to contribute to and benefit from economic growth.
           An analysis of the income generating capacity of the B40, based on the assets framework
           proposed by Bussolo and Lopez-Calva (2013)34 shows that the population in the bottom
           two welfare quintiles is characterized by a lower stock of assets (human and otherwise) to
           draw upon. The B40 have lower levels of education, lower employment rates, particularly
           among women, and higher unemployment rates among youth and Roma than the rest of
           the population.35

     2.4	 Rural livelihoods
     2.16	 The B40 (and the poor) are overrepresented in rural areas, although this is in part the
           result of differences in underlying characteristics of urban and rural populations. A higher
           poverty and B40 rate among rural residents is a common feature across many countries,
           although this difference has been minimized in a number of northern European countries.
           In BiH, the discrepancy is pronounced—only about 30 percent of urban residents were in
           the (national) B40 group according to latest data, compared to more than 45 percent of rural
           residents (Figure 2.15).

     2.17	 People living in rural areas are more likely to be poor and less educated compared to
           urban people. Poverty is significantly higher in rural areas, at 19 percent, compared to 9
           percent in urban areas, with similar results in both Entities. Education differences of HH
           head account for around half of urban-rural income differential (Figure 2.17). Controlling
           for demographics (age, sex, household size, number of children) and labor market status
           reduces the differential to 3 percentage points. The additional contribution of labor force
           status is minimal when conditional on education level, suggesting education drives this.
           These factors make it harder for women to participate in the labor market, particularly
           with low rates of access to early childhood education (in BiH in general and rural areas
           in particular). A lack of early childhood education is also a concern for inter-generational
           poverty transfer risk, given the increased poverty in large families.

     2.18	 Despite this, the rural population has remained stable as a share of the total population
           since 1990. The rural population declined from around 80 percent of the total in 1960
           to around 60 percent in 1990 (Figure 2.16). However, it has remained stable at this level
           since then. This contrasts markedly with other SEE countries, where the urbanization trend
           resumed after the break-up of Yugoslavia, albeit at a slower pace.

     2.19	 Geographical population patterns are partly determined by BiH’s topography and a process
           of sub-urbanization has occurred since the war. The population is concentrated mainly in
           valleys, as illustrated by night time light emission (Annex II). The strongest light growth since
           the war however, can be seen in sub-urban or peri-urban areas, suggesting some degree of
           movement to these areas.

2.20	 “Large villages” are becoming more important, partly because towns are shrinking.
      Administrative data also suggests a degree of sub- or peri-urbanization. Although imperfect36,
      the data indicate that municipalities with high density and very low density (defined as
      below 50 persons/km2) saw declines in their populations between 1991 and 2013, reflecting
      the general population decline. However municipalities with densities of 50 to 100 persons/
      km2 saw increases in their population over the period in both absolute terms and as a share
      of the population.

2.21	 Rural and urban areas differ in access to services or quality of life in some ways. For
      example, some 80 percent of rural households need to travel over 3 kilometers to access
      a bank and 40 percent need to do so to access a clinic (Table 2.1). While no comparable
      statistics exist for urban areas, this suggests that rural road transport is important for access
      to services in rural areas. Access to some types of education are better in urban areas with
      more urban children in Early Childhood Education (22.8 percent vs 7.9 percent).

     2.22	 However, in most ways, BiH does a decent job of ensuring its rural citizens have access to
           basic services. Age differences between rural and urban areas are minimal and therefore
           do not appear to account for either education differences (which are driving income
           differentials) (Annex II). There is little difference in many health indicators (e.g. child
           immunization, sickness, and malnutrition), little difference in school enrollment or literacy,
           and little difference in access to clean drinking water.

     2.23	 The 2012 UNDP Rural Household Survey (RHS) revealed that around two thirds of rural
           income comes from employment. This matches similar findings in the 2011 Extended
           Household Budget Survey (EHBS), which found that around 55 percent of rural income came
           from wage labor (Table 2.2). The RHS suggests that just 6.6 percent of rural income comes
           from selling agricultural produce. Between a fifth and a quarter of household income comes
           from social security.

     2.24	 With a third of rural households having no land and 16 percent having only “gardens”, low
           income and low wage employment from agriculture in rural areas is unsurprising. The RHS
           estimated that 35 percent of rural households have no land; 16 percent have “gardens”; and
           37 percent can be considered smallholders. Just 13 percent of rural households have farms.

     2.25	 Although around a fifth of workers nationally are estimated to be employed in agriculture,
           most are self-employed. Although the 2013 Labor Force Survey found that 19.6 percent of all
           those employed worked in agriculture, the RHS found that agriculture generates little formal
           wage employment. Agricultural employment is therefore largely for self-consumption. In
           rural areas, “non-agricultural households” have higher average income than “agricultural
           household” except the largest farms (although this fails to monetize own-consumption).
           Agriculture contributes little to income for households with less than 3h of land.

2.26	 The fragmentation of land ownership presents a major challenge for agricultural producers.
      Farms in BiH are on average 2 hectares subdivided into 6 to 8 plots. Fragmentation is also
      common among larger farms, which typically comprise 6 to 8 lots of 2 to 3 hectares. BH’s
      farm structure is more fragmented that that of Southern Europe in the 1970, as well as
      most neighboring countries today.37 Such land fragmentation adversely impacts farm
      productivity, and, since 2013, BH is piloting land consolidation over approximately 3,000 ha
      in the municipality of Ravno and Orašje.38

2.5	 Social and political exclusion
Social inclusion
2.27	 Nearly half of the BiH population was found to be at risk of poverty or social exclusion
      (AROPE). The 2007 UNDP National Human Development Report (UNHDR) for BiH, found that
      half of the BiH population could be categorized as socially excluded. They note that a tighter
      definition defined 22 percent as socially excluded based on a combination of living standards,
      health, education, participation in society and access to services. A standard EU indicator
      defines a household as at risk of poverty or social exclusion based on income poverty, very low
      work intensity, material deprivation or an inability to meet a significant unexpected expense.39
      Based on this standard definition, the 2011 Extended Household Budget Survey (EHBS) reveals
      that around 48 percent of the population fell into this category. This compares to 32 percent
      in Croatia and 31 percent for eastern EU countries on average. Only Bulgaria has a higher
      proportion of its population AROPE (Figure 2.18). Based on AROPE and other indicators40, the
      main categories of people identified as being particularly at risk of social exclusion in BiH are:
      (i) elderly; (ii) children; (iii) youth; (iv) persons with disabilities; (v) refugees and internally
      displaced persons; (vi) Roma; and (vii) lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGBT) people.

         The UNDP National Human Development Report (NHDR) for BiH, similarly finds, based on a different measure that half of the BiH population could
         be categorized as socially excluded. A stronger definition defined 22 percent as socially excluded based on a combination of living standards, health,
         education, participation in society and access to services. More details are available from: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.

     2.28	 Roma groups are considered to be particularly at risk of exclusion based on both material
           and discrimination indicators. The absolute poverty rate is estimated to be around three
           times higher among the Roma than the general population, while malnutrition rates are
           eight times higher (Figure 2.19). Roma also have significantly lower literacy rates than their
           non-Roma counterparts (82 percent versus 97 percent) and are less likely to have medical
           insurance coverage than other people (70 percent versus 96 percent). Roma women are
           particularly disadvantaged, suffering from literacy rates as low as 70 percent (compared
           to 90 percent for males) and employment rates of 5 percent (compared to 32 percent for
           males) (see figures in Annex III.)

     2.29	 While women are not considered an AROPE group per se, gender issues remain relevant
           in some areas in BiH. For example, women are around a third less likely to participate in
           the labor force than men (Figure 2.20) and this is the case for all ages (Figure 2.21). Men
           tend to earn around 9 percent more than women (KM 3.9 per hour on average for men
           compared to KM 3.5 for women).41 A gender gap exists at most levels of education, age
           groups, occupations and industries. Controlling for observable characteristic differences
           between males and females reduces the wage gap by only around a quarter. Over 6
           percentage points of the wage gap remains unexplained. In addition, women are much less
           likely to have a bank account at a formal financial institution (48 percent compared to 67
           percent for men) and may find it difficult to access loans due to low property ownership
           rates, which reduces potential collateral (74 percent of dwelling properties are owned only
           by men, see Annex IX), potentially stifling female entrepreneurship. A recent survey finds
           that one in two women in BiH has experienced at least one form of violence starting at age
           15.42 Analysis undertaken by the Copenhagen Consensus suggests that domestic violence
           may have significant economic costs due to increased health expenditure and lost days of
           work or study (Fearon and Hoeffler, 2014).43

2. Poverty and Shared Prosperity



2.30	 One of the main obstacles to gender development in BiH may be the persistence of
      traditional social norms about women’s roles. A recent Gender Diagnostic found that
      Women’s lives are sometimes governed by a patriarchal value system, the remnants
      of communism, and a state of post war transition, all of which limit their capacities and
      prospects.44 Further, data on the impact of the Law on Gender Equality and the result of the
      introduction of various mechanisms on the status of women is limited45 making it difficult to
      measure their impact and to make a case for areas requiring urgent attention.

Administrative inclusion, citizen engagement and trust in institutions
2.31	 BiH citizens value increased employment opportunities highly. Surveys undertaken by
      international institutions provide insight into BiH citizens’ priorities. The United Nations
      “Citizen Aspirations” survey and the Life in Transition Survey (LiTS) undertaken by the EBRD
      and WBG reveal that citizens value increased access to employment, and improved health
      and education (Figure 2.22 and Annex I). However, the LiTS indicated that respondents would
      need to pay more taxes or give up part of their income to finance the improvements. With
      the high tax burden (but low income tax base), it is unsurprising that fewer people in BiH
      indicated being prepared to do this than any other country in SEE apart from Albania. Both
      males and females indicated that improved job opportunities were their most important
      aspiration, with better healthcare and a good education also important. For both males and
      females an honest and responsive government was their fifth most important aspiration.

      extensive citizen engagement. BiH constitutions allow for citizens’ access to parliament
      in person and parliamentary proceedings are broadcast/webcast. In addition, many laws
      demand significant public consultations. There is a consultative group established for Roma

              The extensive public consultations may allow for capture by special interest groups. For
              example, any efforts to make reforms that refocus social protection on the poor may suffer
              from coordinated interventions by current (non-poor) beneficiaries.

     2.33	 Some elected posts are reserved for people of specific ethnicities. One of the remaining
           key political issues is that BiH citizens are obliged to register as one of three “constituent
           peoples” to hold certain public positions. For example, the three-person Presidency is held
           by a Croat, a Serb and a Bosniak, according to the constitution. While any BiH citizen is able
           to declare themselves any one of these, a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights
           (known as ‘Sejdic-Finci’ after its plaintiffs) brought by Roma and Jewish citizens found that
           BiH should open all elected positions to citizens who do not belong to the three groups of
           constituent peoples.

           than people in other countries. BiH suffers Figure 2.23: BiH citizens have little trust in their institutions

     2.6	 The roadmap for ending poverty and creating shared prosperity
     2.35	 BiH can end poverty and achieve shared prosperity in this generation. For this to happen,
           the country needs to rebalance economically, socially and institutionally. High economic
           growth is critical for BiH to win its fight against poverty and become a high-income economy,
           especially as growth has been closely associated with poverty reduction in the past. However,
           BiH needs a number of complementary interventions so that everyone can successfully
           participate in society and in the economy. This includes protecting the environment and
           managing shocks, including from natural disasters.

2. Poverty and Shared Prosperity



2.36	 The next three chapters will outline BiH’s main challenges and opportunities through
      which it can eliminate poverty and achieve shared prosperity. Chapter 3 deepens
      the diagnostics on the drivers and constraints to inclusive growth and job creation. This
      includes the sources of growth and employment, and the infrastructure required to achieve
      shared prosperity. It sheds light on the bottlenecks that need to be removed to achieve
      economic and employment growth. While employment is a key path to ensuring inclusive
      growth, social policies also play an important role. Chapter 4 therefore analyzes some of
      the underlying requirements for inclusive shared prosperity and improving the quality of
      life for all, including education and health improvements. This chapter also analyzes the
      significance of exclusion and vulnerability, especially of rural dwellers, females and Roma.
      Chapter 5 notes that BiH faces risks from a number of shocks, which could set back the quest
      for shared prosperity on both a national level and an individual level. In particular, recent
      floods and other extreme weather conditions have revealed BiH’s vulnerability to climactic
      shocks, which harmed economic growth and hit some families and businesses (notably in
      agriculture) particularly hard. Chapter 6 reports priority reform areas for poverty reduction
      and shared prosperity, noting that both poor and vulnerable households would tend to
      benefit from similar reforms to the non-poor, and firms face similar challenges in all sectors.

2.37	 Restoring growth and creating jobs is the most direct and effective pathway out of poverty
      in BiH. This will require actions on a number of fronts. A key area is the relationship between
      the public and private sector and their relative shares in the economy. A public sector that
      absorbs a smaller share of GDP would help to reduce the current high tax burden that stifles
      firms and individuals, and the structure of tax disfavors production (taxes are discussed in
      more detail in section 3.2). Another challenge are efficient labor markets that encourage both
      labor supply and hiring, including: (i) addressing the issue of high labor taxes—particularly
      for low-earners—which have pushed many B40 into the informal labor market, reduced their
      take-home pay, or prevented the creation of jobs they would otherwise have had access to;
      (ii) improving job matching and skills training, the latter based on evidence of employers’
      skills requirements; (iii) reducing the share of output absorbed by wages by allowing more
      flexible contracts and increasing productivity. Labor market issues are discussed in more
      detail in section 3.7. Social welfare, while beneficial to the B40 pre- and especially post-
      crisis, remains poorly targeted with wealthiest quintile also receiving significant amounts
      of social assistance. The poor and B40 could therefore, have performed better with a more
      streamlined social welfare program. Social protection issues are discussed in more detail in
      sections 3.2 and 3.7. Another key area is a better investment climate, which would help to
      boost employment, entrepreneurship, output and productivity. Currently BiH suffers from
      the worst business environment in Europe, with some key areas for entrepreneurship and
      SMEs in general—such as paying taxes, construction permits and property registration—in
      particularly poor shape. Alignment with EU standards to allow firms to grow and export
      would also help to generate employment. Business environment issues are discussed in more
      detail in section 3.4. Also important for improving private sector prospects is the provision
      of sufficient infrastructure over the medium to long term. This includes ensuring energy
      supply remains sustained and roads are improved. Infrastructure is discussed in more detail
      in section 3.6.

                                                                               2. Poverty and Shared Prosperity



     2.38	 Promoting social inclusion is key to shared prosperity. By some measures, up to half of the
           BiH population are at risk of social exclusion. Some potentially at-risk groups include rural
           dwellers, females, youth, Roma, and younger war veterans. By-and-large, these groups face
           similar challenges to those of the rest of the population. This includes employment (section
           3.7), business environment (section 3.4), corruption (Box 1.1), and poor public services. This
           suggests that tackling the challenges noted above will benefit socially excluded groups. For
           example, rural dwellers would benefit from job creation, including in towns and cities. All
           groups would also likely benefit from economic growth. Some groups also face some specific
           issues. This includes higher poverty among children (i.e. in households with more children)
           and very low rates of early childhood education, especially in rural areas. Improved access
           to early childhood education and childhood care—particularly in rural areas (section 2.4)—
           would help both to break a cycle of inter-generational poverty (especially important since
           families with more children and lower educational levels are more likely to be poor) and
           provide increased childcare that could allow more females to seek employment. Education
           is discussed in more detail in section 4.2. Together, this presents a very real risk of inter-
           generational poverty transfer.

     2.39	 Managing risks for sustainable growth is critical. BiH faces significant risks to sustainable
           and inclusive growth from several factors, many outside of the control of governments. In
           particular natural disasters, including climactic shocks, have hit BiH hard over the last decade
           with harsh winters and floods hitting growth in most sectors of the economy (environmental
           risks are discussed in section 5.1). Pollution in urban areas also harms health and quality
           of life (health is discussed in section 4.1). BiH is also vulnerable to external economic
           and financial shocks, as demonstrated by its growth slow-down (from which it has yet to
           recover) during the global financial crisis. The BiH economy is already intertwined with that
           of the EU through trade, remittances and other financial flows. Finally, BiH is vulnerable
           to social shocks, as shown by demonstrations in 2014 (social risks are discussed in section
           5.2). Reforms that promote more inclusive growth may face resistance by insiders who
           benefit from a status quo that doesn’t always benefit the wider population. At the same
           time, a lack of reforms could also result in social unrest as ‘outsiders’ claim greater rights.
           Navigating needed reforms will therefore not be easy and will require good communication
           and designing ‘reform packages’ from which the population as a whole benefits.

CHAPTER Three

Restoring growth and creating
jobs
Over the last 20 years, BiH has had three distinct economic periods. After the end of the war, the
economy rebounded strongly, driven by exceptionally high foreign aid and remittances (1996-1999).
In a second period from 2000-2007, the economy grew moderately at an average of 5 percent per
year until 2007 when the global financial crisis unfolded. Since the end of the war, remittances and
aid played a critical role in the recovery, fueling a consumption-driven economy, with consumption
at over 100 percent of GDP and non-tradables contributing two thirds to economic growth. Since
2008 the economy has stalled with average growth rates of below 1 percent.

BiH has maintained macroeconomic stability with relatively low inflation; public debt stayed at a
reasonably low level until the crisis—reaching just 19 percent of GDP in 2007, but has more than
doubled since then. BiH governments have a strong track record in raising revenue, especially VAT,
which helps to maintain low fiscal deficits. At the same time, BiH is over-taxing its citizens and
pushing them and the firms they work for into the gray economy. Labor taxes hit the B40 especially
hard both directly and through increased unemployment. Public expenditures are also high, at
close to 50 percent of GDP, and are focused on current items. BiH has the largest public sector wage
bill in the region but citizens don’t enjoy corresponding high quality public services.

Today, BiH is an economy out of balance that needs to look at new sources of growth. Economically,
there are three main imbalances. First, the public sector dominates the economic landscape,
controlling half of the economy (not including SOEs) to the detriment of the private sector. Second,
consumption is at record levels (above 100 percent of GDP), while investment rates are low. Third,
exports are hindered by BiH’s exceptionally poor business environment, and are among the lowest in
Europe (at 32 percent), while high levels of imports are creating a significant current account deficit,
which is being financed by external flows, especially remittances.

Poverty and labor market outcomes are closely linked but jobs are scarce, with only 27 out of
every 100 people employed, and half of those work either in the public or informal sectors. Over
half of the working age population has dropped out of the labor market altogether. Female
employment is low, particularly in the B40, and accounts for some of the differences between B40
and T60 households. Output per worker is low but comparable to some other countries in the
region; however, the few employed people need to support a large number of others. Two thirds
of the output per worker is absorbed by labor costs, and the minimum wage as a share of output
per worker is very high, leaving little room for investment or risk-taking. Rigid labor market rules
make it difficult for employers to hire people, and they think twice before doing so, as making
redundancies is so difficult. Social benefits are costly, reach the rich as much as the poor, crowd
out expenditure on Active Labor Market Policies (ALMPs), including training, and discourage work.
Employment services are overwhelmed by people who are more concerned with obtaining health
insurance than employment.

     3.1 Economic performance

     Historical Growth Performance
     3.1	      BiH was one of the poorer republics in the former Yugoslavia and, by some measures,
               was the hardest hit country following the break-up of Yugoslavia. Estimates place BiH GDP
               at $1,713 per capita in 1990 compared to an average of $3,549 in Yugoslavia as a whole.
               The notable exception is Sarajevo, which had a GDP per capita a third above the Yugoslav
               average. By the end of the war an estimated 1 million people had left the country and 60
               percent of those who remained were internally displaced. Output declined by an estimated
               79 percent between 1989 and 1995 as a result of the cumulative effects of war and the
               break-up of Yugoslavia, significantly higher than in other former Yugoslav republics.

     3.2	      The “peace dividend” allowed BiH to enjoy an economic rebound during the three years
               after the Dayton Accords were signed. Between 1996 and 1999, GDP per capita grew by close
               to 60 percent or an average of 16.5 percent per year (see Annex XII). Overseas Development
               Aid (ODA), averaged 26 percent of GDP per year between 1996 and 1999 but dropping
               considerably in the following years, and remittances were instrumental in supporting the
               economy, with the latter estimated at over 10 percent of GDP, even in in 2014.

     3.3	      Growth slowed considerably after 2000 and was on par with the SEE region. Economic
               growth per capita slowed to an annual average of 5.1 percent between 2000 and 2008,
               around the SEE average of 5.0 percent (Figure 3.1). With faster growth over the period, BiH
               narrowed the gap with EU-CEE and EU17 countries. Per capita GDP increased from 42 to
               44 percent in EU-CEE (and from 19 to 25 percent in EU17), though this could be considered
               slow convergence given BiH’s low starting point (Figure 3.2).

3. Restoring growth and creating jobs



3.4	    Until 2008, BiH broadly achieved macroeconomic and fiscal stability. Positive and broadly
        stable economic growth was achieved in the years between the post-war recovery and the
        global financial crisis (2000-08). A currency board, first with the Deutsche Mark and then
        Euro helped to ensure monetary stability. Inflation averaged 2.4 percent between 2001
        and 2008 and has remained low (even negative) since then. Headline fiscal numbers were
        decent over the period, with modest deficits or surpluses. The establishment of the Indirect
        Tax Authority (ITA) in 2004 helped BiH generate some of the world’s highest public revenues
        as a share of GDP. Public debt remained at moderate levels, reaching a low of 19 percent of
        GDP in 2007 before increasing during the crisis. The financial system provided private sector
        credit that grew at more than 25 percent per year, helping to boost the private sector. Exports
        increased from 26 percent of GDP in 2000 to a high of 36 percent in 2006 before falling back
        somewhat. Partly as a result of the stable macroeconomic performance, unemployment fell
        between 2006 and 2008 from 31 to 23 percent. The close link between employment, poverty
        and the performance of the B40 was reflected in notable improvements in the consumption
        of the B40, which saw greater growth than the average population between 2004 and 2007.

            earnings in countries that host migrants.
            With EU countries suffering, remittances
            declined from 15 percent of GDP in 2008 to around 11 percent in 2013. The poor were
            particularly affected, given their greater reliance on remittances.

     3.8	   The crisis saw BiH reverse some of its previous gains and revealed BiH’s underlying
            structural weaknesses of the pre-crisis model. Growth averaged just 0.3 percent per year
            in BiH between 2008 and 2013. Along with much of the region, the country suffered from
            a “double dip” recession with negative growth in 2009 and 2012 of -2.7 and -1.2 percent,
            respectively. With average per capita growth rates of 0.7 percent in SEE and 0.8 percent in EU-
            CEE, GDP growth in BiH fell behind other countries in the region. Structural weaknesses were
            revealed, which favor consumption over investment, hinder firm growth and employment
            creation, make it difficult to export, and discourage job-seeking. Rigid labor market laws,
            high taxes—particularly on labor, a poor business climate, and poor transport infrastructure
            all made it difficult for firms to adapt during the crisis, and likely held back growth and
            employment prior to it.

     3.9	   Headline fiscal performance was reasonable in the pre-crisis growth period but that
            performance disguised unsustainable elements of the system and deep inefficiencies.
            The average fiscal deficit was 0.6 percent of GDP between 2002 and 2008, the lowest in
            SEE except for Kosovo. In addition, the fiscal balance tended to be positive in the years of
            fast economic growth, making the fiscal policy somewhat counter-cyclical. With revenues
            averaging 46.5 percent of GDP between 2000 and 2013, not many countries in the world,
            can display a better performance in generating public sector resources. VAT productivity is
            the highest in SEE. Public debt was maintained at moderate levels between 2000 and 2008
            and even reached as low as 19 percent of GDP in 2007. However, evidence suggests that
            the excessive tax burden may have pushed firms and citizens into the informal economy.
            In 2013, two thirds of gross value- added per worker was absorbed by wages and labor
            taxes (including SSC), leaving little room for investment or risk-taking. Public expenditure
            is also inefficient, with its over-focus on wages and transfers. Transfers are poorly targeted,
            with the wealthiest quintile benefitting almost as much as the poorest. Fragmented public

        institutions, including the ministries of health also result in inefficiencies. Despite high
        revenues, BiH needed to raise significant resources to finance fiscal deficits during the crisis,
        so that public debt increased to 44 percent of GDP by 2012.

3.10	 Weaknesses were revealed in the financial sector, which performed reasonably well pre-
      2008. While credit growth to the private sector helped to finance economic activity between
      2000 and 2008, the crisis revealed similar weaknesses to the rest of Europe. Non-performing
      loans reached over 15 percent in 2014, up from less than 6 percent in 2009. A small non-
      banking financial sector also displayed weaknesses in expanding insurance markets to
      protect firms and homeowners against natural disasters that have hit BiH over the last five
      years. BiH is subject to Moneyval’s Compliance Enhancing Procedures due to weaknesses
      in their anti-money-laundering and countering terrorist financing system, which is not fully
      in compliance with the international standards. Failure to enhance due diligence measures
      would put international financial connectivity at risk, and significant progress would be
      particularly important in a country where remittances plus foreign wages account for close
      to 15 percent of GDP. Although the banking system—dominated by foreign banks—appears
      broadly sound, significant pockets of vulnerability exist among banks. A number of smaller
      banks are struggling to meet capital requirements, with some facing high concentration risks
      and heavy reliance on public sector support. Moreover, significant deficiencies remain in the
      financial safety net, including with respect to resolution powers, institutional responsibility
      for resolution, and resolution funding.

3.11	 Given the country’s significant structural weaknesses, BiH’s macro-fiscal stability
        will depend on a more sustainable economic model. Weaknesses in the business
        climate, labor markets, fiscal revenue structures and levels, fiscal expenditure
        efficiency, financial regulation and
        breadth, as well as an economic Figure 3.6: Current model: Economy out of balance

        consumption rather than investment                           Policies and

        or tradable production mean BiH’s
        economic stability could be placed
        in jeopardy. While BiH’s economy
        is not broken, it could be seen as
        “out of balance”, with some areas
        overly prominent compared to their
        sustainable levels, and others less
        prominent (Figure 3.6). Addressing
        the major structural weaknesses will
        be key to ensuring continued macro- Source: BiH SCD team

     3.14	 The crisis hit investment hard and it has not yet recovered. A concerning long-term trend
           is the declining importance of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), which fell from 26
           percent of GDP in 2008 to 19 percent in 2009, as investment was cut due to the crisis. It
           never recovered from the fall and indeed, fell further, reaching 17 percent of GDP in 2013.
           While all forms of GFCF were hit (Figure 3.9), investment in machinery and equipment fell
           fastest and has not recovered since. This bodes poorly for future industrial output in BiH.

3.2	 Fiscal position
3.16	 Fiscal performance has been mixed. On the positive side are: sustainable fiscal balances
      (Figure 3.10), sustainable (though fast growing) public debt, broadly counter-cyclical fiscal
      policy, and effective revenue collection. On the negative side are: fast increasing debt and
      debt service, high taxation, and expenditure patterns that could do significantly more to
      promote growth, shared prosperity and promote public services.

3.17	 Fiscal deficits during the 2000s were contained, allowing BiH to run deficits during the
      crisis. BiH succeeded in maintaining either fiscal surpluses or deficits below 0.5 percent
      of GDP in every year between 2003 and 2007. While many other European countries ran
      pro-cyclical fiscal policies. With deficits despite positive economic growth, BiH achieved
      increasing surpluses as growth speeded up. The surpluses turned to deficit during the crisis,

              bottoming out at 5.8 percent of GDP in 2009, the height of the crisis when the BiH economy
              shrunk by 2.7 percent. This represents a good example of a counter-cyclical fiscal policy.
              It could be that BiH’s institutional arrangements—which help to contain debt and ensure
              broad agreement on the fiscal stance across different levels of government—helped the
              country to generate fiscal surpluses and broadly contained deficits during the crisis.

     3.18	 The fiscal stance has promoted redistribution but not always to poorer groups, and not
           always generating incentives to work or invest. High taxation—particularly on the private
           sector and on labor—results in redistribution from formal private sector employees to
           (often inefficient) public sector employees. There is also re-distribution from able-bodied
           workers to the dependent population via pensions and categorical safety nets. Finally, there
           is redistribution from the less well-off to the better-off through high labor taxation among
           less well paid workers and poorly targeted safety nets. These issues are discussed in more
           depth below.

           BiH’s tax rates are close to the rate its economy can support without prejudicing economic
           growth.50 While this is a nice problem to have, it does have consequences.

     3.20	 Value Added Tax (VAT) collection is very efficient. Indirect taxes—in BiH’s case, VAT—made
           up 41 percent of total revenue in 2013. VAT productivity (tax revenues as a percent of the
           tax base divided by the standard tax rate) was the highest in SEE at 89 percent in 2012
           compared to a regional average of 73 percent. Other taxes, notably personal income tax,
           perform more poorly. With consumption at an unsustainable level of over 100 percent of
           GDP, VAT may be an efficient way of raising public resources.

          ‘Tax effort’ is defined as the ratio between the actual revenue collected and the revenue potential of an economy. The difference between the
          revenue potential (legal) and the actual revenue collected is commonly understood as the “tax gap”. The difference between the revenue potential
          (economic) and the actual revenue collected can be termed the “tax space”, i.e., the amount of revenue that a country can afford to collect, given
          its inherent economic strength, not based on what the parliament has mandated. The difference between the tax gap and the tax space—called
          “difference”.

3.21	 BiH may be over-taxing its firms and citizens. For the period 2000-10, Khwaja and Iyer
      (2013) found that BiH’s revenue collections are estimated to have been around 6.3 percent
      higher than the economic potential of the country, highlighting the possibility that high taxes
      have prejudiced economic growth. In the world only a small group of countries have higher
      revenue as a share of GDP than BiH. These are a handful of wealthy western European
      countries; oil-dependent countries or small island states largely reliant on donor financing.51

3. Restoring growth and creating jobs



3.26	 Public expenditures have been concentrated on current spending including public wages,
      pensions and social transfers. BiH spent around 12.9 percent of GDP on compensating
      public sector employees in 2012, over 3 percentage points higher than the SEE average of
      9.7 percent (Table 3.3). This results partly from wage increases prior to the economic crisis
      and may also be influenced by the number of layers of government (see Box 3.1 for details of
      sub-national expenditure patterns). With an estimated 180,000 public employees, around
      one in twenty Bosnians is employed by the public sector. While this is high, it is similar in
      Croatia and lower than in Serbia (where an estimated one in fourteen is employed by the
      public sector). Low private sector employment however means that in BiH, around a third of
      employees are employed by the public sector. In addition, evidence suggests that BiH does
      not enjoy a high level of public services despite its high wage expenditures. With few of the
      B40 in public sector employment, they are unlikely to benefit significantly from this public
      expenditure. As with wages, spending on goods and services is also the highest in SEE as a
      share of GDP. This stems partly from inefficient spending as a result of the fragmentation
      of government, for example, unnecessarily duplicated spending on some healthcare in
      different cantons or lack of reference pricing in pharmaceuticals or joint procurement. High
      social security revenues are matched with high social security spending and, in SEE, only
      Serbia spends more on social benefits, which are often poorly targeted (see below).

3.27	 Pensions account for most social security spending but there are sustainability problems.
      Spending on pensions was estimated at around 9.4 percent of GDP in FBiH and 10.2
      percent of GDP in RS in 2009 (World Bank, 2012)57, higher even than many “older” and
      wealthier countries like Sweden and Japan. Each contributor supported 0.73 pensioners in
      FBiH and 0.76 in RS, with only Italy and France having higher dependency ratios in Europe.
      The low formal labor market participation rates (ironically exacerbated by the high social
      contributions) are partly responsible. The high spending on pensions is partly the result
      of large number of people receiving disability pensions pre-retirement age. Working age

             pensioners (younger than 65) are 33 percent of the total in FBiH and 42 percent of the total
             in RS. But, while many working-aged people are receiving pensions, as many as 39 percent
             of the elderly may not be collecting any state pension, despite the fact that the elderly
             have lower poverty rates than many other groups. See section 3.7 for more details of social
             welfare expenditures, including targeting.


      Box 3.1: Sub-National Public Expenditures

     Fiscal responsibilities are highly fragmented in BiH. Almost all responsibilities are at the level of the
     Entity. This includes areas such as transport, health, education, social benefits including contributory
     ones. The FBiH further devolves responsibility for health and education to its cantons. As a result
     most spending is decentralized. In 2013, total public expenditures was worth 47.1 percent of GDP. Of
     this, the State was responsible for 7.3 percent (3.4 percent of national GDP), FBiH, with around two
     thirds of the population, 59.1 percent (27.8 percent of national GDP), RS, with around one third of the
     population, spent 31.6 percent (14.9 percent of national GDP), and Brcko District, with 2.5 percent of
     the population, spent 2.1 percent (0.9 percent of GDP) (Table 3.4). Within FBiH public spending is also
     highly decentralized. In FBiH, the central government was responsible for just 21.5 percent of total
     public spending in 2013. The remaining 78.5 percent was spent by the ten cantons (themselves subdi-
     vided into 79 municipalities), and 35 extra budgetary funds (one pension, 11 employment, 11 health,
     11 road and one motorway).

     Public spending in RS, is somewhat less fragmented. The central government was responsible for 44.7
     percent of expenditures in 2013. Six extra-budgetary funds (pension, employment, health, child, road,
     motorway) and 63 municipalities were responsible for the remainder. An additional—off-budgetary—
     fund was created following the floods in May 2014 to pay for reconstruction. It is financed by a 3
     percent tax on gross pay.

3. Restoring growth and creating jobs




   The high degree of fragmentation reduces the efficiency of public expenditures. For example, the 11
   health and education funds in FBiH may find savings through more centralized procurement. At the
   same time, greater sharing of services may lead to cost savings and improved quality of public services
   (see e.g. health section of this report).

   Despite their differing degree of decentralization, the two Entities have very similar budget
   compositions in terms of the economic classification. For example, in 2013, FBiH spent 22 percent of
   its total expenditures to finance compensation of employees, compared with 23 percent in RS, while
   capital expenditures (NANFA) were worth 15 percent of the total in FBiH and 13 percent in RS (Table
   3.5). The difference was driven by slightly higher foreign financed capital spending in FBiH.

   Differences between two Entities appear to stem largely from their different degrees of decentraliza-
   tion. In RS, where more public services are provided by the central government, 38 percent of central
   government spending goes on salaries, while just 10 percent of other budgetary units’ spending does.
   In FBiH, where cantons take an important role in providing public services, this is reversed with 11
   percent of central government spending going on wages, while 26 percent of other budgetary units’
   spending does.

   The State plays a different role to that of the Entities resulting in a different budget composition to
   that of the Entities. Over two thirds (69 percent) of the State budget in 2013 was spent paying the sala-
   ries for the functions assigned to the central government (e.g. civil servants, military). An additional
   fifth went on goods and services. Just 6 percent of State resources were invested.

     3.28	 Donor financing used for capital investment. Although, in total, capital expenditures
           averaged 6.3 percent of GDP between 2011 and 2013, between one half and two thirds
           were financed by donors. Large investment projects such as the Vc motorway58, connecting
           the north and south of the country, for example, are donor financed.

     Public debt
     3.29	 Public debt is low and consists largely of concessional debt to International Financial
           Institutions (IFIs) due to limited access to international financial markets.59 Public debt
           fell from 32 percent of GDP in 2002 to 19 percent in 2007, thanks to low fiscal deficits.
           However, BiH public debt has almost tripled since, reaching 47 percent in 2013. This reflects
           a counter-cyclical fiscal policy, which was able to boost public expenditure during the crisis,
           and remains at limits considered to be sustainable, according to the IMF Debt Sustainability
           Analysis (DSA) conducted in 2014.60 The majority of public debt is either external debt
           contracted at the State level and on-lent to the two Entities (66 percent of total public
           debt) or domestic debt (31 percent of total public debt) issued directly by the Entities. The
           remaining debt represents small amounts of external borrowing undertaken directly by the
           Entities, external State debt on-lent to the Brcko District, and external State debt allocated
           to the State level. The largest share of the public external debt (23 percent at the end of
           Q2 2014) is to the International Development Association (IDA) acquired during the post-
           conflict reconstruction phase (1996-2002). The remainder of the external debt is to other
           IFIs as BiH has not had access to international capital markets until recently. The degree
           of risk in the external debt portfolio is relatively low because of its currency composition
           (largely linked to the EUR, with which BiH has a currency board) and the main lenders (IFIs).

     3.30	 Debt growth is contained by law. Debt laws61 set statutory ceilings on government debt
           which is considered a key measure to maintain fiscal discipline. The laws stipulate that new
           loans can be contracted only insofar as debt service on long-term loans does not exceed 18
           percent of fiscal revenues at the respective level of government in the previous fiscal year
           and that guarantees may not exceed 30 percent of revenues.  Repayments on short-term
           debt cannot exceed 5 percent of revenues in the Entities. The Entity laws set such limits to
           municipal borrowing as well. A new RS Debt Law sets the public debt limit at 55 percent of
           GDP and short term debt cannot exceed 8 percent of regular revenues in previous fiscal year.

          Due to the limited development of local financial markets, governments in BiH did not issue domestic securities until 2011, when the first Treasury
          bills were issued. The primary debt markets improved between 2011 and 2014 helping additional domestic debt issuances. For example in the first
          half of September 2014, there were three auctions on BiH stock exchange (bond and T-bill auctions on Sarajevo Stock exchange-SASE and a T-bill
          auction on Banja Luka Stock Exchange-BLSE). At the end of September 2014, SASE held the 22nd auction for FBiH domestic debt, while in BLSE the sixth
          auction of RS bonds were held. The secondary market for government securities is virtually non-existent, with exception of war claim bonds.

3. Restoring growth and creating jobs



3.31	 While the levels of total public debt in BiH are considered sustainable, there are a number
      of causes for concern. Notably:

            •	 The external debt portfolio has been growing at a unsustainably rapid rate, which is an
               indicator and potential driver of distress despite the existence of debt laws;
            •	 The ratio of debt/GDP in the RS is significantly higher than for either the State or the
               FBiH. The rate of growth in the stock of debt in the RS will need to slow down if the debt
               position is to remain sustainable;
            •	 The fast increase in debt service costs in recent years means BiH could get caught in a
               vicious debt cycle if care is not taken to contain debt stocks and extend maturities;
            •	 The lack of comprehensive statistics on private external debt is a concern; and
            •	 The lack of knowledge of local government and SOE debt or liabilities is a concern.

	            The lack of common ground on borrowing strategies between the Entities may result in worse
             terms. 62 Taken together these issues could lead to an increasing debt service burden putting
             additional pressure on public finances. If these are not addressed borrowing costs could
             rise, putting the sustainability of public debt in jeopardy, and squeezing out expenditure on
             other important areas for boosting growth and shared prosperity.

3.32	 Although BiH has mostly contained deficits, fiscal risks remain significant, including from
      economic shocks, natural disasters, and SOE-related liabilities. It has been difficult to
      quantify the potential liabilities that may result from SOEs but they appear to be significant.
      Many SOEs do not operate, or operate only on life support with fiscal transfers. Many SOEs
      continue to employ people, building up arrears, including to the social welfare system.
      Privatizing companies with arrears is difficult. Risks also arise from natural disasters such
      as floods, droughts, which have been shown to have a significant impact on economic
      growth, and therefore hit revenues. Economic shocks hit revenues and increase demand
      for social welfare. Building fiscal buffers to cushion against these shocks would help to
      reduce fiscal risks.




62
    	   There is fragmentation of almost all technical aspects of domestic securities borrowing between RS and FBiH that inhibits the pooling of resources for
        developing market infrastructure. Bosnia and Herzegovinian law allows internal and external debt to be created by the State, either Entity or Brcko
        District. The State is responsible for making payments on external debt, financed by ‘skimming off’ the required repayments from the (nationally
        implemented) VAT collection before distributing the revenue to governments. The State has been allowed to borrow domestically since 2005 but has
        yet to do so, with all domestic borrowing being conducted by the Entities. The market is also fragmented between the FBiH and RS not only in terms
        of volumes but also in relation to different infrastructure, issuing mechanisms, settlements and trading. Each Entity has a separate stock exchange,
        securities register, Securities Exchange Commissions and Regulatory bodies.

     3.3	 Financial sector development and inclusion
     3.33	 The financial sector is heavily bank-dominated and moderately concentrated. There are
           27 banks operating in total in BiH, of which 17 are in FBiH and 10 in RS accounting for 87.1
           percent of financial system assets (Annex IX), which were equivalent to 84 percent of GDP
           as of end-2013. The banking system comprises mostly foreign subsidiaries—91 percent of
           the banking sector assets, while domestically-owned and state-owned banks account for 7
           and 2 percent, respectively. There are 17 banks in FBiH and 10 in RS, with a share of 70 and
           30 percent of the banking system respectively. The five largest banks represented about half
           of banking sector assets in 2013. As a result of the slowdown in foreign funding, banks have
           become more reliant on domestic resources through private and public deposits. From the
           pre-crisis peak (Q1, 2009) to the first quarter of this year, the decline in cross-border funding
           has been equivalent to $2.7 billion or 16 percent of BiH’s GDP. In contrast, domestic deposit
           mobilization has increased by 8 percent in the same period, reaching 50 percent of GDP.

     3.34	 The banking sector in BiH overall remains reasonably liquid and well-capitalized, though
           growing NPLs and the resulting provisioning may erode some banks’ capital buffers in
           the future. Capital adequacy of the system reached 17.3 percent as of March 2014, which
           overall should be sufficient to absorb risks in the system. However, there are pockets of
           vulnerability with certain banks close to minimum standards. In addition, growing NPLs
           and the resulting provisioning pose risks for banks’ assets quality in the future. Slow credit
           growth, at an average of 4 percent per year since 2010, reflects in part sluggish domestic
           demand (Figure 3.14). The earlier impacts of excessive lending practices, fueled by an inflow
           of foreign capital and poor credit underwriting before the crisis, have become apparent in
           the sharply rising volume of bad loans burdening banks’ balance sheets, undermining profits
           and capital and suppressing banks’ interest in new lending. The total NPL ratio posted a
           record level of 15.1 percent as of year-end 2013 (compared to 5.9 percent in 2009) with
           corporate loans being more problematic than consumer loans (Figure 3.15). Importantly,
           while banks’ provisions for possible loan losses are relatively high at about 80 percent of
           NPLs, the level of “watch” loans, which exhibit clear weaknesses (but have not yet reached
           NPL status) are about an additional 10 percent of total loans, posing significant further risks
           to the financial system. Further negative impacts arose from the flooding in 2014, which has
           inflicted severe damage across portions of BiH - with a major impact on business, housing
           and infrastructure in affected areas.

     3.35	 Financial sector development and access to finance for firms is constrained by weak
           domestic demand, high collateral requirements and inadequate credit enforcement
           mechanisms. Credit to the non-financial private sector expanded by only 0.9 percent year-
           on-year in the first nine months of 2014, and by 1.1 percent in 2013. A significant portion
           of the loans were used to finance working capital rather than investments, mostly due to
           unfavorable growth prospects. Collateral requirements are high, with collateral-to-loan
           values at 216 percent for small firms63 in BiH and execution of collateral warranties is lengthy,
           taking three to seven years, hampered by inefficient judicial processes. Overall, firms in BiH
           identify access to finance as the second major constraint after political instability in the
           Enterprise Survey 2013.

3. Restoring growth and creating jobs



3.36	 The non-banking financial system is small, boding poorly for insuring weather shocks,
      including the impacts on agriculture. The non-banking financial system is distributed
      among 25 insurance companies (5 percent of financial system assets), 8 leasing companies
      (2 percent), 34 investment funds, and 19 micro-credit organizations (MCOs) (3 percent each)
      and 1 factoring company as of end of 2013. The agricultural sector, in particular, suffered
      during the 2012 droughts and 2014 floods and may be under-insured. This bodes poorly for
      reducing the risks faced by many of the B40, who often work in agriculture.

3.37	 Bankruptcy laws are reasonable, but implementation is weak. While bankruptcy legislation
      appears to be sufficient, with a decent Doing Business rank, there are questions as to its
      enforcement, notably vis-à-vis SOEs. Recent Central Bank data64 reveal that there are some
      45,000 companies with at least one bank account blocked, which makes them candidates
      for bankruptcy. However, there is only a handful of reorganizations/bankruptcy procedures
      initiated. Many of these companies are state owned or were candidates for privatization. A
      recent Insolvency and Credit Rights ROSC (that the WB conducted in parallel with the FSAP)
      revealed that the legal framework governing creditor/debtor relationships is comprehensive,
      however neither debt resolution, businesses reorganization or bankruptcy liquidation
      work effectively. There is a need to streamline execution procedures, introduce tools and
      incentives to facilitate corporate debt restructurings and resolution, and adopt out-of-court
      restructuring guidelines. The institutional framework could be further improved through
      hiring more commercial court judges with appropriate experience and improving the
      regulation of the insolvency profession.

3.38	 Among households, the overall access to financial services is relatively strong in BiH
      compared to peers, but more constrained among some population groups, including the
      poor, the B40, and women. A total of 56.2 percent of adults in BiH have an account at
      a formal financial institution (Annex IX) and 31.9 percent of these account holders use it

                    respectively. Lending services have a high outreach compared to regional peers, while the
                    usage of saving services are low with only 13.5 percent of adults reporting saving any money
                    in the past year compared to the regional average of 20.4 percent. In particular, for the
                    B40 percent, the ratio of adults reporting saving any money in the past year is even lower
                    at 9.8 percent.66 Moreover, BiH is facing one of the largest gender gaps in the region, with
                    the difference between male and female account holders at a formal financial institution
                    amounting to 19.5 percentage points.67 The World Bank 2011 Financial Literacy Survey
                    suggests a low financial literacy in the BiH private sector.

     3.4	 Private sector development
     3.39	 The private sector contributes significant investment resources, including through FDI.
           Between 2006 and 2013, the private sector has contributed around 80 percent of total
           investment (see Annex VII) out of a total of around €5.6 billion. Austria was the largest
           foreign investor in BiH between 1994 and 2013, accounting for almost a quarter of all FDI
           received. Austria is followed by Serbia (18 percent) and Croatia (13 percent) (Figure 3.16).
           The overwhelming majority of foreign investors in BiH are European. The biggest share of FDI
           went to the manufacturing industry (31 percent) in such sectors as fuel, food and beverage,
           mineral and chemical products; followed by banking and telecommunication 22 percent and
           15 percent, respectively (Figure 3.17).

              Usage statistics show that this gap arises mostly from the fact that women are using their accounts much less than men for receiving wages and
              government payments. This is an expected result, as according to the International Labor Organization (ILO) statistics, the female labor force
              participation is very low at 34.1 percent in BiH in 2012.

3. Restoring growth and creating jobs



3.40	 The private sector’s overall performance is likely stifled by the public sector. Although
      public sector expenditures is close to 50 percent of GDP, the percentage is likely even higher,
      when SOEs are taken into account. It is difficult to obtain accurate information on SOEs but
      some official information suggests that among the companies that were public during the
      Yugoslav period, some 70 percent of large ones and 40 percent of small ones are still public.68
      Some are loss-making, requiring subsidies, while some reportedly no longer function but
      maintain workers. This diverts resources away from the productive private sector, including
      labor (some are employed without needing to work, preventing them from seeking other
      employment), land (under- and even un-used land remains in the hands of non-functioning
      SOEs), and capital (buildings, for example, could be re-purposed or sold).

3.41	 Firms do not always achieve the employment and sales growth expected (Annex VII).
      BEEPS data suggest that in most ECA countries smaller firms (in terms of employment) tend
      to grow faster than larger ones. However, in BiH this does not seem to be the case, which
      reflects low private sector dynamism and prevent small firms in a variety of sector from
      growing. In addition, even though younger firms in BiH increase employment faster than
      older ones, it is not clear whether they are able to increase sales faster than their older
      competitors, unlike in the rest of ECA. Interestingly, being in a large city in BiH seems to be a
      constraint to sales growth among BiH firms, unlike in the rest of ECA.

Poor business environment and regulation
3.42	 The Foreign Investors Council notes that BiH could be a very competitive country thanks to
      “its geographical position, natural resources, traditions and untapped potential in the fields
      of construction, energy, agriculture, timber industry and industry in general”. Unfortunately,
      its poor business climate may mean that the country performs well below its potential.

3.43	 BiH’s business environment is the worst in SEE and needs major work if BiH is to boost
      private investment and improve competitiveness. The poor business climate forces
      entrepreneurs to face burdensome institutional and regulatory barriers. BiH was ranked
      107th out of 189 countries globally in the 2015 Doing Business (DB) survey (Figure 3.18). BiH
      performs worse than any other country in SEE and among former Yugoslav republics. BiH’s
      distance to frontier score of 60.6 was the worst in the SEE7 region in 2015, compared to 74.1
      for the region’s best performer, FYR Macedonia, even though there has been some recent
      progress (Figure 3.19).

3.44	 Entrepreneurs and SMEs in general face tough constraints. These include high social
      contributions, fiscal and para-fiscal fees, a lack of access to export markets, and a non-
      harmonized regulatory environment. A number of public sector and donor-led support
      programs have provided support to SMEs to strengthen their business, marketing and
      financial management skills but so far, with limited impact on employment.

     “Large” and “small” are not defined and how the estimation is done is unclear. Nonetheless, this is indicative of a lack of progress in privatization. See:

     3.45	 BiH performs particularly poorly in indicators related to starting a new business and
           paying taxes. The 2015 Doing Business report ranked BiH among the worst countries in the
           world for: 1) Dealing with construction permits (182nd); 2) Getting electricity (163rd); 3)
           Starting a business (147th); and 4) Paying taxes (151st) (Figure 3.21). These are particularly
           unfortunate areas to perform badly in as the first three indicate that starting a new
           business poses significant challenges. Making it difficult for firms to pay taxes forces firms
           to spend significant amounts of time paying them rather than finding ways to improve
           their business and can encourage tax evasion. At 407 hours per year, firms in BiH devote
           more time to paying taxes than in any other SEE country (Figure 3.20)—a heavy burden on
           SMEs in particular.

3.46	 Challenges also remain with respect to real property rights. BiH ranks 88th in the world in
      the 2015 Doing Business report. The costs of property registration amount to 5.2 percent of
      the property value on average, compared to 2.5 percent for ECA as a whole. According to the
      2011 Doing Business regional report, it takes more than 100 days to register a real property
      in Banja Luka and Mortar, while the same operation takes on average 23 days in the 22
      cities ranked. There have been significant improvements in the land administration sector
      but the accuracy of the cadaster and land records need to be improved. Many subdivisions
      have not been recorded and numerous real properties are registered under the name of
      their previous owners, including the state and deceased individuals. BiH has embarked in
      an ambitious harmonization program whereby cadaster and land registry records are being
      updated and integrated. However, it will take several years to cover the country while BiH
      needs to sustain its efforts to further streamline and automate land administration services.

3.47	 There have been a number of improvements in the business climate, but private sector
      operations remain difficult across the country. Several examples include: the introduction
      of a One-Stop-Shop for opening businesses, which reduced the time and cost of opening a
      limited liability company (from 23 days and €750 to 3 days and €100) in RS; simplification of
      obtaining construction permits in RS; a new Inspections Law, which removed some obstacles
      to exports to the EU in FBiH; and a new business registration law that simplified the business
      registration process in FBiH. While there are differences between the two Entities and
      the Doing Business indicators only capture imperfectly the business environment, other
      evidence also points toward a problematic business environment. For example, there are
      355 business related licenses, permits, approvals and consents required for businesses in
      FBiH, and 319 in RS, as well as an additional 102 at the level of the Institutions of BiH.
      Cantons (in FBiH) and municipalities add a further 161 and 94 respectively.69 A firm wishing
      to operate across the whole of BiH faces over a thousand potential licenses, approvals and
      consents, many of them duplicated.

3.48	 Institutional and governance barriers represent a critical obstacle to business
      development. Although corporate income taxes are harmonized, each Entity has its
      own business registration requirements and each governmental level has the power to
      establish business laws and regulations. Within FBiH, each of the ten cantons has different
      business regulations and administrative procedures. Simplifying and harmonizing these
      regulations and procedures will be key to improving the overall investment climate and
      help fight corruption.70

3.49	 All BiH governments have implemented accounting practices in line with international
      norms but implementation is weak. The government has also failed to translate the
      international standards into local language so that firms can properly implement the
      standards. In addition, “legislative officials have been criticized for attempts to change
      these standards in an effort to protect local accounting firms. Foreign investors should

              therefore carefully scrutinize BiH corporate financial statements.”71 The corporate financial
              reporting framework needs to be better harmonized. Specifically, the two Entities should
              create a coordination mechanism for the parallel alignment of their laws and regulations
              with the relevant provisions of the EU acquis. Both Entities also need to better coordinate
              with respect to accounting and auditing reforms.72

     3.50	 Agriculture, small and large scale, suffers from various aspects of the poor business
           environment. For all farms, but especially for small farms the cost and pressures involved
           in moving into the formal sector and complying with the legal framework are high. With
           the creation of a farm register that requires extensive reporting of production and assets
           to access government support, the application of phyto-sanitary rules for any plant based
           production, more regulated livestock production due to the animal identification and
           registration system, as well as food safety requirements makes the cost of compliance
           increasingly high. This pushes the least productive farms slowly out of business.  Partly as
           a result, according to FAOSTAT, in 2011 imports of foodstuffs were about four times the
           amount exported. While this represents an improvement since 2001 (when the ratio was
           15:1) this is largely despite of rather than because of regulations.

     3.51	 Stronger codes of corporate governance could help to attract investment. In addition to
           governance issues in SOEs, which are prevalent in BiH as in many other countries, private
           firms are also sometimes characterized by low levels of transparency. Many of them are not
           prepared to transition from family business stage to a corporate stage which limits their
           growth prospects and make them less attractive for FDIs. Managers of enterprises are often
           not accountable for their performance, key information for many companies is not available,
           the duties of the boards are not always clear.

     3.52	 Multivariate analysis helps identify constraints faced by firms, based on self-reporting
           (Annex VII). Key findings are:

              •	 Larger firms are more likely to report that skills are more of a constraint than smaller
                 ones, after controlling for other firm characteristics.
              •	 Being in a large city is linked to reporting that political instability and corruption are
                 greater constraints than otherwise.
              •	 The practices of the informal sector are also more challenging in cities.
              •	 Corruption appears to be closely linked to the construction sector.
              •	 Construction and wholesale/retail companies are less likely to report access to finance as
                 a constraint than other sectors.
              •	 Labor regulations are particularly likely to be cited by wholesale/retail firms as a constraint.

     3.53	 Interestingly, only a few constraints appear to impact on firm performance. For example,
           after controlling for other firm characteristics, corruption and political instability do not appear
           to negatively impact sales or employment growth, despite the fact that when firms were
           questioned about the single most important constraints, political instability was ranked first and

          corruption the fourth. The reason for these results are unclear but there are several potential
          explanations. It is possible that constraints affect most firms in a similar way, holding back growth
          en masse rather than only for those firms that most feel them. Alternatively, since firm surveys
          target only successful firms, it could be that the constraints prevent new firms from starting up
          and growing and actually protect some existing firms from competitors. Corruption is pervasive
          throughout all areas of society (see Box 1.1).

3.54	 Two constraints stand out as significant. Access to finance is negatively associated with
      employment growth in BiH and ECA in general. Transport, despite being ranked as one of the
      least important constraints, does appear to have a negative impact on employment growth.

The need for dynamic exports
3.55	 BiH could have higher and more sustainable growth by focusing more on producing goods
      and services for export.73 Exporting firms in BiH tend to employ more people (both skilled
      and unskilled), pay higher wages, and have a higher “skill intensity”. In addition, BiH exports
      embody more value-added and physical capital content than other emerging economies in
      Eastern Europe.

3.56	 Reasonable export growth during the 2000s but the crisis hit exporting firms. Exports of
      goods and services grew from around 29 percent of GDP in 2000 to 36 percent by 2006. In
      USD terms74, export growth was among the fastest in the region between 2004 and 2008
      (Figure 3.22). However, export growth

     The “sophistication” and destination markets for BiH matter for its future development path. Empirical studies show that what a country exports
     and where it exports affect the level and composition of labor demand in the exporting country and its economic growth performance. The structure
     of a country’s exports - that is, what types of products it exports, in which sectors and with what levels of value-added - affects the types of labor
     needed to produce these exports. In addition, the export structure tends to vary by destination market. Exporting to high-income countries, where
     consumers have a relatively high preference for quality, stimulates the production of high quality goods, and increases the demand for skilled labor
     (Brambilla et al. 2012). Hausmann, Hwang and Rodrik (2007) provide evidence that the types of products countries export matters for economic
     growth. Verhoogen (2008) shows that more productive plants produce and export higher-quality goods than less productive plants, and they pay
     higher wages to maintain a higher-quality workforce.

           supply chains. This is notably the case for
           the cars and footwear industries, as well as for furniture products reflecting an abundance
           of wood, much of which is Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)77 certified. This reflects the
           country’s status as having Europe’s largest forested area, and the potential of the forestry
           sector to contribute strongly to export through wood in its raw or processed form, or
           through tourism activities such as people visiting parks. Forestry can generate employment,
           benefiting both rural dwellers—many of whom may be self-employed in agriculture—and
           the B40. However, management of SOEs in the forestry sector is constrained by a policy
           of maintaining short-term employment using labor-intensive processes; production is
           expanding moderately but at sub-optimal levels due to capital constraints and inadequate
           common infrastructure (primarily roads and bridges).

      sluggish demand. BiH’s exporters have
      gained market share in its main trading Source: Staff calculations based on UN Comtrade
      partners with the exception of Switzerland. However, since 2004, the number of different
      products exported has increased only slightly from 1044 to 1081 (see Annex V).

3.60	 Exports are dominated by furniture, fabricated metal and wood products and garment
      manufacture. For example, 87 percent of furniture producers in BiH export, and on
      average these exports account for 40 percent of their total sales. Production of exporting
      textile and garment producers almost entirely targets export markets. Two-thirds of
      those textile producers that do not export directly supply local producers, including
      garment exporters.

3.61	 The export orientation of sectors reveals elements of the country’s revealed comparative
      advantage, many of which may support employment among the poor and B40, particularly
      in rural areas (see Annex V). BiH’s most significant comparative advantage in 2013 can
      be found in footwear exports (a third of which are directed to Italy). BiH’s comparative
      advantage in footwear increased between 2002/03 at an annual average rate of around
      20 percent. Metals, wood and wood products also showed high and dynamic revealed
      comparative advantage. BiH also has a small revealed comparative advantage in foodstuffs,
      including agricultural products (see Box 3.2). Taking advantage of comparative advantage
      in agriculture could help to support the B40, many of whom work in agriculture, and rural
      areas, where rates of poverty are higher.

3.62	 Exporting firms are significant employment generators. As in much of the world, in BiH
      exporting firms are larger than non-exporters in the manufacturing sector, and employ
      both more skilled workers and more unskilled workers (based on number full-time
      employees) (Table 3.7).

3.63	 Both exporting and non-exporting firms in BiH increased their relative skill intensity since
      2002 however, exporting firms did so by more. Non-exporting firms in BiH employed a
      slightly higher proportion of skilled workers compared to non-exporting firms in 2012.
      However, the gap between exporters and non-exporters narrowed over the period.

     3.64	 The higher skill intensity of exporters is reflected in wages with exporters paying higher
           wages. Median manufacturing wages are significantly higher than ECA averages, although
           these summary statistics mask important inter-industry differences. For example, textile
           sector workers in BiH earn less than half the median ECA wage for textile workers. However,
           in BiH, textile production is less skill-intensive than in most ECA countries78 , despite the fact
           that some textiles products are among the top 10 exports for BiH.

     3.65	 High wages among exporting firms offer both an opportunity and a risk. Boosting export-
           orientated industries may eventually help to generate better-paid employment. However,
           high wages may also make it more difficult for exporting firms to compete, harming
           employment and growth. It is interesting to note that there are some sectors in which non-
           exporters pay higher wages than exporters (furniture, publishing and other manufacturing),
           perhaps because they can remain competitive at home even with high wages.

     3.66	 But even though exporting firms are larger on average than non-exporters they do not
           appear to grow faster after taking into consideration firm characteristics. In ECA (and the
           world in general), exporting firms grow faster in terms of employment and sales than their
           non-exporting counterparts, even after controlling for sector and other firm characteristics
           (see Annex VII). However, in BiH after controlling for other firm characteristics, exporting
           firms do not appear to perform better than other firms.

     3.67	 Services exports grew in line with comparator countries during the 2000s but have shown
           significant weakness since the crisis. Prior to the crisis, services export growth was strong
           and at levels comparable with peer countries (See Annex V). Between 2000 and 2007, BiH
           achieved an annual services export growth rate of nearly 20 percent, above that of Georgia,
           Hungary or FYR Macedonia. Services export levels in 2007 were more than three times
           those in 2000, driven largely by travel, construction, and transport services. While all peer
           countries’ performance dropped between 2008 and 2013 with the exception of Georgia,
           BiH has become the weakest performer of its peer countries, averaging a 6 percent annual

      Box 3.2: Agricultural potential for jobs, growth and exports

      BiH remains a fairly rural country with 60 percent of its population living in rural areas. While topo-
      graphic limitations restrict farmers to certain crops/livestock options, the agricultural sector79 still plays
      a key role in poverty reduction and shared prosperity80, employing 19.2 percent of the total labor force
      in BiH (including both formal and informal, including own-consumption). For 61 percent of these 19.2
      percent it is the primary occupation. However, agriculture’s contribution to GDP has declined from
      around 15 percent in 2001 to 7 percent in 2013. Over the past few years, the country has been con-
      fronted with a series of extreme floods, long periods of extreme heat, combined with highly variable
      winter weather which have negatively affected the sector. In BiH agriculture can be classified as (i)
      farming that complements other household income; (ii) commercial family farms or (iii) larger com-
      mercial operations (of which there are only a few). There are an estimated 600,000 holdings in BiH, but
      due to minimum thresholds to qualify as a farm, only about 15—20 percent of the holdings are formal-
      ly registered and apply for support with their respective Ministries of Agriculture, however commodity
      price support reaches all producers. Smaller farmers in mountainous regions often receive a subsidy
      through milk price support. The overall agricultural expenditures—including subsidies - of 2-3 percent
      of GDP amounts to only about half of what the other countries in the region spend on the sector.

      Agricultural productivity and trade

      In spite of challenges, the agricultural sector is not without some dynamism and potential. While the
      overall contribution to GDP has consistently dropped over the past decade and a half, local production
      has gradually gained domestic market share. In 2001, the value of foodstuff imports were 15 times
      the level of exports, in 2012 they were down to about four times that ratio.81 During the same period,
      agricultural value added per worker more than doubled.82 In 2012, a detailed competitiveness assess-
      ment of the agribusiness sector revealed medium-term competitive advantage (compared to EU-27)
      of fruits, vegetables and dairy. BiH had revealed comparative advantage (RCA)83 for food products of
      1.19 (share in exports 3.8 percent), and products of animal origin 1.02 (share of exports 1.65 percent).
      BiH is a significant global producer of blueberries (10th position globally), plums and strawberries (35th).

      While agriculture does show some vulnerability to extreme weather events and climate change, it is
      relatively insulated from downturns faced by the rest of the economy. For instance during 2012-13, the
      agribusiness sector recorded average annual growth in production of about 9.5 percent, while overall
      industrial production grew only 6.7 percent. In 2013, agriculture trade amounted to 2.4 percent of to-
      tal exports and 4.4 percent of total imports. Yet BiH imports nearly two thirds of the food it consumes,
      mainly processed foods, while it exports lower value food commodities. This leaves significant room
      for increased production and growth in domestic market share for fresh and processed food products.
      To increase exports of agricultural products, BiH would need to fully adopt EU food security and phy-
      tosanitary measures.

79	
    National accounts tables classify agribusiness as manufacturing.
80
  	 Agricultural production in BiH comprises a variety of grain crops, horticulture, orchard and field fruit, and niche products (spices, herbs, and
    mushrooms, berries) and some industrial crops. Livestock products dominate the overall picture with milk being the most traded commodity. The
    diversity in production is largely due to topography and land use with over 40 percent of the country covered in forest, 25 percent as pasture land,
    and only 20 percent of the overall area as arable land of which only about 5 percent is in flat plains. The variety is also due to the farm structure with
    little specialized production and most family farms producing a bit of everything with only the most entrepreneurial farmers trying to focus their
    operations. While the arable land area is relatively small, good soils and favorable climate conditions with long growing seasons provide a good basis
    for production increases.

          Potential for growth and employment creation

          The sector is important in providing social stability to a large segment of BiH’s population, and in particu-
          lar the poor and B40, and will continue to play a significant role in economic growth and job creation. Al-
          ready, some of its most productive value chains are relatively labor intensive and provide significant sea-
          sonal employment. With more investments, the competitiveness of already productive families could
          be enhanced, especially in dairy sector and horticulture, while smaller holdings would need investments
          that require limited land such as greenhouse production, specialty production, or intensive livestock, all
          of which are relatively capital intensive, but necessary to make a livelihood from farming.

     3.68	 Services exports represent an important part of the country’s international trade and
           BiH’s service exports are above that expected given its level of development supporting
           employment and the B40. According to balance of payments data, services exports from
           BiH in 2012 represented nearly 40 percent of total exports (goods represented 60 percent).
           Services exports thus represent an important source of export diversification for the
           country. BiH per capita services exports are slightly above other countries of similar income
           level. Tourism offers one service export that may have potential to expand, and to employ
           significant numbers of people, including in the B40. It may be complementary with some
           goods exports including agricultural and viticulture (and notably wine). BiH’s per capita
           exports of services are high for the country’s stage of development (See Annex V).

     3.5	 Forests: An under-utilized asset 84
     3.69	 Forests in BiH are underexploited. Forest management throughout the world has been a
           challenge to governments as they weigh the needs of economic development that involve
           generating revenue from forest assets, against the complementary needs of conservation
           that recognize the important ecosystem services that forests provide. Standing forests
           contribute to erosion and flood control, harbor globally important biodiversity, store
           carbon, and perform a host of other ecosystem services on which people depend. This
           “development vs conservation” issue does not, however, exist in BiH. The forests are
           among the most pristine in Europe: historical labor-intensive logging practices have hardly
           made a dent in the 3.2 million hectares (ha) of forest and forest land. The 2.2 million ha
           of forest designated as “economically exploitable” (of which 0.7  million ha are privately
           owned) remain largely intact. Conservation and recreation interests are largely fulfilled in
           0.6 million ha of designated protected area. As a consequence, the asset is underperforming
           from an economic perspective. The FAO (2015)85 notes: “Forests in BiH are under-used” in
           comparison to the annual allowable cut in both private and public forests. This means there
           is potential for wood mobilization in some areas, especially in those areas that are currently
           not productive or are inaccessible.” Management techniques are also ripe for modernization
           in a manner that supports economic and conservation interests. The FAO (2015) observes

          “…the high amount of coppice forests requires dedicated objectives. Coppice forests are a
          potential treasure trove of biodiversity, but also have potential as a biomass source. Specific
          programs to reach private forest owners (the main holders of coppice forests) are needed.”
          Private owners are most likely to exploit these forests for economic benefit.

3.70	 Forests perform an important social function by providing employment relevant to the B40.
      Socially relevant forestry and employment of disadvantaged groups (war survivors, disabled,
      widows) has been an explicit policy objective of the SOEs responsible for forestry on public
      lands. Expansion of production could potentially enhance this role, without necessarily
      threatening the overall rents derived from the forest estate.86 Current employment in the
      sector is approximately 20,000, with recent rates of increase of the order of 6 percent per
      annum. Forestry sector gross value added (GVA) increased by around 50 percent in a decade.

3.71	 Forestry Stewardship Council (FSC) Certification has in-built mechanisms to ensure
      responsible management, transparency and financial sustainability. In early 2015,
      1.65  million ha of the BiH 2.2  million ha of forests were certified for export under the
      FSC scheme. This has permitted increased exports, most notably within Europe, while
      also ensuring that environmental constraints are respected through best silvicultural
      practice and replanting. Notably, the FSC standards also mandate financial sustainability
      and sound use of financial resources under a responsible management regime with clear
      accountability criteria.

3.72	 Forest access is consistently cited as a key constraint to expansion. Although transport to
      market for all products (including forestry) is constrained by the general state of road and
      infrastructure in BiH, forest product transport is further hindered by the very low density of
      forest roads within the forest estate. The BiH road density within the forest estate is extremely
      low (around 7km/1000 ha) in comparison to forests in Western European countries (around
      30km/1000 ha). These roads are important for ongoing thinning and production purposes,
      for reinvestment (planting and restoration), and for routine monitoring and management
      (notably fire management).

3.73	 Absence of a Forest Law has hindered full realization of the sector’s potential. The
      general business environment and infrastructure constraints pervasive in BiH are described
      elsewhere in this SCD. In addition, other policy-level constraints have been identified that
      prevent the sector from moving forward. Chief among these is the lack of a Forest Law. Such
      a law is necessary for equitable revenue sharing, decentralized management, and improved
      accountability. The lack of a Forest Law also makes tenure less clear and prevents access to
      financial markets for debt financing of operations.

     3.6	 Infrastructure services
     3.74	 Physical infrastructure is essential for economic growth—providing businesses with the
           services they need to increase output and employment—and may have beneficial impacts
           on inequality. Global evidence suggests that investment in infrastructure, including transport
           and communications, can help to increase worker productivity and boost economic growth
           (Calderón and Servén, 2014, WP7034). There is some evidence that, if done properly,
           infrastructure investment may also benefit the poor, in particular through, for example,
           increased access to economic opportunities. Infrastructure investment may also have larger
           multiplier effects, making such investment projects a particularly good tool during economic
           downturns (IMF, 2014).87

     3.75	 Donor resources are important for infrastructure. Each year between 2011 and 2013,
           between a half and two- thirds of all capital investment is estimated to have been financed
           by donors. Despite that, BiH has some of the worst infrastructure in SEE.

     3.76	 BiH’s investment rate remains the lowest one in the SEE region and has fallen behind
           average rates of EU17 and EU-CEE (Figure 3.25). BiH’s low investment rate is partly the inverse
           of high consumption and insufficient savings. Since increases in the capital stock are a major
           factor in explaining growth in industrialized
           countries, BiH’s current consumption- Figure 3.25: BiH: Low capital stock due to low investments

     3.77	 There is little private sector involvement in public infrastructure. Currently, there is a lack
           of prioritized investment plans in many ministries infrastructure projects, making it unclear
           where the private sector could invest and charge user-fees. The use of PPPs is limited.
           Despite a reasonable regulatory framework88 there remain a number of issues including

          The EBRD rates the quality of PPP and concession laws of BiH “in medium compliance with the international best practices (66.2 percent compliance),
          while their implementation is ranked as “medium effective”. The existing regulatory framework is a good starting point to demonstrate government’s
          intent to create a reliable legal basis for concessions and PPPs which would attract FDIs. It allows for a wide range of schemes and provides adequate
          provisions for dispute resolution. However, complex and inconsistent legal framework, as well as weak implementation capacity of the civil service
          underline weaknesses of the current framework regulating PPPs and concessions (Commercial laws of Bosnia and Herzegovina, An assessment by the
          EBRD, August 2014).

          public sector to implement PPPs, and inconsistencies between the laws of the different
          levels of government.90

Connecting to the world: Upgrading transport and ICT services
3.78	 If BiH is to take advantage of its geographical situation next to the world’s largest market
      by increasing exports and export-related employment, it will need to improve its transport
      and trade infrastructure. Improvements in transport, whether this be related to new
      investment, better (and cheaper) maintenance or enhanced coordination within BiH and
      between BiH and other countries, would reduce trade and logistics costs, helping firms to
      compete in international markets. This could have benefits for employment and wages.

3.79	 Upgrading rural and regional transport infrastructure has been shown globally to have
      potential for alleviating poverty, boosting economic activity and reducing income inequality.
      Transport infrastructure implies greater access to goods and services for the population,
      greater mobility, and better access to employment and commercial opportunities.91 The
      poverty reduction impacts stem primarily from enhancements of the income of the poor
      both from farm and non-farm employment (Webb, 2013; Jacob and Minten, 2009 and
      Dercon et al., 2008) as well as access to social services and markets (Mu and Van de Walle,
      2007; Khandker et al., 2006). Improving the quality of a road reduces the time and costs
      associated with transportation. As a result, demand for transportation increases resulting
      in more trips along the improved road, as well as lower prices for transported goods. At the
      household level, real consumption increases as a result of both lower prices for consumer
      goods as well as increased earnings from employment and business opportunities due to
      the intervention. At the firm level, lower transportation costs mean increased real returns
      on investment, which in turn transforms into higher levels of investment. These help to
      increase economic growth and reduce poverty (NORC, 2013).

3.80	 Despite the importance of transport for market access for people and goods, BiH’s
      transport infrastructure is rated as the poorest among SEE, EU-CEE and EU17 countries
      by the World Economic Forum (WEF). In 2012-13, BiH scored 2.1 out of seven on the
      WEF’s Global Competitiveness Indicator (GCI) for quality of transport infrastructure index,
      lower than the SEE average of 2.8, the EU-CEE’s average of 3.6 or the EU17’s average of
      5.2 (Figure 3.26). The Logistics Performance Index similarly rates BiH as having below
      SEE-average infrastructure (2.55 out of 5 compared with a regional average of 2.65) and
      standards significantly below those of the EU-CEE or EU17 (Figure 3.27). Indeed, BiH has
      the worst score among comparator groups among the four modes of transport rated (roads,

     For example, the current Law on Concessions does not contain provisions regulating final negotiations, which undermines transparency, equal
     treatment and competition of the tendering process. The current framework also does not endow the contracting Entity with the authority to
     terminate negotiations with the selected bidder and start negotiations with the second best bidder.
 	
90
     For example, FBiH and local PPP/Concession laws are not harmonized with the relevant national, FBiH and local sectoral laws are inconsistent and
     overlapping. This is particularly relevant for the Concession Law, Roadways 5C Law and Public Procurement Law. While there are PPP laws in the Brcko
     District and RS, this law does not exist in FBiH and its current draft does not include provisions which would facilitate private sector participation.
     Moreover, FBiH’s concession law does not recognize availability payment structures, e.g. payment for performance made irrespective of demand.

     A small sample of studies show the following: proximity to a railway station in China resulted in higher GDP per capita for the residents in the area of
     influence; improvements in the access to all-weather local roads in Vietnam, Peru, Bangladesh, and Morocco have resulted in positive schooling and
     health outcomes for rural population groups; highway investments in India, Spain and the U.S. have helped to close the economic gap between the
     lagging regions and the more developed ones.

     3.81	 BiH performs poorly on many road transport indicators. The road density is the lowest
           in SEE, at 45 kilometers per 100 square kilometers of land area, compared with a regional
           average of 52 kilometers (Annex XIII). It is far behind the EU-CEE average of 116km. When
           considered on a per-person basis, BiH has fewer kilometers of road than any country in SEE
           except Kosovo (Annex XIII). BiH also uses its transport network less than many countries in
           the region, with each individual traveling an average of 543 km per year compared with a
           SEE average of 964 km and an EU-CEE average of over 4,500 km (Annex XIII). For each dollar
           of GDP, its goods are transported 0.14 ton-kilometers, below the SEE average of 0.18 and
           much lower than the EU-CEE average of 0.31. Goods in the EU17 meanwhile travel just 0.08
           ton-kilometers per dollar of GDP on average (Annex XIII).

           making it more difficult for firms to export.
           BiH has fewer than 140 kilometers of
           highways and a number of road bottlenecks
           have been identified (Figure 3.28). Although
           highway network development, especially
           the north-south Corridor Vc, is considered a
           national priority, considerable resources are
           still required for their realization, although
           efforts are underway on some sections.

3.83	 Railways are poorly maintained and not fully modernized. Traveling or transporting goods
      by rail is severely hampered by out of date rolling stock and railways, as well as by the fact
      that locomotives need to be changed as
      trains pass between the two Entities. As a Figure 3.29: BiH: Rail passenger traffic density is low

3.84	 BiH is dependent on ports located in Croatia, creating constraints in terms of accessing
      markets. The only international inland waterway, the Sava River, has suffered from lack
      of maintenance since the 1990s. Despite its potential in providing clean and efficient freight
      transport, the Sava River experiences very low levels of traffic reflecting poor navigability
      conditions. Safe and guaranteed navigation for commercial traffic requires de-mining and a
      major rehabilitation of the river.

3.85	 There is a lack of coordination among the different transport authorities. Despite two
      attempts, a national transport strategy does not yet exist. Such a strategy would help to
      identify the priorities across all modes of transport, determined by clear technical,
      economic and financial considerations. It would also enable the coordinated sequencing
      of interventions within the available funding constraints, and define necessary changes
      in legislation, regulation, organizations, and financing to implement the plans for the
      development of the sector, in a manner consistent with the development needs of BiH
      as a whole. This would help BiH to develop the strong transport system it needs to
      reduce the economic distance92 to markets by expanding opportunities for trade, by
      improving the competitiveness of national locations for production and distribution,
      and by facilitating mobility.

     This measure reflects all the necessary and unnecessary transportation and clearance expenditures. Thus, a reduction in economic distance can be
     realized not only from improved physical infrastructure, where justified by economic criteria—a necessary condition for economic development—but
     also from improvements in the institutional framework (harmonized and simplified policies and regulations which offer significant unrealized gains in
     some of the countries at present), better cost recovery and improved maintenance, simplified transit procedures, improved provision of information,
     and the reduction of unofficial payments or corruption, across the whole region. World Bank (2004).

     3.86	 Penetration of fixed broadband internet access has grown in line with regional comparators
           over recent years. Fixed broadband penetration on a household level stood at 47.9 percent
           in 2013, compared with a regional average of 47.2 percent with only FYR Macedonia and
           Kosovo achieving higher rates (Figure 3.30). The growth of new subscribers slowed from
           around 65.5 percent in 2010 to 10.6 percent in 2013, indicating that most of the urban
           areas are covered while expansion to less profitable areas is constrained, though some
           solutions may exist such as “bidding out” least-cost subsidized services for rural areas. BiH
           has good potential to achieve better results using existing fixed telephony lines. This existing
           infrastructure (if well maintained) could be used for provision of the fixed broadband
           Internet access services via DSL93 technology. BiH has the lowest level of alignment with the
           relevant EU acquis in SEE for electronic communications and as a consequence is among the
           latest in the region to put in place relevant competition safeguards. The growth trajectory
           of the mobile broadband penetration has also been strong but rural areas are under-served.
           In 2012, the number of dedicated data cards / wireless modems per 100 subscribers in BiH
           was low (Figure 3.31). In 2013, the country’s wireless penetration stood at 89.7 percent, low
           when compared to the regional average of 145 percent. During the same time period the
           country’s mobile broadband population penetration (3G) stood at 35.8 percent, lower than
           in Serbia (41 percent), Slovenia (69.9 percent) or Croatia (73.9 percent). Well-developed
           wireless infrastructure is important to serve the rural and isolated areas of the country (65
           percent of the population is rural) as an alternative to the fixed broadband networks.

     3.87	 Competition is lacking in internet service provision, negatively impacting service delivery.
           Although BiH had 73 internet service providers (ISPs) in 2013, competitive conditions and
           market entry are highly constrained by the licensing regime and the dominant position of
           two government owned incumbents, which jointly control around 60 percent of the fixed
           broadband Internet access market in terms of subscribers and revenues. BiH is the only
           country in the region still applying individual licensing for electronic communication services,
           which is not in line with the relevant EU acquis.

3.88	 The low competitive environment in the market is being mirrored in low quality of the
      broadband internet access services. BiH’s international Internet connectivity channels are
      the second narrowest in the region, which is limiting the potential to deliver high quality
      (high speed) broadband connections. The majority of the broadband Internet access
      connections are considered slow by international standards.94 This may pose an obstacle to
      the investment and trade activity.95 The broadband Internet connections at a speed higher
      than 4Mbps experienced a significant take-up only since 2013, whereas in other countries
      higher-speed broadband connections have already become prevalent.

3.89	 BiH has among the cheapest broadband retail offerings in the world making it affordable
      for households at most income levels. Fixed broadband Internet tariffs96 in BiH were the 15th
      cheapest (in PPP terms) in the world in 2013, up from 32nd cheapest in 2012. As of June 2014,
      the price of the cheapest average fixed broadband package with the connection speed of
      1Mbps accounts for 3.3 percent of the average disposable monthly income and the price
      of the similar mobile broadband package stood at 3.6 percent of the average disposable
      monthly income. This makes broadband affordable for most households. However, at
      internationally agreed affordability threshold of 5 percent of monthly disposable income,
      broadband remains just out of the reach of the poorest segments of the population. A
      representative of the poorest average household in BiH (defined as the B40 of the total
      population) needs to allocate 7.5 percent of the monthly disposable income to afford
      the cheapest fixed broadband package and 8 percent of the monthly disposable income
      for the cheapest mobile broadband package. While BiH is a regional leader in terms of
      the most affordable fixed broadband Internet, Croatia and Slovenia demonstrate higher
      affordability when it comes to the purchase of mobile broadband Internet packages. In
      these countries the B40 spends less than 5 percent of their disposable monthly income on
      mobile broadband packages.97

Energy provision
3.90	 BiH has about 4,000 MW of installed power generation capacity and has experienced a
      55 percent growth in electricity generation since 2000 to 16,300 GWh in 2013. Coal-fired
      power plants account for about 60 percent of total generation, with hydropower plants
      providing the balance. In 2013, more than 95 percent of generation capacity is owned by
      the three major utility companies. All thermal power plant (TPP) blocks are dimensioned
      to operate with domestic coal (lignite and brown coal), supplied mostly from open-cast
      mines, also mainly owned and operated by the three main utilities. The transmission
      system consists of about 6,300 km of 400 kV, 220 kV and 110 kV lines, 36 interconnections,
      over 140 substations and over 250 transformers. The system is owned by the transmission
      company “Elektroprenos Bosne i Hercegovine a.d.” (Elektroprenos BiH) based in Banja Luka
      and operated by an Independent System Operator (ISO BiH). The 10(20) kV distribution
 	
94
     Connections with speed below 4 Mbps constitute over 70 percent of all the connections in 2012, while portion of connections above 8 Mbps is
     negligible.

              network has a total length of almost 22,000 km, the low voltage network is over 62,000
              km long, and transformation from medium to low voltage is conducted in close to 20,000
              transformer stations.98

     3.91	 Three power utilities are the most relevant players in the power sector. These are “JP
           Elektroprivreda Bosne i Hercegovine - d.d.” (EPBiH) in Sarajevo, “MH Elektroprivreda
           Republike Srpske a.d.” (ERS) in Trebinje, and “JP Elektroprivreda Hrvatske Zajednice Herceg
           Bosne d.d.” (EP HZHB) in Mostar. All three perform generation, distribution, trade and
           supply in their respective license areas. In RS, five companies operate within the structure
           of ERS as distribution system operators and suppliers to tariff customers. In FBiH, EPBiH and
           EP HZHB perform electricity distribution and supply to tariff customers. There are about
           1.3 million registered electricity users in BiH; EPBIH serves 48 percent, EPHZHB 13 percent,
           ERS 37 percent with the remaining 2 percent served by the distribution company of the
           Brcko District. Energy sector policy and regulatory development is largely driven by the EU
           accession process and the obligations under the Energy Community Treaty.

     3.92	 The current energy system requires minimal public sector financing. Generation,
           distribution and transmission do not need direct government financing. However mines are
           currently partially supported by the EP BiH, mostly due to modernization needs. All three
           Elektroprivredas are self-sustainable, an example of which is that their flood recovery needs
           were covered by their internal capacities, without substantial governmental support

     3.93	 At first glance, the BiH power sector is one of the healthiest in the region and has been
           performing well since 2001. Over the period, power generation increased by 50 percent
           between 2001 and 2013 (see Annex XIV), distribution losses halved between 2007 and
           2010 (Figure 3.34), exports more than quadrupled between 2001 and 2011 and net exports
           also showed an upward trend. Power generation per capita reached that of other Eastern
           European countries since 2010 (see Annex XIV). Hydropower generated around 59 percent
           of total power between 2001 and 2013 (with thermal (coal) power plants responsible for
           the remainder).

     3.94	 The WEF rates the quality of electricity supply as approaching EU17 standards, and access
           is high for all wealth quintiles. In 2012-13, electricity scored 6.1/7 on the index, close to
           the EU17’s 6.3 and significantly above the SEE average of 5.1 or the EU-CEE’s 5.4 (Figure
           3.32). Access to electricity is correspondingly high—approaching 100 percent for all wealth
           quintiles (Figure 3.33).

3.95	 BiH benefits significantly from net power exports. Between 2001 and 2011 net power exports
      averaged 14 percent of total generation. A linear trendline reveals net export growth, with a
      positive coefficient of 0.16 (Figure 3.35). Energy exports have made a significant contribution
      toward exports of goods and services. With very limited trade between companies, partly
      as a result of low power prices mandated for local sales making it more profitable to sell
      abroad, and using imports to balance supply and demand.

3.96	 Investments in new renewable energy (RE), including small hydro plants, sources
      experienced steady growth in recent years. Due to abundant natural potential, focus is
      mostly on small hydropower plants, with few wind parks in preparation. Further utilization of
      new RE sources is limited by budgetary constraints (for financing of subsidization schemes)
      which is partly necessary due to below-cost tariffs, and transmission grid bottlenecks due to
      the need for them to be safely accommodated.99

 	
99
           Currently, the transmission grid enables 350 MW of wind power capacity to be safely accommodated—more than that is not possible due to grid
           constraints. ISO identified wind projects with total size of 2,700 MW on the waiting list (including those 350 MW).

     3.97	 Yet behind this positive story lies a sector with deteriorating assets, underutilized
           resources, and high inefficiency. Aging thermal power plants slated for closure need to be
           replaced. Hydropower potential is continually unrealized as large projects are postponed
           or cancelled. At the same time, consumption is estimated to increase significantly. In
           addition, BiH is one of Europe’s least energy efficient economies, consuming public and
           private resources and harming firms’ export competitiveness due to higher energy inputs
           compared to other countries. It also presents a future risk for firms if energy prices increase.
           A combination of the aging power plants, energy inefficiency, and tariffs that are below cost
           recovery (financed partly by subsidies to mines, which are owned by the generators) help
           to create polluted cities. In addition, the country’s large electricity exports are, in part, a
           reflection of less than perfectly functioning domestic markets as electricity firms would have
           to sell to each other internally at below-market prices. Finally, a State-level energy sector
           strategy, a core document to address these and a range of other energy sector issues, has
           never been developed in BiH.

     3.98	 A significant amount of installed thermal capacity is slated for closure and if no significant
           power generation facilities are brought on-line in the next 10 years, BiH could become an
           electricity importing country. A little over half of thermal capacity dates from the 1960s
           and 1970s and over half of the TPP capacity is slated for closure in the next ten years,
           although it seems likely planners may adjust the closure dates to help meet demand.100
           A new plant under construction101 will replace only a third of this capacity, while two
           other plants designed to replace the remainder102 will unlikely be ready in time although
           planned closure dates could be adjusted. The list of thermal power plants (TPPs) slated for
           closure includes 52 percent (920 MW out of 1775 MW) of the country’s thermal capacity,
           exclusively serving baseload power needs. Although it is difficult to estimate the total cost
           of future investment needs, the privately owned TPP, Stanari (currently in construction
           stage), has a total investment value of €550 million for 300 MW of generation capacity,
           and four times this may be required over the next 15 years to keep pace with demand and
           to replace existing obsolete capacity.Other TPPs in the pipeline have uncertain completion
           dates.103 Long development periods for TPP plants are not uncommon, and in BiH’s case
           has tended to take six to seven years. For example, an Engineering, Procurement and
           Construction (EPC) contract for TPP Stanari was signed in May 2010, and the plant is
           planned to be on the grid in 2016.

     3.99	 New hydropower plants appear unlikely to be able to fill the gap without significant
           effort. Hydropower projects with capacity totaling over 16 percent of the currently installed
           capacity have recently been cancelled or postponed, often following pressure from civil
           society organizations (CSOs).104 The reasons for cancelling or postponing hydropower
           projects vary. However, only in a few cases the reasons were based on environmental or
       	 The following TPPs are slated for closure by 2025: Kakanj 5 (110 MW capacity TPP due for closure in 2022); Tuzla 3 (110 MW and 2019); Tuzla 4 (200
     100

         MW and 2024); Tuzla 5 (200 MW and 2024); Ugljevik (300 MW and 2025). See: Energy Community (2013), “Study on the Need for Modernization of
         Large Combustion Plants in the Energy Community” and Independent System Operator (2014), “Generation development indicative plan 2015 - 2024”

       	 Tuzla 7 (450 MW capacity), for which an MoU for financing recently signed but no construction has yet begun. Kakanj 8 (300 MW capacity), which is

         still in the design phase. Commissioning of Tuzla 7 is planned for 2019, and Kakanj 8 for 2022. No construction has started yet. Since construction of
         the TPP takes 5-7 years, it does not seem realistic these two plants will be commissioned on time.

         social issues (although one recent case on River Drina involved reducing the dam height
         on Buk Bijela, but the project is still to be developed with reduced capacity). Other failures
         often involve administrative issues. On the BiH level, no competencies exist related to
         project development. However, the BiH Council of Ministers has to approve all projects being
         developed on rivers with neighboring countries. RS tried to utilize the middle Drina river
         stretch (bordering Serbia), but the plan was not approved by the Council of Ministers. In RS
         a number of concessions (or similar water rights) were granted, in some cases to renowned
         international companies, but the majority of these projects were ultimately not implemented.
         The reasons for failure to develop those into investments were a combination of political
         instability, lack of adequate consultations on or readiness for concessions from the other
         Entity, lengthy procedures, unrealistic demands by the local community (local communities
         take shares in fees collected by the project and often demand unrealistic concession fees).
         Some companies faced their own internal problems or pulled their investments in the region
         as a whole. The fact that the only two medium-size hydropower plants are currently being
         developed in RS indicates that only a limited number of companies are able to successfully
         develop their projects in such an environment. In FBiH there have been two success stories:
         Mostarsko Blato (60 MW) and Pec Mlini (30 MW) are already in operation. Construction of
         the HPP Vranduk (20 MW) will start very soon. A number of additional projects are currently
         being developed by Elektroprivredas. The FBiH government has never granted a concession
         for an HPP with a size of more than 10 MW to a private company, due to the intention of
         developing such projects through SOEs.

3.100	 Currently no comprehensive and reliable assessments of wind or solar potential and
       estimates for hydro potential date to the Yugoslav period. These hydropower assessments
       may not be reliable and do not take into account developments on environmental and
       social requirements, new riparian issues or institutional issues related to the creation of the
       political Entities after the war. Nonetheless, the estimates are the following:

         •	 Theoretical hydropower potential amounts to 99.256 GWh/a
         •	 Technical hydropower potential amounts to 23.396 GWh/a
         •	 Utilized hydropower potential amounts to 9.000 GWh/a (approx. 40 percent of the
            technical potential)
3.101	 Energy tariffs are too low to encourage the private sector to finance the construction of
       many new power plants. With pre-tax residential tariffs at around 7.6 €cent per kilowatt
       hour at end 2013 (though slightly increased since then) (Figure 3.36), tariffs are unlikely
       to encourage private sector investment in significant new generation. Higher energy
       tariffs would be required to stimulate significant private sector investment in new power
       generation capacity. This would place additional urgency on the importance of well-
       targeted social protection mechanisms so that the poor are cushioned against unaffordable
       price increases.105

  	 The social protection mechanism should support the poor in general rather than subsidies energy, which is just one product they consume. See:

     3.102	 Electricity tariffs are determined in a complex process led by the energy regulators, in
            which the SOEs must justify the reasons for their request related to tariff increase. When
            conducting feasibility studies for investment projects, SOEs sometimes rely on hypothetical
            market prices for electricity rather than on the actual tariff structure in the country. Despite
            this, SOEs are allowed to pursue their investment plans under market prices. If projects are
            developed by the IPPs, the transmission and distribution network is obliged to purchase
            generation only from power plants under 10 MW installed capacity. Investment relying on
            higher than regulated tariffs and no clear domestic market may present future contingent
            liability issues. Increasing tariffs to at least cost would, however, have social impacts on
            poorer groups that would need to be mitigated through a functioning social protection
            mechanism that targets the poor effectively.

     3.103	 At the same time as power stations are closing and new ones difficult to build, power
            demand is likely to increase. Power consumption per capita increased by 53 percent
            between 2001 and 2011 but still remained just 86 percent of the SEE average (see Annex
            XIV). Boosting shared prosperity will likely require this to increase. Some estimates place
            energy demand increases at 50 percent between 2010 and 2030, even under a scenario
            of little manufacturing growth106 (Figure 3.37). Faster economic growth including in the
            manufacturing sector results in a more-than-doubling of power demand over the period.
            Meeting this demand will be challenging in an environment of decreasing generation
            capacity. Data from the Independent Systems Operation of BiH suggests that if all power
            plants are closed on the currently planned dates, BiH would become an energy importer by
            2020, though a more likely scenario is that the aging power plants will continue to operate
            with ever decreasing efficiency (causing even more pollution in coming years), until new
            facilities come online.

3. Restoring growth and creating jobs



3.104	 Hydropower—which generates between a half and two thirds of the country’s power—is
       highly susceptible to weather conditions. Low rainfall reduced hydropower generation by
       over 20 percent in 2011, compared with the average of the previous ten years. The following
       year was even worse.

3.105	 The growing exports of energy are matched by growing imports and both partly reflect
       a poorly functioning domestic energy market. Between 2001 and 2011 imports increased
       nearly as fast as exports. Domestic price regulation means that companies, after meeting
       domestic demand in their own supply area, prefer to sell (for higher prices) abroad. At
       the same time, power purchasers need to import energy, sometimes at higher tariffs than
       they charge. Domestic energy prices were liberalized only on paper as of January 1, 2015,
       meaning (i)  it is difficult to purchase power at short notice if required since there is not
       a spot market and prices cannot adjust to demand and (ii) prices are not high enough to
       attract private investment in the sector. With the public sector unable to afford to invest
       without significant cuts elsewhere, the outlook for the BiH energy sector is bleak.

3.106	 BiH is one of the most energy inefficient countries in Europe. Between 2001 and 2004, BiH
       generated around $5.90 of GDP per kilogram of oil equivalent (koe) used, in line with the
       SEE average. From 2005, other SEE countries have begun to improve their energy efficiency,
       while BiH has stagnated. Its GDP per koe fell from $6.40 in 2007 to $5.00 in 2011. This
       compares with an improvement in SEE (from $6.80 to $6.90), EU-CEE (from $7.90 to $8.40)
       and EU17 (from $8.80 to $9.00). At the same time EU-CEE (which, in 2001, were as efficient
       as BiH) and EU17 countries also made steady improvements.

3.107	 BiH releases substantially more carbon per koe than any other country in the SEE, EU-CEE
       or EU17.107 In 2010, BiH released 4.8 kg of carbon per koe, 28 percent higher than the second
       worst performer, FYR Macedonia. The best performers in SEE, Albania and Montenegro, are
       in line with EU17 averages of 2.1 kg per koe, largely thanks to their use of hydropower, which
       generates almost all electricity in Albania. BiH’s poor performance stems from the fact that
       many of the coal generation facilities are inefficient lignite-burning plants.

3.108	 Several factors contribute to the poor energy efficiency in BiH. High levels of losses in
       energy transformation, dated infrastructure and technologies, poorly insulated buildings
       and the use of inefficient equipment are major factors contributing to the inefficient use of
       energy on both the supply and demand side. Moreover, distorted energy pricing, combined
       with a fragmented legislative and institutional framework create an insufficient environment
       to incentivize energy efficiency improvements.

3.7	 Making labor markets and social welfare work
3.109	 BiH’s labor market challenge is twofold: to create suitable jobs for the de-skilled transition
       generation while ensuring that the younger generation moves into increasingly high-
       productivity jobs. The generation that entered labor markets before or during the transition
       and the war finds itself, to a significant extent, confronted with low demand for its skills.
       Their education is partially outdated, and so are some of the skills they acquired during their
       working careers. Many of them have either not found new proper employment after having

               lost their jobs in SOEs; or they are still working in SOEs, many of which are not sustainable
               in the future. Unfortunately, the prospects for this transition generation to find jobs in the
               modern, exporting sectors are dim. But, the service sector might offer opportunities for
               them in the form low-paying jobs, maybe even part time jobs. Germany, for instance, was
               able to create two million jobs in that category after its labor market reforms in the early
               2000s. This would require opening up an entirely new segment of low-paying, flexible part-
               time jobs, with significant reforms of the labor code and labor taxation. At the same time,
               investments in the human capital of the next generation would have to be significantly
               increased to prevent youth from entering this low-pay sector, and ensure that they get the
               right skills and education for the jobs of the future.

     3.110	 Just 27 out of every hundred people were employed in formal or informal jobs in 2013.
            A further seven were able to work but were not doing so and not looking for employment
            (Figure 3.38). This included discouraged workers and those for whom working may put them
            at risk of losing social welfare entitlements as well as others. Ten out of every hundred
            people were unemployed—that is actively seeking work and willing to work at the relevant
            wage rate. A total of 56 out of every hundred people were not in the labor force at all.108
            Even of those employed, more than half either work informally or in the public sector,
            leaving only very few that have formal private sector jobs—too few to sustain a country
            aspiring to become an EU member. Around 20 percent of employed people are estimated
            to be informally employed and around half of all formally employed people are employed in
            the public sector.

     3.111	 Long-term unemployment and short-term employment are particular issues. Of the
            unemployed, only 14 percent of men and 28 percent of women are unemployed for less
            than a year; the rest has been looking for a job more than a year, many for 10 years or more.
            Some employed people report having repeated three month contracts, which employers
            use to avoid the burdensome labor regulations. This adds to employment precariousness.

     3.112	 The low employment rate means that the few people with jobs need to support many
            others. The 27 out of every hundred people who are employed need to support not only
            themselves but also the remaining 73. This has resulted in high social security contributions
            rates (to fund pensions and benefits for the unemployed, for example), discouraging
            employment further.

     3.113	 Despite an output per worker that compared reasonably well with other Balkan countries
            in 2013 (including two EU members), output per resident was low. At over €13,200
            output per worker in 2013, BiH’s productivity compared well with other countries in the
            region. However, due to low employment rates, output per resident was just €2,884 in
            2013 (Figure 3.39).

3.114	 Employment declined during the financial crisis and bottomed out in 2012. Official data
       record employment declining from around 890,000 people in 2008 to 813,000 in 2012
       (Figure 3.40). Over half of the net job losses of 42,000, were in the industrial sector.
       Employment declined by around 16,000 and 19,000 in the agriculture and services sectors,
       respectively.

3.115	 Males and females were differently affected by the financial crisis. In the industrial and
       service sectors, males and females lost jobs at

       formal and females self-employed.

3.116	 The crisis altered the sectoral composition of employment, particularly for males. With
       significant job losses in the industrial sector but comparatively few in services, the sectoral
       composition of employment shifted toward the latter. The manufacturing sector employed
       40 percent of males in 2008 but this had fallen to just 30 percent by 2012 (Figure 3.41). At
       the same time the share of males employed in the service sector rose from 40 to 49 percent.
       There was a similar but much smaller adjustment toward the service sector and away from
       manufacturing for females.

     Productivity and wages
     3.117	 Productivity—imperfectly measured as output per worker—increased during the crisis
            each year except 2010, but is far behind the best performers. Output per worker increased
            from €12,184 per year in 2008 to €13,243 in 2013, an increase of close to 9 percent or 1.7
            percent per year. With the small increase in total output this was driven largely by reductions
            in employment, which declined by almost 8 percent over the period (Figure 3.42). At €1,109
            per month (€1,243 per year), gross value added per worker in BiH is above estimates for FYR
            Macedonia (€823) and Serbia (€964) but below that for Montenegro (€1,281).109 BiH also
            compares favorably with its two Balkan neighbors, Bulgaria and Romania, both of which are
            EU members. However, BiH is far behind the best performing eastern EU countries—average
            monthly gross value added per worker in Slovenia was €2,807 in 2013 and EU17 countries
            perform considerably better (Figure 3.43).

       and 2013, real gross wages rose an average of 0.5 percent per year. Real net wages have
       seen no real growth. Real wage growth has been held down since 2009 by a “double dip”
       recession which saw two years of negative GDP and wage growth. Average net wages
       declined by 4.6 percent in 2009 (Figure 3.45). In the same year, employment declined by 3.9
       percent and GDP growth turned negative at -2.7 percent. Similarly, in 2012, real net wages
       fell by 2.6 percent as GDP contracted by 1.2 percent. The first seeds of healthy recovery
       were only seen in 2013. In 2013, productivity, employment and real wages all increased
       simultaneously for the first time since the start of the crisis.

3.120	 Wages absorbed an estimated two thirds of total output before the crisis and remained
       high during it. Gross value added per worker was KM 1,893 per month in 2008 (Figure
       3.46). With gross wages of KM 1,163 and estimated total labor costs slightly higher (KM
       1,244), labor costs were around 66 percent of total worker productivity. Wage restraint
       combined with some increase in productivity between 2008 and 2013 helped this to fall to
       64 percent in 2013.

     3.121	 Despite this, the gap between gross and net wages has widened in recent years. Between
            2006 and 2013, the gap between average gross and net wages has widened from KM 297
            per month in 2006 to KM 469 in 2013, although the increase has slowed since 2011 (Figure
            3.47). In percentage terms, in 2006, workers took home 67 percent of their gross salary but
            by 2013, they took home only 64 percent. High social security contributions are responsible
            for a large proportion of this gap.

Social benefits that help the poor and encourage work
3.123	 Spending on social protection schemes in BiH is high by international standards. However
       this spending is biased toward high public spending on pensions (at 10.2 percent of the GDP)
       and categorical benefits out of non-insurance social assistance. On the other hand, spending
       on active labor market programs is low resulting in limited opportunities for employment
       support for disadvantaged groups in the labor market.

3.124	 BiH spends close to 3.5 percent of its GDP (2011) on non-insurance-based cash transfers,
       which makes the country one of the highest spenders in the ECA region. About 80 percent
       of this spending is allocated to categorical benefits for persons with non-war-related
       disabilities, civilian victims of war, and war veterans, which are disproportionately benefiting
       individuals in the richest quintile of the population in terms of targeting.

3.125	 The current mix of social protection programming and spending is unsustainable and
       does not fully respond to the needs of the population. It puts disproportionate weight
       on categorical benefits (about 7.4 percent of fiscal expenditure), crowds out potential
       investments on labor market programs and does not provide much room for benefit design
       reforms and expansion of coverage; e.g. introduction of in-work benefits or expansion of
       employment support programs.

3.126	 The main performance indicators of the social assistance system in BiH are poor by the
       standards of middle-income countries in Europe. Targeting accuracy is low, while the
       leakage of resources to the richest 20 percent of the population is significant. According to
       the estimates published in a study (IBHI and Maastricht 2013),111 in 2011, the members of
       the poorest quintile received only 18 percent of non-contributory cash benefits, whereas
       the richest quintile received about 20 percent.

            severely limited by various obstacles: it is
            overwhelmed with registering unemployed who are not looking for work, but want free
            health insurance.

     3.128	 The social benefit system not only fails to help the unemployed find work but actually
            provides disincentives. Social assistance is currently withdrawn at a rate of 100 percent
            of any formal income—meaning that for every KM earned, beneficiaries lose one KM in
            benefits. This, combined with a tax system that penalizes low-income workers, helps to keep
            unemployment high.

     3.129	 The current social safety net system does not provide adequate coverage to the poor.
            Despite the large share of GDP used for social security and other social benefits, these
            benefits fail to reach the poor adequately. Only around 21 percent of the poorest quintile
            receive some form of social benefits, lower than any other country in SEE except Montenegro
            (Figure 3.52). Over 8 percent of the wealthiest quintile receives benefits. The targeting of
            social benefit spending is also inefficient, with just 37 percent being received by the poorest
            20 percent and 56 percent by the B40, significantly worse than any other country in SEE
            (Figure 3.53). At the same time, over 12 percent of public spending on social benefits
            reaches the wealthiest 20 percent of the population. Further, the poor only absorb around
            three quarters of total non-contributory spending in RS and around two thirds in FBiH. .
            A 2010 World Bank Poverty Report found that if these transfers were to be eliminated,
            the poverty headcount would increase by only 1.2 percent. In contrast, without pension
            transfers poverty would increase to 25.8 percent of the population.

3.8	 Emerging issues and reform areas: Restoring growth and creating jobs
3.130	 The BiH economy needs to rebalance away from a dominant state, imports and
       consumption, toward the private sector, investments and exports. This reorientation would
       also provide the biggest push in creating jobs, from which the B40 would benefit as many
       of them are shut out from the formal labor market. There are five main policy areas which
       BiH needs to address to achieve higher growth and more prosperity for its citizens: Putting
       BiH to work through labor market reforms, making it easier to do business, creating a leaner
       and more effective government, maintaining and deepening financial and macroeconomic
       stability, and building economic infrastructure for growth.

3.131	 Putting BiH to work: reforming the labor market, improving social protection delivery
       and reducing the cost of labor. BiH needs to open up the job market so that many more,
       especially in the B40, would benefit from better paid and more regular employment. The
       EU’s recent Compact for Growth and Jobs112 notes the importance of labor market reforms
       including changes to the labor code (capping severance pay, time-limiting collective
       agreements, etc.) and the reform of social assistance benefits (adoption of in-work benefits,
       reform of unemployment benefits). Policies that could help to achieve this are wide ranging;
       the priority measures are the following:

              •	 Reducing the tax wedge, particularly on lower paid workers could help to boost formal
                 employment.
              •	 Introducing the phased withdrawal of social assistance would encourage employment
                 among poorer groups and help to boost the prospects of the B40. De-linking
                 unemployment benefit and health insurance would also discourage abusive use of the
                 public employment services and allow the PES to concentrate on employment services,
                 including training.

              •	 Increasing private sector provision of employment services would improve the coverage,
                 and breadth and quality of services provided by public employment services and thereby
                 improve employment outcomes.
     3.132	 Making it easier to do business: improving competitiveness, entrepreneurship and
            the investment climate. With one of Europe’s poorest business environments, BiH risks
            suppressing its private sector, preventing it from competing in export markets and even
            in the domestic market. Establishing a company that operates across the entire country is
            difficult due to a plethora of different licenses or permits required in each canton. Improving
            the business climate would help to improve competitiveness and enhance agricultural and
            manufacturing exports, areas in which the poor and B40 are more likely to work. A recent
            report by the European Stability Initiative (ESI) highlighted fourteen steps that BiH (and
            its Entities or cantons) could take to make significant improvements in its Doing Business
            rankings.113 While, like any indicators, the Doing Business rankings provide only a broad
            indication as to the overall business environment, any steps would be positive. Difficulties
            improving even only the indicators included in Doing Business does not bode well for
            the broader business environment. After first important steps to streamline the business
            climate, BiH could go much further to make it attractive to do business, including through
            the following reforms:

              •	 Improving the ability to export—through improved ports and soft infrastructure at
                 land borders—would be a boon for exporters in all sectors, including agriculture
                 and manufacturing, and help firms from BiH insert themselves into European supply
                 chains. It could also encourage export-orientated FDI.
              •	 Making it easier to trade across borders by streamlining customs procedures, including
                 the introduction of risk-based inspections, and upgrading its quality assurance
                 infrastructure, especially regarding phyto-sanitary standards.
              •	 Reducing red tape through further enhancements in business licensing, paying taxes,
                 registering real properties, and construction permitting.
     3.13	 Creating efficient, effective and sustainable government: reducing the size of the public
           sector while ensuring fiscal sustainability and improved public service delivery. Public
           revenues and expenditures are among the highest in the world and both their amount and
           structures hinder growth and harm employment. A number of specific measures would
           make the government more efficient, effective and sustainable:

              •	 With consumption at over 100 percent of GDP the structure of revenues could be
                 changed so that it favors production rather than consumption, and the complexity and
                 time burden of tax compliance could be reduced. Shifting toward a new production-
                 and export-growth model is necessary to boost productivity and competitiveness of the
                 economy, generate long-term employment gains and expand inclusiveness. Reducing
                 taxes on labor and production would be one step forward, while exports would also
                 gain from an improved investment climate and better transport connectivity.
              •	 Public investment is low despite record high public expenditures. Additional efforts
                 could made to leverage EU resources for public investment.

        •	 The significant SOE sector, offers an opportunity to raise resources, reduce subsidies
           and contingent liabilities and help to boost the private sector. Gradually reducing the
           public sector role in the economy, including through reduced SOE presence, would
           help to re-allocate resources toward the more productive private sector. This would
           help to boost growth and employment, benefiting in particular those who do not
           have access to the labor market, who tend to be in the B40. Unfortunately, this SCD
           has not been able to obtain detailed information to understand the SOE sector in
           depth. Further information would be required to understand the best reform path.
3.134	 Adding financial firepower: maintaining financial stability and expanding access to finance.
       Even though BiH maintained macroeconomic stability, even during the global financial crisis,
       new vulnerabilities are emerging. Large non-performing loans and public sector arrears
       must now be addressed in order to reignite growth and maintain long-term macroeconomic
       stability. The following reforms will be crucial:

        •	 Expanding access to finance would help to boost private sector output and employment
           growth and investment;
        •	 Finding ways for banks to resolve NPLs to spur higher lending, which could particularly
           benefit agricultural enterprises and thus many B40 farmers who are currently unable
           to expand;
        •	 Safeguarding financial sector stability by strengthening supervisors’ corrective and
           enforcement powers, strengthening of governance and risk management practices in
           selected banks, and improvements in the financial safety net framework. The benefits
           would be threefold: maintaining the stability of the financial system, protection of insured
           depositors and limiting fiscal implications; and
        •	 Improving banks’ risk analysis would also help reduce future NPLs.


3.135	 Building economic infrastructure for growth: powering and connecting BiH to the world.
       Despite high access levels of close to 100 percent, falling distribution losses and positive net
       exports, the energy sector in BiH is facing many challenges. BiH is one of Europe’s most energy
       inefficient and carbon intensive countries, harming competitiveness and increasing pollution,
       especially in its cities. In addition, BiH has the poorest physical transport infrastructure in
       the region and poor “soft infrastructure” making border crossing time consuming for firms
       and citizens. ICT infrastructure is affordable but international connections are poorer than
       in neighboring countries. The following priority reforms are critical:

        •	 Ensuring sufficient power supply—including through a renewed effort to boost renewable
           generation capacity—would help to maintain future economic growth and prevent power
           cuts, which could occur if supply does not keep pace with demand, harming the private
           sector and economic growth;
        •	 Ensure sufficient investment in the sector and to reduce over-consumption of power
           which is driven by subsidized tariffs;
        •	 Tackling energy inefficiency would help to improve the competitiveness of exporters
           (partly compensating for increased tariffs), and reduce urban pollution; and
        •	 Improving transport would help to connect rural populations to services, including health,
           education and banking as well as employment in larger settlements.

CHAPTER FOUR

Promoting social inclusion


BiH is undergoing a major demographic transition which also influences its development outlook.
Since 2014, old people (age 65+) exceed the number of children (0-14 years). The country faces two
additional challenges which are rare among emerging economies: First, it is shrinking. The overall
population has been declining significantly from 4.5 million before the war to 3.8 million today.
Second, BiH stopped urbanizing. Due to a combination of lack of demographic momentum and lack
of job opportunities in cities (and elsewhere), as well as other reasons, many Bosnians live in rural
areas, where poverty is higher.

With low employment, many citizens rely on social welfare, as well as remittances and pensions
from abroad. Social indicators are around average for a European middle income economy and
financing for health and education is significant. However, results do not match the large amount
of spending. Fragmentation and duplication of services results in substantial wastage, for example
in the procurement of pharmaceuticals. In addition, BiH faces significant health challenges with
a dual challenge of stunting and obesity among children, as well as a rising burden of other non-
communicable disease among adults, which are responsible for almost all premature deaths and,
with one of the world’s highest smoking rates, tobacco use presents a large challenge.

Enrolment rates are broadly in line with regional comparators with the exception being early
childhood education and pre-primary education, which have among the lowest enrolment rates in
the region.  Education resources fail to follow pupils, resulting in large disparities in expenditure per
pupil across the country. Information and statistics on human capital remain scattered and scarce
thus preventing effective policy-making. Lack of useful information makes it difficult to collect the
evidence required to hold teachers, schools, cantons and Entities accountable for their work and
to allow for monitoring and reporting on education statistics and learning outcomes. There is no
nation-wide student assessment or examination system in place, and BiH has not participated
in international benchmarking exercises, such as PISA.  This severely hampers the ability of the
government to assess efficiency and effectiveness of sector spending, and the impact of education
policies on learning.

Access to piped water is high in total but only around three quarters of the poorest quintile have
access to it, with lower rates for the B40 especially in rural areas. Water tariffs are below-cost but
there are significant maintenance needs in some areas (partly to reduce water loss). Access to
sewage systems is low, driven primarily by very low rural access which forces (generally poorer)
rural households to use more expensive sanitation facilities.

     4.1	 Health service delivery and efficiency
     4.1	       Although BiH performs better than the SEE or EU-CEE average in life expectancy, it faces
                significant health challenges, with relatively poor health outcome indicators. While infant
                mortality rate (5.8 per 1000 in 2011) was below Serbia’s 6.3 per 1000, it was 20 percent
                higher than Croatia (4.6 per 1000). Latest data places the infant mortality rate in the RS
                at 3.2 in 2014. The life expectancy gap between BiH and the EU has increased since 1990
                (from 73/75 years in 1990 to 76.6/80.2 years in 2011 for males and females, respectively).
                In addition, access to health service and medical insurance is limited for vulnerable groups,
                in particular for Roma (72 percent of Roma having service access and 66 percent of them
                having access to medical insurance, compared to non-Roma living in the same community
                with 93 percent service access and 97 percent medical insurance access).114

     4.2	       BiH has one of the highest prevalence of childhood malnutrition in the region, characterized
                by a double burden of overweight and stunting in children. One in ten children is stunted
                (signaling chronic under-nutrition), whereas one in five is overweight or obese (Figure 4.1).
                Moreover, half of children who are both stunted and overweight (SO) are 0-12 months,
                which has acute long-term health consequences. Malnutrition is prevalent across all wealth
                quintiles (Figure 4.2), but the poor, especially in rural areas, have higher levels of both
                stunting and overweight than those in middle-income groups (although the wealthiest also
                have high rates of overweight). For instance, overweight in rural children ranges between
                15 percent in the B20 to 10 percent in the T20. Children’s overweight prevalence declined
                between 2000 and 2011 in RS from 19.4 to 17.4, percent but increased in FBiH from 15 and
                17.4 percent. Similarly, chronic malnutrition declined over time in RS, but remained at about
                10 percent in FBiH.

 4.3	          The WHO estimates115 that 95 percent of premature deaths in BiH are attributable to four
               major non-communicable disease (NCD) groups. These NCDs - cardiovascular diseases,
               cancers, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases - are also the leading cause of ill health
               and disability in the country. This epidemiological pattern is the result of the demographic
               transition but also due to the fact that BiH has one of the highest rates of smoking prevalence
               in the world.116 Dietary risks, high blood pressure and alcohol use are also important risk
               factors, the latter particularly among adults aged 15-49 (HMNE, 2010117), particularly cardio-
               vascular diseases (CVD). CVD accounted for over half of all premature deaths in 2008 (Figure
               4.3), rising to nearly two-thirds of total death in BiH in 2013 (WHO, 2014). Within the former
               Yugoslav Republics, BiH and Serbia have CVD age-standardized mortality rates (both sexes)
               much higher than Slovenia or Montenegro, but not as high as FYR Macedonia. In terms of
               mental health, while depression disorders were a leading cause of reductions to Disability
               Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in 1990, BiH has made remarkable progress in reducing by half
               associated burden of disease from these conditions (IHME, 2012). Nevertheless, 45 percent
               of people in FBiH reported having experience stress in the month prior to the survey (Health
               Survey FBiH, 2014), and there is some evidence that this may have negative labor market
               impacts.118

 4.4	          Self-assessed health status is correlated with level of education but not socio-economic
               status. Around 80 percent of those with secondary or tertiary education reported being in
               good or very good health compared to just 60 percent of those with no education and 70
               percent of those with only primary education (Figure 4.4). Interestingly, self-assessed health
               status differs very little between the socio-economic quintile.

     4.5	            BiH has one of the highest smoking rates in the world, with higher rates among poor and
                     the B40, but tobacco taxes are relatively low and enforcement of anti-smoking regulations
                     remain weak, while urban pollution also likely contributes to high rates of some NCDs.
                     Smoking behavior differs by demographic characteristics such as gender and wealth (Figure
                     4.5). Males are more likely to smoke than females (40 vs 28 percent) or to have ever smoked
                     (64 percent vs 52 percent). Poor males are particularly likely to smoke (48 percent) or to
                     have tried smoking (70 percent) though there is not a large difference in the number of
                     cigarettes per day between the poor and non-poor (for either males or females). Around 12
                     percent of females report smoking while pregnant. Binomial (probit) and smoking intensity
                     selection models119 reveal that higher levels of education are significantly associated with
                     lower probabilities of smoking for both women and men (especially secondary for women
                     and higher education for men). Smoking rates in rural areas are significantly lower than
                     in urban areas, but there is no difference in the number of cigarettes consumed between
                     rural and urban men. Tobacco excise taxes are currently only 58 percent of retail prices,
                     which is lower than the EU averages and the WHO recommendation of 75 percent. An
                     amended excise tax law on tobacco was passed in July 2014120, which proposes incremental
                     increases to tobacco excise taxes to raise additional revenue and attempt to reduce smoking
                     rates. While some legislation is in place to discourage smoking, BiH remains far from WHO
                     recommendations in terms of restrictions on tobacco advertising, cigarette warnings, and
                     restrictions on public smoking. Moreover, enforcement of existing regulations on smoking in
                     public buildings and restaurants is limited. In addition to smoking, BiH has some of Europe’s
                     highest urban pollution rates. A large pool of evidence suggests that this is detrimental to
                     health and that poorer groups suffer most. See chapter 5 for more details.

          	 See full statistical model in Annex XI. Having secondary or higher education reduces also the number of cigarettes smoked among men, whereas only
            having higher education reduces smoking intensity among women. Smoking probability rates among poor women (B20) are higher than women in
            other wealth quintiles. Whereas being in the T20 is associated with lower smoking prevalence among men.

          	 Under the amended law, the general excise duty is increased from 126 Bosnia-Herzegovina Convertible Mark (BAM) (about US$88) (stipulated under
            art. 21(6) of the Law on Excise Duties) to BAM176 (about $123) per 1,000 cigarettes. (Id.) In addition, a duty on fine-cut tobacco is introduced in the
            initial amount of BAM78 per kilogram, but in future it is expected to increase to at least 80% of the minimum duty on cigarettes, i.e., to about US$70
            per kilogram. (Id.; Zakon o Akcizama u Bosni I Hercegovini [Law on Excise Duties in Bosnia and Herzegovina] (June 18, 2009), Official Gazette of BiH,

4.6	         Routine vaccinations are low compared to European standards, with children from poorer
             households having slighter lower vaccination rates. Routine vaccinations for children
             are 80 percent or higher except for measles (68 percent), Hib1 and polio4 (54 percent).121
             This compares to European average of 94 percent for measles and 90 percent for HiB1 .
             Differences exist across regions. In particular, BD has lower immunization rates than the rest
             of BiH in hib (first dose), dpt3, hepb3 and measles (but not for BCG (TB)). While differences
             with respect to wealth were small within FBiH and RS, children in the bottom 20 percent had
             a lower probability of having the four main vaccines (dpt3, bcg, polio3, and measles) (Figure
             4.6). The vaccination rate for Roma is lower than for non-Roma in the same community (83
             compared to 95 percent).122

4.7	         The family medicine (FM) model—implemented in recent years—has been the single
             largest reform implemented by the governments in the health sector. Under the family
             medicine model, Primary Health Care (PHC) facilities were rehabilitated and medical doctors
             and nurses are being regularly trained for FM specialization. Coverage of the population
             through family medicine teams has reached 95 percent in RS and more than 69 percent in
             the FBiH in 2014.

4.8	         Total health expenditures in BiH have grown since 2000, and government spends 7 percent
             of GDP on health—the highest in the region. Both public and private health expenditures
             have grown substantially in recent years. Total health expenditures are now estimated to
             have increased from 7.1 percent of GDP in 2000 to an estimated 9.9 percent of GDP in 2012,
             a level similar to the average for EU countries and higher than many of BiH’s neighbors
             (Figure 4.7). Government spending as a percentage of GDP is the highest in SEE, and
             significantly higher than the average for the EU or upper middle income countries as a group
             (about 4 percent of GDP). In the period 2009-2011, while the share spent on inpatient care
             (35 percent) decreased, it was higher than the expenditure on outpatient care (25 percent)

            contrary to most EU countries (Figure 4.8). Relatively high in-patient spending indicates
            opportunities to improve health spending efficiency by shifting to outpatient services. In
            addition, 47 percent of households’ health spending is allocated to pay for pharmaceuticals
            whereas 21 percent of private spending is still allocated to finance in-patient care (through
            informal payments) (BiH NG+HA Report).

     4.9	   Public health insurance is funded by a mixture of contributions collected from employers,
            from the salaries of employees and general revenues. Over 50 percent of those who
            receive health insurance coverage are exempt from paying personal contributions (mostly
            pensioners, the unemployed, the disabled, and war veterans), and their health insurance is
            financed by transfers from other extra budgetary funds and from general revenues.

     4.10	 The financial sustainability of the system is threatened by inefficiencies resulting from
           the fragmentation of service delivery and insurance systems, an inefficient hospital
           sector, and high spending on pharmaceuticals. At 10.9 per 1000 population, the number
           of hospital discharges in BiH is comparable to that of Southern European countries such as
           Spain or Portugal, and below regional averages. The number of acute hospital beds (3.45 per
           100,000) remains within the same range as the OECD and EU averages. The hospital system
           is excessively fragmented and many hospitals have a very low throughput and are inefficient.
           Occupancy rates are low, particularly in the FBiH where they averaged at 51 percent in 2013;
           the ratio of staff per bed varies from 1.5 to 4 across hospitals. There is thus considerable
           room to reorganize service delivery across and within hospitals to improve efficiency while
           maintaining access.

     4.11	 Pharmaceuticals represent about 30 percent of total health spending, about double
           the average for OECD countries. Medication prices are frequently double international
           reference prices in both RS and FBiH. In FBiH, drug procurement is undertaken separately
           by each canton, with little or no use of reference pricing. In addition, cantons are unable
           to purchase in large enough quantities to keep costs down. Other cost drivers in both RS
           and FBiH include inadequate monitoring systems for prescription and dispensing practices;
           pricing policies that do not provide incentives for dispensing lower-cost drugs; and limited
           mechanisms to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of new, expensive drugs before including on
           the health insurance reimbursement list.

     4.12	 The financing system may also threaten the financial sustainability of the system and
           increase the registered unemployment rate. Health insurance is provided through the
           public purse for those registered as unemployed. With an official unemployment rate of
           over 40 percent compared to an unemployment rate of around 27 percent according to the
           ILO definition (which counts unregistered workers as employed) it seems likely some people
           register as unemployed while working in the gray economy. Evidence suggests that one of
           the main reasons for this is the provision of free health insurance to the unemployed. This
           serves both to increase the public costs of health insurance and reduces social insurance
           contributions and other taxes.

4.13	 Overall, individuals’ health costs are reasonably well covered with fairly low levels of
      catastrophic expenditures and low poverty increases as a result of out-of-pocket expenses.
      The poverty headcount is estimated to increase by around 1 percentage point in 2011 as a
      result of out of pocket (OOP) health expenditures (Table 4.1), from 15 to 16 percent. OOP
      were above 25 percent of total expenditures for around 2 percent of households (Table 4.2).
      Out-of-pocket spending represented 28 percent of total health costs in 2012 (WHO).

4.14	 One underlying cause of the high cost, disparities and poor performance is the highly
      fragmented nature of the health systems in BiH. In FBiH, the responsibility for health
      services has been further delegated to the cantons, so the FBiH health sector includes the
      FBiH Ministry of Health (MoH), the 10 cantonal MoHs, the Federal Solidarity Health Insurance
      Fund (HIF), the 10 cantonal HIFs, and 11 Institutes of Public Health (IPH). The RS health
      system is centralized at the Entity level, so responsibility is shared only between the Ministry
      of Health and Social Welfare of the Republic of Srpska (RS MoH), a single health insurance
      fund (the Health Insurance Fund of the Republic of Srpska - HIFRS), and a single Public Health
      Institute (RS PHI). The District of Brcko also has a Department of Health and a separate HIF.
      As a result, BiH has 13 MoHs, HIFs, and IPHs, which has led to substantial duplication and
      inefficiency. While it will be politically challenging to reduce this fragmentation and diffusion
      of authority within the health systems within BiH, it would increase efficiency and improve
      both service delivery and health outcomes.

4.2	 Education service delivery and efficiency
4.15	 Improving the quality and relevance of the education and training system while ensuring
      that learning outcomes are translated into relevant skills that meet the needs of the labor
      market. Consistently, countries in the region have found human capital, particularly skills,
      to be a constraint for economic growth and shared prosperity. To tackle this challenge, it is
      important to distinguish between the current stock of workers—youth and adults already
      outside the formal education system—and the flow of future workers—those of school age
      and youth still in school.123 With a youth unemployment rate at 63 percent, and 31 percent not
      in education, employment or training (NEET), especially for those with secondary education,
      a focus on offering active labor market programs (ALMPs) to unemployed workers, as well
      as updating the skills of those who are already employed through training and retraining
      programs is needed. These programs respond to the immediate jobs crisis and play a critical

               role in getting people back to work, although in the longer-term, higher employment
               generation is needed. Enhancing the skills relevance of future workers is equally important.
               Getting children off on the right start and ensuring that all students learn and build job-
               relevant skills requires significant improvements in the access, quality and relevance of the
               formal education system.

     4.16	 BiH performs well in primary and secondary enrollment rates but poorly in early childhood
           and pre-primary education. Early childhood education (ECE) enrollment rates (for
           children aged 3-5) stood at 13.1 percent in 2011, significantly below rates in Serbia or FYR
           Macedonia (Figure 4.9). Rates were especially low in rural areas where fewer than 8 percent
           of children attend ECE. There are also differences between the Entities with enrollment
           rates of 14.4 percent in FBiH and 10.3 percent in RS. BiH also lags significantly behind in
           access to pre-primary education. In 2011, only 16 percent of children attending the first
           grade of primary school had attended
           preschool the previous year (18 percent Figure 4.9: Early childhood education based on MICS 4 in BiH,
           in the FBiH and 13 percent in RS)124, with Serbia, FYROM and Kazakhstan

           Entities with a 92.9 percent NER in RS and 9.7 percent NER in FBiH.127 This suggests that
           there are more children who repeat years in FBiH than in RS.

4.18	 While education and human development statistics remain scattered, data suggest that
      school enrollment drops at upper secondary level and above. Upper secondary enrollment
      was just 77 percent, and tertiary enrollment was 37 percent (data from 2010). Upper
      secondary gross enrollment rate is far below some of the regional comparators (such as
      Kosovo and Albania, where gross enrollment is at 92 percent for each), and well below the
      average rate of countries in Europe (93 percent). In recent years, the number of private
      tertiary education institutions has increased, suggesting the access to tertiary education may
      have increased. According to the Centre for Information and Recognition of Qualifications in
      Higher Education list, which is compiled on the basis of information provided by the ministries
      of education, there are currently 10 public and 37 private higher education institutions in
      BiH (see Annex XI).128

4.19	 Inequalities in enrollment and educational attainments in BiH. Children from the lowest
      income groups have lower enrollment rates and lower educational attainment, limiting the
      access of these groups to economic opportunities. For example, 31 percent of children from
      the richest quintile had access to ECE compared to only 2 percent in the poorest quintile (MICS
      2011-2012). Studies have demonstrated the importance of early childhood development
      for overall cognitive development and for lifetime earnings potential, particularly among
      poor and marginalized populations. These figures imply that most children in BiH do not
      have the opportunity to gain a set of emotional, behavioral and cognitive skills that lead
      to better school (and later, work) preparedness. Further, in upper secondary education, 92
      percent of children from the richest quintile had access to secondary education compared
      to 84 percent of the poorest quintile. Children from the Roma community are particularly
      disadvantaged with only 2 percent attending ECE and only 57 percent of the poorest income
      group were attending primary (compared to 95 percent of the total population in the same
      income quintile), perpetuating the cycle of poverty.

4.20	 The education system does not systematically measure or monitor quality, but limited
      data available suggests that quality of education is inadequate to equip students with
      the basic skills the labor market requires.129 BiH has not participated in any international
      student assessment, such as Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), and it
      does not have a national student assessment system to measure students’ learning. The only
      available data to provide some international comparison are the results of the 2007 Trends
      in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) in which BiH participated. TIMSS
      compares mathematics and science achievement across countries. BiH eight-graders ranked
      below average in both math and science130 and below the other countries in its region that
      participated in the test (Serbia and Slovenia) (Figure 4.10).

  	 In strategic documents the desire for quality is not questionable. They all call for quality and there is explicit commitment for achieving good quality
129

    education. In practice, however, this is not always the case and the traditional approach to perception of quality, which places emphasis on structural
    dimensions rather than process and outcome dimension, is still in place. This indicates that the concept of quality as understood by some actors within
    the education system, might not fully align with international definitions of quality.

     4.21	 Some evidence suggests that BiH does not achieve value-for-money with its education
           expenditures. Although difficult to estimate, BiH spends approximately 4.5 percent of its GDP
           on education, a little above the regional average of 4.2 percent. BiH’s students performed
           about the same as those in Ukraine which spends 5.3 percent of GDP on education and
           Bulgaria and Romania, which spend about 4.2-4.3 of GDP, but much more poorly than those
           in the Russian Federation and Armenia whose spending was lower than BiH’s.

     4.22	 Available data point to weak higher education performance. Limited progress has been
           made in terms of meeting the requirements for accreditation and quality assurance,
           prompted by the BiH Framework Law on Higher Education and Bologna Declaration (EU
           Progress Report, 2014). Internal efficiency is very low with nearly 24 percent of students
           repeating an academic year and nearly 13 percent dropping out completely (2008), and
           with only roughly 50 percent of students who enroll in universities actually graduating. As
           a result of the high repetitions, it takes an average student almost 7 years to complete a
           4-year degree in BiH. In 2011, an estimated 6.2 percent aged 25 and older had a tertiary
           degree,131 far lower than neighboring countries (Croatia 11 percent and Slovenia 18 percent)
           and further below the EU average (24 percent).

     4.23	 Firms in BiH cite inadequate skills as a constraint to business development.132 According to
           the latest Enterprise Survey (2013), 7.3 percent of firms report the inadequately educated
           workforce is a major constraint, compared to 19 percent of firms in 2009. This decline is likely
           to be due to the poorer economic environment rather than improved quality of education.
           Moreover, a larger share of exporting firms in BiH (15 percent) report inadequate educated
           workforce as major constraint—less than FYR Macedonia (34 percent) but similar to Kosovo
           (15 percent), suggesting that the education system may not be providing the higher level
           skills that exporting firms would require.

4.24	 Education matters for employment. Those with primary education or less represent 41
      percent of the population but just 17 percent of the employed and even just 20 percent of
      the unemployed (Table 4.3). However, 60 percent of the inactive population has this level of
      education. Those with college, university education or above are more likely to be employed
      than others (19 percent of those employed, and out of just 10 percent of the population),
      and are also more likely to be unemployed (12 percent of the unemployed have this level of
      education). This may be due to a lack of skilled jobs available or due to a mismatch between
      the skills available and those required by employers. While high youth unemployment in
      BiH is partly due to low economic growth and low rates of job creation, available courses
      and school curriculum are not linked to labor market needs, resulting in low relevance of
      skills, including: “…lack of necessary skills: communication, computer literacy, fluency in
      foreign languages, managerial and leadership skills”.133 These perceptions, combined with
      the insights that those with very low level of education tend to drop out of the labor market
      altogether, suggest that improved skill levels—in line with the requirements of the private
      sector—could help to lower inactivity and unemployment rates in BiH.

4.25	 Wages are high in education and are crowding out other spending. BiH spent 4.5 percent
      of GDP on education in 2009, a little above the regional average of 4.2 percent. Wages for
      primary and secondary education sector employees took up over 80 percent of education
      spending in 2009 and thus constrained non-wage spending and capital investments. In 2009,
      teachers were already slightly (FBiH on average) or significantly (RS) overpaid in terms of the
      ratio of their wages to GDP per capita.

4.26	 Education policy is fragmented: a total of 14 ministries deal with education in BiH, of
      which 11 are in the FBiH. There is no Ministry of Education (MoE) at the state level. There
      is a small education unit within the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MoCA), but its involvement
      in education policy at the subnational level is minimal. The governance structures for the
      education sector are different in the two Entities. In RS, policy is formulated by a single MoE
      at the Entity level, while in FBiH, it is at the cantonal level. In the latter, each of the 10 cantons
      is responsible for all educational matters, and FBiH MoE cannot intervene in cantons. The
      education department of Brčko District is an independent agency that sets education policy
      in BiH. In total, 14 ministries deal with education in BH - MoCA at the state level, one MoE in
      RS, one at FBiH level and 10 cantonal MoEs in FBIH, and the education department of Brčko
      District. Under this extremely fragmented education system state-level or federation-level

              reforms cannot be decided and implemented without consent of each Entity and canton.
              The Conference of Education Ministers established with the aim of developing consensus
              on education policies among cantons, is only an advisory body with no binding authority.
              Though intended to meet on bi-monthly basis, in 2013 it met only twice, thus resulting in
              ineffective coordination.

     4.27	 The education budget is also highly decentralized. The majority of the education budget
           is determined at the Entity level in RS and at the cantonal level in FBiH. Neither the Entity
           governments nor the cantonal governments receive any earmarked allocations for education
           from the higher levels, so the education budget is decided based on their respective financial
           capacities and policy priorities. This financing model also holds for higher education. In RS,
           the budget is determined at the Entity level but in FBiH, cantons finance higher education.
           The cantons where universities are located provide the bulk of finance even though the
           students may come from other cantons. The funding in both FBiH and RS is driven by inputs
           such as staff salaries rather than outputs. As a result, there is no financial incentive to
           encourage a more efficient management of students and the teaching process.

     4.28	 The result is that there are large financing disparities in funding per pupil. A UNICEF
           supported case study analyzed preschool financing which shows disparities in economic
           cost per child.134 The study reports that in RS the economic cost varies from 400 KM in
           Banja Luka to 120 KM in Bileca, in FBiH it is from 400 KM in Zenica-Doboj Canton to 150
           KM in Canton Posavina, Central Bosnia and Canton 10. Municipality contributions as well
           as parents’ participation represent shares in the overall economic cost per child and partly
           explain these disparities.

     4.29	 A declining school age population in the past decade (the total number of pupils enrolled
           in basic education has declined by 0.5 percent from 2003 to 2007) has resulted in small
           class sizes and low student teacher ratios with resources concentrated in basic education,
           and limited investments in pre-school, upper secondary and tertiary education. While
           secondary class sizes are comparable across the two Entities - an average of 24.3 students
           in FBH and 25.0 in RS - class sizes in primary education vary substantially within the Entities,
           ranging from 19.4 in RS to 21.6 in FBiH’s primary schools. As a result, small schools and
           classes in primary education lead to higher unit costs in RS. On average though, RS spends
           a lower amount per student than FBIH does. Variations across the cantons within FBiH
           are even greater.135 Only about half of the variation in unit costs among cantons can be
           explained by the differences in average class sizes. While the educational norms of most
           cantons stipulate that the optimum class size in primary education should be at least 24
           students, only half of the cantons maintain average classes below 21 students in primary
           education, thus incurring unit costs at least 12 to 15 percent higher than the cantons with
           primary classes near the optimum size.

4.3	 Access to water and sanitation
4.30	 Access to water services is high. The Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) shows a high
      percentage of citizens in BiH, both in urban and rural areas, have access to water services.
      According to the survey, 90 percent of households in urban and 83 percent in rural areas
      had piped private water accesses inside dwelling or yard in 2011 (Figure 4.11). Public water
      companies serve only around half of the population, while much of the rest of the population
      uses water from uncontrolled local systems.136 These small systems were constructed many
      years ago and abandoned to local communities (i.e. individuals or villages) that have neither
      the capacity nor the knowledge to manage them appropriately. Much of the access from
      local systems is not subject to quality control.137

4.31	 Access to sewer and sanitation facilities is much lower. Around 48 percent of the BiH
      population is connected to the sewage system although there are large geographical
      differences (Figure 4.13). Around 58 percent of the FBiH population is connected to the
      sewage system compared to 29 percent of the RS population (Figure 4.14). This is as a result
      of very low rural access across the country (30 percent compared to 84 percent of those
      in urban areas), and is particularly low in RS. Furthermore, less than 3 percent of collected
      waste water is treated in waste water treatment plants.

4.32	 Poorer groups of the population are under-served by sanitation facilities and, to a lesser
      extent, piped water. Data from the 2012 MICS survey shows that around 76 percent of the
      poorest quintile have access to piped water in the dwelling or yard compared with 85 to 93
      percent for all other wealth quintiles (Figure 4.12). Sanitation access is even lower for the
      poorest segments of the population. Just 21 percent of households in the poorest quintile
      and around 37 percent of the B40 is connected to a piped sewer system. This compares to
      close to 80 percent for the wealthiest quintile.

4.33	 The result is that the poorest groups resort to septic tanks, at private expense. Over half
      of households in the B40 use septic tanks compared with 22 percent of the wealthiest
      quintile. Using septic tanks in such percentage endangers water sources used for supply and
      generates an additional financial burden on households.

4.34	 Water and wastewater services fall short of EU standards and requirements. According to
      the program Water Policy in Bosnia and Herzegovina 138, only 35 percent of the population in
      BiH is covered by public water with continuously satisfactory water quality, as required by the
      EU Drinking Water Directive, while the goal for the country is to reach 90 percent by 2035. At
      the same time, this document states that only 46 percent of population in agglomerations
      bigger than 2000 PE139 is connected to sewerage systems while only 13 percent of those are

  	 Latest estimates are that only 56 percent of the FBiH population and 48 percent of the RS populations was served with water from public companies
136

    in 2003 with FBiH rising to around 60 percent in 2010 (2012 BiH State of the Environment Report and National Environmental Action Plan, data from
    2003 and FBiH Water Management Strategy draft of 2010 reports that 60% of the FBiH population is supplied with water by public companies).
  	 Access to piped water in the dwelling or yard does not differ if water is coming from protected or unprotected source. There are many uncontrolled
137

    water networks on local level (mainly in rural areas) which deliver water through pipes, but used water sources are not protected and water quality is
    not in line with standards prescribed.

                       connected to wastewater treatment plants. The EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive
                       requires full coverage for both. For the implementation of these two main EU Water Directives,
                       it will be necessary to secure about €3.7 billion. A failure to sufficiently treat wastewater has
                       negative environmental consequences as rivers become polluted. Agriculture can also suffer
                       if polluted water seeps into agricultural areas. In addition, agriculture can contribute to poor
                       water quality. For example, poor fertilization storage or practices can affect ground waters
                       with increased levels of nitrates and pesticide/herbicide residues as a result of inadequate
                       use of fertilizers and pesticides and poor soil management. In addition, over-use of fertilizer
                       can pose environmental problems. While this has been the case in Croatia, there is not yet
                       evidence of this becoming a problem in BiH.

4.35	 Some portions of the water supply system are in poor condition resulting in large water
      wastage and water prices are not cost-reflective. Water networks in urban areas are in
      particularly poor condition—either damaged or badly maintained—resulting in water
      losses estimated at 40 to 70 percent, well above regional good practices of 20 percent
      and international best practices of 8-12 percent. In addition, around 60 percent of water
      provision in public services is not charged for. The municipal governments determine the
      nominal price of service; however, the set price typically does not reflect the real economic
      cost. The price of water and sanitation services is in general low, from €0.30/m3 in some
      small municipalities to €0.77/m3 in Bijeljina. A combination of low charges and no water
      rates reduces incentives to users to conserve water and to report problems with leakages.

4.36	 The provision of water services is undertaken by several levels of government or public
      companies, not always with clearly defined responsibilities. The main pieces of legislation
      relevant to water utilities are the Laws on Public Enterprises / Utility Services. These laws
      do not distinguish between utilities, and do not consider the specific case of water supply
      services, nor adequately define the role, position, structure and degree of autonomy of
      water utilities in relation to municipalities. The delegation of responsibility to cantons in the
      case of FBiH creates further difficulties in implementing reforms. This has led to a complex
      relationship between water utility companies and municipalities, constraining the efficient
      operation of water utilities which are often in the situation of managing and operating water
      supply and sanitation systems without the full support of the municipality.

4.4	 Emerging issues and reform areas: Promoting social inclusion
4.37	 Even though BiH is a relatively equal society, there are many possibilities to make it
      more inclusive, especially in allowing the poor and neglected parts of the population to
      participate more successfully in society. BiH has a Gini-coefficient of around 33. This is not
      dissimilar from estimates made for Yugoslavia during the 1980s suggesting there has been
      little increase in inequality since then. It is slightly higher than some other countries in the
      region, like Albania (29 in 2012) but much lower than the Gini-coefficients reported in Latin
      America, where they tend to vary between 45 and 55. There are four main policy areas
      where the poor would benefit from more effective public policy and expenditures covering
      the challenges of rural livelihoods, health care, education and water.

4.38	 Boosting agriculture: increasing agricultural productivity and opportunities. With the B40
      predominately living in rural areas and the poor more likely to work in agriculture than
      wealthier people, the following would help to achieve inclusive growth benefiting the rural
      poor in particular:

        •	 Reforming rural land markets to reduce the fragmentation of agricultural plots;
        •	 Finding ways to boost agricultural output on small farm in a sustainable manner;
        •	 Ensuring sufficient services are in place to help agri-business grow output and
           employment; and
        •	 Ensuring EU standards are adhered to and accreditation for the standards in place.

                                                                                 4. Promoting social inclusion



      4.39	 Living healthy lives: improving health services and access to water and sanitation. Although
            BiH life expectancy is above the average for middle-income economies, many are living
            unhealthy lives. In addition, incentives in the health sector are misaligned and are causing
            major inefficiencies and poorer services. This makes the sector very expensive and puts a
            high burden on labor cost, a major contributor to high unemployment in BiH (see section
            3.2). Further, clean water and sanitation facilities are rare among the rural poor and add to
            the health problem. Focusing water supply efforts toward the B40 would help to improve
            the living standards of this group as they are disproportionally impacted by lower access to
            piped water compared to the rest of the population. BiH could improve its health services in
            a number of ways:

            •	 Discouraging smoking to improve quality of life and reduce the health-related bills,
               including by increasing tobacco taxes and enforcing better anti-smoking regulations;
            •	 Decoupling unemployment benefit from health insurance, while finding other ways to
               finance health insurance for the needy, would discourage people from falsely registering
               as unemployed, potentially saving money and increasing social security contributions and
               taxes;
            •	 Ensuring water tariffs reflect costs and are uniformly levied, and that the resources
               used to improve the water infrastructure where required. This would also reduce water
               wastage and ensure prioritized investments; and
            •	 Improving access to sanitation for the population in general is required, given subpar
               access to waste water treatment, which is important for limiting contamination resulting
               from soiled water (health impact, food safety impact) as well as reaching the standards
               under the EU acquis.
      4.40	 Boosting brains: improving education services and labor market skills. Raising the human
            capital of the population and aligning education and training systems with labor markets
            contributes to shared prosperity. While literacy is high, the education system does not
            produce the results one would expect given the high level of spending. The following
            priorities stand out:

            •	 Reorienting financing toward early childhood education to reduce intergenerational
               transfer of poverty, especially as ECE is particularly beneficial for children from poorer
               families, as they are less likely to receive sufficient support from home;
            •	 Improving the quality and efficiency of higher education by strengthening quality
               assurance mechanisms, and improving planning and financing would help to ensuring
               that employers can be sure of minimal standards; and
            •	 Increasing transparency and equity in spending can be improved by the introduction of
               per capita financing (PCF) so that funding can follow the student.

CHAPTER FIVE

Managing risks for sustainable
growth

BiH faces three types of interrelated risks which have been interrupting the country’s quest for higher
economic growth and shared prosperity over the last years. First, BiH is vulnerable to environmental
shocks, including drought, floods and earthquakes. Since 2010, BiH has experienced several
environmental shocks, including a heat wave that triggered forest fires (in Europe’s largest
forested area), droughts that reduced energy generation by a quarter and destroyed 70 percent
of corn and vegetable crops, and extraordinary floods causing damages and losses estimated at
up to 15 percent of GDP. Second, BiH is vulnerable to external economic and financial shocks. The
global financial and subsequent Euro crisis triggered economic stagnation and contraction. There
are several transmission channels which make BiH vulnerable to external shocks, including the
financial sector (strong role of Austrian and Italian banks), trade (EU remains the main trading
partner) and remittances (Bosnian emigrants financial transfers still represent more than 10
percent of GDP). Third, BiH’s social stability is fragile. Early 2014, the country faced severe riots
around Tuzla. Protesters expressed their discontent against the lack of job opportunities and
perceived corruption.

This section will also take a deeper look into the risks of climate change and broader environmental
management issues, especially as urban pollution causes significant health risks and threatens
shared prosperity and social stability. This is also linked to energy pricing which does not reflect
usage. Combined with the lowest energy efficiency in Europe this contributes to unsustainable use
of energy and increased levels of pollution.



5.1	 Environmental and climate risks
5.1	          BiH has started to experience adverse effects of climate change. BiH’s GHG emissions per
              capita are about half of the EU average: 5.2 tons carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent per annum
              compared to the EU average of 9.9 tons (2008) and, as a small economy, they represent
              just a fraction of total world emissions.140 The GHG intensity of BiH’s economy, however,
              is almost four times higher than in the EU: emissions per Euro of GDP amounted to 1.6 kg
              CO2 equivalent while the EU average was 0.4 kg in 2008.141 The high GHG intensity of BiH’s
              economy is symptomatic of energy and industrial inefficiencies and, in urban areas, can
              have negative health implications. Regardless of its low contribution to the causes of climate
              change, BiH is faced with the negative consequences of this global challenge.

5.2	          Observed temperature and precipitation changes confirm that climate change is affecting
              BiH. During 1961-2010, temperatures increased in all areas of the country. Increases in
              annual air temperature ranged from 0.4 to 0.8 °C, while increases during the growing season

                 (April to September) reached 1 °C.142 The rate at which temperature increase has risen over
                 the last decade may indicate that BiH is experiencing the impact of climate change at an
                 accelerating rate. Although the level of annual precipitation did not significantly change
                 during the same period, the number of rainfall days per year decreased while the number
                 of intense rainfall days increased.143 This is a significant change to the rainfall pattern,
                 particularly when combined with temperature increases. This change is likely to result in
                 less moisture in the soil (potentially increasing the frequency and magnitude of droughts)
                 and an increased likelihood of floods.

      5.3	       Increased climate variability is apparent in all seasons and across the entire territory of
                 BiH. In 2012, BiH experienced a heat wave that triggered forest fires, as well as heat-related
                 health conditions and emergencies. These forest fires also spread through areas with land
                 mines that remain from the war and some of the mines exploded. Controlling such fires is
                 made more difficult by the continued existence of mines and unexploded ordnance. Heat
                 waves have been accompanied by droughts, reducing river levels, affecting hydropower
                 generation, destroying agricultural crops—and driving up food prices, especially for meat
                 and milk. The drought and high temperatures in the summer of 2012 cost approximately
                 $1 billion in lost agricultural production and destroyed almost 70 percent of vegetables
                 and corn.144

      5.4	       BiH has also been exposed to other extreme weather events, including severe winters
                 and flooding. In February 2012, a heavy snowfall hit BiH and the region, prompting a
                 state of emergency. BiH experienced water, food, fuel and medicine shortages, power and
                 telecommunications outages, avalanches, and transportation system shutdowns. Many
                 villages were completely cut off and isolated during the storm. In early 2014, BiH and the
                 region were hit hard by floods and related landslides. The rain was the heaviest in 120 years.
                 “Estimates indicate an overall impact of around $1.6 billion of physical damage (8 percent
                 of GDP) and $1.2 billion of economic loss (6 percent of GDP) from the floods.”145 The floods
                 had an adverse impact on a large share of the population and land mass. “As of end-May
                 2014, 25 people had died, about 90,000 people had been evacuated, and about 1 million
                 or one-fourth of the total population had been directly affected in around 60 of BiH’s 142
                 municipalities. The affected area covers more than one-third of the country’s territory, and
                 the massive floods have caused over 3,000 landslides.”146 The housing, energy, transport,
                 water and sanitation, agriculture and services sectors were among the worst affected.

      5.5	       Floods in May 2014 exposed BiH’s vulnerability to extreme weather, with the poor suffering
                 in particular. The floods are estimated to have cost the equivalent of nearly 15 percent
                 of GDP (9.3 percent in damages and 5.6 percent in losses) in 2014 in BiH. The removal of
                 trees (minor deforestation147) in some key areas around rivers as well as construction (often

          residential) in flood plains exacerbated the situation. The flooding also undermined growth
          prospects in some key sectors; the repair of roads and bridges in the forest estate required
          SOEs to redirect scarce capital to infrastructure repair rather than planned plantation
          investments.148 A lack of investment in flood control is also likely partly responsible, with
          needed new infrastructure investments estimated to cost over €500 million.149 An EU-led
          Recovery and Needs Assessment estimated that the cumulative impact could put BiH back
          into recession, increase poverty, and exert pressure on public finances.150 The B40 are
          more than twice as likely to work in agriculture as the T60, and therefore suffer most from
          weather shocks that disrupt agricultural productivity, and the loss of crops drives up the
          prices of food for all. A fully fledged strategy and set of policies that provided a coordinated
          prevention and response to extreme weather could have helped the authorities to take
          action that would have reduced the negative impact of the floods.

5.6	      Climate models predict that temperatures will rise by up to 1.0°C, with rainfall becoming
          less regular. Temperature increases (Figure 5.1) in BiH are likely to have largely detrimental
          effects, particularly as predicted higher temperatures are associated with reduced rainfall
          (Figure 5.2) and higher evaporation rates for inland areas of the country. An average
          temperature increase greater than 2° C will result in costly adaptation and impacts that will
          exceed the adaptive capacity of many ecological systems. Climate change scenarios show
          significant decrease of precipitation in the region, especially during the summer season,
          which could lead to an increase of drought occurrence/frequency, intensity, and impacts.
          The increasing frequency and magnitude of droughts in recent decades, with its impact on
          agricultural production and water management sector emphasize the need for addressing
          the issue of droughts via tailored climate change related policies. Since 2000, there have
          been several drought years in BiH: 2000, 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2012.151

5.7	      BiH’s vulnerability to flood risks could also endanger the country’s fiscal sustainability.
          The government’s liability associated with a once-in-a-50-year flood152 could amount to
          more than $680 million, equivalent to about 4 percent of the country’s GDP (Figure 5.3).
          By a different measure, a once-in-a-25-year flood is estimated to cause at least 1 percent
          loss in government revenues. More frequent events could entail significant fiscal risks. For
          instance, a once-in-a-10-year flood, with a 10 percent chance of occurring in any given year,
          could generate public damages and losses exceeding $500 million, equivalent to 3.5 percent
          of BiH’s GDP.

    permanent crops such as high value permanent crops, and fixed assets remain destroyed. Smaller farms, which represent a significant proportion of

      5.8	                        Due to their exposure and sensitivity to natural changes, agriculture, water and hydropower
                                  sectors are most vulnerable to climate change. Of the total area of BiH, 46 percent is
                                  agricultural land. Climate is the primary determinant of agricultural productivity in the
                                  country. The impact of future climate change on the agricultural sector is forecast to be
                                  largely negative. Despite the abundance of water resources in the country, irrigation
                                  infrastructure is very limited: only 0.65 percent of arable land is irrigated. More hot
                                  days, reduced rainfall and higher aridity in the summer will increase the probability
                                  of droughts and lower river flows, which will in turn worsen water quality and supply.
                                  Conversely, fall and winter seasons will likely see increased frequency of floods.
                                  Increasingly erratic river discharges will also negatively affect the hydropower sector.
                                  While low river flows could halt production of hydroelectric power thus jeopardizing
                                  energy security and electricity exports, increased peak river flows in the event of floods
                                  could damage the hydropower infrastructure.

5.9	     BiH is also exposed to earthquake risks. The last devastating earthquake affected Banja
         Luka in 1969 destroying almost 60 percent of dwellings as well as partially damaging or
         completely destroying 266 schools and 592 cultural, health, social and business facilities. 
         Currently, the potential losses153 of a severe earthquake could be 15 to 24 percent of
         the GDP and affect almost 20 percent of the country’s population. The most vulnerable
         segment of the population exposed to seismic risk is the B40 because of the quality of the
         infrastructure they live in. Old construction and poor construction control position them in
         a riskier situation than the rest of the population.

5.10	 Long-standing high pollution levels reduce living standards, harm health, and reduces
      works days, with poorer groups more likely to suffer from air pollution than other groups.
      This stems from the choice of place to reside (wealthier people tend not to live in the worst
      polluted areas154) and because poorer households are more likely to use solid heating and
      cooking fuels (such as wood or coal)155, which pollute more. The WHO estimated that 58
      percent of the population in BiH used solid fuels for heating purposes in 2012156 compared
      with 38 percent in Albania and 32 percent in Serbia.157 This has large health implications. A
      2013 meta-analysis estimated that every increase or 10 mg/m3 of PM10 is associated with a
      22 percent increase in cases of lung cancer158, resulting in higher health costs.

5.11	 Available data suggest that air quality in Sarajevo has improved since Yugoslav periods
      but can become critical at some time of the year. Due to its valley topography and lack of
      breeze, Sarajevo is particularly susceptible to air pollution. A World Bank report from 1972
      recorded sulfur dioxide (SO2) levels of 1,500 micrograms per cubic meter of air (mg/m3) on
      average over a 24 hour period.159 This compared with US standards at the time of 365 mg/
      m3 and 2013 WHO guidelines of 20 mg/m3. At the same time soot had reached 1,000 mg/
      m3 compared with 2013 WHO guidelines of 50 mg/m3. The main sources of the pollution
      were the burning of wood and lignite for heating combined with fast industrialization of
      the city. Pollution levels have declined significantly since the Yugoslav period, partly as a
      result of a loss of heavy industry and partly thanks to reduced burning of wood and coal for
      heating. Nonetheless, reports of high pollution are frequent in winter. In 2012, for example,
      according to Sarajevo Canton, SO2 concentrations reached 130 mg/m3, over five times
      the WHO recommended limit, while concentration of Particulate Matter (PM), including
      soot, reached 500 mg/m3, ten times WHO recommended limits.160 Demonstrations against
      pollution in the industrial city of Zenica were held in December 2014 and February 2015,
      suggesting that in some urban areas, pollution could act as a catalyst for social instability.

      5.13	 Social instability in BiH could be provoked Source: WDI
            through two channels: (i) implementing
            reforms and (ii) not implementing reforms. Walking the path between the two will require
            resolve, good communication, and good timing of reforms.

      5.14	 A general belief exists that the status quo in BiH favors social peace. Examples abound of
            inefficiencies in public spending, public service provision or institutional structures designed
            to “keep the peace”. For example:

             •	 The high spending on war veterans, even those who are well off, working-age and able-
                bodied may help to reduce the likelihood that they create social unrest.
             •	 The institutional structure of BiH, aims partly to ensure that people attached strongly to
                ethnic identities feel empowered.
             •	 The large number of people working in the public sector and high spending on public
                sector wages helps to reduce the chances that “insiders” will challenge the system or that
                unemployment will increase in the short-term.
      5.15	 Potentially negative consequences of these efforts remain, which themselves could lead
            to social instability. The high taxes required to finance public sector wages and veterans’
            benefits including so-called “privileged pensions” (going to groups such as retired judges
            or high-level public servants) impose a burden on workers and firms and may prejudice                    �


            growth, potentially harming social stability in the longer-term. In the health sector, public
            resources are wasted due to the duplication of occasionally-used medical services, which
            also provides increased opportunities for corruption.

      5.16	 While efforts must be made to ensure social peace, a risk remains that society as a whole
            is held hostage by a few special interest groups. The status quo results in transfers from
            “outsiders” to special interest groups of “insiders”. For example, from youth—who have high
            poverty rates and suffer from poorer education or lack of employment—to older people,
            with low poverty rates. Or from the unemployed—who are unable to find work—to the
            employed, who cost an average of two thirds of their output and often cannot be fired. Or
            from the private sector—which must pay high taxes—to public servants, whose salaries are
            paid with high taxes borne by society.

5. Managing risks for sustainable growth



5.17	 The public vented some of these frustrations in demonstrations that erupted in February
      2014. The demonstrations were sparked by unemployed people who formerly worked at large
      SOEs in Tuzla, and spread quickly across other parts of the country. They protested initially
      about pensions and unpaid social security contributions but the broader demonstrations
      revealed a frustration with corruption (see Box 1.1) and poor public services. Making the
      reforms that address the frustrations, which will be required to maintain social stability in
      the medium to long term, while considering the need to maintain it in the short term, will
      be challenging.

5.18	 Social risks and risks for a sustainable public sector able to effectively implement reforms
      may be posed by the institutional structure, or at least the way in which it functions. For
      example, reducing public expenditure to GDP from its very high level and addressing the
      large financing disparities between the various levels of government will be more challenging
      with the current institutional structure. BiH’s fragmented governance structure creates an
      environment which results in different qualities of basic public services in different parts
      of the countries, likely provides increased opportunities for corruption and over-regulates
      businesses, often in inconsistent ways. This SCD focuses on economic and social reforms
      within the existing BiH governance structures, but existing institutional arrangements may
      pose an implementation risk which could make it more difficult to achieve a number of the
      reforms recommended by this SCD.    

5.3	 Emerging issues and reform areas: Sustainability
5.19	 BiH has been affected by shocks and a high likelihood remains that the country will be
      exposed to future shocks. While it will not be possible to eliminate these risks, BiH can
      reduce them and build buffers to protect against the impact of the shocks. Increasing BiH’s
      resilience to shocks will require action on several fronts. This will require building and
      maintaining sound macro-economic and fiscal management which will be the bedrock of
      reducing vulnerability to external economic and environmental shocks. Building sufficient
      fiscal reserves will be an essential part of this. BiH has also the weakest financial stability
      framework in SEE, with Entity-level governments that are responsible for supporting the
      financial system in the event of a systemic crisis unlikely to have the financial firepower
      or borrowing capacity to do so. Reducing the risks associated with environmental shocks
      will require building a coherent strategy for reducing existing risk, avoiding the creation of
      new risk and responding more efficiently to such shocks, as well as building further the
      institutional ability to deal with such shocks. This would ideally entail a broad approach that
      considers inter-related factors together including forestry, agriculture, municipal planning
      and climate change risk mitigation. Issues such as erosion control and flood management in
      and around towns and cities would particularly benefit from such a cross-sectoral approach.

      5.20	 For BiH, to become more resilient to shocks, the country needs to focus on a number of
            reform areas:

           •	 Reducing the risks of environmental degradation and natural disasters would entail
              sufficient flood water defenses, improved agricultural irrigation, an effective social safety
              net, robust transport infrastructure, an expanded insurance mechanism and, crucially,
              building sufficient fiscal space to be able to respond to disasters.
           •	 Reducing risks associated with external economic shocks will require an effective social
              safety net and building sufficient fiscal space to cushion economic shocks. Strengthening
              financial system oversight and abilities to deal with a systemic crisis would help to reduce
              this risk.
           •	 Reducing the risk of social instability will require walking the thin line between labor
              market and business environment and SOE reforms that create a more inclusive society,
              while mitigating negative impacts on vulnerable groups and communicating well with
              those who benefit from the status quo.

Identifying priorities for accelerated,
inclusive and sustainable growth

6.1	     This SCD makes the case that BiH can build on its strengths to achieve higher, more
         inclusive and sustainable growth. BiH can leverage its proximity to Europe, and a reputation
         for stable macroeconomic policies, including during the global crisis. The country also has
         a few industrial clusters which date back to Yugoslav times, as well as an emergent urban
         service sector that has the potential to attract investment and create jobs, similar to its
         peers in Central and Eastern Europe.

6.2	     However, in order to succeed, BiH needs to fundamentally adjust its economic development
         model, which is out of balance. High consumption, imports and a large public sector are
         dwarfing investment, exports and the private sector (Figure 6.1); BiH requires incentives and
         policies to generate a more productive, investment-driven and outward-oriented economic
         model (Figure 6.2). The current inward-oriented and consumption-led economic approach
         has helped to reduce poverty in the aftermath of the war but is not sustainable for the
         following reasons:

         •	 The growth model was based on high public and private consumption, with BiH having
            one of the world’s highest rates of consumption at over 100 percent of GDP. This is not a
            sustainable path to prosperity.
         •	 This consumption-led economic model is also behind BiH’s trade imbalances with high
            imports and weak exports. BiH’s production base was constrained by, among others, a
            poor business environment and rigid labor laws, holding back growth and employment
            generating exports.
         •	 The economy stopped growing because investments were too low as the dominant public
            sector spent most of its resources on consumption and transfers, and the investment
            climate and regulatory regime made it difficult to create jobs.

                                             6. Identifying priorities for accelerated, inclusive and sustainable growth



      6.3	   These challenges are compounded by BiH’s historical and institutional legacy. BiH’s history
             is that of comparatively low income in Yugoslavia, as well as social fragmentation, war,
             large-scale emigration and dependency on donors immediately after the war. Today BiH is at
             peace, but living standards by some measures are yet to catch up with their pre-war levels.
             Unlike many other emerging economies, the country faces the additional challenge of an
             aging and shrinking population living largely in rural areas, slow pace of urbanization, and
             fragmented institutions.

      6.4	   Growth has been good for the poor in BiH but it has been almost a decade since the
             country grew at or above five percent. The analysis and consultations conducted for this
             SCD confirmed that economic growth is key for tackling poverty and boosting the living
             standards of the B40. When the economy grew strongly, especially between 1996 and 2008,
             the poor benefitted even more than the average. For BiH, the main challenge is to reach
             higher growth again and to mitigate the negative impact of shocks. BiH was badly hit by the
             global financial crisis with almost no growth between 2009 and 2013. The economy is also
             highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including flooding, which in 2014 caused damage and
             losses estimated at close to 15 percent of GDP.

      6.5	   BiH also faces a challenge of inclusion, although the main issues they face are often similar
             to those faced by the population in general. Almost half of the population of BiH is at
             risk of poverty or exclusion (AROPE) by some measures. Excluded groups often face the
             same problems as the rest of the population. Roma groups, for example, cited the poor
             business environment as a challenge they face, while Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender
             (LGBT) groups noted that finding employment was challenging. Higher growth and more
             flexible labor markets will help these groups. For example, poorer groups—that are often
             excluded from the labor market due to high labor taxes and rigid labor market laws—would
             benefit from tax reform and labor market reform more than wealthier groups. However,
             additional more targeted measures are warranted. As the 2014 EU progress report notes,
             there is violence against specific minorities, including LGBT, while Roma face various forms
             of discrimination.

      6.6	   With a broad range of challenges in mind, the SCD considered which reform areas could
             have the most impact on the twin goals, focusing in particular on reforms that could boost
             broad-based economic growth. The key reform areas identified are generally those whose
             benefits have the potential to improve the lives of large segments of society as well as
             numerous productive areas of the economy. For example, while certain productive sectors
             (such as agriculture, tourism or forestry) are seen by some as having the capacity to boost
             growth and support the B40 (given their geographic location and sectoral composition of
             employment), these sectors face constraints similar to firms operating in other sectors,
             including the region’s worst business climate and transport system. Similarly, supporting
             both growth of the productive sector, and employment for the B40 will require tackling the
             constraints of high labor taxes and rigid labor market laws.

6.1	 Priority-setting exercise
6.7	     Based on the analysis in this SCD and consultations with stakeholders, ten key reform
         areas were identified to help BiH move toward shared prosperity (see Annex XV for
         methodological details). This SCD goes further in its prioritization to identify the top four
         priorities to accelerate growth and achieve the Twin Goals. The prioritization exercise
         grouped the key reform areas into three categories based on their estimated contribution to
         achieving growth, shared prosperity and poverty reduction (Table 6.1).

      6.8	   This section will present specific reforms and policies underpinning the identified priority
             reform areas. The SCD identified four top priority areas which are centered on accelerating
             growth and creating jobs which is of highest importance for BiH in the coming years. These
             top reforms are complemented by four high priority and two medium priority areas. The
             high priority areas are important for the medium-term sustainability of BiH’s development
             path, both environmentally and economically. The remaining two priority areas focus on
             reducing pollution and increasing agricultural productivity, including through addressing
             land market reforms and improving transportation networks.

      Top reform priorities

      6.9	   Reforming the labor market, improving social protection delivery, and reducing the cost
             of labor will help put BiH citizens, including especially under-employed groups such as
             females and youth, back to work. Employment in BiH is hindered by a double burden of
             high taxation and highly sclerotic markets. High labor taxes combined with low thresholds
             mean that lower income groups are particularly hit by high taxation. Some of this tax burden
             could be shifted away from labor and toward other areas, such as tobacco and transport
             fuel (raising prices back to pre-oil price crash levels), which alone could raise over 5 percent
             of GDP in revenue, the equivalent of a third of that currently raised from social security
             contributions. Reducing the tax burden on jobs would help to improve the competitiveness
             of most productive sectors in the economy (including agriculture, manufacturing and
             tourism). Shifting the tax burden away from the B40 should help to boost shared prosperity.
             In addition, social protection is currently poorly targeted, with significantly more absorbed
             by wealthier groups than in neighboring countries. At the same time, many needy people
             do not receive benefits. With many of the poor having larger families, the risk of inter-
             generational poverty transfer is high. Improving the targeting of social benefits could help to
             reduce poverty and, critically, inter-generational poverty transfer. Making the labor market
             more flexible could help increase supply and demand for employment. Ultimately, the
             unemployed, many of whom are in the B40, would likely benefit greatly.

      6.10	 An improved business environment will increase BiH’s competitiveness and make it
            more attractive to investors. With one of Europe’s poorest quality business environments,
            BiH risks preventing its private sector from competing in export markets and even in the
            domestic market. Business licensing, inspections, trading across borders, paying taxes,
            registering real properties, and phytosanitary standards are all significant issues. Improving
            the business climate would help to improve competitiveness and boost exports from a large
            number of sectors, but particularly agriculture, which suffers from a lack of accreditation to
            meet EU standards. Investments including FDI could be boosted and BiH could take a further
            step toward aligning with EU best practices. Reforms that help to spur private sector growth
            will also boost sustainable employment, benefitting the B40. With potential increased
            agricultural and manufacturing exports—areas in which the poor and B40 are more likely
            to work—improvements in the business environment will help to boost shared prosperity.
            Specific groups that suffer from poverty, such as the rural poor with large households,
            could also benefit from improved employment prospects and the increased ability to sell
            agricultural output.

6. Identifying priorities for accelerated, inclusive and sustainable growth



6.11	 Creating an efficient, effective and sustainable government will require reducing the size
      of the public sector and ensuring fiscal sustainability. Gradually reducing the public sector
      role in the economy, including through reduced SOE presence (particularly those that no
      longer function), would help to re-allocate resources (including the land and buildings as
      well as workers, employed in the public sector) toward the more productive private sector.
      Increased efficiency in expenditures would help to improve public services, including
      in health, to which the B40 do not always have equal access. Ensuring infrastructure is
      prioritized and that EU resources are efficiently absorbed would help increase employment,
      improve public service delivery and support economic growth. Expenditure reductions
      could be implemented in conjunction with efforts to strengthen the effectiveness of the
      social protection system to provide an effective social safety net to low income households.

6.12	 BiH needs modern and efficient economic infrastructure in order to grow and ensure
      inclusion. Improving transport and ICT infrastructure would help to connect rural
      populations to services, including health, education and banking as well as employment
      in larger settlements. In addition it would help rural businesses—such as agriculture—to
      reduce costs and reach consumers. Improving the ability to export—through improved ports
      or soft infrastructure at land borders—would be a boon for exporters in all sectors, including
      agriculture and manufacturing, and help firms from BiH insert themselves into European
      supply chains. It could also encourage export-oriented FDI and provide a boost to tourism
      potential. Improving ICT could help to facilitate communication for all, and in rural areas
      could provide access to services without the need for travel. It would also help private sector
      firms to access customers at home and abroad, and assist the nascent IT sector, which often
      serves customers in Western Europe or North America. Ensuring sufficient power supply—
      including through a renewed effort to boost renewable generation capacity—would help to
      reduce the likelihood of power shortages and maintain future economic growth. It would
      also help BiH to boost net exports, providing a valuable contribution to financing imports
      and helping to protect macro-stability. At the same time, cost-reflective tariffs would be
      important to ensure sufficient investment in the sector and to reduce over-consumption of
      power. Tackling energy inefficiency would help to improve the competitiveness of exporters
      (partly compensating for increased tariffs), and reduce urban pollution (which harms the
      poor in particular and has resulted in protests in 2014 and 2015).

                                              High reform priorities

6.13	 BiH needs to strengthen its resilience to adverse natural events. Along with other countries
      in the region, BiH has suffered over recent years from a sequence of environmental shocks.
      These include a harsh winter that hit consumption and construction, a drought that harmed
      agriculture, and severe floods that cost up to 15 percent of GDP. In 2012, these shocks
      contributed to pushing BiH into a double dip recession. Construction in flood plains of
      residential areas and businesses, as well as under-developed flood protections exacerbated
      the problems. BiH is also vulnerable to other adverse natural events, such as earthquakes.
      Natural disasters create significant set-backs for economic growth. They may be especially
      harmful for poorer groups and small firms that do not have the ability to bounce back easily.

                                             6. Identifying priorities for accelerated, inclusive and sustainable growth



            Weather shocks are also particularly harmful for those in rural areas, many of whom are
            in the B40 and rely on agriculture. Ensuring resilience to such shocks is essential both for
            sustainable economic growth and for the livelihoods of the B40.

      6.14	 Improving education services and labor market skills is key to escaping poverty. Education
            is closely linked to employment and being in the B40. Quality education, especially pre-
            school, is essential for escaping from poverty. Despite the importance of education there
            is a lack of focus on the quality of education, with no national level exams guaranteeing
            learning standards and a proliferation of under-regulated universities. Some firms complain
            of skills constraints, with there being some evidence that larger firms are much more likely
            to suffer from skills shortages than smaller ones. Improving education and skills training
            would benefit the whole population but would have particular advantages for the poor,
            the B40 and rural dwellers, who have a poverty incidence twice as high as their urban
            counterparts, around half of which is explained by education differences. Providing access to
            opportunities for adult training would help these rural poor. Improved quality of education
            for their children—particularly early childhood education—would also be a significant step
            toward ensuring that inter-generational poverty transfer is reduced.

      6.15	 Improving health services and access to water and sanitation may reduce burden on the
            budget, while improving coverage including for at-risk groups, such as Roma. While BiH
            performs reasonably on some health indicators, such as life expectancy, it faces strong
            challenges and high costs in other areas, such as treating obesity, stunting and other non-
            communicable diseases. Combined with fragmentation in service delivery (especially
            in FBiH) and poor pharmaceutical procurement practices this means BiH has the highest
            public health spending in the region. Reforms in this sector would improve health care
            while reducing the burden on the budget. Changing the financing structure could further
            reduce budget costs, and increase social security contributions, while maintaining coverage.
            Increasing taxes on tobacco could reduce usage in one of the world’s highest consuming
            countries and help to pay for reduced taxes on labor. Some of the resources freed could be
            used to improve health care services, including the basic services that some of the poor lack.
            Access to sewage facilities is low, particularly in rural areas and among the B40. This forces
            rural dwellers—who tend to be poorer—to use more expensive facilities, such as septic
            tanks. The lack of sewage treatment also poses health hazards and environmental issues,
            threatening potential growth sectors such as tourism and agriculture, in which many of the
            poor and B40 work. Finally, sanitation improvements may prove to be the most expensive
            EU acquis criteria to meet, posing issues of ensuring sufficient (EU) resources are available
            and the effective management of these resources. Higher—and uniformly levied—tariffs
            would help to provide resources for investment in reducing leakages and improving water
            treatment, yielding environmental and health benefits. It would also ensure future provision
            of water for the private sector, including agriculture (which has suffered repeatedly from
            droughts in recent years).

6. Identifying priorities for accelerated, inclusive and sustainable growth



                                           Medium reform priorities

6.16	 Maintaining financial stability while expanding access to finance is a pre-requisite for
      sustainable shared prosperity. Financial stability has been broadly maintained but new risks
      are emerging, including rising NPLs. A lack of depth in domestic financial markets limits access
      to capital for firms and may increase the costs of public sector borrowing. A lack of access to
      finance appears to constrain firm output and employment growth in firms, harming growth
      and shared prosperity as well as reducing fiscal receipts.

6.17	 Reducing pollution and protecting the environment would help to promote sustainable
      growth. Preventing wooded areas or forests from being destroyed in flood-prone areas
      would help to reduce the impact of flooding. Cleaning trash from water systems would
      prevent it from being returned to agricultural or urban areas during floods, reducing health
      risks.

6.18	 Boosting agricultural productivity and opportunities would support many of the 60
      percent of the population who live in rural areas. Upgrading agricultural productivity and
      enhancing agribusiness activity will benefit all, but will provide a direct benefit for the poor
      who primarily live in rural areas, partly directly, and partly through increased employment
      opportunities. Land market reform will improve access to land.

6.2	 Trade-offs and complementarities between reforms
6.19	 As often in the policy environment, some reform areas are complementary to each other
      even if they are not all considered top priorities. For example, the team identified some
      specific areas of the High or Medium Priorities that could be considered as particularly
      important because, for example, they help to reduce public sector costs or because they can
      help to ensure improved project implementation in the future or because they begin the
      reform process in other areas by targeting knowledge gaps. These areas include: (i) beginning
      to identify skills needs of firms, and training officials at education ministries on international
      quality standards; and (ii) identifying data needs in all sectors and setting in motion efforts
      to collect this information. In addition, while health reforms are considered a secondary
      priority, increasing pharmaceutical procurement efficiency and decoupling health insurance
      from unemployment benefits were considered to be particularly important as they can help
      to boost employment and generate needed fiscal savings. In all cases, BiH’s track record
      of producing laws of reasonable quality but without satisfactory implementation needs
      to be considered when crafting a reform agenda and translating reforms into policy and
      enforcement mechanisms.

6.20	 Reforms will not be easy and, while necessary, some would likely have short-term impacts
      that would need to be partially mitigated. There are several obvious examples. Reducing
      the size of the public sector would require a growing private sector to create jobs for those
      who would otherwise be in public employment. Similarly reforming SOEs may result in
      short-term increases in unemployment (either because people lose jobs which involve going
      to work on a daily basis or because people lose jobs officially that, de facto, have not existed
      for some time). Steps would need to be taken to mitigate the negative impacts including

                                              6. Identifying priorities for accelerated, inclusive and sustainable growth



            through (re-)training and a functioning social welfare mechanism. An additional example
            can be found for energy tariffs. While below-cost energy tariffs are unsustainable, increases
            would have social impacts that would need to be mitigated. Cost-saving reforms (such as
            pharmaceutical procurement reform) could free resources for alternative investments.

      6.21	 Some recommended reforms make others more urgent. Public sector and SOE reforms
            make improvements in the targeting of social benefits and business environment reforms
            more essential as a means to cushion the any negative impacts. In addition, improvements
            in training and employment services would also be helpful. Increases in energy tariffs make
            social welfare reforms more important.

      6.3	 Areas with significant knowledge gaps
      6.22	 Some potential reform areas, which appeared to be important, lacked sufficient information
            to make judgments, and there were also gaps within some of the reform areas that were
            impossible to evaluate. These gaps include:

            •	 Better knowledge of SOEs, including those at canton or municipal level, including the
               number of employees, whether or not they are working, and whether or not the SOE
               itself is operational.
            •	 Better education data, including on quality of outcomes, and the skills required by the
               private sector.
            •	 Better understanding of likely available resources from the EU if the accession process
               advances quickly.
            •	 Better, more regular, and more broadly available household data to understand the
               performance over time of the poor, B40 and population in general, including information
               on income.
            •	 Better and more regularly available data on firm performance, including employment.
            •	 Better and more regular data on household incomes, rather than just consumption.
      6.23	 Finally, the team also identified several issues that were not analyzed (in depth) in this
            SCD but could be considered in the future. These include: civil service reforms; widespread
            health re-organization or liberalization; completion of the SOE privatization; development of
            gas storage (possibly regionally); shifting energy generation away from coal; systematically
            cleaning the countryside; immigration liberalization; regional transport connections
            including holding companies; land reform.

      6.24	 With so many serious challenges in BiH, it is a notable caveat that this list is neither easy
            to prioritize within nor should it be seen it as exhaustive. This is particularly the case since
            some reforms may be complementary, and sequencing may be important for others. Some
            areas may need a mix of ‘quick wins’ and long-term construction projects. Selecting which
            to begin with is not clear-cut. Furthermore, the selected reform areas have the capability
            of contributing to several areas of the economy and improving the lives of many groups of
            people. However, in a country where challenges abound, views observed in consultations
            range from the need to “change the mentality” to “change the constitution” or from “focus
            on tourism” to “provide more rural services”.

      Annex I: Institutional Structures and Weaknesses


      7.1	     BiH institutions comprise the Council of Ministers, a rotating State Presidency, a two
               chamber legislature, a central bank and a constitutional court.166
              •	 The Council of Ministers consists of the chairman and nine ministers. The Council’s
                 responsibilities include the following areas: foreign policy, defense, security, justice,
                 foreign trade and economic relations, transport and communication, civil affairs, human
                 rights and refugees, and finance and treasury.
              •	 The Parliamentary Assembly is bicameral, with a House of Peoples and a House
                 of Representatives, each consisting of two-thirds of delegates from FBiH (divided
                 equally among Croats and Bosnians) and one-third from RS. The Parliament’s
                 responsibilities include: enacting legislation to implement decisions of Presidency or
                 to carry out constitutional responsibilities; deciding on revenue sources and amounts
                 for institutional operations and international obligations; approving a budget for
                 government institutions, etc.
              •	 The Presidency consists of three members: one Bosniak and one Croat, each directly
                 elected from the territory of FBiH, and one Serb directly elected from RS. Presidency
                 powers include: foreign policy; representing country in international forums and European
                 organizations; treaties; proposing annual budget to Assembly; reporting to Assembly on
                 expenditures, etc.
              •	 The Presidency nominates the Chair of the Council of Ministers, who in turn nominate
                 governmental Ministers and Deputy Ministers (but not from their same constituency). No
                 more than two-thirds of all Ministers may be appointed from the territory of FBiH.
              •	 The Constitutional Court has nine members, with four members selected by the House
                 of Representatives of the Federation, and two members by the Assembly of RS. The
                 remaining three members are selected by the President of the European Court of Human
                 Rights after consultation with the Presidency.
              •	 The Central Bank is the sole authority for issuing currency and for monetary policy
                 throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. It operates a currency board with the Euro.

      7.2	                           The international community established the Office of the High Representative (OHR)
                                     in 1995 to oversee civilian peace implementation and administration. This included
                                     economic reconstruction, humanitarian aid, protection of human rights, and the holding
                                     of free elections. One of the OHRs aims was to help the country develop into a peaceful,
                                     democratic state. Importantly, in 1997, the OHR was also given the executive authority
                                     to impose decisions, push reforms and remove government officials from office (Bonn
                                     Powers). The Peace Implementation Council (PIC), a group of 55 countries and international
                                     organizations, oversees the OHR. From 2002-11, the High Representative also served as the
                                     European Special Representative to BiH. The OHR remains in place.

      7.3	                           A NATO-led peacekeeping force (Implementation Force- IFOR) was also put into place to
                                     implement the military aspects of the agreement, taking over from the UN Protection
                                     Forces (UNPROFOR). It was followed in 2004 by a smaller European Union military force,
                                     EUFOR. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe was charged with
                                     organizing the first free elections in 1996. Refugees and displaced persons were given the
                                     right to vote.

      7.4	                           The Dayton Accords succeeded in their aim of bringing peace but the institutional
                                     arrangements were not meant to be permanent. Richard Holbrooke, an American
                                     diplomat who brokered the accords, noted that “the most important thing was to stop
                                     the killing”. However, while they succeeded in this, John C. Kornblum, a retired United
                                     States ambassador” who drafted the Dayton accords as the diplomat Richard C. Holbrooke
                                     negotiated them, noted that the complex mechanisms they put in place were intended
                                     primarily to secure peace, but they were also supposed to be replaced in three years with a
                                     more streamlined governmental structure.

                Note: Prevalence of bribery is calculated as the number of businesses who gave a public oﬃcial money, a gift or counter favour on at least one occasion in the 12 months prior to the survey, as a percentage of
                businesses who in the same period had at least one contact with a public oﬃcial. The average number of bribes refers to average number of bribes given by all bribe-payers, i.e. those who paid at least one bribe
                in the 12 months prior to the survey. The bars indicate the conﬁdence interval for the prevalence of briberry at 95 percent conﬁdence level.

      Annex II: Urban advantages?


      7.5	                                          Most rural dwellers expect to remain in the countryside and are attached to it. According
                                                    to the RHS, around 84 percent expect that they will still live in the countryside in 2020,
                                                    though just 44 percent expect their children will be in the countryside. Only 41 percent of
                                                    rural residents would be prepared to change their place of residence “if the need arises”,
                                                    while over half would continue to live in the countryside and commute if they got a job in
                                                    a city. Just 18 percent would be prepared to sell agricultural land to invest in a business
                                                    proposed by their child.

      7.6	                                          Rural residents would jump at the chance of a state job. Despite their attachment to the
                                                    land and unwillingness to invest in a business, 60 percent of rural dwellers would leave their
                                                    current job if they were offered a job in a state institution.

      7.7	                                          Rural residents consider some aspects of life to be better in rural areas. The food,
                                                    environment, and health are all considered to be better in rural areas by rural dwellers
                                                    (Figure 7.16). However the young rural are much more likely than their older counterparts
                                                    to favor urban areas (Figure 7.8).

      7.8	                                          A reasonable quality of life combined with urban challenges likely keep people in rural
                                                    areas. Rural households have reasonable (if improvable) access to services, an agricultural
                                                    safety net, high social protection payments, better food, environment and health than urban
                                                    dwellers. Rural wages in the RS were only 8.9 percent lower than urban ones (KM 1334
                                                    versus KM 1225) and this gap has reduced from 11.5 percent in 2007 (Figure 7.9). Moving to

      BiH export composition trends
      7.9	                                  UN Comtrade data show that BiH exports are dominated by base metals and machinery
                                            although their share has seen a slight decline. At the same time, mineral products have
                                            increased (Figure 7.22). Disaggregating by destination market, whereas base metals and
                                            machinery account for the largest share of exports to the EU, footwear accounts for 10-15
                                            percent of total exports to the EU (although much of this is re-exports with only assembly
                                            taking place in BiH), followed by wood and leather (each approaching 10 percent). Base
                                            metals and mineral product exports dominate BiH exports to ECA as a whole. There were
                                            some minor trend variations in export composition around the 2008 financial crisis period,
                                            but the effects for the most part appear to be transitory.

      7.10	 Services exports grew in line with comparator countries during the 2000s but showed
            significant weaknesses since the crisis. Prior to the crisis, services export growth was strong
            and at levels comparable with peer countries. (BiH’s per capita exports of services are high
            for the country’s stage of development.

      Survival in export markets
      7.11	 For countries to achieve fast export growth and diversification, both successful entry into
            export markets and survival of export flows are crucial. In fact, the literature finds exporting
            to be an extremely hazardous activity, and particularly so in less advanced countries.

      7.12	 Among BiH exporters, less than half (48 percent) of export activities that are initiated in
            a given year remain active past the first year. This compares with almost sixty percent in
            Slovenia, 54 percent in Hungary, 49 percent in Serbia, and 44 percent in FYR Macedonia
            (Figure 7.25 and Figure 7.26). Interestingly, survival chances for BiH exporters increased over
            the period. One year survival probabilities during 2002-2008 were close to 40 percent, and
            picked up to over 55 percent in the period 2008-2013 (Table 7.5).

7.13	 The chances of survival of export relationships in the global marketplace depend on the
      destination of the export flow and on the type of product being traded. BiH exports to non-
      EU developed countries and to the non-EU region have the highest chances of remaining
      active for longer, followed by flows to the EU. Those to South Asia and to Latin America and
      the Caribbean show the lowest survival chances. At the same time, exports of foodstuffs, and
      wood seem to be the most resilient, while those of textiles and clothing the least resilient.
      Survival probabilities vary substantially more across destinations than across products
      (Figure 7.27 and Figure 7.28).

      Annex VI. Labor sophistication of exports


      7.14	 This annex assesses the evolution of BiH’s export basket in terms of product mix, product
            sophistication and destination markets to estimate its labor content. This can help to
            understand the scope for diversifying BiH’s export markets and products with a view to
            increasing export-driven labor demand. It does not, however, derive precise measures of
            the labor market impact of BiH export performance. Adapting the Hausmann, Hwang and
            Rodrick (2007) measure of export sophistication, we develop indirect measures of the labor-
            related sophistication of BiH’s export basket. We construct five indices or "EXPYs"169 that
            measure the following aspects of labor sophistication: (i) median wage, (ii) median value
            added per worker, (iii) ratio of skilled to total workers, (iv) years of schooling, or “human
            capital”, and (v) capital stock per worker. For each of the five EXPY indices, we compare the
            time trends of their level across destination markets, comparing the average for all Bosnian
            exports (i.e., destined to the "world") to those destined to the European Union (EU27), ECA*
            (i.e., non-EU non-Russia ECA countries), and Russia. The results for each of the five EXPYs for
            BiH are shown in separate panels in Figure 7.29.

        	 EXPYs can be interpreted as the export share-weighted average labor market outcome associated with BiH’s export basket, and are calculated using
      169

          two-steps. The first associates to each product the global trade-weighted average wage, value-added, skill ratio, or physical capital covering all
          countries in the world that export the product, denoted PRODY. The second step then weights the PRODYs appearing in BiH’s export basket by the
          share of each product in BiH’s total exports, denoted EXPY. These resulting EXPYs reflect the global average labor content of goods that appear in BiH’s
          export basket.

7.15	 Comparing EXPYs over time and with other countries provides insight into the labor
      sophistication of regional exports. Using these labor-related EXPYs for BiH, we (i) look at
      their change over time, (ii) compare these time trends with other ECA countries such as
      Albania, Hungary, Moldova and FYR Macedonia, (iii) consider variations in labor-content
      across different destination markets and how these have evolved since 2000, and (iv)
      make bilateral comparisons of labor content with Albania, Hungary, Moldova and FYR
      Macedonia across the distribution of export products. The logic behind these measures
      is that labor market and other characteristics of the economies that intensively export a
      given product provide information about the implications of specializing in certain products
      exported to certain markets, and will determine how export growth will contribute to job
      creation, wages and skill mix. Based on our observations, we can draw inferences about
      how the shift in product and regional trade patterns can impact employment, wage and
      skill demand in BiH.

7.16	 BiH exports to Russia and ECA are characterized by relatively high wages and high value
      added per worker compared to exports to the EU. The share of skilled workers has
      increased for exports to Russia, but exports to other destination markets embody a lower
      skilled-to-unskilled labor ratio and do not show much variation over the last decade. BiH
      exports to Russia embody slightly higher-than-average human capital compared to other
      destinations, while exports to Russia reflect a high level of physical capital (partly due to
      high chemical exports).

7.17	 BiH has seen some moderate improvements in export sophistication since 2000. Taking
      the BiH export basket as a whole, BiH exports to the world exhibit modestly increasing
      sophistication in terms of median wage, value added and skill, but relatively less progress in
      terms of human and physical capital content since 2000.

7.18	 Comparing the labor content of BiH exports to other emerging economies (Figure 7.30),
      we observe increasing trends between 2000 and 2012 for Bosnian exports in terms of
      wage and value added content, but at levels lower than for exports from Hungary (an
      early reformer). On the other hand, BiH exports compare favorably to those from Albania,
      Moldova and FYR Macedonia in terms of their higher quality and sophistication with respect
      to wages, value addition, human and physical capital content, having increased their relative
      competitiveness in recent years.

Firm size and characteristics: Evidence from BEEPS
7.19	 The Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) is imperfect
      but can be revealing. The latest BEEPS round of surveys were conducted in 2013 in ECA
      countries, including BiH. 360 formal firms were surveyed in BiH across the manufacturing,
      construction, transport, wholesale/retail, hotels/restaurants, IT and other service sectors
      (Table 7.6). In total, around 15,000 firms were surveyed across ECA. While the sample size
      for ECA may be considered large, caution should be taken when interpreting the results for
      BiH due to the small sample size. Nonetheless, the results are instructive for the sectors
      covered and results presented below are weighted to the population.

7.20	 Some of the key findings related to employment, exports, firm age and gender are
      summarized below:
        •	 Employment
             o	 According to the BEEPS, the average formal firm in the sectors covered employed
                around 32 permanent full-time workers in 2012. This was higher than the SEE average
                of 25 but lower than EU-CEE countries (around 41 employees) Figure 7.31.
             o	 While other countries appear to have “bulges” of firms at around 15 employees and
                again at around 25 employees, BiH lacks this second “bulge”. Rather than have many
                medium-sized firms boosting employment, as in other countries, BiH has a long “left
                tail” of large employers (Figure 7.33). It is possible that these are a protected group
                preventing medium-sized firms from entering.
             o	 Unlike in other SEE or EU-CEE countries, firms did not report growth in employment
                between 2010 and 2012.
        •	 Exports
             o	 16 percent of firms are classified as “exporters” (more than 10 percent of output is
                exported) in BiH compared to 19 percent for other SEE countries. 23 percent of EU-
                CEE firms surveyed were exporters (Figure 7.32).

                •	 	Age
                        o	 BiH firms tend to be older than those in other regions, at 17 years versus 15 on average
                           in SEE. This suggests a post war flurry of new business creation followed by a significant
                           lull.
                •	 Gender
                        o	 Around 24 percent of firms reported that their top manager was female, in line with
                           the SEE average but 5 percentage points higher than the EU-CEE and 9 percentage
                           points higher than the ECA average.
                        o However, as a share of total employees, the manufacturing sector employs fewer
                          females than the SEE average (30 versus 34 percent) but is around the EU-CEE average.

      Business Environment
      7.21	 Accessing credit became more difficult in DB2015. This was driven by worsening Depth of
            Credit Information index, Credit Registry Coverage and Credit Bureau Coverage. However,
            the global rank improved in 2015 due to even larger backward steps in other countries.

      7.22	 Even in areas in which BiH has made some improvements, other countries have advanced
            quicker. BiH made improvements to business environment by reducing a number of costs,
            such as: costs for starting a business, costs for registering a property, costs in dealing with
            construction permits, costs in getting electricity, costs to exports and imports (deflated
            US$ per container); and lowered minimum paid-in capital to start a business. However, the
            ranking of the main indicators worsened due to larger improvements in other countries.

      7.23	 BiH does perform relatively well in a number of areas. BiH ranks 34th in the world in
            Resolving Insolvency and 36th in Accessing Credit. Within SEE, BiH performs second best in
            Enforcing Contracts (but worst in Protecting Minority Investors) (Table 7.8).

7.24	 BiH improved in all DB indicators between 2010 and 2015 except in Enforcing Contracts
      (Figure 7.36). BiH improved more than any other country in SEE in Getting Credit, and
      was second best in four categories (Resolving Insolvency, Starting a Business, Registering
      Property, and Getting Electricity) and below worse than the SEE average in other indicators.

7.25	 The DB reports note several positive reforms between 2010 and 2013, a negative reform
      DB2014, and neither significant positive nor negative changes in DB2015 (Table 7.9). In
      fact there were few positive changes done in DB2015 as mentioned in previous paragraphs
      but they were not considered significant enough to be recorded as reforms. Across the DB
      reports there was only one topic by which BiH was considered to have good practices in
      place and that was ‘Maintaining a Unified Registry’, which made it easier to get credit.

      Sub-national business environment
      7.26	 A regional Doing Business survey ranked 22 cities in South East Europe 2011 and the three
            BiH cities included were ranked as 18-20 among the 22 cities. This is a slight improvement
            compared to similar report from 2008 when they were in the last three positions, and
            the change came due to deterioration of ranking of Kosovo cities (Table 7.10). Registering
            Property, Starting a Business and Enforcing Contracts were among the worst ranked, while
            dealing with construction permits was relatively good.

      7.27	 Some reforms prior to 2011 were noted in the report but were relatively minor. All
            three cities made it easier to start a business by eliminating municipal or entry permits
            and decreasing their fees. All three digitalized Cadaster and Land Registries and Banja Luka
            adopted and implemented a new construction law. Banja Luka also reduced court fees and
            improved court efficiency. Yet these reforms only lifted the three BiH cities slightly in the
            rankings. It should be noted that any reforms since 2011 are not reflected in this analysis
            due to lack of new data.

      7.28	 Detailed analysis reveals that business environment was not very friendly in any of the BiH
            observed cities. Banja Luka had 18 pre-construction procedures followed, while Sarajevo
            and Mostar each had 19 procedures. Sarajevo performed the least worst in dealing with
            Construction Permits, requiring “just” 182 days, compared with 228 in Banja Luka and 554
            in Mostar. The property transfer fees were highest in Mostar and Sarajevo at 5 percent of
            property value and somewhat lower in Banja Luka at 3 percent. Banja Luka was ranked 15th
            in Enforcing Contracts, while Sarajevo and Mostar were ranked 19th and 20th, respectively.
            Mostar and Banja Luka had the slowest courts in all of the cities included requiring 1,653
            and 1,220 days respectively to complete enforcement of judgment. In Sarajevo it takes 595
            days to complete the process. The court costs are quite high at 40.4 percent of the claim in
            Sarajevo, 31.5 percent in Mostar and 27.7 percent in Banja Luka.

      Firm-reported obstacles to doing business
      7.29	 The BEEPS identifies political instability and corruption were identified as “major” or “very
            severe” constraints to doing business by more firms than any other presented obstacles.
            Around 32 and 26 percent of firms cited these constraints, respectively. Access to finance,
            tax rates, tax administration and labor regulations also featured prominently (Figure 7.37).
            When firms were asked to cite a single major obstacle, similar concerns emerged. 32 percent
            of respondents cited political instability as the most important obstacle, while access to
            finance was cited by 16 percent. Tax rates, corruption, labor regulations and customs and
            trade regulations were each perceived to be the most important obstacle by between 7 and
            9 percent of respondents.

      7.30	 There are some differences in perceived obstacles depending upon firm size. While
            political instability was identified by all types of firms as the main obstacle, small and large
            firms identified access to finance as the second main obstacle, but the medium enterprises
            ranked it as the third problem while labor regulations were in second place. While access
            to electricity was the third main problem for large enterprises, small enterprises felt higher
            burden from the tax rates (Figure 7.38).

Annex VIII. Lessons for BiH from other countries


7.31	 While it is difficult to find a perfect comparison for BiH history, social composition
      and institutional structures in the rest of the world, several other countries offer some
      imperfect lessons. Below we highlight some potentially relevant ones from Lebanon,
      Belgium and Cyprus.

Lebanon
	        “The Lebanon of my birth is probably the most emblematic example of a country dislocated
         by ‘confessionalism’, and as a result I feel no sympathy for this pernicious system. Perhaps
         it was once the answer to an ill, but in the long term it has turned out to be more harmful
         than the malady itself, like a drug that was administered to a patient to calm his suffering,
         but which created an irreversible addiction, which debilitated his body and mind a little more
         each day to the point where it repaid him a hundredfold for all the pain it had temporarily
         spared him.” Amin Maalouf, Lebanese-born, French author, Disordered World

7.32	 Lebanon represents an extreme cautionary tale for BiH. Lebanon, a tiny country comprised
      of 18 confessional groups,170 gained its independence from France in 1943. According to the
      unwritten 1943 National Pact, a system was created whereby all governmental posts would
      be distributed according to confessional group. The idea was that political competition
      would take place within groups rather than between them, thereby lessening the likelihood
      of confessional conflict. As such, the President was to be a Maronite Christian, the Speaker
      of the Parliament a Shiite Muslim, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, and the Deputy Prime
      Minister and Deputy Speaker of Parliament Greek Orthodox.

7.33	 Although it was conceived as a temporary solution—as the Dayton Accords were — "’Until
      such time as the Chamber enacts new electoral laws on a non-confessional basis’, more
      than eighty years later confessionalism is still the system of government implemented in
      Lebanon.”171 Since independence, the country has undergone drastic shifts in population
      due to migration, wars,172 an influx of refugees and asylum seekers, etc., these governing
      arrangements have held. No official census has been conducted since 1932 because of fears
      of confessional conflict.

7.34	 Efforts were made to modernize the system. After the brutal 1975-1990 civil war— which
      left 150,000 dead, 200,000 wounded and a million displaced— Lebanese political elites
      reached the Taif Agreement, which transferred some powers away from the Christians
      (Presidency) in favor of the Muslims (Prime Minister and Speaker of the Parliament) to
      provide for a more balanced system between Christians and Muslims. “The Chamber of

     Armenian Catholic, Syriac Orthodox Christian, Chaldean, Assyrian, Coptic, Sunni Muslim, Shiite Muslim, Druze, Sufi, Alawite, and Jewish. http://

                Deputies was increased in size to 128 members, shared equally between Christians and
                Muslims, rather than elected by universal suffrage that would have provided a Muslim
                majority (excluding the expatriate community, a majority of which is Christian). A cabinet
                was established similarly divided equally between Christians and Muslims.”173 The Taif
                Agreement stated that “the abolition of political sectarianism is a fundamental national
                priority.”174 Sectarianism was to be abolished in all government fields and jobs. However,
                no specific time frame was delineated for achieving this goal. The Taif Agreement was
                incorporated into a revised Constitution in 1990.

      7.35	 Lebanon has undergone many more upheavals since the civil war, including the
            assassination of Prime Minister Hariri and other prominent political figures of various sects,
            the subsequent Cedar Revolution which triggered the withdrawal of the Syrian occupying
            army, the rise of Hezbollah,175 conflicts between Lebanon/Hezbollah and Israel, Sunni-Shiite
            political tensions, spillover effects from the Syrian civil war, and a massive influx of a million
            Syrian refugees. As a result of its turbulent history, there are now more Lebanese living
            outside the country (8-14 million) than inside (4.2 million).

      7.36	 Confessionalism and its pernicious discontents continue to pervade the Lebanese polity,
            society and economy. Indeed, there is a confessional capture of the state and its socio-
            economic and political policies. There is no political consensus among confessional groups
            on national priorities, and patronage, nepotism, clientalism, and bribery dominate public
            service (at the expense of merit) and investment. Most of the country’s public services and
            utilities have become sources for rent-seeking and redistribution. The result is a fragmented,
            inefficient, non-transparent government lacking in accountability. The judiciary, which could
            potentially function as a check on the system, is also regarded as corrupt, inefficient and
            weak. Allegiance to non-state actors remains a problem.

      7.37	 Lebanon serves as a cautionary example for BiH in other respects. It has become the
            playground for regional states and actors looking to export their troubles and/or use
            Lebanon as a proxy to fight their religious, ideological and territorial battles. Regional states
            and actors use confessional groups for their own purposes; confessional groups in turn try to
            recruit external forces to support and strengthen their internal position within the Lebanese
            polity. In short, confessionalism remains a deep and dangerous fault line in Lebanon, leaving
            the country perpetually unstable and at risk of further conflict.

      7.38	 In practical terms, the dysfunctional government has adversely impacted the country’s
            economic outlook and capacity to reform, build and modernize. For example, there has
            been no approved budget since 2006. A credible Single Treasury Account has not yet been
            achieved. Donor-financed projects which produce common public benefits are often not
            regarded as achievements; confessional groups want projects that benefit them directly and
            look to their political representatives to deliver them.176 Lebanon’s investment climate is
            poor, as reflected in its rating for the ease of doing business: it was ranked 111 (out of a total

         	 Hezbollah has become, in effect, a “state within a state,” with its own militia, social and political organizations. The existence of a separate militia is
           against the Taif Agreements, which provided for “the disarmament of all national and non-national militias.”

         of 189 countries; BiH ranks somewhat worse, at 131) in 2014, down from 105 in 2013.177 For
         one recent ten-month period, there was no government (some claimed that the country ran
         better without one).

7.39	 The parallels between Lebanon and BiH are striking. In Lebanon, we can see a possible
      future for BiH and it is not a good one. The longer the confessional system remains in place,
      the more entrenched it becomes, the more it pervades all of society, and the more difficult
      it comes to dislodge it.

7.40	 One significant difference (and there are others, e.g. Lebanon was a state for a longer
      period of its history and there is still strong support for the state) is that BiH has the
      possibility to become a member of key Euro-Atlantic institutions such as the EU and NATO,
      with attendant economic assistance. Thus far, however, these incentives have not served as
      sufficient inducement to pull BiH out of its ethnic conflicts and political deadlock.

Belgium
Belgium is the most successful ‘failed state’ of all time. German newspaper, Die Tageszeitung, 2008

7.41	 What insights does multi-ethnic and linguistic Belgium hold for BiH’s political system and
      future? “Belgium and BiH can be understood as ‘divided house’ states, which contain
      proportionally similar groups with opposing views regarding whether the state should be
      more unitary or more decentralized. The Belgian example demonstrates that even where
      groups disagree on state structure, (the francophones tend to prefer a centralized state,
      whereas the Flemish prefer a decentralized state structure) a mixture of various forms
      of group autonomy may facilitate stability and compromise within the state.”178 Belgium
      provides for linguistic communities without territorial autonomy.

7.42	 Belgium has another unique feature of assigning competencies to different groups.
      “The three territorial regions of Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels capital hold powers over
      economic issues and development related to their territories, including environmental and
      agricultural policy, research, and external commerce. The primary powers for the three non-
      territorial communities (Flemings, Francophones and Germans) include educational policy
      and linguistic and cultural matters. In addition, communities may engage in some foreign
      relations directly.”179 The Belgian example is relevant to BiH in that it demonstrates the
      power of various forms of group autonomy in facilitating stability and potential compromise.

7.43	 Belgium is a cautionary case for BiH in other ways. For instance, “Both countries have
      broken the existing records for the time it took their political elites to form a government
      after the general elections. The Belgian elections took place in June 2010; the government
      was formed in early December 2011. The BiH elections took place in October 2010; the
      government was formed only in late December 2011. If there were a contest for the duration
      of post-election negotiations, Belgium would be the winner, with 541 days of post-election
      vacuum without a government.”180

      7.44	 Indeed, Belgium differs from BiH in significant ways. It is the home of the European Union
            and many of its institutions. BiH has come through a difficult war and is still in the process
            of democratic evolution and transition to a market economy. And, of course, BiH is not an
            EU member with all of its attendant benefits. Belgium is certainly peaceful, but it is not the
            most functional democracy, having experienced long periods of instability and stasis.

      Cyprus
      “The EU’s failure to facilitate the resolution of the Cyprus problem is long-standing.” 181

      7.45	 Following its independence from Britain in 1960, the constitution granted powers to
            the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. “The constitution of the Republic of Cyprus,
            adopted in 1960, provided that executive power be exercised by a Greek Cypriot president
            and a Turkish Cypriot vice president, elected to five-year terms by universal suffrage, and
            that there be a Council of Ministers (cabinet) comprising seven Greek Cypriot and three
            Turkish Cypriot members. It also called for an elected House of Representatives with 50
            seats, divided between Greek and Turkish Cypriots in the proportion of 35 to 15 and elected
            for terms of five years.”182 Greek Cypriots preferred a union with Greece over independence.
            Tensions and conflicts between the Greek majority and the Turkish minority became more
            prevalent. Since the Turkish invasion in 1974, the island has been divided between Greek
            Cypriots who control 63 percent of the island, and a separate Turkish Republic of Northern
            Cyprus, which controls 37 percent. Turkey is the only country that recognized the Turkish
            Republic since its declaration of independence in 1983.

      7.46	 In 2004, Cyprus became a member of the EU, but as a divided island. “One of the protocols
            on Cyprus that was annexed to the Treaty provides for the suspension of the application of
            the acquis in the northern, Turkish-occupied part of the island, to be lifted in the event of a
            solution. It also states that the EU is ready ‘to accommodate the terms of a settlement in line
            with the principles on which the EU is founded’, and expresses the desire that the accession
            of Cyprus should benefit all Cypriots.”183

      7.47	 Despite many international political initiatives over the year to mediate the conflict and
            reunify the island, none have been successful. A key lesson from the Cyprus experience that
            is relevant to BiH concerns EU membership. In the case of Cyprus, potential EU membership
            did not serve as sufficient inducement to Cypriot conflict resolution, reconciliation and
            unity. “Cyprus is the closest model, but Nicosia joined the EU in 2004 without resolving or
            even ameliorating the relationship with the Turks in the North of the divided island. In the
            years since, even full EU membership and associated investment and development has not
            resolved the standoff between Greek and Turkish Cypriots (though there have been some
            positive developments of late).”184 Therefore, EU accession, while attractive, may not be
            sufficient to untie the Gordian knot of BiH’s ongoing ethnic conflicts.

      Annex XV. Prioritization methodology


      7.48	 This annex provides details of the approach taken in conducting the priority setting
            exercise in this SCD. With imperfect information there will always be a degree of judgment
            in determining the priority reform areas that could achieve the greatest progress toward
            achieving the Twin Goals. Nonetheless, the core SCD team based its analysis on the available
            evidence and used several methods in the prioritization exercise.

      Prioritization process

      7.49	 The prioritization process was completed in several steps:

      	     Step one: The team identified a series of seven initial hypotheses designed to help
            understand better the key issues in. The team then tested these hypotheses based on
            extensive consultations and deeper analysis.

      	     Step two: Based on the deeper analysis – presented in this report – and the extensive
            consultations, the team identified the key themes emerging from these hypotheses. These
            were then used to formulate the reform areas.

      	     Step three: The team used two complementary methodologies to identify the most
            important priority reform areas.

      	     Step four: The team compared the results of the different methodologies, discussed with
            internal experts on BiH (who did not have a direct interest in the results of the findings
            of the SCD) and identified the priority reform areas and secondary priorities, which are
            reported in section 6. Figure 7.53 illustrates these steps and further details of each step are
            provided below.

Prioritization methodology
	                                           Steps one and two

7.50	 As part of the SCD process, the team formulated seven hypotheses based on initial
      analysis. These were designed to help the team understand better the situation in BiH.
      The hypotheses were: (1) Increasing employment requires much higher economic growth
      and significant labor market reform; (2) BiH can only reduce poverty and achieve shared
      prosperity by exporting significantly more; (3) The public sector is too large and inefficiently
      delivers public services, harming economic growth, employment and shared prosperity;
      (4) The political economy is unfavorable, which makes it difficult to enact reforms and
      contributes toward elite capture; (5) BiH faces pronounced spatial imbalances and social
      segregation, which impacts shared prosperity; (6) BiH faces the double demographic
      challenge of a shrinking and aging population, making the reform process and achieving
      shared prosperity more urgent and challenging; and (7) BiH is prone to, but ill-equipped to
      deal with, external shocks. The team tested these hypotheses using further analysis and
      extensive consultations. The team then identified the key themes emerging from these
      hypotheses and these correspond to the reform areas analyzed in the SCD.

7.51	 The team conducted extensive consultations with stakeholders based on these hypotheses.
      The major aims of the consultations were: (i) to verify whether, or the extent to which, the
      hypotheses were correct; (ii) to understand better the causes and consequences that matter
      most for achieving the Twin Goals related to each hypotheses; and (iii) to ascertain whether
      there were important factors that the team had failed to identify that had significant impacts
      on the likelihood of achieving the Twin Goals. The team held meetings with key public
      sector officials, the private sector, local government, NGOs, other donors, representatives
      of various interest groups including, but not limited to youth, employers, and war veterans.

7.52	 In parallel, the team conducted deeper analysis and based on this and the consultations,
      identified the key reform areas that emerged. This was designed to achieve the same aims
      as the consultations and this analysis is reflected throughout the SCD. Based on the results
      of the consultations and the deeper analysis, the team identified the key themes emerging
      and formulated reform areas. These were:
        •	 Putting BiH to work: reforming the labor market, improving social protection and reducing
           the cost of labor;
        •	 Making it easier to do business: improving competitiveness, entrepreneurship and the
           investment climate;
        •	 Creating an efficient and effective government: reducing the size of the public sector
           while ensuring fiscal sustainability and improving public service delivery;
        •	 Building economic infrastructure for growth and inclusion: powering and connecting BiH
           to the world;
        •	 Building resilience: helping BiH cope with adverse natural events;
        •	 Boosting brains: improving education services and labor market skills;

                                                                                                     Annexes


            •	 Living healthy lives: improving health services and access to water and sanitation;
            •	 Adding financial firepower: maintaining financial stability and expanding access to
               finance;
            •	 Greening BiH: reducing pollution and protecting the environment; and
            •	 Boosting agriculture: improving agricultural productivity and opportunities. Greater
               information on each is provided in section 6.
                                                  Step three

      7.53	 Having identified the key reform areas, the team used two separate methodologies
            to identify reform priorities. The first methodology was a qualitative assessment of the
            evidence by core team members. The second was a quantitative ‘ratings’ methodology. In
            both cases, the team also considered complementarities between reform areas. Below we
            discuss both methods and provide more detail on the quantitative method. The results from
            both are broadly aligned.

      Qualitative method
      7.54	 As in many other SCDs, one prioritization method was qualitative but based on the
            underpinning analysis. Using the analysis and evidence gathered during consultations, the
            team took a brainstorming approach to considering possible reforms. During this stage, the
            team discussed which reforms would have the most impact on achieving the Twin Goals.
            This method allowed for a nuanced approach to prioritization, including considering reform
            sequencing, complementarities of different reforms, and prioritizing particular components
            of some key reform areas over others.

      7.55	 This approach led the team to consider “waves” of reforms based partly on available
            resources. In particular, the team prioritized reforms that reduced expenditure or would
            ensure increased revenue or carried minimal costs. In addition, the team considered reforms
            that could be undertaken in the short-term, which would act as a basis for future reforms.

      7.56	 Top priority or “first wave” reforms under this approach were:
            •	 Labor market reforms including reducing labor taxes;
            •	 A broad-based approach to business and investment climate reforms;
            •	 Pharmaceutical procurement reforms;
            •	 Drafting detailed and prioritized investment plans for the main investment sectors;
            •	 Identifying potential EU resources for investment and ensuring training in efficiently
               disbursing these resources;
            •	 Begin construction or planning for construction of relevant infrastructure;
            •	 Identifying SOEs that do not function, formally closing them, selling land or buildings, and
               agreeing a settlement with workers for missing benefit contributions;
            •	 Identifying areas that required additional data or information (education/skills and SOE
               management are notable ‘gaps’ and beginning to collect relevant data).

7.57	 High priorities or “second wave” reforms under this approach were those that tended to
      be more expensive or are more politically difficult. They included:
        •	 	Using some of the fiscal savings to ensure a ‘buffer’ to protect from external economic
           shocks or adverse natural events;
        •	 Privatization or private management of functioning SOEs;
        •	 Efforts to improve education and skills;
        •	 Re-focusing social protection on the poor.
7.58	 These priorities are not significantly different from those identified – and discussed in
      more detail below – by a more quantitative method. Quantitative method

7.59	 The second methodology consisted in using quantitative ratings to score the impact of
      reform areas based on their ability to contribute toward sustainably achieving the twin
      goals. The core team rated each reform area based on their ability to generate economic
      growth, which this SCD has argued is important to achieving shared prosperity, and the extent
      to which the resulting prosperity is likely to contribute toward achieving the Twin Goals. In
      addition, the team considered the extent to which each key reform area contributed toward
      the medium to long term sustainability of progress toward the Twin Goals. The following
      rating scale and scoring methodology were used:

7.60	 The rating scale was as follows:
        •	 he team rated on a scale of 1-5 (1=minimal impact, 5=most beneficial impact) for each of
           the three components.
        •	 The team use “positive ratings” – i.e. we began from a baseline of 1 and increased, rather
           than beginning at 5 and decreasing.
        •	 The team agreed that if there were large differences in means, we would standardize but
           this was not necessary.
        •	 The team agreed that, since we had already pre-selected the reform areas (which had
           already emerged as some of the key challenges for tackling poverty and boosting shared
           prosperity), the average ratings would likely be above three.
7.61	 The rating methodology was as follows:
        •	 Economic growth pathway
            o Economic growth has tended to benefit both the B40 and the T60 during the pre-
              crisis period, with the B40 benefiting slightly more. In addition, with one of the largest
              public sectors in the world, there remains no space to increase tax revenues to boost
              expenditure on areas that benefit the B40. Growth is therefore essential to increase
              public sector resources for health, education, social protection, etc. Reforms in most
              areas tend to be easier during periods of an expanding “pie”, helping to create a
              virtuous circle. Since the crisis, the economy has been sclerotic, under-performing
              even by the SEE’s dour standards.

                                                                                                       Annexes



                o The team considered how much the reform area could boost growth or shared
                  prosperity above a baseline (of 1.5 percent per year) over the medium term (i.e. 5-7
                  years). That is, the team did not only consider growth in the year following the reform.
                  Reforms that could either boost this average or prevent it from declining was rated
                  positively.
            •	 Shared prosperity and poverty pathway
                o	 Even though growth on average benefited the B40 during the pre-crisis period, some
                   future reforms would be positive for this group and some negative. Others may be
                   negative in the short-term but eventually more positive.
                o	 The team considered whether reforms over the medium term would be more, equal
                   or less positive for the B40 than for other groups. Any reforms that were considered to
                   impact more positively the B40 than the average received a rating higher than that for
                   growth, while any reforms that impacts them less positively than the economy-wide
                   average received a lower rating than growth.

      7.62	 In rating for sustainability, the SCD considered the following factors:

      a. Fiscal, financial and macro sustainability

      	     Key factors considered: (i) The macro and financial climates are reasonable but BiH is highly
            vulnerable to external shocks; (ii) Any policy set that threatens to push the macro or financial
            climate into danger would cause this to become an important issue; (iii) The fiscal stance has
            been reasonable up to the crisis but public debt has doubled since 2008; (iv) and BiH taxes
            its citizens more as a share of GDP than any country that is not rich western European, oil-
            dependent, or a small island state dependent on donors, leaving no room to increase public
            sector resources through taxation; (v) Opening up fiscal space is going to be key to allow
            the country to cope with external economic or weather shocks, as well as to re-focus public
            resources on things that can generate growth and improve the lives of poorer citizens.

      b. Social sustainability

      	     Key factors considered: (i) Reforms that can lead to excessive social unsustainability in the
            short-run could be considered less sustainable; (ii) however, it is also necessary to consider
            the short- and long- term consequences of not making reforms; (iii) and society shouldn’t be
            “held at gunpoint” by a small group of special interests; (iv) the institutional sustainability of
            the reforms.

      c. Environmental sustainability

      	     Key factors considered: (i) BiH has been shown over recent years to be highly vulnerable to
            weather shocks (floods, droughts and a harsh winter in recent years have had large negative
            GDP impacts); (ii) but at the same time, building in flood plains is an issue – including both
            residential and firms; (iii) BiH is Europe’s most energy inefficient country in terms of its
            carbon intensity and one of its worst in terms of its energy use per unit of GDP; (iv) Some
            cities have pollution several times WTO recommended safety limits; (v) untreated sewage
            water and trash threatens to pollute rivers.

7.63	 The ratings were ranked to find the reform priorities, and were robust to a number of slightly
      adjusted approaches. The results were tested for robustness by using several weights for
      growth, shared prosperity and sustainability. Weightings of 50, 30, and 20, were applied to
      growth, shared prosperity and sustainability, respectively, and 40, 40, 20, respectively were
      applied, among others. Results were robust to these changes.

                                               Step four

7.64	 Based on the outcome of the above methods, the team discussed the identified key reform
      areas with internal experts. The experts were drawn from the pool of individuals within the
      WBG who had extensive experience in BiH but who do not manage projects. The aim was to
      ensure knowledge and understanding of BiH but, at the same time, to ensure independence
      vis-à-vis the prioritization process. The SCD team discussed the results extensively with
      the experts and ensured that there was coherent understanding and agreement on the
      prioritization.

Prioritization results
7.65	 The prioritization process, which is based on extensive analysis and internal and external
      consultations, helped the SCD to identify which key reform areas are expected to have
      the highest impact on achieving the Twin Goals. Based on the prioritization process, the
      key reform areas can be formed into three groups of priorities. These are discussed in more
      detail in section 6 and are summarized in Table 6.2.
        •	 Top priorities: These are the key reform areas assessed to have high overall impact on
           achieving the Twin Goals in both the short to medium term and the medium to long term.
           They cover the areas of labor market and social protection reform, business environment,
           role and size of the state and fiscal management, and infrastructure.
        •	 High priorities: These are the key reform areas assessed to have significant impact on
           achieving the Twin goals. They cover the areas of resilience to natural disasters, education
           and skills, and improving health and water/sanitation.
        •	 Medium priorities: These are the key reform areas assessed to have an impact on
           achieving the Twin Goals but in some cases the focus needs to be more on maintaining
           the current achievements or where reforms need to begin by gathering more data or
           information. They cover the areas of financial sector reform and inclusion, environmental
           protection, and agriculture.

      improving public service delivery
