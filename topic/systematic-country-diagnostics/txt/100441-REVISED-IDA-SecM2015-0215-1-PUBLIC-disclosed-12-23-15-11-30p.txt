1. Overview
1.       Honduras is Central America’s second-largest country with a population of more than 8
million and a land area of about 112,000 square kilometers. It has coastlines on both the Caribbean
Sea, including the three Bay Islands, and the Pacific Ocean via the Gulf of Fonseca. Its inland territory is
largely mountainous, with plains along the coast, and its rain forests, cloud forests, savannas, pine forests
and the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System boast a wealth of biodiversity. The country’s two largest
cities, Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, are home to almost a quarter of its population, yet approximately
half of the population lives in rural areas, where most are engaged in semi-subsistence agriculture.

2.       The 20th century witnessed a profound economic transformation and modernization in
Honduras. While agriculture continues to play an important role in GDP, the manufacturing sector,
driven by the product-assembly maquila industry, has become increasingly important. During the first
part of the twentieth century, Honduras’ exports centered mostly on bananas. In pursuit of a diversified
and modern productive structure, the country invested in infrastructure and promoted credit markets to the
primary sector in the mid-twentieth century.1 In the 1960s, the Central American Common Market was
created to promote industrial production and further develop this sector. These policies resulted in a more
diversified export structure. By the end of the 1960’s, other commodities such as beef, cotton and sugar
had become important players, while the share of bananas in total exports halved. Moreover, exports of
industrial products to other countries within the region increased. With the creation of its first free trade
zone in Puerto Cortés in the late 1970s and an export processing zone in the late 1980s, the country
continued to implement policies to support diversification. Trade liberalization policies were furthered
with the integration to the World Trade Organization in the 1990s and, in the 2000’s, when the country
joined a free trade agreement between Central American countries and US (the CAFTA-DR).

3.     Honduras possesses multiple strengths with the potential to form a base to propel the
country towards faster growth and shared prosperity:
    First, its strategic location places Honduras as a potential investment destination. Indeed, the
       country has relatively high levels of Foreign Direct Investment (about 6 percent of GDP) flowing
       into fast-growing sectors including telecommunications, manufacturing, and financial
       intermediation. Honduras’ location is also helped by the connectivity provided by its deep water
       port in the Caribbean Coast (Puerto Cortés) which has good access to US ports in the Caribbean
       Gulf and the East Coast. Puerto Cortes was also part of the first wave of ports included in the
       Secure Freight Initiative by which US officials can inspect the merchandise before departing the
       port towards the US.
    Second, the country’s industrial base can support an expansion of the tradable sector. At about 20
       percent of GDP, the manufacturing sector is relatively large compared to countries in Latin
       America and the Caribbean (LAC) and other middle-income countries, and given the country’s
       small size, this expansion could have plenty of benefits due to economies of scale or the
       possibility of specialization. Although the maquila model (mainly concentrated in textiles) still
       plays an important role, the country has been making efforts to diversify to other areas including
       machinery and electrical devices.
    Third, the Honduran economy has the second largest trade-to-GDP ratio in LAC and its efforts to
       diversify exports in the last decades not only have been successful in increasing the number of
       exported goods and destination markets, but also have developed internal competencies in the

        management of external trade, a valuable platform from which to further grow the country’s
        presence in international markets.
       Fourth, with a young and growing population, Honduras has the opportunity to harness a
        demographic dividend. With about a third of its population between the ages of 10 and 24 and
        population growth rates declining, Honduras is in the early stages of the demographic transition
        and therefore in position to benefit from a demographic dividend.

4.       And yet, despite the potential associated with its strengths, and the modernization efforts
that transformed Honduras in the early 20th century, the country has the third lowest per capita
income in LAC and is among the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere. Nearly one in five
Hondurans lives on less than US$1.90 per day, the second highest rate in LAC. According to official
poverty lines, in 2013 almost 65 percent of Honduran households lived in poverty and 43 percent lived in
extreme poverty, including two out of three rural Hondurans. Nearly 80 percent of Hondurans younger
than 15 live in impoverished households and approximately one in four is undernourished, with negative
implications for learning abilities and future earning capacity. Even when there have been periods of
poverty reduction, shocks have periodically erased gains. For instance, following a political and economic
crisis in 2009, poverty rates increased for three consecutive years; by 2013 poverty rates had returned to
the levels seen a decade earlier. In other words, there are forces at work that may result in poverty
continuing to future generations unless an ambitious development plan is implemented.

5.      While already behind standard comparators in 1960, the income gap between Honduras
and the world has widened. In 1960 Honduras per capita income (in current US$ terms) represented 150
percent of the Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC) per capita income, 13.5 percent of the High
Income Countries (HIC) per capita income and 5.6 percent of the US per capita income. In 2014, when
per capita was about US$2,300 (the third lowest in LAC), these same indicators had fallen to 86 percent,
6.2 percent and 4.3 percent respectively. In other words, Honduras has been diverging from these three
comparators for more than half a century, a reflection of the country’s sustained lower growth rates.
Indeed over the 1960-2014 period, Honduras average per capita income growth (1.2 percent) was well
below the one observed in the LMIC group (3.1 percent), the HIC group (2.3 percent), and the US (2.0
percent).

6.     Honduras’ persistent poverty is the result of long-term low per capita growth and high
inequality, perpetuated by the country’s high vulnerability to shocks.
     First, over the past 40 years the country has experienced modest growth rates marked by
       considerable volatility. This growth, however, has not been sufficient to keep pace with its rapid
       population growth, resulting in a widening per capita income gap between Honduras and the
       world. Its low average growth masks high volatility: over 1960-2014, the standard deviation of
       growth in Honduras was 44 percent, 83 percent and 52 percent larger than that of Low and
       Middle Income Countries, High Income Countries, and the US. Low growth has limited the
       ability of the private sector to generate jobs, resulting in weak employment outcomes. For
       instance, Honduras has one of the lowest labor force participation rates in LAC, a small formal
       sector (accounting for only 20 percent of jobs) and the highest self-employment rate in Central
       America.
     Second, high levels of inequality have weakened the ability for growth to reduce poverty by
       limiting the extent to which a large segment of the population is able to fully access physical and
       human capital. Making comparisons for earlier periods is difficult due to data limitations, but
       existing proxies suggest that the country’s inequality has historic roots. In 1925, for example,
       only 29 percent of Hondurans 10 years old and above were literate. This compares to 36 percent
       in Mexico, 40 percent in Colombia, and 64 percent in Costa Rica. For LAC countries for which
       comparable data exist, only Guatemala, at 15 percent, had lower literacy rates. In the early-1990s,
       the country’s Gini coefficient (0.56) was already among the highest in LAC after Brazil (0.59).

                                                    9
         With a Gini of 0.54 in 2013, Honduras has the second most inequitable income distribution in
         LAC which means that growth has not been able to lift many Hondurans out of poverty. While
         LAC has been moving towards becoming a middle class region, Honduras’ middle class has not
         grown over the past decade and remains among the smallest in the region.
        Third, a large share of the population is vulnerable and exposed to regular shocks—both large and
         small—which has exacerbated poverty by destroying or slowing asset accumulation. For
         example, in 1998, Hurricane Mitch caused 11,000 to 18,000 fatalities and destroyed 70 percent of
         the country’s crops and 70 percent of the nation’s transport infrastructure, with an economic
         damage estimated at around 81 percent of GDP. Beyond natural hazards, “smaller” shocks—such
         as periodic floods, droughts, and outbreaks of blight including the “coffee rust”—have damaged
         agricultural production and hurt the poor. As a small open economy, Honduras is also exposed to
         terms of trade shocks which at times have disrupted periods of economic expansion. Evidence
         suggests the poorest households struggle the most with shocks, as the effects on assets last longer
         and are felt more acutely relative to wealthier groups.

7.       This Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) explores the drivers of these development
outcomes in Honduras, and reflects on the policy priorities that should underlie a development
strategy focused on eradicating poverty and boosting shared prosperity. After identifying a number
of critical factors affecting the country’s development outcomes, the SCD concludes that there is a need
for a comprehensive agenda that tackles simultaneously the problems that have kept the country in a low
development equilibrium for many decades, as well as emerging challenges that have the potential not
only to prevent progress but also worsen the current situation. The SCD also argues that the policy agenda
needs to be ambitious and move away from marginal interventions in order to move Honduras from a
situation where its economic potentials are just potentials to another where they become actuals.

Crime and emigration: The emergence of two cycles locking-in low growth
8.      Honduras’ history of low and volatile economic growth and high inequality have created the
conditions for the emergence of two mutually reinforcing cycles: (i) a high crime-low growth cycle;
and (ii) an emigration/remittance flows-low growth cycle. Over the last 15 years these cycles have
shaped the challenges faced by Honduras and have continued to impact the country’s growth prospects.

9.       Honduras has one of the highest levels of crime and violence in the world, undermining
growth and stifling economic opportunity (Figure 1.1). With 67 murders per 100,000 habitants in
2014, Honduras’ homicide rates are among the highest in the world. Honduras has been strategically
important to the drug trade since the 1970s, but in the last 15 years the country has witnessed an increase
in gang activity and a rise in violent crimes such as extortion and kidnapping. 2 Young men are
particularly vulnerable to crime, both as victims and perpetrators. The cost of crime in Honduras is
estimated to have reached a staggering 10 percent of GDP (US$900 million) per year, and the health costs
alone are estimated at 1.3 percent of GDP.3 Security costs slash an estimated 9 percent from private sector
profits. Crime reduces competitiveness, discourages entrepreneurship and investment, and slows the pace
of job creation. To put it simply: crime acts as a barrier to growth. However, the dynamics are more
complex considering that low growth has a negative impact on the creation of economic opportunities,
and this in turn lowers the opportunity cost of joining criminal groups. The implication is that high crime
and low growth can create a vicious cycle that locks the country in a low level equilibrium.

have high homicide rates. Source: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. 2014. “Global Study on Homicide, 2013”

10.     Large levels of emigration and remittances flows are also presenting challenges to growth
(Figure 1.2). Large-scale emigration from Honduras is a relatively recent phenomenon that can be traced
back to the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Today over half a million Hondurans (or 13 percent of
the working-age population) live in the United States alone. Remittances approached 18 percent of GDP
in 2014, the largest rate in Central America and among the top fifteen worldwide. The average monthly
remittance reported by recipients is US$477, almost 2.5 times the country’s average monthly per capita
income. Migration opens new possibilities for workers, and remittances have contributed to poverty
reduction. Yet, evidence from Honduras indicates that the large emigration and remittances flows have
also negatively impacted productivity by shrinking the size of the labor force and increasing reservation
wages. At the same time, the data suggest the presence of effects similar to “Dutch disease” as remittance
inflows appear to distort domestic prices in Honduras, causing an appreciation of the real effective
exchange rate. Both the impact on the labor supply and the exchange rate damage the international
competitiveness of Honduran producers, hindering growth and economic opportunities.

             violence and low growth                      emigration/remittances and low growth




11.      Despite the significant development impact of high levels of crime and large
emigration/remittances flows, these cycles do not provide a complete picture of the development
challenges in Honduras. As noted above, high poverty has persisted for decades. Yet, both crime and
emigration emerged in the late-1990s: the country’s homicide rate in the early-1990s was below 20 per
100,000, similar to other Central American countries, while remittances flows in 1997, just before
Hurricane Mitch, represented only 4 percent of GDP. This implies that neglecting pre-existing structural
forces that were already preventing Honduras from developing in the 1990s before the surge of crime and
emigration would result in an incomplete picture of the country’s development challenges.

Beyond crime and emigration: Long-standing challenges to competitiveness and
opportunities
12.     Growth challenges. An analysis of the barriers to growth uncovers long standing chronic
constraints that have undermined productivity growth (on average, total factor productivity fell between
1960 and 2013), the development of a dynamic formal sector of the economy, and by extension, the
creation of high quality jobs—key to sustainable poverty reduction. Elements identified in previous
analytical works and confirmed in the SCD include: (i) an imperfect regulatory framework affecting both

                                                   11
the labor market and certain product regulations that hinder competition in the domestic markets; (ii) a
lack of fiscal discipline and high levels of debt which have undermined macroeconomic stability in
Honduras; (iii) inadequate infrastructure; (iv) a persistent shortage of skills and limited access to
education for much of the population; and (v) relatively low access to capital (finance and property
rights), particularly for SMEs.

13.      Inclusion challenges. There are also a number of critical elements affecting the unequal
distribution of income. These include: (i) low access to, and poor quality of, basic services—
approximately half a million Honduran children do not have access to potable water and 1.1 million
children do not have access to basic sanitation; (ii) an unequal distribution of access to services related to
household income and location resulting in children from poor households facing limited access to
essential services; and (iii) a high minimum wage and other labor market regulations that provide formal
workers with relatively high wages and labor protections, but do not reach the 80 percent of Honduran
workers who remain in the informal sector.

14.      Sustainability challenges. The sustainability analysis also reveals challenges along the
economic, social, and environmental sustainability fronts: (i) continuing with the country’s fiscal
instability that led it to benefit from the Highly Indebted Poor Countries initiative, Honduras is again
experiencing a debt buildup that limits the use of domestic resources for productive activities such as
social and infrastructure investments; (ii) beyond its impact on the investment climate and the allocation
of investment, high levels of crime and violence undermine the country’s social contract; and (iii) the
impact of natural hazards on Honduras is not simply a symptom of the country’s geographical location,
but rather of its low resilience. Structural sensitivity to economic shocks, chronic fiscal instability, low
resilience to natural hazards, and high levels of crime and violence represent multiple dimensions of
vulnerability that together pose a persistent risk to the achievement of Honduras’ economic and social
development objectives.

Deep roots of the challenges faced: Institutional quality
15.      The fact that there are so many factors that emerge as development challenges may be an
indication of a missing critical element in the diagnostic. The picture that emerges from the discussion
indicates that poverty is high and persistent, affected by low growth, high inequality, and limited
sustainability due to exposure to shocks across various fronts, and in turn, each of these are affected by a
number of bottlenecks. That is, the focus thus far has been on identifying the proximate causes of
Honduras’ weak development outcomes (e.g., crime, fiscal instability, access to services, resilience). Is
there a root cause affecting the proximate determinants?

16.      This SCD argues that a plausible root cause behind the country’s development outcomes is
the low quality of its institutions (Figure 1.5). Institutions are defined as the basic pillar of the state and
include the following three elements: formal and informal rules and regulations (rules); the bureaucratic
structure that implements and enforces these rules (capacity); and the mechanisms to hold agents
accountable for their actions (accountability). An examination of Honduras’ rankings across different
dimensions reported in the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) suggests significant institutional
challenges. For instance, Honduras scores in the lowest quartile in the world in the areas of control of
corruption, rule of law, and government effectiveness, and below average in the areas of political
stability, voice and accountability, and regulatory quality. While these aggregated measures provide
limited information, they are corroborated with other measures: on the institutions pillar of the World
Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Competitiveness Index, Honduras ranks 105th out of 144; on the
Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), Honduras ranks 126 out of 175 countries; the Government of
Honduras provides the public with limited budget information and has scored 43 out of 100 in the Open


                                                      12
Budget Index (OBI); on Judicial Independence, Honduras ranked 77 out of 142 in 2011-2012; and, on the
Press Freedom Index, Honduras ranked 135 out of 179 countries in 2011-2012.

17.      Beyond aggregate indicators, the analysis of the bottlenecks to growth, inclusion, and
sustainability underscore issues related to institutional quality. The literature on the role of
institutions in economic development suggests that institutional weaknesses can lead to lower growth
(through regulatory framework imperfections or inadequate enforcement, macroeconomic instability,
negative effects of human capital accumulation and public infrastructure, limited access to finance, and,
more generally, inefficiencies of the public sector affecting the implementation of programs), and high
inequality (through governance effects on education and health, and the redistributive capacity of the
state). For example, in Honduras:
      Macro-fiscal instability is, in part, the result of institutional quality. Inadequate fiscal
         management has played a large role in preventing Honduras from achieving sustained economic
         growth, and the devastating impact of both natural hazards and economic shocks is explained, in
         part, by low fiscal resilience and insufficient expenditure controls.
      High electricity costs result from losses of the state-owned electricity company, driven by
         inadequate electricity pricing mechanisms, high levels of theft and fraud, and poor maintenance
         of the distribution network. High energy costs can dramatically reduce economic returns not just
         for individual projects but to the entire infrastructure stock.
      Limited and unequal access to basic services is affected by the country’s inefficient public
         spending. Public spending accounts for over a fifth of GDP, but most goes to public sector
         salaries. Driven by high minimum salaries and a lack of hiring oversight, the public wage bill
         now represents an estimated 9 percent of GDP and accounts for more than half of current
         expenditures. Education spending alone accounts for 5.5 percent of GDP, yet at present an
         estimated 1,000 additional secondary schools would be needed to achieve universal secondary
         education; instead, more than two-thirds of education spending is personnel costs. Poor targeting
         mechanisms, limited budget flexibility, and a weak accountability framework have been
         worsened by fiscal instability and a lack of budgetary credibility.
      The persistence of crime is attributable at least in part to the judicial system’s lack of enforcement
         capacity. Challenges regarding law enforcement emerge from the United Nations Convention on
         Anti-Corruption (UNCAC) self-assessment of Chapter III on Criminalization and Law
         Enforcement and Chapter IV on International Cooperation. This assessment reveals that the legal
         and regulatory framework of Honduras complies with most provisions of the UNCAC in relation
         to criminalization of bribery and with most requirements relating to international cooperation by
         signing of a series of international treaties, which are now part of domestic law. However, it also
         reveals that major challenges remain in terms of law enforcement, with few cases being
         investigated, prosecuted and eventually punished with convictions.

18.      Development outcomes, in turn, can also affect the quality of institutions, suggesting the
presence of a third cycle affecting Honduras (Figure 1.3). The literature linking institutions with
development outcomes is complemented with another strand which emphasizes that the quality of
institutions is endogenous to development outcomes and hence has the potential to create a feedback loop.
The upcoming 2017 WDR framework identifies this feedback loop as a function of the power structure
and norms present in the society; that is, the bargaining power of different groups can influence the
evolution of the quality of institutions.

19.      Changes in the bargaining power of agents and groups can influence the development path
of institutional quality. One channel emphasizes that higher income levels are likely to lead to higher
demand for quality institutions, while also implying more availability of resources with which to build



                                                     13
institutional quality.4 For example, as growth increases the profitability of firms, they are able to move
away from areas where officials demand bribes and to areas with lower bribes.5 In this way, growth acts
as a push factor and low bribes as a pull factor. In practice, this would imply that countries can enter into
a virtuous circle where high growth tends to reduce corruption and this feeds into higher growth, or
conversely that corruption negatively affects growth and this feeds back an increase in corrupting
activities. Another channel relates to income inequality. This is largely attributed to the importance of
social cohesion, captured, for example, in the role of a sizeable middle class that both demands
institutional quality and increases institutional quality through its willingness to contribute through
taxation.6

20.     As with the cycles of crime and emigration, breaking the weak institutions-poor
development outcomes cycle can be particularly challenging given its self-reinforcing nature. The
existence of vicious cycles can make the task of reducing poverty and boosting share prosperity more
complex because of the self-reinforcing mechanisms at play.

Priorities Ahead
21.      The discussion above concludes that Honduras may be trapped in a low level equilibrium
resulting from three self-reinforcing cycles: (i) low growth and high levels of crime and violence; (ii)
low growth and high migration/remittances flows; and (iii) low growth/high inequality and poor
institutional quality. These cycles reinforce each other and have important implications for a policy
prioritization exercise (Table 1.1).

22.      A first implication is that escaping Honduras’ low level equilibrium will require actions on
several fronts. Looking for a single action or policy to act as an engine of development is insufficient;
addressing the challenges emerging from some of the cycles and leaving aside those of others would risk
leaving intact low growth attractors. Obviously, this is not to say that a single policy implemented in
isolation will not have a positive development impact. Yet, when the objective is to dramatically alter the
development dynamics, a coordinated effort along different fronts will be needed.

23.      A second implication is that the needed actions will need to generate a “big push”, strong
enough to alter the existing dynamics. Marginal interventions are unlikely to break or revert the self-
reinforcing forces that have kept Honduras in a low level equilibrium. It is not that modest interventions
that go in the right direction will not have a positive impact on development outcomes, but rather, that
these interventions are limited in what they can achieve given the complexity of the challenges involved.

24.     Third, it is important to identify entry points, or policy levers, that can help break or revert
the existing cycles– and, given the magnitude of challenges, they might need to be supported through
additional policies that will foster complementary progress in growth, inclusion and sustainability.
Priority areas to attack the challenges created by the cycles would have to focus on (i) improving
education and skills to compete; (ii) strengthening violence prevention and law enforcement; and (iii)
improving the quality of the institutional framework, with a focus on rule of law, capacity building and
fostering accountability.

25.      Breaking the cycle between violence and low growth requires a concentrated focus on
prevention and improved law enforcement to reduce the high social and economic costs imposed by
crime and violence. Reducing crime and violence enhances social sustainability and improves the
credibility and legitimacy of the government. The poor stand to gain the most from a reduction in crime
and violence since they are often the victims. Less crime implies reductions in production costs as
expenditures associated with buying protection are reduced. Smaller enterprises will gain, with a potential
positive impact on employment generation and hence inclusion. Lower crime and violence is likely to
improve the investment climate, support domestic entrepreneurship and increase foreign investment
inflows. A drop in crime and violence can also create stronger value chains, potentially contributing to an
increase in exports and open space for other areas of economic activity to grow, such as tourism. In
addition, it may reduce Honduras’ out-migration and incentivize migrants to return, invest and transfer
skills back into the economy.

26.     Skill upgrades can be a powerful tool in fighting crime and violence. For example, the
Programa de Apoyo Temporal al Empleo (PATI) implemented in El Salvador contributed to lowering the
levels of crime. The program offered income support to vulnerable individuals in urban areas with
program beneficiaries committing to participate in community activities and capacitation programs to
improve their employability and entrepreneurial abilities. This type of program increases the opportunity
cost of joining a criminal group by increasing both the present income as well as participants’ future
potential income.7 At the same time, addressing crime will also require a strategy that reduces impunity,
strengthen the judicial system, and enhance the accountability of the government, including its actions to
reduce impunity.8

27.    Improving education and the skills to compete can help break the cycle between migration
and low growth by lowering the pressure of high reservation wages. Excessively high reservation

7 The World Bank supported a similar cash for work project in Honduras, Employment Generation in Poor Urban Neighborhoods,
which targeted at risk youth and unemployed heads of household with young children. The project also included a number of
crime and violence prevention training and development of human capital, including conflict resolution and preparation for
employment.

wages, which are partly the result of large inflows of remittances, hamper labor market development as
workers require wages that are above their marginal productivity. Increasing labor productivity through
investment in education and skills would help bridge this gap and would positively impact growth,
inclusion, and sustainability, including crime prevention. Better learning outcomes, even at the current
levels of enrollment, would help equip the youth for the acquisition of skills demanded by the labor
market. In this regard, tackling the country’s low secondary school completion rate and low access to
vocational training is fundamental to promote improved job outcomes and generate greater productivity
and innovation. Moreover, the country may follow an active policy of training adults focused on skills
that facilitate entry into better occupations, including providing training to those formerly involved in
crime and gangs. It is also likely that improved educational outcomes contribute to higher retention rates
at the secondary level. Education, as noted above, is also a key building block for other priorities, in
particular reducing crime and violence.

28.      The country’s institutional framework has implications for growth, inequality, and
resilience. Even though improvements to the quality of institutions are difficult to achieve, Honduras’
ability to harness its potential hinges on improving the capacity of the public sector to plan and implement
effective policies, execute public investment projects, deliver services, and increase accountability. The
discussion in the SCD concludes that improvements to the quality of institutions in Honduras will require
a broad agenda that includes: (i) strengthening of the rule of law and the judiciary, (ii) building capacity
for implementation and enforcement, and (iii) improvements in the accountability framework.

29.     Addressing the challenges emerging from the three cycles feeding into Honduras’ weak
development outcomes will also require policies that complement those priorities identified as entry
point to the cycles, particularly those that have a direct impact on (i) reigniting economic growth and (ii)
fostering inclusion.

30.      Promoting fiscal sustainability is perhaps the most critical objective to reigniting economic
growth over the medium term. While measures for reigniting growth in the short term are difficult to
identify, a stronger fiscal position that is achieved now and sustained over the medium to the long-term
will set the basis for progress on service delivery, and growth and employment. Fiscal deficits and slower
economic growth since the 2009 crisis have increased public debt, affecting investor confidence. While
the authorities have recently made strides to reduce the fiscal deficit, fiscal consolidation will require
additional reforms that enhance public financial management and rebalance expenditures from current
spending towards capital spending. Curtailing the fiscal losses in the power sector will also bolster the
fiscal position, and in this regard the current environment of low oil prices does provide an opportunity to
advance an electricity subsidy reform. At the same time, there is scope for mobilizing additional tax
revenues by improving tax and customs administration and reducing tax exemptions which represent a
large share of GDP.

31.      With a view to generating sustained growth and facilitating further insertion into global
markets, it is important to address the constraints of expensive and low quality infrastructure
services. Key objectives should include a modernization of the state owned electricity company (ENEE)
through actions aimed at improving: (i) energy pricing and energy efficiency mechanisms, such as
modernizing the energy matrix towards cleaner and cheaper energy sources to reduce the dominance of
thermal power; (ii) the legal framework to reduce fraud and theft; and (iii) the corporate governance of
ENEE, including building capacity of the newly created energy regulatory agency. To promote further
insertion into global markets, a focus on port infrastructure and improved road maintenance is warranted
and should be combined with improved logistics and regulations to reduce waiting times while improving
customs enforcement. Expanding the road network is important to promote the inclusion of poorer rural
areas and small producers, accounting for many of the country’s extreme poor. These investments, if


                                                    16
planned and executed well, also represent an opportunity for growth in the near term, providing
opportunities for Public Private Partnerships and the creation of jobs.

32.     Measures aimed at boosting growth also support a more competitive private sector and help
generate more demand for labor, creating much needed jobs. As in other economies, small and young
firms generate a disproportionate share of job creation. Reducing their exposure to economic volatility
through a healthier fiscal environment allows these firms, which are often the least able to survive shocks,
important economic space to grow. Reducing operating costs through improvements in the energy sector
and transportation would boost productivity – bolstering the potential for productivity growth in key
industries, including agribusiness and manufacturing. Combined with the policy levers designed to
address the cycles of crime, emigration, and institutions identified above, these measures would be
expected to promote a better business climate, a more skilled workforce, and lead to more job creation by
the private sector.

33.      The challenge of fostering inclusion cannot wait for education and skills to have an impact.
Eighty percent of Honduran children live in poverty and a majority do not finish secondary school. There
is strong evidence that the current social assistance programs are having an impact in the reduction of
poverty and should be expanded to cover all eligible families living in extreme poverty. Over the long-
term, efforts at inclusion need the support of good-quality basic services that empower the population
with the assets both to create and to profit from opportunities. Similarly, reducing child malnutrition
should figure as a high priority: studies estimate that malnutrition is responsible for approximately 45
percent of under-five mortality and that stunting, in particular, is estimated to contribute to GDP losses of
up to 11 percent.9 In order to improve the chances that each child in Honduras reaches his or her potential,
the country needs to ensure that young children have access to adequate food, health services, and a
healthy environment (including access to clean water and sanitation facilities), and appropriate medical
care, especially during pregnancy and the first two years of age. A solid insertion of Hondurans into the
labor market is the best bet for the country to achieve sustainable inclusion. This calls for active labor
market policies that work towards making markets more efficient and inclusive by addressing issues of
information, lack of skills, and low job creation. Minimum wages set in line with market wages have the
potential to unleash investment and production in high productivity sectors and contribute to a better
allocation of resources in the economy. Addressing skills and information problems can translate to
improved employment opportunities for the young and poor and, in turn, can be a countervailing force to
violence and crime.

34.       One final reflection regards the need to focus on policies that go beyond average higher
growth rates and lower inequality, and include vulnerability considerations. For this, it will be
critical that Honduras continue building resilience to natural hazards as these are expected to increase in
frequency and severity due to the expected impacts of climate change. An ample agenda is already under
implementation for building institutions and improving infrastructure and local planning to build
resilience to natural hazards. Greater attention is needed, however, to the impact of “small” natural events
that affect the lives of the poor in a localized but dramatic manner. In this regard, the capacity of
households to manage the impact of natural hazards can be enhanced by linking them to saving
mechanisms and increasing the availability of financial instruments, such as agricultural insurance.
Similarly, improved capacity to manage natural resources, including water and forests, can decrease
vulnerability of households to hazards like droughts and landslides.

35.     There is no doubt that this is a complex agenda that will require persistence and
commitment over time. But it is a worthwhile endeavor as it would allow Honduras to move from being
a country of potentials to one of actuals.

Process and knowledge gaps
36.     This Systematic Country Diagnostic draws on existing analysis and publications, new
analysis, and, importantly, consultations and ongoing dialogue with stakeholders in Honduras.
Throughout discussions, there was broad consensus on the diagnosis of challenges faced in Honduras, in
particular the country’s high rates of crime and violence and institutional quality, as well as priorities
ahead.

37.     Although there are some analyses of the nature and causes of Honduras’ high and
persistent levels of poverty and inequality, as well as its volatile growth, this SCD identifies several
knowledge gaps in the existing analyses. In identifying knowledge gaps, the SCD focused on areas
where new information could help inform specific actions in the priority areas. Eight concrete knowledge
gaps were identified:
     What are the determinants of low returns to investment in Honduras?
     What is the full cost of crime to the Honduran economy?
     What is the effect of labor market regulations on job creation, informal employment and
        unemployment in Honduras?
     What is the impact of the country’s high minimum salaries on job creation, particularly for
        unskilled workers?
     What are the challenges facing increased female inclusion into the labor force?
     How does crime affect the welfare of the bottom 40 percent in Honduras?
     What is the relationship between vulnerability, extreme weather events and poverty?

Structure of the SCD
38.     This SCD is structured as follows: the second chapter examines trends in poverty and shared
prosperity in Honduras and identifies the roles of economic growth, labor markets, and social policy for
poverty and inequality reduction. The following three chapters provide analyses of the main factors
affecting inclusion, growth, and sustainability. Chapter 3 analyzes the drivers of growth and identifies the
key constraints to further growth. Chapter 4 assesses the drivers associated with the country’s limited
inclusion and high inequality. Chapter 5 identifies risks to the sustainability of development, including

adequate fiscal policy, the role of crime and violence, and environmental hazards. The final chapter takes
stock of these elements and identifies priorities ahead.

2. Poverty
In 2013, more than half of the Honduran population lived below the poverty line, with six out of ten rural
families living in extreme poverty. Honduras also ranked among the most unequal countries in the region,
and its middle class was among the smallest in LAC. Low levels of economic inclusion, limited social
mobility, and the vulnerability of lower-income households to a wide range of shocks have made poverty
in Honduras especially deep and intractable. Over the past 15 years, many Hondurans have left the
country to seek opportunities abroad, and due to years of large-scale migration Honduras now has one of
the world’s highest levels of remittances as a share of GDP. Although remittances have enormous
potential to reduce poverty and increase household incomes, emerging evidence suggests that they may
also be causing Dutch Disease effects, as well as draining the country’s human capital stock and
potentially discouraging labor force participation among domestic workers. Remittances, together with
labor income and employment, have driven poverty trends over the last decade. Cash transfers have had
a positive impact on extreme poverty and social indicators, but their scope is relatively limited.

2.1      Trends in poverty reduction and shared prosperity
39.     Due to the severe multidimensional vulnerability of both individual households and the
country as a whole, poverty rates in Honduras are among the highest in the LAC region. In 2013,
almost 65 percent of Honduran households were below the poverty line, with 43 percent in extreme
poverty (Figure 2.1).10 Although modest gains were made during the global economic expansion of the
mid-2000s, these were wiped out during the final years of the decade, when the impact of the global
financial crisis was magnified by domestic political instability. By 2012, both the moderate and extreme
poverty rates had returned to their 2003 levels. This repeats what has become an unfortunate pattern in
Honduras, marking the fourth time since 1990 that sudden shocks have undone years of progress in
poverty reduction.

40.     Despite these setbacks, the share of the population living on less than US$1.90 per day—the
global extreme poverty line—has declined over time, falling from about 44 percent of the
population in 1990 to 19 percent in 2013. Nevertheless, Honduras’ extreme poverty rate remains the
second highest in the LAC region.11 Meanwhile, the moderate poverty rate also experienced a modest and
uneven long-term decline, falling by roughly 20 percentage points since 1990, though it too remains one
of the highest in LAC. In 2013, both the moderate and extreme poverty rates decreased for the first time
since 2009 (Figure 2.2).

41.      Slow and inconsistent poverty reduction in Honduras is a departure from regional trends.
Poverty rates in LAC have declined steadily and substantially over the past decade. With a GDP per
capita of US$2,291, just 30 percent of the LAC average, Honduras is one of the poorest countries in a
growing region. The aggregate LAC poverty rate fell from 41.3 percent in 2003 to 25.3 percent in 2012.
Meanwhile, Honduras’ poverty rate fluctuated between 53 and 65 percent, and it is now more than double
the LAC average. While Central America has lagged the broader regional trend, its overall poverty rate
has modestly declined, and since 2009 poverty rates in Honduras have diverged substantially from those
of its neighbors.




10 Internationally comparable moderate and extreme poverty are measured US$4 and US$2.50 per day in 2005 purchasing-power
parity terms.
11 Comparable extreme poverty data are available for 18 LAC countries. These data exclude most Caribbean countries, as well as

Venezuela. Poverty rates for Haiti, Guatemala and Nicaragua are from 2012, 2011 and 2009, respectively.

                         Box 2.1: International benchmarking: poverty and inequality12

 Honduras’ global extreme poverty rate is higher than its structural peers and four times higher
 than its aspirational peers; its inequality rates are the highest among both structural and
 aspirational peers. As of 2012, the last year for which comparable global poverty rates have been
 published, Honduras’ extreme poverty rate was slightly higher than the average poverty of countries
 identified as structural peers (Figure 2.3). Compared to aspirational peers, Honduran poverty was four
 times, or about 19 percentage points, higher. Similarly, inequality, measured using the Gini Coefficient,
 has been consistently higher in Honduras relative to its peers (Figure 2.4).13 On average, both structural
 and aspirational peers have inequality of around 0.40 throughout the period even while Honduras’
 fluctuates near 0.60. Notably, Peru and El Salvador have decreased their inequality levels over the last
 decade: Peru’s Gini decreased from 0.53 in 2003 to 0.45 in 2011 while El Salvador’s decreased to 0.42
 during the same period.




12 For global comparisons, two sets of countries have been identified. Structural peers and aspirational peers (see Annex 1).
13 Care should be taken in interpreting the Gini coefficient across regions, however, as many countries outside of the LAC region
rely on welfare aggregates based on consumption, while in LAC, the welfare aggregate is based on income. Income-based
inequality measures tend to be higher than consumption-based measures.

     2007, 2009 values were missing. Finally, for Lithuania 2007 and 2009 were missing.

Who are the poor?

42.     In Honduras more than half of the poor, and two-thirds of the extreme poor, live in rural
areas (Figure 2.5). Reductions in both extreme and moderate poverty between 2003 and 2013 were
driven by gains in rural areas, while the rest of the country experienced a slight increase in both. Rural
poverty is most heavily concentrated in the western and southern areas of the country, known as the “Dry
Corridor” (Corredor Seco). 14 The rural poor overwhelmingly rely on agriculture as their principal
livelihood. Seventy-two percent of agricultural families in Honduras are engaged in semi-subsistence
farming, which is typically characterized by low marginal productivity and high vulnerability to shocks.15
Between 2008 and 2013, self-employment represented about half of total employment in rural areas.

43.      Nonmonetary poverty is most acute among the rural population, and rural households are
far more likely to suffer from a lack of basic services. The Unmet Basic Needs (UBN) index describes
the share of the population that is deprived of at least one fundamental public good or social service. It
identifies the share of families which: (i) include children aged 6-14 who are not attending school, (ii)
lack access to running water, (iii) lack access to improved sanitary facilities, (iv) lack access to electricity,
(v) live in housing with a dirt floor, or (vi) live in overcrowded housing. Honduras’ average UBN score
across all administrative departments is 27.3 percent. However, a breakdown by administrative
department reveals substantial geographic differences, ranging from Cortés, which has the lowest UBN
score at 11.5 percent, to Gracias a Dios, which has the highest at 51.7 percent. The urban centers have
lower levels of unmet basic needs as shown in Figure 2.6. Departments in which the majority of the
population is comprised of Indigenous Peoples (IP) and Afro-descendants (AD) (Gracias a Dios, La Paz
and Intibucá) have UBN scores that are worse than the national average (Box 2.2).

                          Box 2.2: Indigenous Peoples and Afro-descendants in Honduras

An estimated 8.6 percent of the Honduran population is made up of Indigenous Peoples or Afro-
descendants.16 There are seven indigenous groups (Miskito, Pech, Tawahka, Nahua, Tolupán, Chortí y
Lenca), one group considered both indigenous and Afro-descendant (the Garifunas) and one Afro-
descendant group, the Creoles. While the IP are concentrated in the southwest and northeast corners of the
country, the AD are primarily along the Caribbean coast (Figure 2.7). Social structures in these groups
remain strong and, except for the Lenca and the Chorti, the groups have kept their languages. Given the
lack of information about the IP and AD populations in the Honduran household surveys, there are no
official estimates of the poverty rates for these groups. However, other analysis suggests that poverty
rates are high among indigenous groups: rough estimations from indigenous organizations indicate that
over 70 percent live in poverty and over half of the population is not employed.17 Agriculture is the main
source of livelihood of the majority of this population, albeit at a subsistence level. Agriculture is the
predominant activity for most IP and AD groups in Honduras.

     are included as AD.

44.      Children in Honduras are especially likely to live in poverty and suffer the consequences of
malnutrition and inadequate access to clean water and sanitation. In 2013, nearly 80 percent of
Hondurans younger than 15 lived in poverty, in contrast to 64 percent of prime-age adults (Table 2.1).
Approximately one in four children in Honduras is so undernourished that their development is stunted,
with negative implications for their future learning abilities and labor capacity. 18 The World Food
Program estimates that 60 percent of Hondurans are food insecure, and in the Corredor Seco, where
poverty is most acute, 58 percent of children under five suffer from chronic malnutrition. Contributing
factors include limited access to clean water, a nutrient-deficient diet, poor sanitation and insufficient

percent) than in urban centers (14.6 percent).

45.     Extreme poverty remains pervasive in Honduras, yet there are signs of improvement in
education and labor force participation among households below the extreme poverty line. The
Government has made substantial investments in the human capital of the extreme poor over the past
decade (Annex 3). As a result, school enrollment rates among children aged 6-12 living in extreme
poverty rose by 16 percent, and the average years of education among heads of extreme poor households
increased by more than one year to 3.6 years. Nevertheless, the share of 13 to 18 year olds enrolled in
school remains low for both the poor and extreme poor at just 15 percent. Labor market outcomes show
mixed signs of improvement for the poor and extreme poor. Unemployment rates have fallen, particularly
for men, while the female labor force participation rate among the extreme poor increased. Even so,
female labor force participation among the extreme poor remained at just 37.1 percent, below the labor
force participation rate of 49.8 percent for the population as a whole.

Households in the poorest 40 percent continue to live in extreme poverty

46.      Hondurans in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution have an average income of
less than US$1.70, just half of the average for LAC as a whole.20 The economic expansion of the mid-
2000s was generally pro-poor, and incomes rose among the bottom 40 percent at an annualized rate of 9.4
percent, faster than the rate for the population as a whole (Figure 2.8). In fact, Honduras outperformed
most LAC countries in promoting shared prosperity during this period. However, these gains were
partially erased in the wake of the political and economic crises at the end of the decade, and from 2009
to 2013, the average income among the bottom 40 percent contracted by an annualized rate of 2.9 percent,
while average incomes fell by 4.3 percent. These outcomes were the worst in the LAC region and
underscore the importance of vulnerability in perpetuating poverty in Honduras.

Income inequality: the missing middle class

47.      Income inequality in Honduras is among the highest in LAC, and periods of inclusive
growth have been followed by contractions and regressive recoveries.21 Between 2003 and 2013,
inequality fell substantially across the LAC region (Figure 2.9).22 After spiking in 2005, inequality in
Honduras declined rapidly through 2009 as income growth among the poorest households outpaced
growth among the better off (Figure 2.10). GDP contracted in 2009, yet inequality continued to decline as
the initial effects of the crisis fell hardest on households in the top decile, which saw their aggregate
income drop by 13.8 percent. 23 Poor and middle-class households also suffered as the economy
contracted, and they were far slower to recover. From 2010 to 2011, inequality again increased as
rebounding growth benefited the top of the distribution, even as incomes continued to fall among the
bottom 90 percent. After plateauing between 2011 and 2012, the Gini coefficient fell sharply to 0.53 in
2013 as GDP growth slowed. This drop in inequality was due to a combination of income growth among
lower deciles and declining income among the top decile. This may signal a return to a more progressive
growth pattern, as income growth at the bottom of the distribution has again surpassed growth at the top.

48.      After expanding modestly during the mid-2000s, Honduras’ middle class contracted in the
wake of the domestic and global crises.24 As poverty fell from 2005 to 2009, the middle class expanded
from 10.9 percent to 15.7 percent of the population. However, by 2011 the middle class had shrunk to less
than 13 percent and by 2013 it had returned to 10.9 percent, making it one of the smallest in LAC (Figure
2.11).25 In many countries a large and growing middle class has been associated with stronger economic
growth, better governance quality and a more stable society. In Honduras, the share of low-income
households—those that are above the poverty line but not yet in the middle class—rose in the years prior
to 2009, reflecting the economy’s modest success in enabling households to escape poverty. After 2009,
however, the share declined again as many households fell back below the poverty line.

49.     The country’s small middle class and high level of income inequality is a concern among the
Honduran public. Most households are clustered at the far ends of the income distribution, leaving a
“missing middle” between them (Figure 2.12). Opinion polls indicate that almost 47 percent of
Hondurans find the current distribution of income to be unjust, and 34 percent regard it as very unjust.26
The 70 percent of the population currently living in poverty together accounted for less than a third of
total household income in 2013. Meanwhile, the wealthiest one percent received 13 percent of total
income in 2013.

2.2      Causes of poverty and drivers of poverty reduction
Poverty and vulnerability in Honduras: the role of resilience in development outcomes

50.      It is difficult for poor household in Honduras to rise above the poverty line, and those that
do remain highly vulnerable to shocks that can push them back into poverty. Only 6 percent of
households that escaped from poverty between 2003 and 2007 were still out of poverty in 2011.27 These
households saw their income grow by almost 50 percent over the period. Chronically poor households in
rural areas experienced stronger income growth (around 40 percent) than those in urban areas (around 20
percent).28 At both individual and household levels, rural residence is associated with much greater levels
of chronic poverty. Sixty-five percent of rural households were chronically poor, compared to 31 percent
of urban households, and rates of extreme poverty were particularly high among agricultural workers.
Credit constraints, low marginal productivity of land and labor, limited educational attainment, and the
absence of effective risk-mitigation strategies prevent the poor from accessing new economic
opportunities and increase their susceptibility to negative shocks. These factors reduce social mobility and
increase the likelihood that households that escape poverty will be pushed back into it.



27 A synthetic panel was constructed based on Dang et al, 2014. Measures of poverty taken at one point in time, or even multiple
points in time provide little information on intra-generational mobility. Honduras does not collect the panel data required to
follow individuals over time. However, a methodology that simulates panel data was applied to household surveys in Honduras
for 2003, 2007 and 2011 to look at movements into and out of poverty using the international poverty line of US$4 per capita per
day. See World Bank (2015). “Honduras Economic DNA: Maintaining commitment”.
28 This is corroborated by sharper falls in the poverty gap indicator for the rural population than for the urban population (18.3

percent versus 15.5 percent reduction) between 2003 and 2013, indicating that the poor in rural areas, while still poorer than
those in urban areas, saw their incomes rise faster. The poverty gap measures the distance between the income of those living in
poverty and the income needed to exit poverty ($4/day). World Bank estimates using SEDLAC (CEDLAS and the World Bank).

                                                               28
51.     Natural hazards can have a particularly devastating effect on the poor, and in Honduras the
absence of crucial physical, institutional and economic infrastructure leaves poor families especially
vulnerable to natural disasters. Honduras suffers from environmental hazards ranging from hurricanes
and tropical storms to droughts and erratic rainfall patterns.29 World Bank Group research has shown that
catastrophic events have led to drops in household consumption per capita, compelling individuals to
decrease calorie consumption, sell vital assets, work longer hours and pull children out of school.30 The
adverse impacts of disasters may also disproportionately affect women, who often experience higher rates
of mortality, morbidity and diminished earnings.31

52.      Poverty rates are particularly sensitive to changes—both positive and negative—in labor
income, employment and remittances. During the period of inclusive growth between 2003 and 2008,
rising employment among both men and women drove poverty reduction. Increases in female
employment reduced moderate poverty by 2.4 percentage points and extreme poverty by 2.5 percentage
points, while increasing male employment was associated with 3.2 and 3.3 percentage-point reductions in
moderate and extreme poverty, respectively (Figure 2.14). Remittances also contributed to poverty
reduction during this period, cutting moderate poverty by 1.3 percentage points and extreme poverty by
2.1 percentage points. However, during 2008-2012, a reduction in employment in Honduras coincided
with a weakening US labor market, leading to a simultaneous drop in both labor income and remittances.
The reduction in remittances alone increased moderate and extreme poverty by 2 and 2.3 percentage
points, respectively. However, falling male labor income consistently increased poverty over the entire
period, raising the poverty rate by 3 percentage points in 2003-08 and by 4 percentage points in 2008-
12.32

53.      Before 2012 income growth was the key determinant of poverty trends; however, changes in
income distribution played a dominant role in poverty reduction in 2013. A decomposition analysis
can shed light on the relative contribution of income growth and income distribution to changes in
poverty rates, along with the role of prices (Figure 2.13).33 Gains in overall poverty reduction achieved
prior to 2008 were mainly due to income growth supported by a modest improvement in the distribution
of income, though these gains were mitigated by higher prices. This situation was reversed between 2008
and 2012, when weakening economic growth and an increasingly unequal distribution of income pushed
poverty rates up, while price changes partially offset this effect. By contrast, almost all poverty reduction
observed in 2013 has been attributable to improvements in the income distribution.




29 The probability of disasters also affects people’s perceptions of uncertainty, disrupting their normal decision making. Disas ters
have the potential to destroy part of the capital stock and impair productivity; thus they are characterized by declines in
investment, corporate leverage, output, and employment, and account for part of increased risk premium in financial markets.
30 Baez et al (2013).
31 EAP DRM Knowledge Notes No. 24: Making women’s voices count in disaster programs in EAP. Several underlying factors

exacerbate women’s vulnerability to the impacts of disasters, such as lack of means to recoup lost assets, limited livelihood
options, restricted access to education and basic services, and in many cases, also socio-cultural norms.
32 Due to how the decomposition is calculated, men’s falling labor income may be due to fewer men in the household (resulting

from to increased out-migration, for example) rather than falling wages. Additional analysis reveals a small increase in the
average wage of men during the three periods while the share of the male share of the adult population fell slightly.
33 The price level effect captures changes in the poverty line due to changes in the price of the basket of goods rather than

changes in the income of households. This is important for official poverty lines as they are not based on a constant monetary line
but rather on the cost of a constant basket of goods.

  poverty rates–the proportion of households with labor income of less than US$4 per day per capita. The intrasectoral
  component refers to the sector of employment of the main earner in the household.

54.     Job and wage growth in manufacturing, construction and agriculture contributed to
poverty reduction prior to 2008, while declines in those same sectors caused poverty to rise after
2008. Increased earnings from manufacturing reduced the poverty rate by 2.2 percentage points between
2003 and 2008, whereas construction and agriculture contributed 1 and 1.5 percentage points, respectively
(Figure 2.15). Conversely, during 2008-2012 declining earnings in these sectors increased poverty.

Manufacturing contributed the largest share, accounting for 1.4 percentage points of the increase in
poverty.

Social assistance programs

55.      The expansion of social assistance programs has had a modest but positive impact on
extreme poverty over the past decade. In recent years these programs have proliferated throughout the
region (Figure 2.16). Honduras’ Bono Vida Mejor (formerly Bono 10,000) is a conditional cash transfer
(CCT) program designed to incentivize child healthcare and school attendance (Box 2.3). The Bono is
relatively well-targeted compared with other interventions in the country and with other CCT programs in
Central America, though substantial coverage gaps among the extreme poor remain. Estimates for 2013
show that 75 percent of beneficiary households are extremely poor.34 Only 14.4 percent of beneficiaries
are in the top two quintiles. This is in line with other CCT programs in the region and compares well with
other social assistance programs in Honduras. Since 2013, the Bono has improved its targeting to the
extreme poor. Improvements in targeting and coverage will also be critical to improving the country’s
other social assistance and subsidy programs.

56.     The Bono has reduced poverty among its beneficiaries while increasing primary school
attendance and demand for health services in program areas. A 2013 impact evaluation found that
the program had reduced the overall poverty rate among beneficiaries from 88.8 percent to 83.8 percent,
and the extreme poverty rate from 73 percent to 63.7 percent (Figure 2.17). Among rural beneficiaries the
poverty rate fell by 3.1 percentage points, while per capita consumption increased by 7.8 percent.
Simulations of the recent improvements in targeting and reduction in benefits suggest a potential
reduction in the national extreme poverty rate of 1.7 percentage points. The impact evaluation also
revealed that primary school enrollment in program areas had increased by 3.1 percentage points, and
attendance rose by 3.5 percentage points. While child visits to health centers increased by 4.1 percentage
points in program areas, the evaluation did not find a significant correlation with nutritional outcomes,
vaccinations or prenatal care.35

34 World Bank calculations based on 2013 EPHPM and using ADEPT SP software.
35 One possible explanation could be the insufficient supply of health services in rural areas. Increase in nutritional outcomes is
also typically challenging since they are a result of multiple factors – water, sanitation, food, practices, etc.

                                                               31
                              Box 2.3: Improvements in Honduras’ CCT System

In 2010 the Government launched a national consolidated CCT program, Bono 10,000, which
rapidly became the country’s main social assistance vehicle. Its annual funding was equal to 0.7
percent of GDP (US$ 130 million), and by 2013 the program reached almost 20 percent of the population,
including 270,000 rural households and 50,000 urban households. Before 2009 the Government had
operated two CCT programs that provided income transfers to extreme poor rural households in extreme
poverty: Bono Solidario, which encouraged regular health checkups for infants, and Bono Escolar, which
promoted primary school enrollment among children aged 6-13. Bono 10,000 consolidated these
programs and expanded its targeting to include both extreme and moderately poor families with children
under the age of 5 or in primary school. The program paid a benefit of 10,000 lempiras (US$500) per year
to its beneficiaries, ranking it among the most generous CCT programs in the world.

In 2014 the CCT program, now called Bono Vida Mejor, was enhanced, and it became the core
intervention of the government’s social development strategy, Estrategia Vida Mejor. To improve the
fiscal sustainability of the program, the targeting formula was revised to restrict eligibility to beneficiary
families classified as extremely poor. Coverage was expanded to students in lower secondary school to
address the country’s relatively high dropout rate. Benefits are now based on the number of eligible
children in the household and capped at 10,000 lempiras. The program’s expansion prioritized areas that
(i) had high rates of extreme poverty, (ii) were prone to severe droughts, (iii) were home to indigenous
communities, and (iv) suffered from a high child incidence of child migration during the recent surge in
undocumented child migrants leaving for the US. The program is still evolving and the government is
keen to strengthen the institution that executes the program.


Migration and remittances: A complex relationship

57.     Over the past 15 years, migration and remittances have come to play an increasingly
important and complex role in the Honduran economy. As of 2013, an estimated 8 percent of
Honduran nationals were living outside of Honduras, including as much as 13 percent of the working-age
population. 36 There were over half a million Honduran-born immigrants living in the U.S. in 2013,
representing over 80 percent of Hondurans living abroad (Figure 2.18).37 Large-scale migration to the US
and elsewhere has accelerated rapidly in recent years; over 25 percent of Honduran migrants in the US
arrived after 2006, and migration grew at an average rate of 5.2 percent per year between 2000 and 2012.
Recent emigrants have lower levels of educational attainment than earlier cohorts, suggesting that
emigration is increasingly common among the less well-off (Box 2.4). An estimated 60 to 77 percent of
Honduran immigrants in the US are undocumented, 38 and a lack of legal status limits their earnings
potential. Even so, remittances skyrocketed in the years prior to the global financial crisis, rising from less
than US$1 billion in 2000 to US$2.8 billion in 2008. Remittances fell to US$2.47 billion in 2009 as the
crisis weakened the US labor market, but then gradually recovered to US$3.1 billion in 2013, equivalent
to 17 percent of GDP. In real per capita terms, however, they are yet to return to their pre-crisis value
(Figure 2.19).

58.     Remittances have become increasingly pro-poor and have decreased poverty rates. There is
evidence that remittances in Honduras have led to poverty and inequality reductions.39 Between 2003 and
2008 remittances contributed to falling poverty rates, but the drop in remittances following the global
financial crisis increased poverty from 2008 to 2012 (Figure 2.14). Remittances are increasingly
important to households at the lower end of the income distribution, reflecting changing demographics of
Honduran migrants (Box 2.4). In 2013, they represented just over 20 percent of per capita household
income among households in the bottom two quintiles, up from just 8 percent in 2003. The share of poor
households that receive remittances also more than doubled in the last decade, rising from 1.7 percent to
3.4 percent for households in the lowest quintile and from 3.4 percent to 7.3 percent for households in the
second-lowest, while the share of households in the richest quintile receiving remittances fell from 8.2
percent to 4.3 percent. Among households in the first two quintiles that received remittances, those
remittances represented almost half of their income (48.9 and 49.2 percent, respectively) in 2013.
Children from families reporting remittances are more likely to stay in school and enrollment rates are
approximately 12 percent higher for those aged 12-17.40

were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) by the US government, granting them work authorization
and protection against deportation. Even though the TPS only applied to those arriving before the end of
1998, increasing numbers of Hondurans continued to migrate to the US. Today, the majority of the
Honduran-born population in the US is undocumented.

In recent years Honduran migrants have become increasingly bimodal in terms of their education
and skill levels, revealing the changing dynamics that motivate and facilitate migration. Since 2010
Honduran migrants have become more likely to have either a primary education or less, or a completed
secondary education or more. Whereas those with an incomplete secondary education accounted for more
than half of post-Mitch migrants, they accounted for just one in ten adult migrants after 2010. The job
profiles of Honduran immigrants have also changed: prior to 2000, only 25 percent of Honduran
migrants worked in construction or food service, but by 2010 this share had doubled. These patterns
reflect increasing emigration by poorer Hondurans. This is confirmed by the change in the distribution of
receipt of remittances observed between 2003 and 2013. In 2003, the bulk of remittances went to the top
quintile, but most now go to the middle quintiles.

(2010 onwards) are from the ACS 2013 while information from the post-Mitch cohort (1998-2000) are from the 2000 US Census.
The figure presented breaks workers into three skill levels: the unskilled, who completed primary schooling at most (including
those with no formal schooling); the low-skilled, who completed some secondary education; and the skilled, who have at least a
secondary-school education.

Recent Honduran migrants to the US are younger on average and include more children. While in
the initial wave, approximately 80 percent of migrants were 25 or older, this age group accounted for 70
percent of those arriving in the US between 2010 and 2013; instead, more than a quarter of migrants were
15 or younger during this period, suggesting more family migration and reunification.

The recent surge in child migrants to the US has led to a joint effort with El Salvador and
Guatemala to address the structural causes of migration. Fleeing poverty, lack of opportunity and
some of the highest crime rates in the world, the number of unaccompanied minors from Honduras
detained at the US-Mexico border rose from fewer than 7,000 in 2013 to over 18,000 in 2014,
contributing an international humanitarian crisis. 41 In 2015 Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras
proposed the “Plan of the Alliance for the Prosperity of the Northern Triangle” to expand economic
opportunities and develop human capital. The crisis at the border has triggered increased interest and
investment in the region, including a US-sponsored US$1 billion “Plan for Central America” to support
the tripartite strategy.


59.      While migration and remittances have become important contributors to household income
and poverty reduction in Honduras, and can help insulate households against domestic volatility,
their macroeconomic implications can exacerbate poverty and increase household income volatility.
As discussed in Chapter 3, remittances can erode international competitiveness and slow the pace of job
creation. Dependence on remittances can also exacerbate external vulnerability, as it ties household
income to trends in foreign labor markets (Box 2.5). For example, the sharp decline in remittances
following the global financial crisis contributed to rising poverty rates in Honduras, underscoring the
vulnerability of poor households to external shocks. Similarly, exchange-rate fluctuations can impact the
real value of remittances.42 However, remittances can also stabilize consumption against domestic shocks.
The sensitivity of remittances to growth in Hondurans suggests that they may be part of household
strategies to cope with local economic trends and smooth consumption over time. Finally, with limited
access to credit and insurance markets, migration and remittances may serve as an insurance strategy for
low-income households.43

                        Box 2.5: Analyzing the determinants of remittances in Honduras

Although external factors are the most relevant explaining changes in remittance flows to
Honduras, domestic factors are also important. A time-series Vector Autoregressive Regression
(VAR) analysis conducted for this SCD finds that, in line with findings in the literature, the economic
cycle in the U.S. is the most important factor explaining changes in remittance flows to Honduras: almost
40 percent of the variation in remittance flows is explained by U.S. economic activity. Similarly, a
deterioration of employment among Honduran workers in the U.S. is associated with weaker remittance
flows back home. Conditions in global financial markets and the stance of monetary policy in the U.S.
also appear to influence remittance flows. But not everything is external, as Honduras’ GDP explains
around 25 percent of the variability in remittance flows. Higher economic activity in Honduras implies a
greater demand for labor and higher wages, as well as an increase in wealth. Hence, as GDP growth in
Honduras accelerates, the demand for non-labor income falls and so remittances decreases.

42 For example, in the case of the Philippines (Yang, 2008).
43 Relying on data from the Philippines, Yang and Choi (2007) estimate that about 60 percent of exogenous falls in household

income were replaced by remittance inflows. As a result, households with access to remittances did not see their consumption fall,
while similarly affected households without remittances saw significant consumption effects. Clarke and Wallsten (2004) find
that remittances were similarly used as insurance in Jamaica, where they replaced 25 percent of damages from Hurricane Gilbert
in 1992; The World Bank has also found that remittances increased following natural disasters in Bangladesh, Dominican
Republic, Haiti and Honduras (Acosta et al 2008). Using data for 26 LAC countries, Acosta et al (2008) find that remittances are
largely countercyclical, responding to reductions in real output below trend with more than a proportional increase.

3. Economic Growth in Honduras: Challenges and
   Opportunities
Over the past 30 years, Honduras has experienced modest economic growth marked by considerable
volatility. Meanwhile, economic growth has not kept pace with rapid population growth, preventing
Honduras from converging with high-performing countries in Central America and elsewhere in the LAC
region. External macroeconomic vulnerability, exposure to natural hazards, and a history of fiscal
instability have repeatedly erased years of progress in raising incomes and reducing poverty,
contributing to a set of mutually reinforcing vicious cycles that have trapped the country in a low-growth
equilibrium. The Honduran economy’s small size and high degree of external openness, its large
agricultural sector, its sensitivity to exogenous shocks, and the presence of both chronic and emerging
challenges to competitiveness have inhibited diversification, thereby undermining productivity growth
and preventing the private sector from sustaining robust job creation in high-value sectors. A
burdensome regulatory structure and capacity constraints, limited investment spillovers, inadequate
infrastructure, low access to capital, a troubling rise in crime and violence, and large emigration flows
not only slow overall growth but also narrow the distribution of its returns. Opportunities for sustained
growth may come from the demographic dividend associated with the increasing labor force, provided
the private sector is able to generate high-productivity jobs sufficient to accommodate the growing
workforce.

60.      Decades of modest, highly volatile economic growth, combined with a rapidly expanding
population, has resulted in slow, uneven improvements in GDP per capita. Over the past 30 years,
Honduras’ average annual real GDP growth rate (3.6 percent) exceeded both the LAC average (3.4
percent) and the global average (2.9 percent). Yet during the same period Honduras’ population grew at
an annual average rate of 2.4 percent per year, far higher than the LAC average of 1.6 percent and on par
with the average for Sub-Saharan Africa of 2.7 percent. An increase in the size of the labor force has the
potential to yield a demographic dividend. However, this will be contingent on the ability of the private
sector to generate a sustained increase in high-productivity jobs sufficient to accommodate the growing
workforce. If job growth is inadequate or confined to low-productivity sectors, demographic trends may
further depress wages and contribute to negative economic and social outcomes.

61.     While periods of robust growth have generated important gains in productivity,
employment and poverty reduction, persistent volatility has repeatedly erased these gains, lowering
Honduras’ long-term growth trajectory and exacerbating poverty and inequality. Between 1960 and
2014 there were only two periods in which economic growth was sustained for more than five
consecutive years. Growth in Honduras has occurred in a series of fits and starts, and since the mid-1970s,
year-on-year growth has varied by more than 80 percent in almost half of all years, a degree of volatility
that exceeds global, LAC and Central American averages.44 Natural disasters and global economic shocks
have had a major impact on Honduras’ growth performance, while a combination of weak institutional
capacity and limited fiscal space have hindered efforts to build resilience.

         Disasters associated with natural hazards, in particular climate-related events, have repeatedly
         derailed growth. Honduras’ inherent vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change is an
         additional source of macroeconomic uncertainty. The country is highly exposed to hurricanes and
         tropical storms, mainly from the Atlantic, as well as dry periods associated with the El Niño weather
         cycle.45 Between 1994 and 2013 Honduras suffered the highest average annual economic losses due
         to climate-related disasters in Central America. During this period the cumulative impact of small-
         scale climate-related disasters (without taking into account damages from Hurricane Mitch) resulted
         in average economic losses of 2.5 percent of GDP per year.46 Hurricane Mitch, the worst disaster in
         Honduras’ recent history, devastated the country in 1998, abruptly ending a period of economic
         expansion. It affected 90 percent of Honduras’ territory, resulting in over 5,700 dead, 8,000 missing,
         and almost half a million people displaced.47 It also destroyed more than 50 percent of the country’s
         road infrastructure and 70 percent of its water network and damaged about 400,000 houses. 48
         Subsequent extreme hydro-meteorological events since Hurricane Mitch suggest that Honduras’
         disaster vulnerability is on the rise. Most recently, eight tropical storms and hurricanes of various
         magnitudes had pronounced damages on the Atlantic coast with effects extending to the entire

Nevertheless, probabilistic risk models estimate losses associated with an event of a 500 year return period at approximately
US$2.2 billion, representing 6.3 percent of GDP, and an average annual loss due to earthquake equivalent to US$ 35.5 million, or
0.103 percent of 2013 GDP (CCRIF SPC, 2014).

percent of US per capita income. In 2014, these same indicators fell to 6.2 percent and 4.3 percent,

been diverging from them, with most of this divergence occurring between 1960 and 1990 (Figure 3.3).

63.      External and domestic shocks have repeatedly erased gains in poverty reduction, and post-
crisis recoveries are often far less progressive than pre-crisis expansions. There have only been two
periods in the past two decades in which poverty has fallen for three or more consecutive years, and both
were periods of robust growth. However, each period ended with a sharp contraction followed by multiple
years of poverty increases. Between 1991 and 1994 GDP growth averaged 5 percent per year, and the
poverty rate50 fell by 10.8 percentage points; between 2006 and 2009 growth averaged almost 6 percent
per year, and the poverty rate fell by 14.2 percentage points. The sharp downturns that ended each of
these high-growth periods resulted in years of rising poverty, particularly the 2009 crisis, which
completely reversed the progress made during the expansion. And while in each case poverty reduction
resumed as the economy recovered from the shock, in neither case was this recovery sufficient to return
the poverty rate to its pre-crisis low crisis.

Source: World Bank tabulations based on the World Development Indicators, SEDLAC (CEDLAS and the World Bank), and
Honduran Authorities. Note: Poverty changes are based on US$ 4 per day using 2005 PPP. Note that there is a break in the
comparability of the poverty series in 2001, so the change in poverty rate is not reported for that year.

3.1 Drivers of growth
64.     Factor accumulation has been the primary driver of GDP growth, while the contribution of
total factor productivity (TFP) has been almost uniformly negative. Growth accounting estimates
based on a wide range of assumptions reveal a pattern of low and frequently negative rates of TFP growth
combined with relatively high rates of physical and human capital formation. From 1981 to 2013 TFP
contracted by an average of 1.1 percent per year. This long period of negative TFP growth was not unique
to Honduras, but the overall decline in productivity was more severe in Honduras than among most of its
regional peers.51

65.     Private consumption has reemerged as a key driver of growth. Prior to the 1990s, growth was
led private consumption, supported by relatively modest rates of investment growth. From the early 1990s
through the mid-2000s growth patterns shifted toward investment, boosted by reconstruction efforts
following Hurricane Mitch and the rise of maquila industry. From 1990 through 2008, investment growth
contributed an average 47 percent of GDP growth, up from only 3 percent in the 1980s. Even though the
investment rate in Honduras was consistently higher than in other countries with similar levels of per
capita GDP, this did not translate into accelerated economic growth. In the wake of the 2009 crisis,
aggregate demand again shifted toward consumption, supported by high inflows of remittances. Real
investment declined, and as imports stagnated a gradual recovery in net exports supported growth.

 Knowledge gap: What are the determinants of low returns to investment in Honduras?

 Since the 1990s Honduras’ investment-to-GDP ratio has been high by regional standards, yet
 productivity gains have been persistently low. This strong accumulation of capital was sustained
 throughout the period but did not result in higher productivity growth and hence faster economic
 growth. A majority of this investment is private, including substantial FDI inflows, with public
 investment making a limited contribution. However, in contrast to other countries Honduras
 demonstrates no significant positive correlation between the investment ratio and GDP growth. Capital
 accumulation has contributed an average of just 1.7 percentage points to GDP growth since the early
 1980s. The reasons for the apparently low impact of investment on growth are not fully understood.
 Possible explanations may involve the sectoral allocation of investment or the high cost of doing
 business. Annex 5 presents preliminary research on the relationship between investment and growth in
 Honduras.

66.      Labor’s contribution to growth has occurred primarily through the expansion of the labor
force rather than improvements in the marginal productivity of labor. Labor accumulation has
accounted for roughly 2.2 percent of economic growth in recent years, as high fertility rates and increased
life expectancy have caused the labor supply to increase consistently for the past four decades.

67.      Honduras’ most recent period of robust pro-poor growth occurred during the global
economic expansion of the mid-2000s. Between 2001 and 2008 strong simultaneous increases in labor,
capital and TFP pushed Honduras’ growth trajectory toward convergence with the developed world.
Accelerating growth in the early 2000s was supported by large-scale investments in reconstruction
following Hurricane Mitch. Meanwhile, the global economy entered a period of remarkable growth, and
Honduras’ high degree of trade openness left it well positioned to take advantage of rising commodity
prices. Robust export revenues and high rates of investment supported an average growth rate of 5 percent
per year for a full 8 years. This was the country’s strongest performance since the early 1960s, and its
growth rate exceeded the LAC average of 3.9 percent. Moreover, the returns to growth were clearly
progressive, and both poverty and inequality indicators fell substantially during the period.

68.     However, Honduras’ robust growth came to an abrupt end in 2009, as the impact of the
global financial crisis was exacerbated by domestic political instability, causing GDP to contract by
2.7 percent in a single year. The post-crisis recovery was slow an uneven, with growth averaging 3.3
percent over 2010-2014. TFP growth again turned negative, and labor and capital accumulation were the
exclusive drivers of an anemic recovery. The contraction affected nearly all sectors of the economy,
though export-oriented industries such as maquilas and tourism were hit the hardest. Turmoil in global
financial markets curtailed investment and disrupted the construction sector, while worsening conditions
in the US labor market caused a dramatic decline in remittances, which adversely affected retail and non-
tradable services. A sharp decline in income at the top end of the distribution briefly reduced inequality,
but the Gini coefficient soon began to rise as wealthier households recovered faster than their poorer

counterparts. Poverty rates increased for three consecutive years, and though progress resumed in 2013,
poverty remains well above its pre-crisis level.

3.2 Recent job growth has been concentrated in low-productivity sectors
69.     During the strong growth period of the mid-2000s, the secondary and tertiary sectors drove
a balanced pattern of job growth, and wages rose modestly as the economy diversified away from
agriculture. From 2003-2008, as an expanding global economy supported robust export-oriented growth,
Honduras’ industrial, commercial and service sectors led job creation. Employment growth in the
agricultural sector was positive, but far below the population growth rate. As the urban economy absorbed
an increasingly large share of the labor force, wages rose among remaining agricultural workers.

70.      Enterprise surveys reveal a steep decline in job creation in manufacturing following the
crisis, and the importance on young and small firms to generate jobs both before and after the
crisis (Figure 3.7). In 2006, young firms (those 5 years old and under) reported employment growth of
13 percent on average, while small firms (those with less than 20 employees) reported 7.3 percent more
jobs. Even in 2010, a year in which the private sector was still feeling the effects of the 2009 crisis, young
firms were able to generate new jobs, though at a lower rate than in 2006. Enterprise surveys reveal that
both exporters and non-exporters, as well as domestic and foreign-owned firms, created jobs at about the
same rate in 2006. Yet, in 2010 domestic firms and those who were exporters reported a larger destruction
of jobs. The crisis also had a large impact on the manufacturing sector, where firms reported a reduction
in employment of almost 5 percent on average. Even though small and young firms have been responsible
for creating a disproportionate share of jobs, they face a number of challenges that impede their further
growth, thereby affecting employment opportunities.

71.      Most jobs created since the 2009 crisis have been in low-productivity sectors. The impact of
the 2009 crisis radically altered the pattern of job creation. Between 2009 and 2012, job growth ceased in
the service sector, and the number of industrial jobs declined. Commerce continued to make a positive
contribution, but it was not enough to accommodate the growth of the labor supply. As a result the
agricultural sector absorbed a large share of excess labor, and the sudden influx of workers caused
agricultural wage rates to plummet, wiping out the gains made during the middle of the decade. Overall,
since 2009, new job opportunities were mostly concentrated in less skill-intensive, less technologically
sophisticated activities such as commerce (a sector with high rates of self-employment), hotels and
restaurants, rather than higher-value-added sectors like manufacturing, telecoms and finance. Agriculture
was the second largest source of employment creation and accounted for roughly 40 percent of new jobs,
particularly in the coffee and palm oil industries. However, this increase was not driven by demand for
more agricultural labor, but rather by an excess supply of workers who turned to agriculture as an
employer of last resort. Manufacturing was a key driver of job creation in the pre-crisis period, but its
recovery has been weak due to challenges in the maquila subsector, as described further in the next
section.

  72.      Poverty rates fell fastest during periods when high-value-added sectors contributed the
  most to job creation. During the mid-2000s the poverty rate declined by 6 percentage points, as labor
  incomes increased. During the 2003-2008 period the main contributors to job creation were
  manufacturing, telecommunications and finance. However, during 2008-2012, as poverty rates rose, job
  creation was driven by the low value-added commerce and agriculture sectors, while manufacturing and
  services largely stagnated. These were also years in which the agricultural sector suffered from an
  outbreak of rust leaf disease in coffee production, hurting output. From 2012 to 2013, when poverty
  reduction resumed, job creation was still driven predominantly by the low value-added commerce sector,
  but it was accompanied by a modest but rising contribution from manufacturing and other services and a
  slight reduction in agricultural employment. These trends suggest that the creation of jobs in higher value-
  added sectors is closely linked to poverty trends.

  73.      The concentration of job growth in low-productivity sectors has caused a range of negative
  labor market outcomes. Honduras has one of the lowest labor force participation rates in the region. The
  labor force participation rate among adults age 25 to 54 is just 72 percent, well below the LAC average of
  81 percent. While Honduras’ overall unemployment rate of 6 percent is not exceptionally high by
  international standards, it is elevated by the standards of regional comparators, particularly El Salvador,
  which recorded an unemployment rate of just 3.8 percent in 2013. Furthermore, the unemployment rate
  has been growing since the 2009 crisis. Salaried employment represents fewer than half of all jobs in
  Honduras, and self-employment accounts for 41 percent of total employment, the highest share in Central
  America (Figure 3.12). Self-employment has been the main driver of recent job growth, accounting for
  212,000 of the 230,000 jobs created between 2011 and 2013.

who are not classified as unpaid workers.

74.     Honduran workers continue to earn less than the LAC average, and the wage gap has
grown over the past decade. In 2003, the average worker in Honduras earned approximately $1.39 per
hour, compared to a regional average of $1.70. By 2013, the average wage in Honduras had grown by just
2 percent, while the regional average had grown by 37 percent. The average hourly wage in the LAC
region reached $2.33 in 2013. Low average wages hide significant wage gaps between different types of
workers.52

75.     Persistently low levels of labor productivity have suppressed wage growth across the
Honduran economy. Agricultural workers, who account for 57 percent of the extremely poor, are the
least productive in the economy, and the agricultural sector has registered only small gains in labor
productivity in recent years (Figure 3.14). However, in even the more productive manufacturing and
service sectors, marginal output remains well below the LAC average. Due to low and stagnant labor
productivity most poor households can only increase their labor income by extending their total working
hours.

Sector productivity is calculated as the ratio of sector’s value
added and the number of employees working in that sector.
The shares of employment are the fraction of the workforce
that works in that sector.

76.     Creating the conditions for robust employment growth in high-productivity sectors is a
pressing challenge, as demographic trends are causing a large number of new workers to enter the
labor force. Roughly 60 percent of the Honduran population is under the age of 26, and a third is under
the age of 14. Honduras’ median age is the second lowest in the region and among the lowest 25 percent
worldwide. Over the medium term the ratio of working age adults to dependent children and retirees is
expected to increase substantially, creating the conditions for a “demographic dividend” in economic
growth.

77.     However, the extent to which Honduras is able to benefit from its changing demographics
will depend on the ability of the private sector to create new jobs in high-productivity sectors. If the
ongoing recovery generates a balanced pattern of employment growth in manufacturing and high-value-
added services similar to that observed in the pre-crisis period, the private sector will be able to leverage
the demographic dividend to accelerate growth and poverty reduction. However, if employment growth
slows or remains confined to agriculture and low-value-added industries, the influx of new workers could
further depress wage rates, exacerbate poverty and contribute to a range of negative social outcomes. At
present, educational indicators and youth employment opportunities in Honduras remain inadequate, as
described in Chapter 4, underscoring the urgency of reforms in social services and the business climate.

78.      While the Honduran labor market suffers from serious weaknesses, employment dynamics
differ by sector. Before addressing the broader economy-wide challenges facing Honduras, including the
constraints imposed by a rigid labor market, it is important to examine growth and job creation in specific
industries. The following section analyzes key industries in the agriculture, manufacturing and service
sectors, each of which is either a major driver of employment and output, or a possible catalyst of income
growth and poverty reduction. The potential impact of the further expansion of these industries is
assessed, along with the constraints to their development.

3.3 Selected industries and their growth challenges
79.      Agriculture, manufacturing and services each play an important role in the Honduran
economy. In the agricultural sector the coffee and sugarcane industries remain a major source of
employment and income for rural households, while palm oil production has recently emerged as a new
force in the sector. The maquila light manufacturing model has led the growth of the industrial sector
since its emergence in the 1990s, yet it has struggled to recover in the wake of the global financial crisis.
Before the crisis, transportation, communications and financial services drove the expansion of services,
but in recent years tourism, including hotels and restaurant services, has become an increasingly
important component of the sector.

Agriculture: coffee, palm oil, and sugarcane

80.      Agriculture has long been the mainstay of the Honduran economy. Historically, agriculture
has accounted for a larger share of output and employment in Honduras than in comparable LAC
countries. The sector directly employs one-third of the Honduran labor force and accounts for about 30
percent of total exports. In 1970, agriculture represented 32.4 percent of GDP, double the LAC average of
16.6 percent for countries with available data. Today, agriculture represents 14 percent of Honduras’
GDP, the second-largest share in LAC. And if agribusiness activities are included, the sector accounts for
over 40 percent of GDP. Most small and medium producers grow low-value crops for consumption in the
household and local markets and cultivated land is often on hilly terrain with poor access to water, roads,
credit, modern production technology, improved seeds, tools, and basic inputs. Over the last two
decades farmers and agricultural firms have gradually transitioned into higher-value products. Sector
legislation promoted foreign and domestic investment in export commodities such as coffee, palm oil and
sugar, which have also benefited from proximity and preferential access to large consumer markets,
persistently low land and labor costs in rural areas, and the adoption of improved production processes.
Agribusiness exports experienced robust growth over the past decade, rising from US$600 million in
2006 to US$3 billion in 2014. Agribusiness currently accounts for 63 percent of total exports. However,
the agricultural sector remains highly vulnerable to both shifts in international prices and exogenous
production shocks such as diseases and natural hazards.

81.     Coffee. Coffee accounts for about a third of total agricultural production, represents about 5
percent of GDP, and directly employs 10 percent of the labor force. Two-thirds of coffee producers live
below the poverty line, and half live in extreme poverty. About 90 percent of Honduran coffee is
exported, and it is the country’s second most valuable export after maquila manufactures. 92 percent of
Honduras’ 110,000 coffee growers are small farmers, who also account for the majority of coffee
production. Output has increased in the last decade driven by productivity gains. Between 2001 and 2012,
coffee production rose from 150 to 354 million kilograms, as farmers adopted new quality-control
practices and introduced disease-resistant seeds, increasing marginal yields. Productivity gains have been
especially strong in specialty coffee. However, access to finance remains an important challenge. While
access to short-term credit for coffee farmers (e.g., pre-export credit) has improved, affordable long-term
financing to support investments in infrastructure, technology, and enhanced inputs remains limited. This
leaves the industry highly exposed to shocks. For example, the 2012-2014 outbreak of rust-leaf disease
(“roya”) affected about 25 percent of Honduras’ coffee crop, causing over US$100 million in losses,
much of which was borne by small farmers.

82.      Palm oil. Honduras is currently the ninth-largest crude palm oil producer in the world and the
largest in Central America. Three-quarters of palm oil production (about 500,000 metric tons in 2015) is
exported, and palm oil accounts for over 5 percent of total exports. Production has grown at an average
rate of 10 percent per year since 2008. There are currently 12 oil-extraction plants operating in the

                                                     46
country, and three more are expected to open in 2015-2016, increasing total extraction capacity by 31
percent. In contrast to other Central American countries, palm oil production in Honduras involves a large
share of independent smallholder producers. About 98 percent of palm oil production comes from
approximately 18,000 small and medium-sized farmers. These farmers are organized into producer
groups, some of which operate their own extraction plants. Land tenure issues and environmental and
social risks constrain the expansion of palm oil production. Uncertain property rights have led to conflicts
over land, including armed confrontations and violence in the Bajo Aguan Valley. Producer organizations
are committed to adopting best practices for environmental and social responsibility, but the capacity of
most local producers remains weak. A public consultative process is currently underway in support of the
prospective adoption of the International Responsible Palm Oil Criteria. Natural hazards are also a source
of concern, as the majority of palm oil plantations are located in areas affected by hurricanes and floods.
Finally, high energy costs are a major constraint on profitability, and producers have been forced to invest
in biomass and biogas plants to generate their own electricity. The sector is also highly vulnerable to
international prices, but Honduran palm oil producers have demonstrated resilience and a capacity to
adapt to market dynamics.

83.      Sugarcane. While its share of GDP has fallen over time, sugarcane remains one of the largest
employers in the agriculture sector, directly generating over 16,000 jobs. About 40 percent of Honduran
sugarcane is exported and the rest is consumed in the domestic market. Productivity gains have driven
growth; between 2008 and 2014 yields improved by a full 39 percent, and production reached 11.3
million pounds of sugar per year. Enhanced refining processes and increased demand spurred by Free
Trade Agreements with the United States, the European Union, and other countries further boosted
output, though exports to the US remain constrained by regional quotas. A revised legal framework was
approved by Congress in 2014 to regulate the production of biofuels derived from sugarcane and palm oil
as additives for imported gasoline. This framework should expand opportunities for the sector over the
long term. However, key challenges include ensuring adherence to environmental and health standards.
Industrial accidents in sugar production remain common, especially among sugarcane cutters. The
burning of fields before the harvest is also a dangerous activity for workers, who often lack appropriate
protective equipment, and causes environmental damage. Child labor is a major challenge. A 2013 human
rights report by the US State Department claims that approximately 170,000 children between five and
fourteen years old work as child laborers in Honduras, and many are engaged in harvesting sugarcane.

Manufacturing

84.     The maquila industry has played a major role in Honduran manufacturing since the late
1990s and represents an important source of poverty reduction. The maquila model, in which
imported components and intermediate inputs are assembled and re-exported, emerged following the
trade liberalization reforms of the late 1990s. Maquilas currently comprise two-thirds of the
manufacturing sector and 6 percent of GDP. Total maquila exports amount to about US$3,900 million, of
which around 80 percent are textiles, and over 70 percent of exports are bound for the US market. Over
the past decade the industry has transitioned from a simple assembly-based production model to an
increasingly sophisticated, vertically integrated industry, driving technological innovation and attracting a
large amount of investment. Maquilas now account for the second-largest share of FDI after
telecommunications. Maquilas employ three percent of the Honduran workforce (over 120,000 workers),
75 percent of whom produce textiles and garments, while another 12 percent produce automotive parts.
Though it employs a relatively small share of the labor force, the emergence of the maquila industry has
reduced poverty by an estimated 1.5 percentage points and expanded employment opportunities for
women.53

                                                     47
85.      The growth of the maquila industry has slowed since the global financial crisis due to
increasing international competition, particularly in textiles, combined with rising costs. Honduran
maquilas benefit from special tax regimes and employment incentives, but these are not sufficient to
offset the erosion of competitiveness caused by high minimum wages and rising electricity costs. The
industry is also constrained by a lack of new opportunities in the global market for manufactures. Since
2009 a number of maquila firms have relocated to other countries, including neighboring Nicaragua,
where labor costs are lower.

Services, commerce and construction

86.     Led by the transportation, communications and financial services, Honduras’ service sector
has been the main contributor to recent economic growth. Yet at 25 percent of GDP the sector
remains far smaller than the regional average (50 percent). Despite the impact of remittances on
consumption, the country’s high poverty rates and small middle class limit the scope of the domestic
market for services. By contrast, investment in the export-oriented maquila industry and agriculture sector
has been relatively robust.

87.     Communications. Growth in the communications industry has been boosted by large investment
inflows, particularly FDI in the telecoms industry, which have financed technological upgrades and
network expansion. Over the last decade, mobile services companies have increased the geographical
coverage of their networks and diversified into cable and satellite television services, as well as data
transmission. The 4G spectrum was allocated in 2013, improving the scale of internet access and data
transmission. However, telecommunication quality indicators have not substantially improved over the
past decade.

88.      Financial services. The financial services subsector has grown at a robust pace of around 5
percent per year over the last decade, and the industry currently generates about 21,000 jobs. Increasing
loans to the commercial, agricultural and manufacturing sectors, combined with rising consumer credit,
have driven the growth of financial services. Honduras’ deposit and loan rates are relatively high by
regional standards. In 2013, the ratio of total deposits to GDP reached 48 percent, well above the average
of 34 percent in Central America (excluding Panama), while the loans-to-GDP ratio reached 69 percent,
compared to an average of 60 percent in Central America (excluding Panama). However, bancarization
rates remain low. 54 Just over 20 percent of Honduran adults have an account at a formal financial
institution, and only 5 percent have credit cards; both rates are far below the Latin American averages of
39 percent and 18 percent, respectively. The bankarization rate for individuals in the bottom 40 percent is
just 13 percent and only 14 percent in rural areas. Despite the importance of remittances in the Honduran
economy, only 4 percent of Hondurans report using formal financial accounts to receive remittances.55
And only 8 percent of Hondurans use bank accounts to receive wages.56

89.     Tourism. Tourism is an emerging industry in Honduras. It is the country’s fourth-largest source
of foreign exchange and employs around 6 percent of the workforce. However, the sector has been
waning in importance since the global financial crisis, and its share in total goods and services exports fell
from 11 percent in 2009 to 7 percent in 2013. Tourism represents a smaller share of exports in Honduras
than in neighboring countries such as Belize (31 percent), Costa Rica (14 percent) and Panama (12
percent). Honduras has the potential to compete with other top destinations in the western Caribbean, as it
boasts impressive beaches and Mayan ruins, and in the last five years the number of international arrivals

has increased rapidly. Improved infrastructure, notably the opening of a new airstrip in Copan and a new
cruise ship port in Colon in 2014, has also helped the sector. There are currently about 2 million tourism
arrivals per year, roughly half of which are cruise ship passengers. However, a number of important
challenges constrain the sector’s growth, including the high cost of both international and domestic
airfares, a growing reputation for crime and violence, and limited infrastructure development. 57 The
government is attempting to overcome these challenges through innovative sector development strategies
such as establishing public-private partnerships to improve tourism infrastructure.58

90.      Construction. The construction industry employs about 6 percent of the Honduran workforce
and accounts for 3 percent of GDP, down by half since 2000. The sector was hit hard during the 2009
crisis. Due to weakening residential and commercial investment, the sector contracted by 8 percent per
year during 2009-10, losing about 500,000 jobs. Construction output and employment both remain well
below their pre-crisis levels. The share of total private investment allocated to residential construction is
high in Honduras, indicating that the country’s housing deficit presents opportunities for domestic
investors. Yet the high cost of construction materials is a major constraint in the sector, as cement prices
are rising faster than inflation. The Honduran cement industry is an imperfectly competitive duopoly, and
the projected growth of demand over the next 3-5 years could create an opening for entry of new firms as
existing producers reach maximum production capacity. Increased competition in the production of
cement and other inputs could lower prices and accelerate construction activity.

91.     While each of these industries faces specific constraints, a number of transversal challenges
affect the competitiveness of the Honduran economy and deter job creation. Some of these issues
have emerged recently, while others have inhibited Honduras’ development for decades. Key cross -
cutting issues include limited infrastructure, including energy and transportation; an underdeveloped
financial sector; land tenure insecurity and limited administrative capacity for adjudicating and enforcing
property rights; a burdensome regulatory environment that contributes to labor market rigidities and
limited competition; and the rise of crime and violence, particularly organized criminal syndicates
associated with the international drug trade. The following section examines the impact of these factors
on the Honduran economy and explores options for alleviating transversal constraints to growth.

3.4 Challenges to competitiveness in Honduras
92.      Over the past 15 years, two major issues have arisen as threats to Honduras’ continued
economic development: high levels of crime and emigration. These two forces have implications for
growth and competitiveness as both imply an increase in business costs. On the one hand, Honduras has
one of the highest rates of crime and violence in the world (see Chapter 5.3). All three countries in the
Northern Triangle—El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras—have suffered from elevated crime and
violence rates, as drug traffickers and gangs have grown more violent. These three countries top world
rankings of homicide rates. On the other hand, the combination of violence and lack of opportunities has
driven a large wave of out-migration from Honduras, largely to the US. These migrants have become a
significant source of income, with remittances accounting for 17 percent of GDP. As in neighboring El
Salvador, this has led to symptoms of Dutch disease in the economy. Combined with the country’s
relatively high minimum wages, this has led to increased labor costs.

Security costs: the economic impact of crime and violence

93.    Crime, violence, and insecurity distort incentives to invest in human capital, impose direct
and indirect costs on firms, lower household welfare directly through lost wages and labor, and

57   Plan de Turismo Sostenible 2011-2014, Instituto Hondureño de Turismo, 2011
58   It is projected that these new investments will generate about 4,600 new jobs by the end of 2015.

                                                                  49
divert government resources from public investment and poverty alleviation to law enforcement
and criminal justice. The economic cost of crime in Honduras is staggering, reaching an estimated 10
percent of GDP (US$ 900 million) in 2011. Insecurity substantially increases the cost of doing business in
virtually all sectors, and private firms spend an average of about 9 percent of their annual profits on
security costs.59 Crime impacts firms in a number of ways, and extortion, kidnapping and other forms of
racketeering are becoming increasingly common.

94.     Crime and violence increase operational costs, erode competitiveness and discourage
private investment. In some cases, such as the maquila sector, international firms may shift investment
to more secure destinations. And while sectors such as extractive industries and fixed-crop agriculture are
more likely to remain in operation despite high crime rates, insecurity costs will inevitably diminish profit
margins. There is mounting evidence that fear of crime, particularly extortion, has prompted some
businesses to exit the marketplace altogether. For instance, the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys identify
crime and violence as one of the most important problems facing Honduras.

95.     Low economic growth and criminal violence have become locked in a vicious cycle (Figure
3.15). Low growth limits income and employment opportunities, creating incentives to profit from crime,
and widespread poverty reduces the ability of the population to resist crime and demand action from
public agencies. These incentives and vulnerabilities become increasingly acute in countries where
criminal enterprises have developed a strong organizational infrastructure and enjoy high rates of
impunity. As crime and violence damage economic competitiveness, discourage investment and drive
firms from the market, they improve the conditions for their own survival and proliferation. The rise of
crime and violence also contributes to increased migration, spurring a second vicious cycle that further
constrains economic growth.

 Knowledge gap: What is the full cost of crime to the Honduran economy?

 Media reports suggest that gang violence and extortion have resulted in the closure of small
 businesses, causing employment losses. While some gangs profit from the international drug trade,
 others generate income primarily through extortion payments from businesses and citizens, commonly
 known as the “impuesto de guerra”, or “war tax”. 60 Extortion demands range from US$20 to
 US$5,000 per month, and failure to pay often results in harassment, death threats, or violence by gang
 members. In 2012, the impuesto de guerra was estimated to have caused the closure of approximately
 1,600 businesses in Tegucigalpa alone. Together these firms employed nearly ten thousand workers
 and consisted primarily of bakeries, beauty salons, food stands, hardware stores and other small and
 medium enterprises.61 Extortion payments have also affected activity in the capital’s central market,
 Mercado Las Américas, where by 2015 an estimated 500 food and clothing vendors had been reduced
 to just 50.62

Migration, remittances and labor costs

96.     Since the late 1990s the emigration of Honduran workers has dramatically increased,
spurred by low growth rates and accelerated by rising levels of crime and violence. Migration and
remittances play a complex role in the Honduran economy, one that generates both positive and negative
outcomes. Migration can offer productive workers a means to escape from limited labor market
opportunities, and remittance inflows have had a demonstrably positive impact on poverty rates.
Honduras receives the largest remittance inflows in Central America as a share of GDP (over 17 percent
in 2014), and remittance levels have increased over the past decade. According to the Central Bank of
Honduras’ biannual remittances survey, the average monthly remittance reported by recipients is US$477,
or almost 2.5 times Honduras’ monthly per capita income. Yet, by drawing off a significant share of the
labor force, migration adversely impacts aggregate productivity. Moreover, the process of migration itself
requires capital to achieve. As a result migrants rarely come from among the poorest households in
Honduras, and remittance income rarely reaches them.

97.      Low growth rates and high migration rates can be mutually reinforcing. Remittances have
been found to contribute to “Dutch disease” effects, as high capital inflows result in real exchange-rate
appreciation. 63 A rise in household income through the inflow of remittances leads to an increase in
consumer demand, which raises prices for domestic nontradables, prompting a reallocation of labor away
from the tradable goods and a real exchange rate appreciation. Among LAC economies, a one percentage
point increase in remittances as a proportion of GDP is estimated to lead to a real-exchange rate
appreciation of 2.5 percent if remittances are taken as exogenous to 18-24 percent if the models correct
for reverse causality in which real exchange rates also affect remittances.64 Rising domestic demand and
the decreased competitiveness of domestic producers of tradable goods also widens the current-account
deficit, weakening the country’s macroeconomic position. Migration also has direct implications for
growth by reducing the size of the labor force as workers self-select out of the country, potentially
generating brain drain and slowing the accumulation of skills in the economy. And, as household income
rises, reservation wages increase and the labor supply falls.

98.      There is evidence of a vicious cycle between migration and low growth in Honduras. Low
growth and a resulting lack of opportunities, further exacerbated by the country’s high violence, drive
migrants to seek work outside of Honduras. These migrants, in turn, send home millions of dollars in
remittances. Evidence of Dutch disease as a result of the country’s high remittances can be seen in the
relationship between real exchange rate and remittances (Figure 3.16). Between 1995 and 2013, there has
been a strong correlation between growth in remittances and in the real exchange rate. At the same time,
there is evidence of lower labor supply among recipients of remittances —both in the literature and from
Chapter 2.65 This implies a higher reservation wage and thus upward pressure on wages. Through a higher
real exchange rate and higher wages Honduras loses competiveness in world markets, limiting, in turn,
opportunities for further economic growth. This loss of competitiveness, and its negative effect on the
business climate, closes the negative cycle of migration on economic growth (Figure 3.17).

3.5 Chronic constraints to economic growth
99.     While high crime and violence combined with high migration pose serious challenges to
growth, the reality is that Honduran growth challenges predate these two cycles. Earlier
comprehensive studies, cross country regressions, and micro economic data reveal that some challenges
have been chronic or persistent in hindering growth since the 1960s (Table 3.1). Well-documented
evidence on competitiveness and growth challenges in Honduras identifies five long-term challenges that
harm firm productivity, and job creation, and make investment in Honduras more expensive:
     First, persistent fiscal instability and macroeconomic imbalances were mentioned as a major
        challenge in the 1987 CEM, were the main focus of the 1994 CEM report, and were highlighted
        as a major issue in cross-country regressions.
     Second, low endowment of human capital and a limited supply of skilled labor were mentioned in
        all the comprehensive reports reviewed and has been identified as an important growth deterrent.
        Low educational attainment is also significant in cross-country regressions and the lack of a


65Acosta et al. (2008) find that in Honduras, labor force participation and the number of hours worked for recipients of
remittances is significantly lower than for those not receiving remittances, and this effect is larger for women.

                                                                                                                                                52
            skilled workforce is among the major constraints reported by firms in the Wor ld Bank’s
            Enterprise Surveys.
           Third, inadequate infrastructure was cited in the 1999 IMF report on Honduras’ growth as an
            issue since the 1970s, also appearing in the 2004 DPR report as one of the four major challenges
            to competitiveness and growth, and also highlighted by the cross-country regressions.
           Fourth, limited access to capital was mentioned as one of the four major constraints to growth in
            the 2004 DPR report, was among the top five concerns for firms in the Enterprise Surveys, and is
            statistically significant in the cross-country regressions.
           Fifth, weak governance, with particular attention to a poor regulatory environment, was
            highlighted in the 1987 CEM report which mentioned the complex legal and institutional
            regulatory framework. The 1999 IMF report also mentions an inadequate institutional
            infrastructure, while the cross-country regressions also highlight this challenge.

Fiscal and macroeconomic instability

100.    High levels of debt have repeatedly destabilized the public finances, undermining investor
confidence and wealth creation, slowing growth, and limiting the authorities’ ability to cope with
both unexpected disasters and cyclical downturns. 66 This vulnerability is illustrated by Honduras’
experience following the global financial crisis, when an unsustainable fiscal stance left the government

                                                                   53
 ill prepared to combat the effects of a deteriorating external environment combined with an internal
 political crisis which led to the temporary suspension of aid from most of the international community.
 While any economy would suffer facing those conditions, the effect in Honduras was particularly
 negative resulting in a multi-year period of losses in social gains - poverty rates and income inequality
 increased between 2010 and 2012, erasing the gains made since 2003. Fiscal consolidation efforts and an
 improvement in external conditions resulted in a partial recovery in economic growth after the crisis, but
 growth slowed again in 2012-2013 in a context of worsening terms of trade (Figure 3.18).

 101.     Despite support by the Multilateral Debt Relief initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor
 Countries (HIPC), which cut the public external debt stock by half in 2005-2007, in 2014 the
 Government was spending a higher share of its revenues to service debt payments than it had in
 2004 before the debt relief (Figure 3.19). The accumulation of debt implies that the government must
 spend a significant amount of its revenues in servicing its debt, leaving little room for countercyclical
 policies. Notably, both domestic and external debt levels increased following the global financial crisis,
 with external debt rising by 26.3 percent in 2013 alone following the government’s issuance of US$
 1 billion in international sovereign bonds. Moreover, financing costs have increased from 0.7 percent of
 GDP in 2009 to close to 3 percent of GDP in 2015, and the stock of public debt has almost reached 50
 percent of GDP.

 102.     Rising fiscal deficits have contributed to the deterioration of Honduras’ external position
 (Figure 3.20). Government expenditures have played a crucial role in the dynamics of the current account
 deficit; every extra US$100 spent by Honduras’ government is associated with an increase in the current
 account deficit of US$14, keeping everything else constant 67 . Honduras has consistently run current
 account deficits for the past 20 years. From 2009-2011, the widening in the current account deficit can
 largely be attributed to a recovery of national investment in the aftermath of the global financial crisis –up
 from around 20 percent of GDP in 2009 to 26 percent in 2011, which was not matched by a
 commensurate rise in domestic savings. However, the continued widening in the current account deficit

since 2011, from 2.8 percent of GDP to 7.6 percent in 2013, has coincided with declines in national
investment and by even greater declines in national savings.

Low endowment of human capital

103.     Honduras’ low endowment of human capital creates a competitiveness gap with peer
countries, making it difficult for Honduras to compete internationally and may partially explain its
labor productivity deficit. While education and access to other basic services are discussed in greater
detail in Chapter 4, it is important to stress that despite relatively high levels of public spending on
education, Honduras faces challenges in coverage, equity and quality. Despite the universalization of
primary education, access at all other levels of education continues to be strikingly low. High dropout
rates in Honduras exist despite high returns to education, reflecting low educational access and quality. 68
The tertiary enrollment rate is just 20 percent, compared to 45 percent in large LAC countries and 25
percent in neighboring Central American countries. Low quality of schooling further compounds this
effect: only one third of the students who finish secondary education are able to achieve satisfactory
scores in tests to enter higher education (Box 3.2).69 Poor schooling outcomes also impacts the crime and
migration cycles detailed above; for example, high dropout rates increase the nini population – youth who
are neither working nor in school, an especially vulnerable group for joining criminal activities. 70 Finally,
lack of proper nutrition and access to basic health and water and sanitation also have negative
implications for learning abilities, labor capacity, and earnings potential.




68 Returns to secondary education in Honduras, for example, are twice as high as in Costa Rica.

104.    Low levels of schooling imply a limited supply of adequately trained labor, which has
resulted in a mismatch between the supply of skills and the demand for workers. The average
Honduran over the age of 15 has only 6.2 years of schooling, lower than the Latin America average of 8.4
years, and this gap has widened since 1990. 71 While other countries in the region have seen larger
increases in educational attainment over the last 20 years, the educational attainment of the labor force in
Honduras has increased by only 1.3 years of schooling. This has resulted in an increasing human capital
gap between Honduras and Latin America, in terms of years of education: in 1990, it was of 1.7 years but
by 2010 it had increased to 2.2 years. A lack of skilled labor is among the top five business environment
constraints identified by business owners and more than one in ten firms (11.4 percent) identified an
inadequately educated workforce as the biggest obstacle for their business.72 Moreover, this could be an
underestimate as many firms in Honduras may not be more skill-intensive as a consequence of the low
levels of human capital in the country. In other words, the scarcity of talented labor prevents highly-
productive industries from emerging.73 To address the scarcity of skills, a third of private companies offer
in-house training for their employees.74 Training for technical careers can help reduce the lack of skills in
the economy and, in fact, in 2011 around 190,000 workers (5.8 percent of the labor force) were certified
by technical institutions. However, it is worth mentioning that of these workers, less than 90,000 were
fully employed,75 though this was during a period in which overall employment creation slowed down.

years) and Nicaragua (6.6 years) (EdStats using Barro and Lee).

Inadequate infrastructure, especially in transport and energy

105.     Weaknesses in core infrastructure, especially transportation and energy, and logistics
compromise the international competitiveness of Honduran firms, reducing gains from trade and
increasing prices for traded goods. On the two most widely used international rankings of transport
service provision—the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index and the Logistics
performance Index—Honduras ranks slightly below the median among the 140-160 countries ranked,
scoring below neighboring Central American countries. Honduras’ poor performance in logistics is across
both infrastructure gaps and service quality (Figure 3.24). Despite efforts to increase infrastructure
coverage, Honduras still lags neighboring countries. Road density in Honduras is only 15 percent of Costa
Rica’s road density, and it lags behind Nicaragua, Panama and El Salvador. Moreover, Honduras has one
of the lowest rural electrification rates in the LAC region, with a quarter of the rural population lacking
access to electricity.

106.    In the case of transport infrastructure, key challenges include low access and deficient
quality. Inefficiencies in the road transportation network affect both international trade and domestic
commerce. A large share of internationally traded goods utilize multiple transport modes, usually road
and sea or road and air. Rail service is limited to a few dedicated short-distance routes used for
transporting lumber or agricultural products to nearby ports, while the overwhelming majority of overland
freight is transported by road. Despite its importance, the road network has been deteriorating as a
consequence of limited public resources and setbacks in the capacity of the agencies responsible for road
pavement. As a result, more than 50 percent of roads in Honduras are in a poor condition.

107.     High rates of crime and violence and logistical weaknesses, including empty backhauls, long
wait times, and corruption issues, all increase road transport costs. Over the past three years average
security costs related to transportation have increased by close to 20 percent, and they now represent
about 5 percent of total trucking costs. Long loading times and delays at weigh stations represent around
20 percent of total shipping time along the country’s main routes. Administrative costs are esp ecially high
for international freight, as wait times at customs and inspection stations can represent as much as 15-20
percent of the total shipping time on international routes. Moreover, a large share of overland shipments
return with empty backhauls, which pushes up prices in order to cover the cost of the empty return trip.
Trucking companies report high informal payments to the police along both national and international
overland routes, as well as border clearance payments to both official and unofficial customs agents.77

108.    Given the importance of agriculture to the Honduran economy, particularly to households
living in poverty, connecting rural areas to urban markets is one of the country’s main transport
and logistics challenges. Good transportation infrastructure is especially important for agricultural trade,
in order to open access to international markets for small farmers. Road infrastructure efforts could
connect the large agricultural population to global markets, contributing to poverty reduction by
increasing the rural poor’s opportunities. Additionally, due to the perishable nature of most agricultural
products, there is a particularly high premium on improved and speedy transportation options.

109.    High energy costs undermine competitiveness and productivity by increasing production
costs. At approximately 25 percent above the LAC average, the industrial price of electricity in Honduras
is one of the highest in the region. High electricity cost and unreliable service erode competitiveness,
especially in those sectors with higher energy intensity, and divert investments to neighboring countries
with lower industrial electricity prices. In 2013, Honduras’ industrial tariffs were the highest in Central
America, surpassing Nicaragua’s rates (Figure 3.25). Moreover, 7.6 percent of the electricity comes from


77   Osborne et al. (2014).

back-up generators, a higher share than in Latin America (4.8 percent).78 To counteract the unreliable and
expensive electricity service in Honduras, the maquila industry in the country produces its own electricity
from biomass. This implies a significant sunk cost, which may discourage new entrants.

110.     The high share of obsolete, inefficient and expensive thermal generation in the energy
matrix and price tensions in an under-supplied market are the main structural reasons for high
electricity prices. First, Honduras’ energy mix relies heavily on thermal generation (55 percent),
surpassed in Central America only by Nicaragua (59 percent). The cost of thermal generation is not only
influenced by oil prices but also by expensive thermal generation power purchase agreements. Second,
power demand exceeds supply by around 100 MW. This gap is driven by limited generating capacity, but
demand is also artificially inflated through distorted price signals produced by electricity subsidies, theft
and fraud. Insufficient supply prompted Honduras to increase its electricity imports, which rose from 3.5
percent of GDP in 2010 to 4.9 percent in 2014. To fill this supply gap, the Government is promoting
different efforts: 1) bolstering supply in the short run through costly agreements with private energy
generating firms, particularly during the summer time when water reservoirs are at low levels, affecting
hydroelectricity production; 2) reducing future production costs through a recently signed agreement with
Guatemala to import gas via the planned Mexico-Guatemala gas pipeline;79 and 3) pushing for further
expansion of renewable energy.

111.    Inefficient transmission and distribution systems exacerbate the impact of expensive and
limited generation capacity on electricity prices (Box 3.3). The state-owned electricity company
(Empresa Nacional de Energía Eléctrica, ENEE) is in charge of electricity transmission and distribution,
while private companies generate two-thirds of the electricity produced. ENEE lacks an adequate cost
recovery scheme: the tariff adjustment mechanism is inefficient, there are substantial non-commercial

79 Similarly, Honduras may be able to tap into developments of liquefied natural gas in El Salvador or Panama, projects currently
in the pipeline, if excesses are sold regionally.

                                                               59
loses, and there are deficiencies in the billing and collecting systems. Together, these contribute to large
company losses - in 2013, for example, ENEE registered a deficit equivalent to 1.8 percent of GDP.
Recent reforms have improved the targeting of subsidies, but until recently, the residential sector was
significantly cross subsidized by the industrial and commercial sectors. After the recent subsidy reform in
2014, estimates show that the cost recovery ratio in the residential sector has increased to 95 percent,
from 65 percent. The tariff adjustment mechanism was also modified in 2014, resulting in a tariff increase
estimated at 15 percent. Even so, total loses amount to about 30 percent. ENEE’s losses are borne by the
government and thus reduce fiscal space for public initiatives and investments in other sectors.

                               Box 3.3: Governance challenges in ENEE

ENEE is one of the few remaining vertically integrated power utilities in Latin America and faces
governance challenges. In Honduras, only the generation business has been opened to private
investors. ENEE is solely responsible for the transmission and distribution businesses, which are
aggregated in regional clusters with a high level of decision autonomy in expenditures. In contrast,
ENEE´s decisions on power purchases to meet the demand are centralized, and billing and collection
are outsourced to the private sector, with suboptimal control from ENEE. As a result of this
decentralized/centralized structure, the regional clusters hold limited accountability for financial results
and hinder corporate control on loses and expenditures, impacting negatively on ENEE´s performance.
At the same time, ten CEOs have led ENEE since 2005; this has resulted in weak governance, lack of a
long-term strategy, limited internal control and has deteriorated the company´s operational and
financial performance.

Obsolete internal control systems lessen the management capability to run the company
efficiently. Information provided by the internal control systems to the decision-makers is usually
inadequate, unreliable and frequently not available in a timely manner. A symptom of this deficiency is
the unsuccessful attempt of ENEE to go through an audit process of its financial statements in the past.
The lack of reliable information and acceptable internal control procedures have been central
arguments raised by the Auditing Companies for not subscribing ENEE´s financial statements. Last
auditing took place in 2010 with negative results. Based on the comments of the auditing company and
supported by multilateral organizations, including the World Bank, ENEE has undertaken the auditing
of its 2014 financial statements. This exercise is expected to be concluded by 2016.

The World Bank Group is collaborating with the Government of Honduras to improve ENEE´s
institutional framework. The Bank has supported the implementation of adequate internal control
systems and the definition of a modern organizational structure, in line with best international
practices. These instruments altogether with ENEE´s further modernization, legislative reforms in the
power sector–General Law of Electric Industry approved in 2013– and strong political willingness and
support, will be key to overcome the current situation and improve the governance of the institution.
The Government of Honduras has given first steps towards a structural change in the sector, by
appointing the three Commissioners of the recently created Regulatory body (Comisión Reguladora de
Energía Eléctrica, CREE) on June 19, 2015 and by approving ENEE’s new organization structure.



112.    In a context of limited fiscal space, the Government has begun promoting private sector
investment in public infrastructure. In 2010, it created COALIANZA, a commission tasked with
promoting public-private partnerships for public works. COALIANZA is still a relatively new institution,
and strengthening its capacity and that of its regulatory body will help to ensure that PPPs are structured
around principles of competitiveness and good governance. The existing legal and operational framework
for PPPs allows for private sector investment in certain large infrastructure projects. PPP contracts have

                                                      60
been tendered, both by COALIAZA and by private banks serving as trust agents, for projects involving
the development of maritime ports, toll roads and urban road infrastructure.

Limited access to capital

113.     While access to finance in Honduras has improved in the last decade, access to credit
remains a challenge, and high interest rates undermine firm-level competitiveness (Figure 3.28).
About 81 percent of Honduran firms have a checking or savings account, more than 10 percentage points
below the LAC average. Moreover, only 31 percent of these firms have a line of credit, well below the
LAC average of 46 percent. About 15 percent of firms identified access to finance as a major constraint to
doing business, the third most-cited constraint after political instability and corruption.80 Small firms were
20 percent more likely than medium-sized firms and 94 percent more likely than large firms to identify
access to finance as a major constraint on their operations.81 While short-term working capital can be
secured with guarantees on future production, long-term financing for investment in infrastructure and
technology is limited. Consequently, only 17 percent of firms in Honduras reported having investments
financed by a bank, compared to an average of 33 percent in LAC. The proportion of loans requiring
collateral (81 percent), and the average value of the collateral required (222.4 percent of the loan), are
both relatively high. In LAC, 72 percent of loans require collateral, and its average value is 204 percent of
the loan.82 High interest rates further hinder opportunities to access financing, and real lending rates in
Honduras are higher than in many LAC countries, as well as other countries with similar income levels.
Interest rate spreads (the lending rate minus the borrowing rate) in Honduras are among the highest in
Central America, behind only Costa Rica, and above the average for Latin America. While investment
rates are relatively high in Honduras, high interest rates and collateral requirements suggest that
investment could be expanded.

114.     Financial inclusion remains low and credit concentrated. Banks are profitable, liquid, well-
capitalized and domestically funded, and their recent performance on key financial-soundness indicators

has been robust.83 Private sector credit to GDP is 54.1 percent and domestic bank deposits represent 47.5
percent, both above the regional averages (41.0 and 41.3, respectively) and above the expected medians
compared to its level of development (32.5 and 44.3, respectively).84 While Honduras’ banking system is
sound, financial inclusion indicators are among the lowest in the region, with the percentage of adults
with access to a bank account reaching only 32 percent, while LAC averages 51 percent. Moreover, credit
is highly concentrated; 90 percent of all outstanding banking loans are concentrated in three provinces:
Francisco Morazán, Atlántida and Cortes. In addition, the recent expansion of credit was concentrated in
consumption and housing, rather than productive activities. Driven by the increased use of credit cards,
consumer credit as a share of total new credit rose from 25 percent in 2007 to 50 percent in 2012.85

115.    Despite the importance of agriculture in the economy, rural sector lending remains limited
and agricultural loans represent only 5 percent of total outstanding loans. The appetite for rural-
based lending has diminished, and private banks view rural borrowers as very risky. This is driven by
high default rates after disasters associated with natural events, compounded by the government’s loan
forgiveness program for the sector.

116.    Issues surrounding property rights are another challenge to access to capital in Honduras.
Approximately 80 percent of privately held land in rural areas and 30 percent in urban areas is
untitled or improperly titled.86 As a consequence of this uncertainty in property rights, informal land
markets are active in urban and rural areas.87 Moreover, mortgages and other forms of credit are difficult
to obtain due to the unclear nature of land tenure. An adequate provision of property rights increases
incentives to invest (particularly long-term investment) and prevents distortions in investment decisions.
Clear property rights provide incentives for owners to investment in improving their property. However,
according to the Doing Business Report (2015), Honduras ranks 81st in the Registering Property
Indicator, while the WEF Global Competitiveness Report ranks Honduras 98th in the Property Rights
Indicator.

Institutional and regulatory challenges

117.     Honduras has made progress in reducing the cost of doing business and expediting
administrative procedures. These advancements have focused on different investment-climate fronts:
the ease of starting a business, simplification of tax payments, the ease of getting credit, property
registration and construction permits. Reforms led, among other things, to an impressive reduction in time
spent on different administrative procedures. According to Doing Business, while in 2006 it took more
than 60 days to open a business, it now takes only 14 days. The number of days to deal with construction
permits was halved from 165 in 2006 to 82 days in 2015. Time spent to register property also decreased
from 35 days to 22. The number of hours per year it takes for an average firm to pay taxes was also
halved from 424 in 2006 to 224 in 2015.

118.     Nevertheless, despite this important progress, a substantial regulatory burden continues to
constrain Honduras’ business environment. Competitiveness in Honduras continues to lag
internationally. According to the 2015 Global Competitiveness Index, which pools 144 countries,
Honduras ranks 101st, the lowest in the Central America region. The Doing Business report ranks
83 As of 2013, CAR was 14.5 percent, NPLs 3.4 percent, provisioning to NPL 123.7 percent. Currency mismatches by borrowers
remain a source of risk within the banking sector. One-third of bank deposits and lending is in foreign currency and mismatches
are significant with about 45 percent of foreign currency credit going to unhedged borrowers.
84 FinStats (March 2015). The bulk of the credit is based on consumption credit growing from 15 percent in 2009 to 22 percent in

2013 and 28 percent of credit growth is based on construction and real estate. There is rapid private credit to deposit at 113.9
percent which is well above the regional average of 85 percent.

Honduras 104th out of 189 countries, and the OECD Product Market Regulation (PMR) indicators rank
Honduras 45th out of 48 countries. Honduras also ranks poorly in firm governance and transparency (174th
out of 189 countries), the ease of enforcing local commercial contracts (166 th), the simplification of the
administrative burden and cost of paying taxes (153rd), the ability to deal with insolvency chapters and
secure recovery (140th), the cost for launching new enterprises (138th) and the time and cost to access
electricity (110th).

119.     Although Honduras was among the first countries in the region to introduce a Competition
Law, evidence suggests that the country’s regulatory environment is more restrictive to competition
than peer economies (Figure 3.30). For example, the OECD’s PMR indicator suggests that product
market regulations in Honduras are less conducive to competition than in most countries in LAC. 88
Regulation restricts competition mainly through barriers to entrepreneurship (complex regulatory
procedures) and state intervention in markets. Levels of public ownership and involvement in Honduras
in business operations are higher than all LAC countries included in the PMR index, except for Argentina
and Jamaica. Moreover, the complexity of regulatory procedures (in particular license and permits
systems), administrative burdens for sole proprietor firms and barriers in network sectors remain high.
The extent of restrictiveness in product market regulations is reflected in the perception that few business
groups dominate in the market. Honduras ranks 83rd out of 144 countries in terms of the “extent of market
dominance” in the 2015 Global Competitiveness Report, and scores low in the effectiveness of anti-
monopoly policy. Honduras has recently adopted a legal provision that allows for a leniency program,
which could increase the effectiveness of its efforts to prevent price-fixing or other forms of cartelization,
as it enables the authorities to shield cooperating firms from prosecution.

120.    By directly participating via its state-owned enterprises and by fixing market variables, the
Honduran government intervenes in markets where competition would otherwise be viable and
efficient (Figure 3.31). Despite extensive direct government participation in markets (including in
markets that are typically served by only private enterprises throughout LAC), there are no adequate rules
in place to ensure that state involvement in the economy is neutral to competition. Furthermore, the
Honduran government enables competitors (producers and industrial processors) to establish
“agreements” (convenios) on prices, domestic and import quantities and market quotas for some
agricultural products. Additionally, a quota is set for new importers of basic grains, deterring market
entry. Honduras controls prices for products that are not usually under government control in LAC
countries such as freight transport.

121.     In the service sector, regulations often protect incumbents, and administrative barriers
inhibit competition (Figure 3.32). For example, transport associations are consulted on the entry of new
market players, constituting an anticompetitive barrier to entry in a key sector, and the accountancy
profession has an exclusive right to provide nine different businesses services for which it sets minimum
prices.89 There is no “silence is consent” rule in place for any sector, increasing the complexity of the
procedures to obtain licenses and permits.

122.    The government also maintains special tax regimes for specific products or industries that
can distort the allocation of investment. Special regimes, including tax incentives, create an uneven
playing field that can distort investment allocation. Benefits include tax incentives for banana production
and the tourism industry, free-zone regimes for exports, agricultural export zones, industrial export
processing zones and even tax holidays for the fast food industry (Box 3.4). Moreover, tax exemptions
and exclusive economic benefits hinder government revenues and the capacity of the state to transfer
resources to achieve shared prosperity. According to the Revenue Agency, a complex list of exemptions
represented over 6 percent of GDP in 2014, with over 68 laws and 11 presidential decrees creating tax
exemptions, each with a specific policy goal aimed at stimulating economic growth through a particular
sector. In some cases, these tax exemptions are concentrated on a somewhat reduced number of
beneficiaries, as is the case with exemptions on the tax to support road infrastructure, with 12 firms
accounting for over 77 percent of the total sum of the exemption. Furthermore, it is worth noting that
despite the presence of high tax expenditures, Honduras ranks 131 out of 144 countries in the “effect of
taxation on incentives to invest” ranking in the 2015 Global Competitiveness Report.

123.    As a consequence of higher formal labor costs, the country has experienced a loss of
competitiveness; this is evidenced in the manufacturing sector, which has been a driver of poverty
changes in the past decade. The textile industry, which represented more than 40 percent of exports in
2013 in Honduras, is struggling with higher labor costs in an international context with more competitive
wages in many other textile-producing countries (Figure 3.31). Among the top apparel exporters to the
U.S., Honduras has the sixth highest wage in the industry, almost doubling the wages of nearby
competitors Guatemala and El Salvador, and significantly higher than China, Cambodia, Vietnam,
Mexico or India. Possibly as a consequence of high wages, employment in the maquila sector has not
returned to pre-crisis (and pre-minimum-wage increase) levels.

       Knowledge gap: What is the effect of labor market regulations on job creation, informal
       employment and unemployment in Honduras?

       Formal employment in Honduras is heavily regulated; these regulations may contribute to the high rate
       of informality by restricting the ability of firms to adjust their workforce. Evidence that these rigidities
       in regulation may hurt job creation is seen in the creation of 177,000 new jobs after the passage of the
       Hourly Employment Law of 2010, which allowed for the temporary hiring of workers for specific tasks
       at an hourly or daily rate.

124.    High minimum wages not only affect the competitiveness of the economy, but also influence
the pattern of job creation in Honduras.90 Since the 1970s minimum salaries have been high relative to
Honduras’ GDP per capita (see Annex 8). At the beginning of the decade, minimum salaries in Honduras
were similar to those of Nicaragua and El Salvador and lower than in Panama and Costa Rica. After the
increases in 2009, these minimum salaries rose to levels closer to those in Panama and higher than
Nicaragua and El Salvador. At the same time, Honduran law offers some of the most generous severance
payment policies in the region, further increasing the cost of formal labor. These result of the minimum
salary wage hikes and generous severance payments may disincentivize the creation of formal

                                                                                                                                                  67
employment. As already noted, only twenty percent of jobs are in the formal sector and self-employment
accounts for more than four out of ten jobs in Honduras, the highest share in Central America, and has
been the main driver of recent job growth, accounting for 212,000 of the 230,000 jobs created between
2011 and 2013. While there are many factors at play, including a large unskilled pool of workers and a
large rural sector, the country’s labor market regulations imply a significant cost differential between
hiring informal and formal workers.

4. Equity, Equality and Social Inclusion in Honduras
Honduras’ potential for inclusive growth is limited by unequal access to basic services, slow job creation
and inefficient public spending. Ineffective targeting mechanisms, weak expenditure controls and
inadequate institutional capacity distort the distribution of basic goods and services in ways that
disadvantage the country’s poor. A lack of access to social and economic infrastructure not only
diminishes the quality of life among households in the bottom quintiles, it also reduces their employment
opportunities and earnings potential, perpetuating entrenched intergenerational poverty. Weak targeting
mechanisms, limited budget flexibility, and a weak public accountability framework reduce the efficiency,
equity and impact of public spending in Honduras. A lack of opportunities to build human capital has left
many Hondurans unable to compete for high-productivity employment, concentrating workers in low-
productivity employment, causing high unemployment among certain groups, and discouraging labor
force participation, particularly among women.

125.     Honduras has long been among the most unequal countries in Latin America, and while
income inequality has fluctuated over the last two decades, little progress has been sustained. In
1990 Honduras’ Gini coefficient (0.57) was the same as Chile’s, and both were close to that of Brazil
(0.60), the most unequal country in LAC at the time (Figure 4.1). Yet, while the region as a whole has
experienced a substantial reduction in inequality, with inequality in Brazil and Chile falling substantially
since the mid-1990s, Honduras’ Gini coefficient has fluctuated dramatically and remained high overall,
reflecting the intense vulnerability of Honduran households at the lower end of the income distribution.
By 2013 the Gini coefficient was only marginally lower at 0.54, the second-highest level of income
inequality in Latin America. Moreover, while the regional middle class has continued to grow, the
distribution of income in Honduras remains highly bimodal. High levels of income inequality have
constrained poverty reduction in Honduras, even during periods of robust growth.

                  Figure 4.1: Income inequality in Honduras is both high and volatile.

126.    Underlying the country’s long-term inequality are institutional weaknesses which have
resulted in unequal access to public goods and services, as well as opportunities to build human
capital. A lack of access to education, health care, utilities, public economic infrastructure and private
markets has increased the vulnerability of millions of Hondurans exposed to shocks. Moreover, low levels
of socioeconomic inclusion leave many poorer households unable to benefit from all but the most robust

                                                           69
periods of growth. Constraints on human capital formation have particularly important implications for
growth and inequality. Children’s access to basic education and health services is largely determined by
the income and location of the household into which they are born, systematically limiting human capital
formation among the less well-off. Low levels of human capital force workers into low-productivity
employment, diminishing their earnings potential and curtailing the opportunities available to subsequent
generations. Structural institutional weaknesses reduce the effectiveness of public spending, constraining
the ability of policymakers to break the cycle of limited opportunities and low productivity.

4.1 Limited and unequal access to basic services
127.    Malnutrition and limited access to basic services are a barrier to strengthening human
capital in Honduras. Approximately one out of five Honduran children suffers from chronic
malnutrition, affecting the country’s human capital. Studies have shown that malnutrition is estimated to
be responsible for approximately 45 percent of under-five mortality,91 stunting, in particular, is estimated
to contribute to GDP losses of up to 11 percent.92 Children who escape undernutrition are more likely to
survive and stay in school; for example, stunted children have at least one year less of schooling than a
healthy child.93 Moreover, healthy and better nourished children are 33 percent more likely to escape
poverty as adults and earn at least 20 percent more than adults who were stunted as children.94 Women
who escape undernutrition are also 10 percent more likely to own their own business.

128.     A lack of improved water and sanitation services is associated with more missed school days
and poor health outcomes in both children and adults. Higher maternal mortality rates, higher levels
of environmental contamination and exposure to a wide range of debilitating and often fatal diseases are
linked to poor water and sanitation systems.95 While the coverage of water supply and sanitation services
is gradually increasing, the distribution of access remains highly unequal, and service quality is generally
low (Figure 4.2). In 2013, 14.4 percent of Hondurans—over a quarter of a million households—lacked
access to a water grid, and 580,000 households lacked improved sanitation services, mostly in rural
areas.96 The urban poor also suffer from lack of access, as investment has been insufficient to keep pace
with the country’s rapid urbanization. As a result, a smaller share of the urban population has access to
water systems now than in 1990.97 Quality varies widely, service interruptions are common and water is
frequently rationed. Poor water and sanitation infrastructure in schools exacerbates inequality in
education access, as 80 percent of urban schools have access to improved sanitation facilities, compared
to just 62 percent in rural areas. This leaves approximately 500,000 children without access to potable
water and 1.1 million children without access to basic sanitation, with deeply negative impacts on health
and education outcomes. Similarly, access to these services appears especially limited among indigenous
groups. The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC/CEPAL) estimates
that 48 percent of indigenous households have limited access to improved water and sanitation services.

129.     Access to health services remains a key challenge, especially for poor and rural
households.98 While immunization rates have improved, rates of prenatal care provided by a doctor and
deliveries assisted by a health professional are uneven. In 2012, 93.5 percent of pregnant women in urban
areas received prenatal care from a doctor, compared to just 62.3 percent in rural areas. This gap reflects
an even larger disparity between the top and bottom income quintiles, at 97 and 53 percent, respectively.
The rate of deliveries assisted by a healthcare professional was similarly unbalanced, at 98 percent for the
highest quintile and 58 percent for the lowest. Access to health insurance is limited for both the urban and
rural populations, covering just 19 percent and 5 percent, respectively. This contributes to Honduras’ high
out-of-pocket health costs, which exceed both the LAC and Central American averages. These costs
further limit healthcare access among poor households, as evidenced by the 2012 National Survey of
Living Conditions (Encuesta Nacional de Condiciones de Vida). Of the 60 percent of respondents in the
poorest quintile who reported being sick during the survey period, 25 percent did not seek medical
attention due to cost and 22 percent due to the distance to the nearest healthcare provider.99 Moreover, the
departments with the largest indigenous populations also have the worst health indicators, reflecting
further disparities in access to health services across the country.

130.     Electrification rates in Honduras lag those of other countries in the region; service quality is
unreliable, and access is especially limited in rural areas.100 Despite high rates of public spending on
the electricity sector, 1.1 million Hondurans lacked access to electricity in 2012, including a quarter of the
rural population.101 Low electrification rates reduce living standards in rural areas, increase health and
safety risks, and diminish employment opportunities by slowing local economic growth and inhibiting
diversification.

131.    In Honduras, rural status, parental education and household income largely determine
children’s access to services. The Human Opportunity Index (HOI) examines the correlation between
access to services and household characteristics. The HOI is an equity-adjusted measure that captures the
degree to which access would need to be reallocated to achieve full equality across a given set of

characteristics. 102 The HOI’s equity-adjusted level of access to water and sanitation reveals that, to
equalize access, approximately 20 percent of water coverage and over 30 percent of sanitation coverage in
Honduras would need to be redistributed across groups (Figure 4.4). The D-Index disaggregated by
household characteristics indicates that rural/urban location, income level and parental education largely
explain inequality in access to most basic services (Figure 4.5). These factors contribute to entrenched
poverty, as inadequate access to opportunities in one generation creates the conditions for similar
deprivation in the next.

 household head, the presence of both parents in the home, and number of siblings. Of these, number of siblings accounts for
 half of the D-Index.

Both access to education and education quality remain low and unequally distributed

132.      Deep and persistent disparities in education access are a structural barrier to long-term
poverty reduction. While Honduras has made progress in expanding access to primary education,
enrollment in other levels (pre-primary, secondary and tertiary) remains low, and the quality of public
education presents a serious challenge in both urban and rural areas. Overall access to secondary
schooling is heavily influenced by area of residence, parental education and household income level, all
of which present barriers to intergenerational mobility. The HOI reveals that the key factors influencing
secondary school enrollment are the education of the head of household, the per capita income of the
household and its rural or urban location. Enrollment in tertiary education remains low at just 20 percent.
In addition, boys are less likely to remain in secondary and tertiary education. In 2013, female enrollment
in tertiary education exceeded male enrollment by 6.5 percentage points.103

133.    Indigenous peoples have less access to education than other groups. Due to data limitations
the HOI cannot be disaggregated by ethnicity in order to estimate the extent of exclusion among minority
groups. However other analyses suggest that indigenous communities in particular have lower access than
other groups. In 2013, approximately 18 percent of Hondurans over the age of 25 were illiterate; however,

102 See World Bank (2014) for further details on the HOI concepts and methodology. Household circumstances included in this
analysis are rural/urban status, gender (both of the child and the head of household), parental education, family per capita income,
number o siblings, and the presence of both parents in the home.

                                                                72
the Maya, Chortí, Tolupán, Tawahka, Nahua and Pech had even higher rates than the average for rural
areas, ranging from 24 to 34 percent. 104 A lack of schools in the areas where they live, difficulties
attending schools in neighboring non-indigenous communities, deficient school infrastructure and low
education quality are the main factors contributing to high illiteracy rates.

134.     A growing gap between rural and urban areas has increased disparities in education access
over the last decade. Among the factors driving unequal education rates between urban and rural areas
are the poor quality of the Honduras’ public school system, low estimates by parents of the returns to
schooling, and financial constraints.105 Differences in rural and urban enrollment rates magnify the impact
of income inequality, and the richest quintiles have nearly twice the school attendance rates as the poorest
quintiles, (Figure 4.6). While rural enrollment rates have increased in recent years, these improvements
have been limited to the lower grades (Figure 4.7). Due to an acute shortage of rural secondary schools
the rural secondary enrollment rate is half the urban rate. Assuming that the 192 rural secondary schools
operating in 2012 were already at full capacity, a staggering 1,079 additional schools would be required to
serve all rural students.

135.     Driven by economic constraints, Honduras has the highest secondary dropout rate in
Central America.106 In 2013, there was a relatively small difference in primary enrollment rates across
Central America, but the trend diverges rapidly at the secondary level, with Costa Rica and Panama
recording the highest enrollment rates at around 75 percent and Honduras the lowest at 46 percent.
Moreover, Honduras is the only country in Central America where the majority of students cite economic
constraints as their main reason for dropping out. In 2013, 53 percent reported economic constraints as the
main factor, while only 29 and 14 percent cited a lack of interest in studying or access to schooling,
respectively.107 While boys and girls drop out at roughly the same rates, their reasons for dropping out
differ: for boys economic reasons are most important, while girls are more likely to cite other reasons,
including responsibility for household tasks. High dropout rates have important consequences for
economic productivity and future inequality. In an effort to address this issue, compulsory education has
recently been extended through lower secondary school (up to 9th grade), and secondary education has
been added as a condition of the Bono Vida Mejor program.

136.     Education quality is low in both urban and rural areas. National and international tests
indicate that the majority of Honduran students do not achieve grade-appropriate literacy and
numeracy.108 Performance in grades 7-9 is particularly poor, with only 37-42 percent of students reaching
a satisfactory level in reading and just 3-8 percent in mathematics (Figure 4.8). National standardized test
scores reveal no significant differences in educational outcomes between students in rural and urban
areas. However, since rural enrollment rates are much lower than urban rates, the rural sample may be
biased towards students that are more committed to remaining in school.




104 World Bank estimates based on preliminary 2013 census tabulations from Honduran authorities.
105 Lopez (2013) shows that the returns to education are higher for tertiary education (118 percent) than for secondary education
(29 percent), which in turn offers a higher return than primary education (17 percent).

137.     The low quality of public education in Honduras leads wealthier families to opt out of the
public school system. While 88 percent of Honduran children attend public schools, the 12 percent that
enroll in private school are disproportionately likely to come from higher income households (Figure 4.9).
This difference is largest at the secondary and tertiary levels. In the urban school system, 30 percent of
secondary students and 38 percent of tertiary students attend a private institution, compared to just 13
percent at the pre-primary level and 9 percent at the primary level.

4.2 Lack of opportunities in the labor market
138.   Limited and inequitably distributed access to education, health and public utilities inhibits
human capital formation, leaving many Hondurans unable to compete for high-productivity jobs.
Honduras suffers from low rates of labor force participation, particularly among women, high
unemployment among certain groups, especially young people, and a large concentration of workers in
low-productivity jobs.

139.     Honduras’ labor force participation rate has increased in the last decade, yet it remains
among the lowest in the region, and fewer than two of every three adults in the bottom 40 percent
of the income distribution are active in the labor force. The labor force participation rate among adults
age 25 to 55 is just 72 percent, well below the LAC average of 81 percent (Figure 4.10). As in most
countries in the region, workers in the bottom 40 percent have lower participation rates than those in the
top 60 percent. However, in Honduras labor force participation among workers in the bottom 40 percent
has been growing at a faster rate than in the top 60 percent. Between 2003 and 2013, labor force
participation among the former increased by over 5 percentage points, compared to 2 percentage points
for the latter.

140.     Honduras’ unemployment rate is higher than many of its Central American neighbors, and
unemployment is most common among women and youth. While the overall unemployment rate of 6
percent is not exceptionally high by international standards, it is elevated by the standards of regional
comparators, particularly El Salvador, which recorded an unemployment rate of just 3.8 percent in 2013.
As is often the case, unemployment in Honduras is largely an urban phenomenon and is particularly acute
among the youngest workers. In 2013, the unemployment rate for workers aged 15-24 was 9.8 percent.
Unemployment is higher among women than men, and this gap has grown since 2007, when the two rates
were practically the same. The female unemployment rate is now 3 percentage points higher than the
male rate, with the highest rates among women between the ages of 15 and 24. The unemployment rate
for young women is estimated to be 13 percent in rural areas and nearly 18 percent in urban centers.

141.    High youth unemployment rates are a particularly serious concern. One fifth of Hondurans
are between the ages of 15 and 24, and this group comprises a third of the working-age population. Yet
young people face high rates of unemployment, low rates of labor force participation and low rates of
school enrollment (Figure 4.11 and Figure 4.12). Among young workers who are employed, low job
quality is a serious issue. In 2013, fully a quarter of all jobs held by workers aged 15-24 were unpaid
family work, with similar rates for men and women. The difficulty of acquiring a quality education and a
general lack of jobs discourages young workers from building the skills required by a competitive labor
market.

Low rates of educational attainment are linked with low-productivity employment

142.     Limited and inequitable access to education translates into disadvantages in the labor
market. Almost half of workers who did not attend secondary school work in agriculture, while 20
percent work in the retail, hotel and restaurants sector and 12 percent in manufacturing (Figure 4.13).
Highly skilled workers are more likely to work in services and less likely to work in agriculture. There are
substantial wage disparities in the labor market, both by economic sector and skill level. Workers with a
tertiary education earn about 300 percent more than the average wage, while those with primary school
education or less earn only 65 percent of the average (Figure 4.14). This disparity perpetuates Honduras’
high rate of economic inequality.

143.     While the labor market should be expected to reward workforce skills, the small size of the
Honduran formal sector and the country’s relatively high minimum wage exacerbate the gap in
earnings between workers with different levels of education. At approximately US$600 per month in
2011 purchasing-power parity (PPP) terms, Honduras has a higher minimum wage than Uruguay, Brazil
and Chile, and at 13.5 percent, it is the highest in the region as a share of per capita GDP (Figure 4.15).109
Before the large increase in minimum wage in 2008, formal sector workers earned nearly 30 percent more
than informal workers, but by 2013 the wage gap had widened to 65 percent. Yet informal employment
dominates the Honduran labor market, and only one fifth of workers are employed in the formal sector.
Formal employment not only offers higher average wages, but also access to employment benefits,
including one of the most generous severance payment policy in the region (equivalent to a month’s
salary per year worked), and stronger worker protections. Nearly 80 percent of informal workers did not
finish secondary school and approximately 40 percent of informal jobs are in agriculture, while only 11
percent are in manufacturing. By contrast, only 3 percent of formal workers are employed in agriculture
while 23 percent are in manufacturing.110

Knowledge gap: What is the impact of the country’s high minimum salaries on job creation,
particularly for unskilled workers?

Economic research has found evidence that high minimum salaries deter the creation of employment, and
jobs requiring low skills are the most likely to be affected. Evidence suggests that the minimum salary
increase has led to a widening earnings gap between formal and informal workers in Honduras. However,
no analysis has yet measured the impact of this policy change in terms of lost employment in the formal
and informal sectors.




                                                        78
                                    Box 4.1: The minimum salary and inequality

The large gap between the minimum salary and the average wage in the labor market limits the
extent to which the minimum wage can influence wages in the informal sector. In 2008 the minimum
wage for most formal sector workers was increased by 60 percent, and it now significantly exceeds the
average wage in the economy as a whole. Though they are not enforceable in the informal sector,
minimum wages often operate as a strong pay signal by indicating what is considered “fair” or “adequate”
compensation.111 This effect can be observed in the wage distribution of workers in countries like Brazil
and Colombia, for example.112 However, evidence suggests that in Honduras, setting the minimum wage
too high has weakened its effect on the informal sector (Figure 4.16). The informal wage distribution
shifted when the minimum wage was raise. In 2013, 62 percent of informal workers earned less than 90
percent of the minimum wage, down from 47 percent in 2008. By contrast, more modest increases in
Brazil’s minimum wage between 2005 and 2006 (15 and 17 percent, respectively) did not affect the share
of informal sector workers earning less than the minimum. This may be due to Brazil’s minimum wage
being closer to the average wage.

 employees (those who worked between 30 and 50 hours) in urban areas who received wages and excludes the self-employed.

 Minimum wages in Honduras are set by sector, and the low minimum wage for agricultural
 workers—who are among the poorest in the country—may be widening the overall wage gap.
 Between 2003 and 2013, the average minimum wage grew by 225 percent in nominal terms, but the
 agricultural sector’s minimum wage increased by just 159 percent. Meanwhile, the gap between the
 wages of agricultural workers and workers in all other sectors widened. In 2003, the maquila, utilities
 and financial sectors all had minimum salaries that were 123 percent higher than the agricultural sector.
 By 2013 all sectors of the Honduran economy had minimum wages that were at least 134 percent
 higher than agriculture. Notably, the minimum wage for maquila workers fell from the highest in 2003
 to the second-lowest in 2013, with only agricultural workers earning less. Even so, the labor costs of
 the country’s maquilas are high by international standards.113


  “[The minimum wage] is binding if it actually affects wage distribution, whether through enforcement or other factors. It is

144.     The wage gap is also influenced by relatively high public sector salaries, and public sector
workers earn more than similarly skilled workers in the formal private sector. In 2013, civil servants
earned about a third more than similarly skilled workers in private firms, but this gap fluctuated across
sectors (Figure 4.17). For example, public transportation workers earned 50 percent more than their
private sector counterparts, while the gap was just 25 percent for public utility workers (Figure 4.18).

Weak labor market outcomes for women

145.     Female labor force participation is especially low in Honduras. At 46 percent Honduras’
female labor force participation rate is lower than both the male rate (85 percent) and the female rate for
LAC as a whole (53 percent). 114 The gender gap affects Hondurans of all ages, but is particularly
significant for the youngest and oldest groups. Lower labor force participation rates reflect the limited
employment opportunities available to women, who face higher unemployment rates and lower average
wages. The leading sectors for female employment are retail (38 percent) and services (32 percent)
including the domestic services subsector, which employs 11 percent of women who did not complete
secondary school. Industry, particularly the maquila subsector, accounts for another 18 percent of female
employment. However, despite the fact that half of the Honduran population lives in rural areas, the
primary sector represents 10 percent of female employment, whereas it accounts for nearly 50 percent of
male employment. A lack of employment opportunities for women in the rural economy may partially
explain Honduras’ relatively low female labor force participation rate. Moreover, due to the enormous

amount of domestic labor required by rural households—particularly given their limited access to running
water, sanitation, electricity and other basic services—rural women in Honduras may have an unusually
high reservation wage.

146.     Traditional gender roles and familial and household obligations reduce female labor force
participation. A married rural woman with no children is 18 percent less likely to be in the labor force
than an unmarried woman with no children, while a married urban woman is 14 percent less likely than
her unmarried counterpart. The reverse is true for men; married men in rural and urban areas are 8 percent
and 12 percent more likely to be in the labor force than unmarried men. Each additional child in the
household is associated with a 1 percent decrease in female labor force participation. Honduras’ high
crime rates may also deter female labor force participation, and women in urban areas with high homicide
rates are less likely to be in the labor force.

Knowledge gap: What are the challenges facing increased female inclusion into the labor force?

Approximately two thirds of agricultural workers’ wives do not report being in the labor force,
even though production activities in small farms are typically undertaken by all family members.
Low labor force participation rates among women in Honduras may be due in part to the underreporting
of women’s involvement in agricultural production, food processing and distribution. 115 However,
traditional gender roles, poverty, lack of access to capital, and violence may be limiting the ability of
Honduran women to gainfully enter the labor force.

147.     Women with less education are less likely to participate in the labor force and face worse
employment outcomes.116 The receipt of remittances is correlated with a lower likelihood of being part of
the labor force across both the rural and urban sectors, and the link is particularly strong among women.
However, education and household characteristics are also closely correlated with labor force
participation, particularly for women. Ceteris paribus, women with more education are more likely to be
in the labor force; urban women who completed primary and secondary school are 6.4 and 19.5 percent
more likely, respectively. 117 This explains certain employment outcomes. For example, informality is
more prevalent among men in the labor force (85 percent) than women (78 percent), in part because
women with the lowest education levels and most limited access to employment are least likely to
participate in the labor force.

148.     Even though Honduran women, on average, earn less than men, the gender pay gap has
decreased over the last decade. Average hourly wages are higher for men than for women in sectors
with higher rates of female participation. As of 2013, men earned nearly a third more than women in retail
and industry and 13 percent more in the service sector (Figure 4.19). However, after adjusting for
socioeconomic and labor characteristics it appears that the gender pay gap has moderately improved in
the last decade.118 In 2003, the average wage for male workers was approximately 20 percent higher than
for comparable female workers; by 2013 this gap had fallen to 12 percent (Figure 4.20).

Extension Education, Little Rock, Arkansas.
116 These results are based on linear probability regressions of labor force participation by gender and urban/rural sector for adults

aged 25-65. See Annex 4 for detailed regression results.
117 Among rural women, the correlations are 9 and 30 percent for those who completed primary school and for those who

completed secondary school. Given the low school access rates in the rural sector, this may reflect professionals moving to the
rural sector for service jobs (schools, health sector), suggesting a highly self-selected group.

149.    Further constraining women’s opportunities to enter the labor force is a lack of access to
finance historically limited by their lack of access to land. Even though the law stipulates that land can
be registered under the names of both spouses, in practice cultural norms generally recognize men as the
heads of families and landowners. This constrains women’s access to financing, as they are less likely to
be able to use land as collateral.119 In Honduras, 35 percent of men have a bank account, compared to less
than a quarter of women. In LAC as a whole, male and female bankarization rates are comparable at 49
percent for women and 53 percent for men. Women also face other challenges, as they tend to have less
access to training, capital, inputs and markets for their goods. Women are also more likely to tend smaller
plots on less fertile soil, and they are less likely to produce export crops than male farmers.

4.3 Challenges to effective public spending
150.     While social spending is relatively high in Honduras, weak institutional capacity hampers
the ability of public agencies to deliver quality services that promote inclusive growth. The low
quality of public service delivery negatively impacts education, health and workforce skills among the
poor, slowing the accumulation of human capital and perpetuating economic inequality. Poor targeting
mechanisms, limited budget flexibility, and a weak accountability framework have been exacerbated by
fiscal instability and a lack of budgetary credibility. Finally, inadequate institutional capacity leaves
public agencies susceptible to corruption, patronage and various forms of elite capture.

151.     Due to inefficient targeting, a large share of the beneficiaries of social spending are in the
top 40 percent of the income distribution. While Honduras’ medium- and long-term development
strategies provide a degree of policy coordination designed to achieve specific development targets,
limited institutional capacity and data limitations diminish the effectiveness of strategic planning. While
the Bono Vida Mejor program is relatively well targeted, other programs are not. In 2013, households in

the top 40 percent of the income distribution received almost 60 percent of spending on scholarships and
22 percent of energy subsidies (Figure 4.21). Before they were reformed electricity subsidies effectively
covered only the top 62 percent of Honduran households in 2011, creating an unsustainable fiscal burden
that prompted the redesign of the targeting mechanism. The social security system accounts for a large
share of public spending, yet it covers only 20 percent of workers, and its distribution is steeply regressive
(Box 4.2).

152.     Weaknesses in policy design and limited institutional capacity further reduce the efficiency
of public spending and limit inclusive growth. Labor market policies suffer from particularly acute
targeting issues. Honduras lacks unemployment insurance or individual savings accounts to protect
workers from unemployment risk. While youth unemployment rates are higher than the national average,
less than 0.1 percent of GDP is allocated to training programs for unemployed youth.120 Instead, most
resources go to training already-employed young adults through the National Training Institute
(INFOP). 121 As employment status is correlated with income level, spending on workforce training
largely benefits wealthier workers. Similarly, the government’s employment service (Empleate) explicitly
excludes informal firms, and as a result most postings are for formal jobs, often requiring secondary or
tertiary education. This is a critical targeting weakness considering that less educated individuals face
serious information constraints when looking for a job, are generally unable to access job search
programs, and comprise both the majority of workers in Honduras and the vast majority of those living in
poverty. Honduras also lacks employment-of-last-resort programs to activate during emergencies.
However, projects executed by the Social Investment Fund (FHIS) are usually small and community-
driven, and they have in some cases offered temporary employment.

                                      Box 4.2: The Social Security System

Though it covers less than 20 percent of workers, the government spends a considerable amount of
resources on the social security system. In 2012 the country’s social security schemes, most of which
operate on a pay-as-you-go contributory mechanism, amounted to 4.6 percent of GDP. The Honduran
Social Security Institution (Instituto Hondureño de Seguridad Social, IHSS) is the country’s largest
scheme. It covers formal workers in the private sector and offers health insurance and workers
compensation in addition to social security benefits. Separate social security institutions cover public
employees (INJUPEMP), teachers (INPREMA), police and military (IPM) and employees of the National
University of Honduras (INPREUNAH). The social security regime at IHSS is a defined-benefits system
funded by a 3 percent contribution rate with a cap that is currently lower than the minimum wage and
therefore insufficient to finance any meaningful social security benefit. The government has made various
efforts to reform the country’s social security institutions, all of which suffer from actuarial deficits and
poor management. The most recent reform was carried out in 2011 at INPREMA and successfully
reduced its actuarial deficit from 29 percent of GDP to between 9 and 13 percent.

The IHSS social security regime suffers from structural weaknesses. The IHSS lacks a digitalized
history of contributions. When applying for a benefit, the member is asked for a list of his or her former
employers, and then IHSS manually reviews the paper records of the employer’s historical declarations to
establish the history of contributions. IHSS only has a database of affiliates in digital form, some of
whom may end up never contributing to the system. Weak information management also limits the
information available to project future liabilities and analyze the impact of reform efforts. As a result of
low contribution rates and an outdated benefit formula, IHSS members receive low benefits.

Due to its focus on formal sector workers the IHSS is deeply regressive, and the system’s
regressivity is exacerbated by its use of housing saving accounts. These are individual saving accounts
financed through an uncapped contribution of at least 3 percent of salaries. Although all workers in the
formal sector contribute to this system, only those who earn more than double the minimum wage
(approximately 20 percent of covered workers) are entitled to request mortgage credits backed by this
account, making it steeply regressive.

153.     High wage bills limit the ability of policymakers to reallocate resources in order to improve
service delivery. 122 Trade unions in the public sector have negotiated beneficial labor conditions,
especially in the health and education sectors as exemplified by the large share of resources devoted to
salaries and favorable tax exemptions.123 Driven by high minimum salaries and a lack of hiring oversight
the public wage bill now represents an estimated 9.1 percent of GDP and accounts for more than half of
current expenditures (Figure 4.22). Capital investment has declined since 2008, dropping from 2.8 percent
of GDP to 1.4 percent in 2012,124 and is expected to fall to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2015. Public sector
gross capital formation reached a decade low of 3.3 and 4 percent of GDP in 2010 and 2011, compared to
5 and 6 percent in 2003 and 2004, respectively. In addition, nearly 6 percent of GDP is spent on
earmarked transfers, and the establishment of taxes with earmarked revenue further restricts budget
flexibility. This has left only a narrow margin for public investment in other areas.

154.    In 2013, nearly 90 percent of education spending was allocated to wages (Figure 4.23). By
contrast, countries with highly effective education systems usually allocate around 50 percent of their
education budget to teacher salaries. Meanwhile, capital investment amounted to just 0.9 percent of total

education spending. 125 Low levels of capital investment intensify expenditure inequalities by, for
example, limiting the ability of education authorities to address the lack of rural secondary schools.

155.    Staffing costs in the state-owned water and sanitation company (SANAA) increased by
nearly 74 percent in real terms over a 10 year period, while almost no increase was registered in the
client base.126 While a large portion of the budget should be dedicated to maintenance, rehabilitation and
replacement costs, there are currently no funding mechanisms designed for this purpose. At the same
time, implicit subsidies reduce rates for households with water access, while the poor are left with little or
no service. Inadequate cost recovery impacts service quality through underspending on maintenance and
investment, further limiting the scope and quality of water coverage in the country.127

156.    While public health spending reached almost 3.4 percent of GDP between 2007 and 2012,
the wage bill accounted for nearly 66 percent of the sector’s expenditure, leaving less than 25
percent for medical supplies and 8 percent for capital investment. The Ministry of Health’s average
from 2007 to 2012 is higher than the average for middle-income countries (52 percent)128 and higher than
in El Salvador (57.4 percent)129 and Guatemala (48 percent). In the education sector, more recent budgets
have decreased the share of the wage bill in total spending. Similarly, the 2014 budget allocated a lower
share of health spending to salaries (45.9 percent) and 12.7 percent to capital expenditures.

157.    A weak accountability framework has given rise to fraud, leakages and inefficient staffing,
which negatively affect service delivery. In education, for example, ghost workers and teacher
absenteeism are recurrent concerns in terms of expenditure control, though recent reforms are beginning
to show results (Box 4.3). In the health sector, there is evidence that the mismanagement of
pharmaceuticals and medical supplies wastes as much as 23 percent of the sector’s budget. Weak
oversight and management at the central level encourage systemic inefficiency, reducing the effectiveness
of public expenditure in a context of fiscal constraints. A public sector personnel registry launched by the
government in 2014 enabled the identification of ghost workers and facilitated a thorough analysis of staff
qualifications and benefits. The registry also identified nearly 19,000 different positions in the civil
service, compared to just 1,200 positions included in the organizational structure of the Civil Service
Directorate.

158.     Inadequate controls at the subnational level further increase the share of current spending.
A 2013 Public Expenditure Review (PER) revealed that most municipalities do not comply with legal
rules for earmarked transfers. Municipalities are required to invest 54 to 69 percent of the transfers they
receive from the central government, and they are allowed to allocate a maximum of 15 to 30 percent to
administrative costs depending on the size of the municipality. Yet the PER found an inverse relationship
between the ratio of recurrent expenditures to total municipal expenditures and the level of transfer
dependence. In addition, the PER also suggests that municipalities use the majority of their own resources
to finance personnel and other forms of recurrent spending, rather than capital investment. The absence of
ex-ante commitment controls and a lack of predictability in transfers has caused municipalities to commit
to future expenditures even when adequate resources are not available.

                                           Box 4.3: The Education System

Poor teacher performance, including high rates of absenteeism, has been a core contributor to the
country’s low educational outcomes. Although Honduras spends heavily on teachers’ wages, both in
terms of GDP and as a share of the education budget, its student-teacher ratio is higher than in
neighboring countries and twice as high as in comparable countries worldwide. Weak institutional
oversight has led to the accumulation of ghost workers, which accounted for 23 percent of the public
payroll in 2010.130 In addition, an estimated 60 percent of teachers are not qualified for their position, and
only 90 of the 200 official school days are spent on academic tasks.131 Honduran teachers tend to score
poorly on university entrance exams, suggesting negative selection into teaching. Over the last decade the
school year has been frequently disrupted by teacher strikes and demonstrations, and between 2002 and
2011 Honduran schools were closed for approximately a third of the total number of class days.132 Even
when school is in session, teachers spend an average of just 64 percent of class time on learning
activities.133

Between 2012 and 2015 the government passed the Fundamental Law of Education, the Higher
Education Law and the Law for Strengthening Public Education and Community Participation.
These reforms extended the school year by about 25 days to compensate for lost days, and Honduran
schools now regularly achieve the 200 school-day mark. In an attempt to increase enrollment in secondary
school the targeting formula for Bono Vida Mejor was expanded to cover students in lower secondary

130 Due to the inaccuracies of the Ministry of Education database, the true number of ghost teachers cannot be determined, in
addition, it is possible that some teachers were actually working in other schools and not included in the sample or were not
recorded at the time.

education as well as primary. The government has also taken steps to ensure the timely payment of
teacher salaries, thereby addressing a core complaint of teachers unions, and enacted new regulations
designed to curb absenteeism and limit strikes.

The government has also established an Integrated Education Management Information System
(EMIS) consolidating student-level, teacher-level and administrative information. The EMIS helped
eliminate almost 3,000 ghost workers from the education payroll, saving an estimated US$20 million
annually. The EMIS also helped prioritize capital investment in education through the creation of a
sectoral master plan.

159.     The government is decentralizing certain functions in an effort to improve efficiency in
public service provision, however this process has been slow and uneven. In the water and sanitation
sector, 40 percent of the Honduran population is now served by 61 decentralized urban providers.
However, these providers have limited access to financing and often suffer from low managerial capacity.
Meanwhile, SANAA still operates 13 major urban systems covering 1.5 million people. In the health
sector, the decentralized model for primary care now reaches 1.2 million people in 69 municipalities. Yet
the questionable financial sustainability of municipal service provision and the weak regulatory capacity
of the central government threaten recent progress. Limited institutional capacity at both the central and
local levels leaves many public institutions unable to effectively service their target populations.

160.      Accountability remains a persistent challenge, though recent reforms have yielded positive
results. Developments in the health sector underscore both the progress that has been made thus far and
the obstacles that must still be overcome. The Ministry of Health is currently allocating its budget based
on an action plan linked to specific targets. It has signed performance-based contracts with decentralized
facilities, and it will be piloting performance-based contracts with select public hospitals in the near term,
with the goal of extending them to all public hospitals by 2018. The active participation of civil society
groups has improved transparency by drawing attention to sector weaknesses and potential reforms.
However, serious challenges persist in human resources management, and especially in the procurement
and management of pharmaceuticals. Despite an increase in public scrutiny in the wake of a major
pharmaceutical procurement scandal, inefficiencies in the health sector continue to negatively impact
service quality.134

161.    Recent reforms and emerging multi-stakeholder initiatives demonstrate the government’s
commitment to improving the quality of public administration. The authorities are mounting an
aggressive campaign against crime and corruption. In 2013, the government undertook a self-assessment
of its compliance with the United Nations Convention on Anti-Corruption (UNCAC), and in 2014,
Honduras became the first national government to sign an agreement with Transparency International on
anticorruption priorities. The authorities have also taken steps to promote constructive multi-stakeholder
engagement through initiatives designed to achieve shared strategic goals. These include the Open
Government Partnership (OGP), the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), and the
Construction Sector Transparency Initiative (CoST). Key challenges remain in addressing strategic and
structural issues, such as ensuring merit-based appointments in audit and oversight institutions,
professionalizing the public sector workforce, and strengthening public procurement (Box 4.4). Action in
each of these areas will be required to sustain recent progress in public administrative reform.

                             Box 4.4: Public procurement in Honduras

Public procurement systems in Honduras suffer from institutional weaknesses, including a lack
of clarity in the roles of leading agencies, inadequate staff and funding, and unreliable
information systems, which negatively impact the efficiency of public spending. The National
Procurement Office (ONCAE) recently launched a new electronic procurement platform
(HonduCompras) linked to the public financial management system. However, ONCAE has
consistently suffered from high staff turnover and is currently understaffed. This jeopardizes the
consolidation of the savings achieved through the implementation of the electronic procurement
system, as well as a first set of pilot framework agreements for interinstitutional coordination. The
agency is attempting to perform a strategic analysis of public procurement trends and their policy
implications, but the success of this work depends on the opening of staff positions in ONCAE by the
Civil Service Directorate. During the development of the HonduCompras platform ONCAE lacked the
institutional capacity to serve as a counterpart to the software development firm that installed the
system. As part of the reorganization of the Executive Branch initiated by the new administration
ONCAE was shifted from the Ministry of Finance to the newly created Presidential Directorate for
Transparency and Modernization of the State (PDTMS), which has a distinctly different vision
regarding the role of ONCAE. The government has also resorted to outsourcing the procurement of
medical supplies to UNOPS in an effort to improve transparency and efficiency.

5. Sustainability
Over the past three decades Honduras has repeatedly experienced the same unfortunate pattern, in which
gains achieved during periods of relatively robust, broad-based growth are wiped out by an abrupt,
devastating shock and then only partially reclaimed during the modest, uneven recovery that follows.
These cycles are evident in the country’s growth, income and poverty statistics, each of which rev eal a
gradually improving long-term trend marred by recurring setbacks. Thus, the crucial challenge facing
Honduran policymakers is not only to promote economic growth or foster progress in poverty reduction
and shared prosperity, but to reinforce the economy’s resilience against shocks and sustain income and
poverty gains in the face of unpredictable circumstances. Structural sensitivity to economic shocks,
chronic fiscal instability, exposure to natural hazards, high levels of crime, violence and corruption, and
limited public administrative capacity represent multiple dimensions of vulnerability that together pose a
persistent risk to the achievement of Honduras’ economic and social development objectives.

5.1 Macroeconomic Sustainability
162.     The economy’s sensitivity to a wide range of shocks—internal and external, endogenous and
exogenous—is largely responsible for its pattern of growth punctuated by repeated crashes.
Honduras’ economy is small, open, largely agricultural and predominantly informal. A lack of physical
and institutional infrastructure, an adverse business climate, burdensome regulations and high security
costs discourage investment, inhibit diversification and slow the reallocation of capital and labor, creating
structural rigidities on the supply side. Agricultural output is especially vulnerable to both market
volatility and exogenous shocks, as the sector focuses on a narrow range of primary commodities
produced with limited technological support. On the demand side, the growing role of remittance inflows
heightens external vulnerability, as remittances are closely tied to the US labor market, especially the
services and construction sectors.

163.     Agricultural output is volatile, and the sector has considerable scope for diversification.
Honduran farmers are highly vulnerable to weather conditions, including erratic rainfall. Although coffee
production has begun to recover following the recent outbreak of rust-leaf disease (roya), coffee
producers are no more resilient to blights and other natural shocks than they were in 2012. Diversifying
the sector by introducing new crops and encouraging investment in agro-processing could boost the
sector’s exports and enhance its employment and income potential. In particular, increasing export-
oriented fruit and vegetable production may provide an opportunity to reduce the overall vulnerability of
the sector and increase wages. A recent analysis by the International Food Policy Research Institute
(IFPRI) estimated that shifting one third of the area dedicated to corn and beans to higher-value crops
such as fruits and vegetables could expand Honduras’ economic output by US$1.1 billion per year,
equivalent to 4.4 percent of GDP. However, many farmers are unwilling or unable to assume the risk of
diversification away from staple crops due to the sector’s vulnerability to environmental shocks, their
own limited access to agricultural credit and insurance mechanisms, and the limited extent of social
protection policies and emergency preparedness infrastructure to counter the threat of food insecurity.

164.    Although the contribution of mining to GDP has decreased over the last few decades,
Honduras is now presented with an important opportunity to explore its untapped mineral
potential. Currently, there are only seven metallic mines and about 300 non-metallic mines in Honduras.
Yet, the country has significant reserves of iron oxide, and there are about 160 pending permit requests
for exploration and feasibility studies. The revised Mining Law passed in April 2013 provides an
improved framework to promote investment in the sector. In addition, offshore oil exploration is
underway, and a commercially viable discovery could improve the trade balance, encourage foreign
investment and bolster government revenues, all of which would help to reinforce macroeconomic

                                                     89
stability. However, for extractive industries to effectively promote long-term growth and sustainable
social development, appropriate transparency and accountability mechanisms must be in place. In light of
Honduras fragile ecology, environmental protection must also be accorded a high priority. Finally, high-
value extractable resources have a history of fomenting instability in developing countries, and steps must
be taken to ensure that any new resource development does not further undermine the rule of law.

165.     Honduras’ macroeconomic profile is expected to improve during 2015-16, as a positive
external environment supports critical efforts to strengthen the country’s fiscal position and boost
economic growth. Table 5.1 presents Honduras’ medium-term macroeconomic outlook. Growth is
expected to recover during 2015-18, with all major sectors contributing. The ongoing recovery in coffee
production combined with rising yields for other export-oriented crops will bolster the agricultural sector,
while continued growth in manufacturing and construction will have an especially positive impact on
employment indicators. Increasing investment will boost the credit supply as the financial sector remains
solvent, while expanding internet and telecommunications infrastructure will spur growth in services.
Finally, lower oil prices are expected to help reduce the current-account deficit. However, this forecast
rests on the assumption that current fiscal consolidation efforts will continue to be implemented as part of
a broader program of governance reforms, and that past progress will be maintained. Consequently, a
sustained political commitment to the reform agenda is critical to the positive outlook presented below.

166.    Strengthening the business climate would facilitate diversification and enhance the
economy’s ability to adapt to changing circumstances. According the Fraser Institute’s 2014 Survey,
Honduras’ Investment Attractiveness Index is the lowest in LAC, and the country remains last globally in
terms of the Policy Perception Index. Improving how Honduras is perceived by the global private sector
would help to attract increased foreign investment and promote the development of new industries.
However, macroeconomic growth and resilience are not determined by economic policies alone, but are
also profoundly influenced by the fiscal, environmental and social dimensions of sustainability.

5.2 Fiscal sustainability
167.    The country’s fiscal situation is one of its biggest challenges to macroeconomic
sustainability, as growing fiscal deficits limit the resources available for public investment, social
service provision and environmental protection, and could ultimately push the public debt to
unsustainable levels. Achieving fiscal sustainability will be critical to support strong, consistent growth
and enduring poverty reduction.


                                                            91
Fiscal consolidation

168.     Substantial imbalances in the public accounts and an unsustainable debt trajectory have at
times destabilized the Honduran economy, undermining wealth creation, perpetuating poverty and
exacerbating the country’s already high degree of inequality. Fiscal instability intensifies poverty in
two ways: by causing economic disruptions, with which the poor are least able to cope, and by limiting
the fiscal space available for public spending, on which the poor are most likely to depend. Historically,
the performance of public finances in Honduras has followed the electoral cycle, with higher fiscal
deficits coinciding with presidential and parliamentary elections, making the realigning of the country’s
fiscal stance more difficult.135 Even though incoming administrations often announce policies to reduce
fiscal deficits, positive results have rarely been sustained.

169.     Honduras continues to run sizeable fiscal deficits despite relatively high revenue inflows,
and major expenditure rigidities constrain the available fiscal space for public investment and
social spending. Recent fiscal reforms pushed the central government’s current revenue intake to 18.0
percent of GDP in 2014, 91 percent of which came from tax collection. Yet, current revenues only
slightly exceeded current expenditures, which reached 17.9 percent of GDP and accounted for around 78
percent of total public spending. This reflected a modest decline in current expenditures from 20 percent
of GDP in 2013 due to a decrease in transfers and purchases of goods and services. However, the
expansion of the public debt stock has caused interest payments and interest rates to rapidly increase.
Interest payments on public debt reached 2 percent of GDP in 2013 and rose to 2.3 percent just a year
later. Similarly, the total public debt stock increased from US$8.3 billion in 2013 to US$9.3 billion in
2014. The rise in debt service is limiting the resources available for social spending and investment.
Social spending has declined as a share of GDP from 18.8 percent in 2008 to 15.3 percent in 2012, with
the largest reductions concentrated in education (which fell from 6.9 percent of GDP to 4.6 percent) and
social security (7.3 percent to 5.9 percent).

170.      The state-owned electricity company (ENEE) has played a major role in the persistence of
the public sector deficit. In 2014, ENEE recorded losses over US$1 million per day, equivalent to 1.3
percent of GDP. This was a decrease from the 1.8 percent of GDP observed in 2013, but still above the
government’s target. Though energy sector reforms were implemented in 2014, the reduction in ENEE’s
deficit was mainly a consequence of falling international oil prices. ENEE’s weak financial position is
caused by its below-cost tariff structure combined with subsidies and high technical losses (i.e. poor
utility infrastructure) and non-technical losses (i.e. weak commercial management, theft and fraud). Even
though public spending on electricity is relatively high, access to electricity remains limited. Moreover,
the transfers necessary to cover ENEE´s deficit come at the expense of public investment in productive
sectors and core infrastructure, with a clear impact on economic growth.

171.    The public sector wage bill and the pension system have been critical contributors to fiscal
instability over the past decade. Honduras’ public sector wage bill is among the highest in LAC and has
increased substantially since 2001, reaching 12.7 percent of GDP in 2013 before moderating slightly in
2014. The health and education sectors account for almost 70 percent of the total wage bill and have been
the main drivers behind its recent expansion. Education alone accounts for more than 50 percent, and the
teachers’ union is one of the most politically active groups in the country. 136 At 5.1 percent of GDP
Honduras’ relative pension spending is the highest in Central America and one of the highest in Latin
America at well above the regional average of 3.3 percent. Yet all social security institutions combined
cover less than 20 percent of the employed population. Efforts have been made to reform these

135Honduras Economic DNA (2015)
136More than 90 percent of the budget for education is used to pay salaries, while investment in the sector has never surpassed
1.5 percent of GDP.

                                                             92
institutions, but these efforts are hindered by a lack of fiscal space and institutional weakness in the
management of the pension system. These challenges are exacerbated by a poor information-management
system, a lack of reliable beneficiary data, low average benefit levels and a highly regressive distribution
of benefits.

172.     Since December 2013 the authorities have launched a set of reforms designed to open new
fiscal space in an effort to overcome Honduras’ legacy of chronic fiscal instability. The fiscal
consolidation agenda addresses both revenues and expenditures (Box 5.1). The authorities have taken
steps to boost tax revenues, tighten controls over current expenditures by strengthening payroll and
procurement oversight, and reduce loses in the electricity sector. Meanwhile, additional measures are
being implemented to improve the targeting, monitoring and evaluation of social protection programs in
order to enhance the cost-effectiveness of social spending.

                     Box 5.1: Recent measures aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit.

Tax policy and tax administration. Key tax policy measures include: (i) an increase in the VAT rate
from 12 to 15 percent, bringing it slightly above the LAC average of 14 percent; (ii) the elimination of
selected VAT import and income tax exemptions; (iii) the reduction of the minimum tax-exemption
threshold for the income tax; and (iv) an increase in the average fuel tax by about US$0.25 per gallon
(excluding fuel used for electricity generation). The authorities are restructuring the Revenue Authority
by: (i) strengthening the Large Taxpayers Unit (LTU); and (ii) modernizing the DEI’s IT system.

Public debt management: A medium-term debt management framework has been adopted, and the
authorities have exchanged short-maturity bonds (due in 2016-18) for new bonds with longer maturities.

Power sector: To reduce ENEE’s structural deficit, electricity tariffs were increased by 12 percent in
October 2014 and by a further 9 percent in December 2014. Electricity subsidies were eliminated for
those consuming more than 75 kWh per month. A new Electricity Law was adopted in 2014 which (i)
defines sector responsibilities under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; (ii) creates a new Electricity
Regulatory Commission responsible for defining methodologies for establishing tariffs and technical
standards as well as overseeing transparency in bidding processes; (iii) allows private sector participation
in transmission and distribution; (iv) establishes an Independent Market Operator to develop generation
contracts and guarantee supply adequacy; and (v) restructures ENEE into a holding company with
subsidiaries for generation, transmission, and distribution in order to improve accountability and cost
efficiency, and reduce cross subsidies. In 2015 ENEE’s wage bill was reduced by 40 percent, reducing its
deficit by 0.25 percent of GDP.




                                                    93
                                          Box 5.1 (Continued)

 Public financial management: Supported by a Fiscal Emergency Law the government has begun
 streamlining the public sector through: (i) nominal wage freezes in 2014 and 2015, and (ii) the
 elimination of 60 percent of positions that were unfilled at end-2013. As a result, the non-financial
 public sector wage bill declined by 1.4 percent of GDP in 2014, though the full impact of the reform
 will only materialize over the medium-term due to the cost of severance payments. A public
 employment census was completed in 2014, and public sector employees are now recorded in a central
 database integrated with the automated payroll system. To enhance the scope of public-private
 partnerships (PPPs) the authorities have: (i) introduced a PPP framework law creating a fiscal risk unit
 within the Ministry of Finance; and (ii) repealed the law allowing government guarantees for debt
 contracted by companies involved in PPP projects. The government has also implemented measures to
 enhance procurement mechanisms, including the adoption of an e-procurement law and the signing of
 shared services agreements to eliminate duplicate procurement functions.

 State-owned enterprises: The government adopted a plan to restore the medium-term financial
 sustainability of the state telephone company (HONDUTEL) by (i) appointing a new administration in
 2014 with a plan to reduce the number of business units by half; (ii) reducing non-essential spending,
 including a 35 percent reduction in the workforce, limiting overtime hours, curbing outsourcing and
 decreasing energy consumption; (iii) improving network efficiency and enhancing maintenance and
 monitoring mechanisms; and (iv) building a strategic partnership with a private company to provide
 bundled services.

 Monetary, exchange rate, and financial sector policies: The authorities adopted a multiyear plan to
 recapitalize the Central Bank through non-negotiable bonds bearing a positive real interest rate, and the
 central bank has implemented short-term liquidity-management policy. The Central Bank is also taking
 advantage of the flexible exchange-rate regime, allowing the Honduran lempira to depreciate by 5
 percent during 2015. Financial sector reforms include: (i) stricter regulations aimed at reducing
 exposure to currency mismatches by unhedged borrowers, (ii) stronger pension fund investment
 policies designed to protect resources and maintain adequate returns, (iii) the passage of Anti-Money
 Laundering and Combatting the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) legislation.

173.     The fiscal reform program is designed not only to rectify imbalances in the public accounts,
but to bolster confidence in the economy as a whole. Efforts to improve the government’s revenue
position, limit the growth of current expenditures and mitigate the fiscal risks posed by state-owned
enterprises would establish the foundation for more robust long-term growth, though the consolidation
might have a temporarily negative effect on growth in the short term. The overall public sector deficit is
expected to decline from 7.6 percent of GDP in 2013 to 2.2 percent by end-2016, supported by a
combination of revenue and expenditure measures. On the revenue side, tax reforms are expected to
increase the tax-to-GDP ratio from 15.6 percent in 2013 to an average of 17.2 percent during 2014-16.
Ongoing reforms in the energy sector are expected to improve the financial position of ENEE. Enhanced
public financial management, particularly in the areas of procurement and payroll, is expected to yield
fiscal savings. Furthermore, ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of social protection systems are
expected to help cushion the impact of fiscal consolidation on the most vulnerable.

174.    The magnitude of the consolidation has been significant, with the total fiscal adjustment
reaching 3.3 percent of GDP between 2013 and 2014, before rising to a projected 5 percent by 2016.
The reforms implemented thus far represent important steps in the right direction, but they will require
substantial political will to sustain over the medium term. However, the consolidation effort has already
enabled the government to cut its fiscal deficit, and the positive response of international lenders is

                                                    94
evident in the improvement in yields and maturities for new domestic bonds, as well as the yields for
international bond issues in 2013.

175.    External imbalances are highly correlated with the fiscal deficit, and fiscal consolidation
could alleviate the pressure on the external accounts. Expansionary fiscal policies have exacerbated
the impact of exogenous shocks on the current account. Each additional US$100 in public spending is
associated with an increase in the current-account deficit of US$14, ceteris paribus. Moreover, fiscal
consolidation could help Honduras restore its credit rating, which was downgraded in 2013, and thereby
reduce the cost of foreign financing.

176.     The fiscal consolidation program is intended to stabilize the debt trajectory. Honduras’ risk
of public external debt distress is currently considered moderate. The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to
increase from 45.1 percent in 2013 to a peak of 50.8 percent in 2017 and then decrease gradually to 36.1
percent by 2034.137 External public debt is expected to increase from 28.1 percent of GDP in 2013 to 32.9
percent in 2016, while domestic debt is projected to remain at 17.7 percent of GDP through 2016. Interest
payments are projected to increase from 2 percent of GDP in 2013 to 3 percent in 2016, in line with the
rise in the public debt stock. Under a number of alternative scenarios public debt dynamics in Honduras
will remain somewhat vulnerable to both policy-related and exogenous shocks, especially those involving
lower economic growth and a worsening fiscal balance. The ratios of the present value of public debt and
public debt service to GDP are expected to remain well below their indicative thresholds under the
baseline scenario, and no alternative scenarios cause the debt-to-GDP ratio to breach its threshold.

Structural risks

177.    Serious structural challenges inhibit the government’s efforts at fiscal consolidation,
particularly the lack of an effective expenditure-control system. Weak budgetary controls have caused
spending to repeatedly exceed projections, weakening the credibility of the budget. During budget
preparation the line ministries set unrealistic targets, and the Ministry of Finance does not have a system
in place to amend them. In addition, after the budget has been approved new expenditures are introduced
on an ad hoc basis, and these supersede the ceilings set by the Ministry of Finance. Line ministries often
demand that new projects be added to the budget at different points throughout the fiscal year, and these
expenditure lines are introduced without a formal budget review or project evaluation process. Moreover,
line ministries sign contracts for new projects before securing adequate financing, and these contracts
often breach their respective budget ceilings. Recent legislation limits the ability of Congress to increase
the budget without confirming the availability of funding.

178.     Over the last five years falling domestic demand for new government bonds and limited
access to official external financing have led to the accumulation of domestic arrears, the so-called
“floating debt”. As of December 2014, the stock of floating debt was estimated at 3 percent of GDP. The
growth of the floating debt is mainly due to weak budgetary controls and the poor financial performance
of state-owned enterprises, particularly ENEE. The accumulation of arrears to government contractors
appears to have exacerbated the recent economic slowdown.

179.     The low institutional capacity of the national revenue authority is a major obstacle to public
financial management. Political interference in the hiring process is a major liability, and the Ministry of
Finance estimates that 70 percent of revenue authority staff do not possess the appropriate academic
qualifications. Organizational deficiencies also affect revenue performance, including inadequate
information systems that do not ensure transparent and effective tax collection. Moreover, income and
sales tax collection remains low due to a regulatory gap that prevents the correct application of the tax

137   IMF 2014 Stand-by Arrangement.

                                                    95
code, as well as the presence of about 200 legal exceptions to the tax code. The prevalence of the informal
sector also hinders tax collection.

180.    While previous reform efforts have proved short-lived, and this record should temper
expectations, the authorities have thus far demonstrated a credible commitment to fiscal
consolidation and macroeconomic stability. The full impact of the government’s current efforts will not
become apparent immediately, and cuts to current spending may even slow growth in the short term.
However, over the longer term the successful consolidation of the public finances will be essential to
reinforcing resilience and accelerating economic growth.
5.3 Social sustainability
181.     Addressing challenges in crime, lack of youth inclusion and weaknesses in land rights would
help build the country’s social sustainability by fostering social cohesion and empowerme nt. Rising
levels of crime and violence represent both a threat to macroeconomic growth and a major source of
household-level vulnerability. Honduras’ crime and violence rates are among the world’s highest, and due
to its location the country has become a transit route for drug trafficking. Inadequate mechanisms for
assigning and enforcing land tenure are a further source of social instability, and insecure property rights
have exacerbated violence and economic exclusion. Indeed, most privately held land in rural Honduras is
untitled or improperly titled, and the level of land inequality is high. The government has pursued legal
and institutional reforms designed to strengthen land tenure but still lacks both a comprehensive policy
and effective mechanisms for inter-institutional coordination.

Crime and violence

182.    Crime and violence are among the main challenges to social sustainability in Honduras
today, as the entire country suffers from elevated rates of violence (Figure 5.2). Hondurans
increasingly identify crime as one of the country’s biggest problems (Figure 5.3). Even though the data
suggest a modest decline in 2013 and 2014, Honduras’ homicide rates remain far above those of any other
country in the world (Figure 5.1). Gangs and drug trafficking drive high crime rates, and young men are
the most likely to be both perpetrators and victims of violence. The cost of crime is estimated to represent
10 percent of GDP (US$900 million) per year, with crime-related health costs alone amounting to an
estimated 1.3 percent of GDP. A 10 percent reduction in crime would increase GDP by an estimated 0.7
percent.138 Crime is a major obstacle to doing business, and its effects are believed to fall most heavily on
the poor.

183.    The majority of homicides in Honduras go unsolved, which has eroded citizens’ confidence
in the police and the rule of law. Few homicides are investigated and fewer still are prosecuted. It is
estimated that 97 percent of murders in San Pedro Sula go unsolved. Trust in public institutions is low
and has deteriorated over the past eight years (Figure 5.4). In 2012, Honduran respondents registered the
lowest level of police confidence in the region.139 In addition to demanding bribes, passing information to
criminal groups and allowing drug shipments to pass unchecked, some elements of the Honduran police
have reportedly participated in, and even directed, violent criminal operations. In recent years some
reforms have been made to the country’s law enforcement, including allowing the military to carry out
police functions.

184.     Due in part to its geographic location, Honduras has become a transit country for drug
trafficking. In the 2000s Colombian drug cartels cemented Honduras’ status as the principal trafficking
corridor for cocaine bound for Mexico, further undermining the country’s security.140 San Pedro Sula, the
country’s manufacturing capital, has become a hub for cocaine trafficking, and its homicide rates have
been the highest in the world for four consecutive years.141 Moreover, arms trafficking has taken a heavy
toll, and 83 percent of homicides in San Pedro Sula are committed with firearms. Most of the 18,000
Honduran children who have fled to the U.S. in recent years were originally from San Pedro Sula.142

 Knowledge gap: How does crime affect the welfare of the bottom 40 percent in Honduras?

 There is limited information on how crime affects the welfare of lower-income households in
 Honduras. Data collection in this area is challenging not only because of the high levels of violence in
 poorer neighborhoods, but also because of the reluctance of respondents to speak openly about crime.
 Efforts to improve data collection and analysis will be necessary to develop evidence-based policies in
 this areas

185.     Youth violence and gangs (or maras) are a critical concern in Honduras. Estimates of the
overall number of gang members in the country vary widely. In 2007, the U.N. Office on Drugs and
Crime (UNODC) estimated 36,000 gang members in Honduras whereas a 2012 report claimed there were
only 12,000. 143 Nonetheless, gangs have become a pressing issue in the country. They control entire
neighborhoods and generate income primarily through extortion, drug trafficking and kidnapping.
Although the major gangs are most active in the capital, Tegucigalpa, they are present throughout the
country. Policies aimed at reasserting public security through anti-gang crackdowns and large-scale
incarceration largely failed because they did not address the root causes of gang membership or provide
rehabilitation for gang members. Macro-social factors, such as a lack of education and job opportunities
for at-risk youth and rising levels of poverty and unemployment, have perpetuated the gang problem.144

186.     The country’s high crime and violence rates expose young people to risks and present
serious obstacles to education and employment. Men between the ages of 20 and 34 face a staggering
homicide rate of 240 per 100,000 (Table 5.2). Adolescents between the ages of 15 and 19 also face
elevated homicide rates, particularly boys. While the majority of homicide victims are men, between 2005
and 2013 violent deaths among women increased by 263 percent.145 Differences in the age distribution of
men and women suggest some differences in causes of homicide as women between the ages of 20 and 50
had approximately the same homicide rate even as rates peaked for younger men, possibly due to the
latter group’s higher involvement in drug trafficking and gangs.

187.     Domestic violence and violence targeted at the LGBT population is also a serious concern.
More than a quarter of Honduran women over age 15 (27 percent) report being victims of physical
violence.146 Spouses and partners were the main perpetrators of violence (35 percent), followed by ex-
spouses or ex-partners (24 percent). Urban women and those with less schooling were more likely to
report being victims of domestic violence. 26 murders of LGBT people were reported in 2013, including
11 transgender women, 11 gay men, and 4 lesbians.147 Violence against transgender victims was more
likely to take place in public places and involve excessive force. Gender identities and norms shape both
male and female attitudes towards gender-based violence; as a result, 16 percent of Honduran women
believe that wife-beating is justified under certain circumstances.148

Excluded youth

188.     Honduras has the largest share of young people who neither attend school nor are employed
in the region, and members of this group are particularly vulnerable to crime, both as perpetrators
and victims. Approximately one in four Hondurans between ages of 15 and 24 are neither employed nor
enrolled in school. These young people are described as “ni estudian ni trabajan” (neither studying nor
working), and are sometimes referred to as “ninis.” Nearly 40 percent of girls aged 15-24 and 11 percent
of boys in the same age group are part of this group. High rates of male youth who are neither employed
nor in school in a context of violence and organized crime is associated with an increase in the homicide
rate.149 Moreover, there is a larger share of unattached youth in rural areas and across the poorest income
quintiles. Roughly a quarter of urban youth are neither in school nor employed, whereas this share rises to
nearly a third in rural areas. In addition, more than a third of youth in the poorest income quintile are not
employed and out of school, compared to just 14 percent in the highest quintile (Figure 5.5). Low rates of
youth employment and lower educational attainment reduce the long-term productivity of the labor force.

189.     Marriage and pregnancy are the most important factors that cause young women to drop
out of school and exit the labor force. In 2013, 44 percent of young women between the ages of 15 and
24 years old who were not working, including nearly a quarter of those under 18, were already married.
Teenage pregnancy remains a critical concern, as nearly a third of all births in Honduras are to mothers
under 19 years old. While the pregnancy rate in Honduras fell from 104.9 births per 1,000 teenage women
in 2001 to 84 in 2012, it remains well above the LAC average of 68.6. Honduras’ teenage pregnancy rate
is the second highest in the LAC region.150 Access to contraception has increased over the past decade,
but teenagers have the lowest rate of contraceptive use at 56 percent and 71 percent for married and
unmarried women, respectively.

190.    In Latin America, the incidence of young people who are neither in school nor employed is
typically higher among poorer households. Even though this pattern is evident among young women in
Honduras, there is no clear correlation among young men (Figure 5.5). The highest rate among young
men in Honduras is found in the fourth quintile (13.9 percent), followed by the second (12.7 percent) and
third quintile (11.4 percent). This suggests that the prevalence of young men in Honduras who are neither
employed nor in school may be more closely linked to a lack of educational opportunities or an absence
of applicable labor skills.

192.    Developing a strategy to reduce school dropout rates, provide workforce training
opportunities and rehabilitate young people who have been involved with gangs should be regarded
as a key priority. Nearly half of Honduran youth drop out of the education system by age 15 (Figure
5.7). This suggests that interventions to promote continued enrollment should focus on basic secondary
education. Providing training, job opportunities and outreach efforts to youth, including those who have
been involved in gangs and drug-trafficking, would help to break the cycle of poverty and violence in
Honduras.

Land tenure

193.     Issues related to land tenure pose a challenge to social sustainability, as violence has erupted
over contested property rights, and they have important negative implications for economic and
environmental sustainability. As noted in Chapter 3, approximately 80 percent of privately held land in
rural areas and 30 percent of urban land is not properly titled. During the last decade the government has
pursued numerous legal and institutional reforms aimed at strengthening rights to real property, including
the Territorial Ordering Law of 2003, the Property Law of 2004 and the Forestry Law of 2007. Yet
despite an improving legal and institutional framework land tenure remains a major issue in Honduras.
Land disputes represent between 10 and 30 percent of all cases in the judicial system. It is estimated that
70 to 90 percent of these cases are resolved in the first instance,151 and delays are due to case backlogs, a
lack of documentary evidence and witnesses, and the absence of a specialized tribunal for land cases. A
socially inclusive and environmentally sound agenda for strengthening property rights among the rural
and urban poor should include supporting women’s access to land, formalizing the recognition of
communal lands held by indigenous communities, and promoting the sustainable use of water and forest
resources.

194.     Honduras has high levels of land inequality in rural areas. Only 9.5 percent of the country’s
total land area is arable, of which approximately 28 percent is dedicated to seasonal agriculture and 3
percent to permanent crops, 39 percent is forest, and 20 percent is dedicated to national parks and
protected areas. Large and small farmers compete over the country’s limited arable land. The poorest 70
percent of farmers own 10 percent of the land as smallholdings, while the richest 1 percent of farmers
own 25 percent of the land as large plantations.152 The growth of industry and tourism is intensifying
competition for farmland, at times leading to social conflict (Box 5.2).

195.    Land reform programs have been unable to solve the problem of land inequality. Between
1973 and 1977 the government legitimized informal land holdings and transferred land ownership to
peasant farm cooperatives and associations. These reforms distributed 120,000 hectares of land to 35,000
poor families, representing 9 percent of rural households.153 However, the Agricultural Modernization
Law in 1992 permitted members of cooperatives to individualize and sell their holdings. Some
smallholders sold their land to large-scale agricultural producers, which resulted in the re-concentration of
previously distributed land.

196.     Indigenous and Afro-Honduran peoples are particularly vulnerable to land tenure
insecurity. In 1995 the government signed Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization,
asserting its commitment to recognize the land rights of indigenous peoples. Formalizing collective tenure
of traditional lands is more complex and costly than single-owner parcel registration. The process requires
that the group have a legally recognized leadership capable of holding land title. It is estimated that only
10 percent of the land belonging to indigenous and ethnic groups is formally demarcated and titled, which
encourages encroachment and expropriation attempts by non-indigenous farmers, powerful business
interests and government elites. One of the most significant achievements in this areas is the demarcation
and titling of nine territorial councils representing the Miskito people in the department of Gracias a Dios.
Honduran law allows for the individualization of communal property, but this procedure has not yet been
implemented and remains controversial among some indigenous organizations and NGOs.

197.   The government has implemented a number of legal and institutional reforms designed to
strengthen land tenure. The approval of the Property Law in 2004 allowed for the establishment of a

new parcel-based registration system known as folio real to replace the existing owner-based system.
Parcel-based registration improved the management of land records and facilitated the automation of land
transactions. The law also created the Property Institute and established the National Property System,
which includes a unified registry of cadastral information, regulations, and geo-spatial data. Since 2004
the World Bank-financed Land Administration Program (PATH) has assisted in the implementation of
these reforms. The program is currently in its second phase and has invested in legal and institutional
strengthening, cadastral surveying and titling. The automation of registration procedures has reduced the
transaction cost from 8.7 percent to 5.7 percent of a property’s value and cut the average number of days
required to register a property from 35 to 22. 154 The land registries modernized by the Land
Administration Program register transactions in fewer than 15 days.

        Box 5.2: Improving Environmental and Social Safeguard: Corporación Dinant Case

In 2009, IFC provided a loan to Corporacion Dinant a large vertically-integrated Crude Palm
Oil, snacks and food producer based in Honduras. IFC’s investment in Dinant was subsequently
audited by the CAO in 2013 following complaints from Human Rights NGOs referring to Dinant’s
security forces involved in confrontation with armed farmer groups. Both campesinos and Dinant
security guards died in the course of campesino land incursions on Dinant palm plantations. The CAO
identified shortcomings in the environmental and social due diligence carried out by IFC at the time of
its investment and during supervision.

Improvements and Remedial Actions: At the institutional level IFC has taken a number of steps to
strengthen its Performance Standards (particularly with respect to agricultural supply chains) in
response to lessons learned from cases such as Dinant. At the micro level, and prepared in consultation
with stakeholders, an Enhanced Action Plan (EAP) articulates IFC’s response to the CAO audit and is
currently under implementation. The EAP seeks to address both Dinant-specific environmental and
social improvements as well as some of the critical and more systemic social, security and
environmental issues that are manifested in the agrarian conflicts around land in the Aguán Valley. In
parallel, IFC with the support of consultants experienced in conflict resolution and the Voluntary
Principles on Human Rights (Consensus Building Institute and Foley Hoag), are carrying out a
stakeholder Engagement and Dispute Resolution process and monitoring Dinant’s security plan to
ensure consistency with the Voluntary Principles for Security and Human Rights (VPSHR) and also
advising on investigative protocols for past allegations regarding Dinant’s security personnel.

To date, there has been significant progress in implementing the EAP. At the company level and as
per IFC requirements, Dinant has undertaken a social baseline study for all project sites to better inform
engagement with communities, is implementing a grievance management mechanism, and has hired
new community liaison officers. The company has updated its security procedures following the
VPSHR (reviewed by security consultant and Foley Hoag); hired a new Security Manager and
currently in process of hiring a new private security contractor and now vets all new security personnel
against defined protocols as per VPSHR. The company has carried out a security forum with
communities in order to produce Community Risk Assessment for some locations and is the first
company in Honduras to disarm its security guards to reduce the likelihood of armed conflict.

Under the stakeholder dialogue process led by Consensus Building Institute, campesino
organizations, local communities, Dinant and the GoH are deeply engaged in a process which
seeks to address systemic issues relating to impunity, land and the future economic development
of the Aguán. The Government of Honduras has expressed support for this initiative and has indicated
at the highest levels that it is committed to find sustainable solutions to address the structural issues
related to the Bajo Aguán conflict by: i) promoting dialogue with key stakeholders; ii) strengthening
capacity and capacity of the investigative bodies looking into human rights crimes; iii) clarifying and
reviewing historical patterns of land titling in the Bajo Aguán; and iv) designing socio-economic
development programs for the Bajo Aguán region. The Government is interested in using the synergies
in the World Bank’s portfolio (land, safer municipalities and agricultural projects) to provide support in
the Bajo Aguán region.


198.     However, the government still lacks both a comprehensive land policy and an effective
mechanisms for inter-institutional coordination. The national development strategy includes indicators
on territorial planning and formal land tenure but does not establish an overarching land policy. Instead,
each agency and jurisdiction has its own set of policies. Some municipalities are reported to have up to
200 territorial plans, and government agencies and donors develop plans independently of one another.

                                                    103
Land administration functions are determined according to type of land tenure, which results in a complex
legal framework overseen by multiple agencies. This creates overlapping competencies and inhibits
effective enforcement. In addition, some sections of older sectoral policies remain applicable, further
complicating land administration. For example, the titling of public land for coffee growing is still
allowed despite prohibitions on issuing private titles in protected areas. There are a few examples of
satisfactory inter-institutional coordination when the instrument requires co-management, yet it is still
unclear what impact these plans have had on improving land tenure in Honduras.

5.4 Environmental sustainability
199.    Honduras is among the countries most affected by extreme weather events in the world.
Honduras is susceptible to periodic disasters such as hurricanes and tropical storms, as well as cyclical
droughts that may be exacerbated by human activity. Moreover, rapid urbanization, extensive land
degradation and deforestation, air pollution, and inadequate water and sanitation represent major
challenges to Honduras’ development. Investment in physical and institutional infrastructure and
continued efforts to strengthen disaster-risk management are critical for enhancing resilience to climate
change and natural hazards. In order to mitigate its inherent vulnerability, Honduras must improve the
management of meteorological and geological knowledge, further developing risk-assessment
mechanisms at the sector level and strengthen local and sectoral planning processes.

Vulnerability to natural hazards

200.    Honduras’ vulnerability to extreme weather events has been a major challenge to its
development.155 Honduras consists of three main geographic regions with distinct weather patterns: the
extensive interior highlands, the Caribbean lowlands on the north coast, and the Pacific lowlands in the
south. Droughts and irregular rainfall are common in the western, central, southern and southeast regions
(the Corredor Seco). Tropical storms and cyclones can cause floods and landslides throughout the
country, but are primarily concentrated in the northeast and along the Caribbean coast. Between 1994 and
2013 Honduras suffered the highest average annual economic losses due to weather-related disasters in
Central America, driven mostly by Hurricane Mitch.156 Although it has not suffered frequent earthquakes,
Honduras is not exempt to seismic hazards.157 Adverse natural shocks combined with high vulnerability
can cause serious long-term damage to human, social and physical capital, especially for the poor.

201.     Cyclical droughts also have an impact on the country’s development prospects. Dry periods
associated with the El Niño southern oscillation phenomenon affect the western and southern areas of the
country, which includes the Corredor Seco and is home to a large share of Honduras' extreme poor.
Considerable crop losses following periods of drought increase the prices of stapled foods and lead to
acute food insecurity. In 2014, the government declared a state of emergency following a severe drought
that affected one million people in 165 municipalities throughout the country. It was considered the worst
drought to affect Honduras in 10 years.158

202.   The Corredor Seco makes up more than half of Honduras’ territory and includes many of
the poorest municipalities in the country, with nearly 91.7 percent of the population (650,000


155 Global Climate Risk Index 2015. Germanwatch: November 2014.
156 Global Climate Risk Index 2015. Germanwatch: November 2014.
157 Honduras has been mostly unaffected by the frequent earthquakes. However, the country suffered a magnitude 7.1 earthquake

on May 28, 2009, killing 7 people and causing estimated losses of US$100 million (EM-DAT 2013). Probabilistic risk models
estimate losses associated with an event of a 500 year return period at approximately US$2.2 billion, representing 6.3 percent of
GDP and an average annual loss equivalent to US$35.5 million (0.103 percent of GDP of 2013) (CCRIF SPC, 2014).

inhabitants) living below the extreme poverty line. 159 The Corredor Seco experiences irregular
precipitation levels and a longer dry season, which is intensified during El Niño periods when rainfall is
reduced by between 30 and 40 percent.160 Small-scale subsistence farmers and small rural communities
are the most vulnerable to droughts, which reduce access to fresh water sources and negatively affect the
livelihoods of the rural population. Soil degradation is a major cause of agricultural vulnerability due to
its negative effects on water infiltration and retention capacity, fertility, crop yields, and general resilience
to droughts. Diversification, innovation, and the widespread adoption of climate-smart agriculture in
efforts to secure the triple win of higher agricultural productivity, increased resilience to climate change,
and lower greenhouse gas emissions are essential steps for building resilience of small agricultural
producers.

Urbanization

203.    Rapid urbanization, high rates of overall population growth and the growing concentration
of settlements and assets in hazard-prone areas—compounded by considerable environmental
degradation—have intensified Honduras’ vulnerability to natural hazards. The country’s urban
population growth rate is higher than the national population growth rate at 3.16 and 2.01 percent,
respectively. UN-Habitat projects that by 2025 more than 60 percent of the Honduran population will live
in urban areas. The rapid growth of urban areas has resulted in a sprawling and unorganized pattern of
residential development. Over a third of urban dwellers live in slums and are not connected to regular
services such as waste collection and drainage. The limited provision of public services such as electricity
and water and the lack of appropriate drainage systems heighten the risk of floods in urban areas. In
addition, deforestation and poor construction practices have led to the proliferation of settlements on
increasingly steep slopes or along riverbanks, increasing the risk posed by landslides.161

Logging and land degradation

204.     Extensive land degradation and deforestation from logging and the clearing of land for
agriculture and cattle ranching represent major environmental challenges. The decline of forest
cover affects the Corredor Seco and small agricultural producers, and 2 percent of the country’s land was
deforested between 2005 and 2010 alone.162The deforestation rate of over 2 percent per year in Honduras
exceeds the global average. It is nearly twice the average for Central America and one of the highest in
Latin America. It is estimated that by 1987 about 750,000 hectares of Honduran land was already
seriously eroded as a result of cattle ranching on unsuitable areas and slash-and-burn agriculture.163 From
2000 to 2013, the country’s total forest area decreased by 4.4 percent, or approximately 486,000
hectares. 164 Deforestation negatively affects poor rural households given their dependence on forest
resources, including food, fodder and fuels, as one of their main sources of income. Moreover it damages
critical ecosystem services such as soil fertility and watershed protection, with negative implications for
poor households.165

205.   Exacerbated by poverty, households rely heavily on firewood, threatening forests and
imposing health risks due to indoor air pollution. As of 2013, four out of five households in the bottom
40 use firewood as their primary cooking fuel. Burning solid fuels produces high levels of indoor air

pollution, and indoor firewood smoke can have negative health consequences, particularly for children
and women. Women exposed to indoor smoke are three times more likely than women who cook with
electricity, gas or other cleaner fuels to suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such as
chronic bronchitis or emphysema. 166 In 2010, damage associated with air pollution represented 5.6
percent of GDP. Driven by indoor air pollution, this represents a 50 percent increase in cost from 2005.

206.     A substantial portion of Honduras’ forests are protected areas, but limited state
management capacity and high levels of corruption facilitate illegal logging. 167 Extensive cattle
ranching and slash-and-burn agriculture, closely associated with logging for timber, is a driving cause of
deforestation and the resulting vulnerability to natural hazards. A deeper understanding of the factors
underlying the rapid change in land use is needed, including the role of local institutions and forest tenure
rights in providing the incentives for sustainable land use and conservation of natural resources.

Water security and sanitation

207.    A number of major river basins and lakes throughout the country are strained by rising
population levels and agricultural, industrial and mining run-off. Pollution from untreated waste
degrades the quality of water resources. In Honduras approximately 99 million cubic meters of
wastewater are discharged per year into water bodies without any type of treatment.168 Moreover, 2.2
million people do not have access to improved sanitation services, half a million of which still practice
open defecation. This, coupled with unregulated fecal sludge management,169 further degrades aquifers
and surface water quality, with adverse impacts on health and economic growth. In Tegucigalpa alone
deficient water infrastructure and poor sanitation services cost over US$135 million per year.170

208.    Climate variability accentuates drought cycles and impacts the water supply, particularly in
rural areas. Honduras has over 7,000 registered rural water systems administered by local inhabitants,
the majority of which face challenges in post-construction support. As a result of annual droughts about
28 percent of rural water systems run dry at least once during the dry season, and over half of existing
rural water systems lack functioning water treatment systems. Storage facilities could mitigate the effects
of seasonality, but few have been built. Although an effective rural water and sanitation information
system is in place, there is inadequate capacity at the central and local levels to provide up-to-date and
consistent information to guide the planning process and facilitate interventions.

209.    Investments in water and sanitation have failed to keep pace with urban population growth.
Current annual investments represent just 0.13 percent of GDP, with an estimated shortfall of US$350
million between current spending levels and the amounts needed to meet national targets. 171 With
approximately 93 billion cubic meters per year of fresh surface water and an annual water-availability
average of nearly 11,381 cubic meters per capita the country is well above water stress levels. However,
Honduras uses less than 9.1 percent of its available water resources. In Tegucigalpa just 83 percent of the
population has access to water, 70 percent has access to sanitation, 80 percent has access to solid waste
management, and only 17 percent has access to wastewater management. While the share of the
population with access to water services is higher than in the rest of the country, water resources in the

capital do not meet demand, and the deficit is estimated at 60 million cubic meters per year. Shortages are
most common in the dry season, which accounts for 50 percent of total demand. As a result, water
restrictions are imposed during most summers, which disrupts the water supply and increases the
likelihood of waterborne disease outbreaks. The economic cost associated with a lack of reliable water
service and waste management in Tegucigalpa is estimated at US$160 million per year, or 2.5 percent of
Honduras’ GDP.172

210.    The process of decentralizing water and sanitation services is still underway, and limited
progress in this area undermines water security and service quality in major cities. Under the
current laws municipalities are responsible for providing water services; however, only 60 percent of the
population is currently supplied by a decentralized service provider. The National Service of Aqueducts
and Sewage Systems still operates in 13 urban centers and provides limited services to over 1.5 million
people, including 71,000 poor families in the capital’s peri-urban areas. Many water systems are located
in areas highly vulnerable to climate change. The local government in Tegucigalpa is in discussions with
the central government to take over the capital’s water and sanitation system.

Knowledge gap: What is the relationship between vulnerability, extreme weather events and
poverty?

Heightened vulnerability to extreme weather events coupled with the challenges of a growing urban
population compound the structural inequalities that create and sustain poverty and constrain access to
resources. Nevertheless, this relationship needs to be better understood in order to develop a
comprehensive vulnerability assessment for Honduras that takes into account the linkages between
natural hazards and poverty, as well as measures to improve the coping and adaptive capacities of the
poor. Improving the availability, coverage and quality of data is crucial to develop qualitative and
quantitative approaches to assess the determinants of poverty, measure the effects of disasters, and
identify vulnerabilities at the household, sector and national levels. Time-series data on risk conditions,
disaster impact assessments, household income and expenditure evaluation, a poverty index and an
analysis of the geographic distribution and socioeconomic characteristics of the poor are just some of
the potential areas for further research.


Priority policy areas for enhancing environmental sustainability

211.     In recent years the government has made key political, legislative and institutional advances
toward developing an integrated and proactive approach to disaster-risk management. This
includes adopting guiding policies to reduce the country's vulnerability to the impacts of climate
variability and climate change, as well as a gradual shift toward a culture of disaster-risk prevention. Key
achievements include (i) the incorporation of risk-reduction and mitigation considerations in the 2010-
2038 Vision for the Country (Visión de País) and the corresponding 2010-2022 National Development
Plan (Plan de Nación); (ii) the formulation of a 2010-2038 National Climate Change Strategy to prioritize
programs and activities; (iii) efforts to formalize and coordinate inter-institutional disaster response and
risk-management capacity at the national level, as reflected in the consolidated legal framework
established through the National System for Risk Management in 2009; (iv) the strengthening of technical
and institutional capacities for disaster-risk management and adaptation to climate change in key
agencies; and (v) efforts to promote the active participation of municipalities in conducting risk analyses
and preparing planning instruments.

212.    Despite recent progress in improving the framework for disaster risk management and
climate adaptation, Honduras should invest more heavily in efforts to enhance resilience to climate
change and natural hazards. Honduras ranks 128 out of 178 countries in terms of climate change
vulnerability and its readiness to improve resilience.173 Among the most vulnerable countries, Honduras
ranks as the 30th least prepared to improve resilience. Furthering efforts to move from a reactive to
preventive response will be key to lower the social and economic costs associated with natural hazards
and improve the environment for growth, inclusion and sustainability. Box 5.3 identifies specific steps
that Honduras should take to improve its resilience to disasters and climate change.

                  Box 5.3: Measures to Improve Resilience and Disaster Risk Management

        Develop an effective budget management strategy that allows for the rapid mobilization
of resources in the event of a natural disaster while still protecting fiscal accounts . When a disaster
strikes, Honduras will have to mobilize resources quickly without jeopardizing its fiscal stability. A
financial protection strategy that combines a number of instruments in a risk-layering approach could
help the country meet its financial needs and manage fiscal volatility. The strategy should incorporate:
(i) budget allocations and reserves, (ii) contingent credit, and (iii) risk-transfer instruments.

       Improve the management of meteorological and geological knowledge, early warning
systems and climate data to support informed decision making. Effective risk reduction and climate
change adaptation policies should be based on reliable data. Improving monitoring, forecasting and
early warning systems, and generating the required evidence base for climate variability and climate
change would be important steps in this regard. The monitoring and modeling capacity of geological
hazards should also be strengthened. This will require bolstering existing observation networks, as well
as reinforcing the financial sustainability of the recently established National Center for Atmospheric,
Oceanographic and Seismic Studies and improving other coordination mechanisms focusing on climate
and geological information.

       Assess and reduce the structural vulnerability of public assets. Focusing on the structural
dimensions of resilience by conducting risk assessments of public infrastructure, including schools and
other public buildings, would identify vulnerabilities and improve risk mitigation. At the same time,
the capacity to understand infrastructure vulnerability and effectively incorporate this information into
decision making at the local level must also be enhanced.

        Strengthen territorial and sectoral planning processes to better integrate risk-reduction
criteria and land-use planning. Effectively managing disaster risk and reducing vulnerability will
require substantial efforts to build strategic planning capacity at the local and sectoral levels. The
integration of risk-management strategies into planning tools would help reduce vulnerabilities
associated with inefficient land use, poor water management and inappropriate building practices. This
should be complemented by efforts to better incorporate disaster-risk management and climate change
adaptation criteria into the public investment process.

6. Taking Stock and Priorities Ahead
213.     Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere. Honduras’ poverty rate
stood at almost 65 percent in 2013, and the extreme poverty rate was close to 43 percent. With almost one
in five people living on less than US$1.90 per day, Honduras is the second-poorest country in Latin
America. Nearly 80 percent of Honduras’ youth (population under 15 years old) live in poverty, and
approximately one in four children in Honduras is undernourished, with negative implications for their
future learning abilities and earnings capacity.

214.    Honduras’ high poverty rates result from both low per capita growth and high inequality,
which are perpetuated by macroeconomic volatility and high exposure to natural hazards. These
negative dynamics will continue to deepen and perpetuate intergenerational poverty, unless ambitious,
well-designed policies, and targeted interventions can break the mutually-reinforcing cycles that have
kept Honduras locked in a low-growth equilibrium for decades. Understanding key characteristics of
Honduras and its social and economic dynamics helps to inform the discussion about such policies.

       First, poverty in Honduras is not only high but also persistent. Despite data limitations both
        quantitative and qualitative indicators reveal the modest progress in poverty reduction achieved
        over the past several decades. In 1960 Honduras’ per capita income (in current US$ terms) was
        5.6 percent of the US per capita income and 13.5 percent of the average per capita income for the
        World Bank’s High-Income Countries group. In 2014 these same indicators were 6.2 percent and
        4.3 percent, respectively. In other words, in 1960 Honduras was already well behind standard
        comparators, and its per capita income has diverged from that of wealthy countries over the last
        55 years.

       Second, two challenges have emerged over the past 15 years: crime and emigration. These
        challenges have created self-reinforcing cycles that contribute to an equilibrium of low growth,
        high crime rates and large emigration flows. High crime rates—Honduras generally leads the
        world in homicides per capita, with 67 homicides per 100,000 people in 2014 —negatively affect
        the investment climate and hinder growth. In turn, low growth limits the ability of the economy to
        generate economic opportunities for the population, encouraging criminality. Low growth also
        incentivizes emigration and remittances. While remittances have had a positive impact on poverty,
        the analysis also suggests that they affect the labor supply (i.e., through higher reservation wages)
        and drive real exchange rate appreciation, reducing competitiveness and slowing growth. Both
        high crime rates and large emigration flows are relatively recent challenges. According to data
        collected for the 2011 World Development Report Honduras’ homicide rate in the early 1990s
        was below 20 per 100,000 people, similar to the level in other Central American countries.
        However, the late-1990s and early-2000s witnessed a dramatic increase in crime. Similarly,
        remittances flows in 1997, just before Hurricane Mitch, represented about 4 percent of GDP, but
        have since risen to 17 percent. Neglecting the long-term structural forces that have slowed growth
        in Honduras since the mid-20th century would result in a partial and incomplete picture of the
        country’s development challenges.

       Third, because high poverty has persisted for many decades, it is necessary to look beyond the
        challenges of crime and emigration, and understand the long-stranding drivers of low growth and
        high income inequality. Unlike in some countries where poverty is the result of either low growth
        or high inequality, in Honduras both elements are present. Over the 1960-2014 period, Honduras’
        per capita GDP growth rate was just 1.2 percent, about half the rate of the High-Income Countries
        group (2.3 percent) and well below the average rate for the Low- and Middle-Income Countries


                                                    109
        group (3.1 percent). Similarly, with a Gini coefficient of 0.54 in 2013, Honduras has the second
        highest rate of inequality of Latin America, which is itself one of the most unequal regions in the
        world, and while the regional middle class expanded over the past decade, Honduras’ middle
        class remains small. Honduras’ Gini coefficient in the early 1990s (0.56) was already among the
        highest in the Latin America after Brazil (0.59) and similar to that of Colombia (0.56).
        Comparisons for earlier periods are complicated by data limitations, but estimates suggest that
        inequality in Honduras has deep roots. In 1925, Honduras’ literacy rate was 29 percent, compared
        to 36 percent in Mexico, 40 percent in Colombia and 64 percent in Costa Rica. Only Guatemala
        had a lower literacy rate at 15 percent.

       Fourth, tackling Honduras’ high poverty is further complicated in a context of macroeconomic
        volatility. During 1960-2014 the standard deviation of growth in Honduras from the Low- and
        Middle-Income Countries group, the US, and the High-Income Country’s group was 44, 52, and
        83 percent, respectively. Macroeconomic volatility has a profound impact on poverty because the
        poor tend to have limited means to absorb negative shocks, and because such shocks often have
        lasting effects on both growth and equality. Indeed, there is a wealth of empirical evidence that
        income volatility both contributes to lower economy-wide growth and encourages coping
        behaviors among poor households that may reduce their chances of escaping poverty.

Low Growth
215.    Breaking Honduras’ complex low growth/high poverty equilibrium will require addressing
structural challenges. The analysis of the barriers to growth in Honduras has noted several long standing
chronic constraints that have undermined the development of a dynamic formal sector in the economy,
and by extension, the creation of high-quality jobs:

     Lack of fiscal discipline in the past has led to accumulation of debt that has undermined public
      social spending and investment, and reduced the effectiveness of private investments.
     A shortage of skills and limited access to school for much of the population—despite the fact that
      Honduras has one of the highest education budgets in LAC as a share of GDP—hinders
      productivity, growth and innovation, and contributes to a growing productivity gap between
      Honduras and its peers.
     Inadequate infrastructure lead to high costs of transportation, electricity, and telecommunications,
      reducing the country’s international competitiveness.
     Relatively low access to capital (finance and land), particularly for SMEs and rural activities,
      undermine the potential for profitable business opportunities and job creation.
     A regulatory framework affecting both the labor market (e.g., high minimum wages) and in
      certain product markets (e.g. special regimes) hinders competition in domestic markets.


High Inequality
216.     Constraints affecting both opportunities and outcomes in the distribution of access to basic
services and income create obstacles for many to move out of poverty. A lack of opportunities results
in many children not being able to accumulate human capital. When these children grow up, they are less
likely to find good jobs and improve their living conditions. In turn, their children grow up in poor
households with low access to opportunities. Specifically:

     Access to, and quality of, basic services is relatively low. Approximately half a million Honduran
      children do not have access to potable water and 1.1 million children do not have access to basic
      sanitation. Low levels of access is alarming since these basic services directly affect health and

                                                   110
      learning outcomes. A quarter of the rural population does not have access to electricity, and only
      14 percent of rural adults have an account in a formal financial institution.
     Access is related to household income and location, with children from poor households having
      limited access to essential services such as education and sanitation. Honduras ranks lowest
      among LAC countries in the World Bank’s Human Opportunity Index (HOI), which calculates
      how personal circumstances, such as rural status, income, or parental education, impact the
      probability of a child accessing services necessary to succeed in life, such as schooling, running
      water, or connection to electricity.
     Formal workers in Honduras benefit from high minimum wages and labor protections; however,
      80 percent of workers in the country are in the informal sector, with half of the population relying
      on self-employment.

217.     Honduras has the highest secondary school dropout rate in Central America due to a
combination of high poverty and insufficient secondary schools in rural areas. According to the
recent World Bank Central American Social Expenditures and Institutional Review these outcomes result
from the government’s limited ability to expand safety nets, increase the access and quality of public
education and health services, engage in active labor market policies, and generally improve human
development indicators. This is in part due to low revenues and fiscal deterioration, which constrain the
financing of much needed social sector improvements. This highlights that fiscal challenges discussed in
different sections of the report translate into social pressures. Yet, perhaps most importantly, challenges in
budget formulation and execution, primarily due to institutional factors, diminish the impact of social
spending. Therefore, Honduras needs to significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its
social spending.

Low Resilience
218.    Honduras also faces challenges with regards to economic, social, and environmental
sustainability.

      On the economic front, achieving fiscal sustainability is critical for Honduras to boost growth and
       reduce poverty. Honduras benefitted from HIPC debt relief, yet its current debt trajectory is
       pushing it back to its pre-HIPC debt levels, and a large share of domestic revenues goes to debt
       service rather than productive investments in social development and economic infrastructure.
      On the social front, reducing crime appears to be fundamental. This is because of the negative
       impact that crime and violence has on the investment climate and investment allocation, and
       thereby growth, as well as on the social contract that citizens form with the government.
      On the environmental sustainability front, Honduras is highly exposed to natural shocks, which
       combined with low resilience, affect the poor disproportionally. Some shocks have massive
       impacts, but a multitude of smaller shocks, including periodic floods and droughts and repeated
       outbreaks of blight, such as coffee rust (“roya”), have also had substantial cumulative impacts on
       agricultural production and poverty. The combination of high exposure and low resilience to
       environmental hazards leaves most Hondurans exposed to frequent income and consumption
       shocks. Evidence suggests that the poorest households are most affected by disasters; the impact
       on their assets is both more extreme and more lasting, and prevent the poor from catching up with
       wealthier groups.

Deep roots of the challenges faced
219.    The picture that emerges from this discussion indicates that poverty is high and persistent,
affected by low growth, high inequality, and sustainability challenges, and in turn, each of these are

                                                     111
affected by difficult issues. When there are so many factors that are relevant and that therefore need to
be taken into account, any exercise to identify policy priorities that may underlie poverty eradication
efforts becomes very complicated. Should one start by addressing the high levels of income inequality
because high inequality is itself a barrier to growth and, for a given growth rate, to poverty reduction, or,
instead, focus on growth given the low per capita income levels and hence the limits of redistributive
policies? And what about the challenges on the sustainability front, given the difficulties of building a
long term strategy on footings that are not too solid? And once the decision of which area needs to be
tackled first is made, which policy options should be prioritized?

220.     Most of the discussion above has focused on identifying the proximate causes of lack of
development in Honduras; but is there a root cause? For example, take the case of macroeconomic
stability which is a proximate cause behind the country’s low growth and a critical element behind the
economic sustainability challenges. Achieving macroeconomic stability depends on the quality of policy.
Likewise, low levels of education and human capital hinder growth in Honduras and hence the temptation
to recommend improvements to education. But education levels (particularly considering that the country
already spends a relatively large share of GDP in education) are the outcomes of the set of country
policies and institutional arrangements that may be problematic and prevent progress on this front. And
consider crime and violence, which appears as a key element underlying low growth and increasing social
sustainability challenges, but at the same time is also an extremely complex problem that needs to be
tackled taking into consideration factors such as the capacity of the security forces to enforce the law
and/or the judiciary to prosecute crimes. In other words, when considering the identified proximate causes
of development in Honduras, could it be that there is a root cause affecting the proximate determinants?

221.      The development economics literature highlights the importance of the quality of
institutions. 174 North and Thomas (1973) argue that institutions are the fundamental determinant of
growth affecting total factor productivity, human capital accumulation, and physical capital accumulation
(i.e., the three elements of the production function) and these in turn aggregate income and growth.
Shleifer and Vishny (1993) present both a theoretical model and empirical evidence that is consistent with
poor institutions affecting the provision of social services, with evidence linking them to outcomes such
as infant and child mortality rates, literacy, low birth weight, and primary school dropout rates.175 Rodrik
(1999) studies other channels and presents evidence from a panel of countries that better institutions are
associated with higher real wages and higher labor share in national income. Lindert (1994, 2004)
provides evidence from OECD countries indicating a linkage between institutions and public spending,
particularly on education. And Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo and Robinson (2015) find that better
institutions are associated with higher tax collection as a percentage of GDP. In summary, the existing
literature on the role of institutions in economic development suggests that institutional weakness can lead
to lower growth (through regulatory framework imperfections, macroeconomic instability, negative
effects on human capital accumulation and public infrastructure, access to finance, and more generally
inefficiencies of the public sector affecting the implementation of programs), and high inequality (through

174 Admittedly, the empirical literature on the impact of institutions on development has not produced refined enough results to
assess the magnitude of the effects of institutions on growth and income inequality. In some cases, this has been due to
difficulties finding exogenous variables that can be used to instrument explanatory variables measuring the quality of institutions.
In others, because of the intrinsic difficulties at capturing the different dimensions of the quality of the institutions. And finally,
there are also problems distinguishing the differences between de jure and de facto institutions. Yet, the causal relationship
linking institutions to development appears well documented.
175 Kaufmann, Kraay, and Zoido-Lobaton (1999) find that a one standard deviation improvement in the Worldwide Governance

Indicators was associated with a two-and-a-half to four-fold decrease in a country’s infant mortality rate, and a 15 to 25 percent
increase in literacy. Similar results are obtained by Gupta, Davoodi, and Tiongson (2000) who also find that corruption has
adverse consequences for a country’s child and infant mortality rates, percent of low-birth weight babies in total births, and
dropout rates in primary schools. In particular, child mortality appears to be about one-third higher in countries with high
corruption, and infant mortality rates and the percent of low-birthweight babies almost twice as high. Dropout rates are five times
as high.

Schematically, these relations are represented in Figure 6.1.

222.     One natural question that emerges in this context is what is meant and understood by
institutions and their quality. Institutions, both broadly defined as the “rules of the game” and narrowly
defined as organizations, particularly in the public sector, pose challenges to development outcomes in
Honduras.176 The discussion below relies on a definition of the institutional framework that encompasses
notions of: (i) formal and informal rules and regulations (rules); (ii) the bureaucratic structure that
implements and enforces these rules (capacity); and (iii) and the mechanisms to hold agents accountable
for their actions (accountability). Rules include both formal laws (de jure level) and informal rules and
regulations. Capacity refers to the ability of the administration and society to operate and enact the rules;
this includes the delivery of services and the protection of rights and entitlements. And, in this context,
accountability refers to the mechanisms that shape incentives, including the application of sanctions (or
other consequences) if rules are not followed due to a lack of capacity or due to neglect, for example. The
configuration of rules, capacity and accountability determine the extent to which the country’s
institutional framework is conducive to growth, inclusion, and sustainability.

223.     Development outcomes can, in turn, affect the quality of institutions, thereby creating a
cycle as illustrated in Figure 6.2. 177 That is, institutional quality is endogenous to development
outcomes. In other words, poor institutional quality and poor development outcomes can result in a cycle,
which can be either vicious or virtuous, and help explain why both poverty and poor quality institutions
can be highly persistent overtime. In fact, there is evidence that differences in institutional quality explain
differences in development outcomes over a hundred years later, suggesting that not only is this a strong
effect, but also a challenging cycle to break.178 Indeed, this is the basis for the conceptual framework of
the World Bank’s forthcoming 2017 WDR, which identifies this feedback loop as a function of the power
structure present in society. That is, the bargaining power of different groups (e.g., the middle class, labor
unions, business groups) in society influence the quality of institutions.




176 North (1994) refers to institutions as “humanely devised constraints that structure human interaction… made up of formal
constraints (e.g., rules, laws, constitutions), informal constraints (e.g., norms of behavior, conventions, self-imposed codes of
conduct), and their enforcement characteristics.” He defines organizations as “made up of groups of individuals bound together
by some common purpose to achieve certain objectives… [they] include political bodies (e.g., political parties, the Senate, a city
council, regulatory bodies), economic bodies (e.g., firms, trade unions, family farms, cooperatives), social bodies (e.g., churches,
clubs, athletic associations), and educational bodies (e.g., schools, universities, vocational training centers).”
177 The applied economics literature has typically considered institutions endogenous to the development process, an implicit

recognition of the feedback loop. Yet, similar to the difficulties of quantitatively estimating the effects of institutional quality on
development outcomes, the estimation of the effects of development outcomes on the quality of institutions faces the same
statistical challenges that limit the ability to parametrically assess the impact in practice.
178 For example, Acemoglu, Gallego and Robinson (2014).

224.    Development outcomes influence bargaining power, pressuring institutions to deliver;
economic growth, for example, results in higher income levels that can increase the demand for
better quality institutions.179 For instance, research using firm data finds that as growth increases the
profitability of firms, these are able to escape areas where officials demand bribes and move to areas with
lower bribes.180 Therefore growth may act as a push factor and low bribes as a pull factor. In practice, this
would imply that countries can enter into a cycle where high growth tends to reduce corruption and this
feeds back into higher growth, or conversely that corruption negatively affects growth and this feeds back
into an increase in corrupting activities. Another potential channel is related to how the level of income
inequality affects the quality of institutions. This is attributed to the value of social cohesion and is
captured in the importance of a sizeable middle class that demands institutional quality.181 In countries
with lower income inequality, interests are more closely aligned between groups.

225.    This SCD argues that the quality of the country’s institutions is an important determinant
of development outcomes in Honduras. A question that arises is how to assess the quality of institutions
in Honduras, and whether this can be an explanation behind the long-run development challenges in the
country. As discussed previously, institutional quality has several dimensions related to the rules in place,
the capacity to implement, and the associated accountability framework. For example, problems on the
regulatory front (either because of its quality of because it is not appropriately implemented) affect a
country’s macro stability182 and through this channel growth. Similarly, lack of capacity in the public
sector can lead to inadequate infrastructure provision (e.g. construction of the wrong infrastructure, poor
construction and quality of provision, or insufficient maintenance). This in turn can dramatically reduce
economic returns not just for individual projects but to the entire infrastructure stock, and lead to lower
levels and less efficient provision of infrastructure provision.183 And deficiencies in the functioning of the

181 For example, Loayza, Rigolini, Llorente (2012) and Ferreira et al (2013). Alonso and Carcimartin (2013) argue that income

distribution 1) “…causes divergent interests among different social groups, lead(ing) to conflicts, sociopolitical instabilit y and
insecurity”; 2) “… facilitates that institutions remain captured by groups of power”; and 3) “diminishes social agents’ disposition
to cooperate action and favors corruption and rent-seeking activities.”

of law hinder financial sector access for firms, particularly among small and medium enterprises.184

226.     International indicators suggest institutional challenges in Honduras. In three of the six
indicators reported by the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI)—control of corruption, rule of law,
and government effectiveness—Honduras scores in the lowest quartile of the world, and in one of those
(rule of law) in the lowest decile (Figure 6.3). There is no single indicator among the WGI where
Honduras is above the world median, though in the case of regulatory quality scoring in the 46th percentile
the country is close to it. As for political stability, and voice and accountability, Honduras appears in the
lowest one-third of the ranking. If one were to take the average percentile of the six WGI as an aggregate
measure, Honduras would be in the 28th percentile, the second lowest in LAC. Findings of weak
institutions in Honduras are not unique to the WGI. In its public institutions pillar, the World Economic
Forum’s (WEF) Global Competitiveness Index ranks Honduras 105th among 144 countries (Error!
Reference source not found.). Honduras also ranks low in indicators such as the quality of public
spending (127th), the reliability of public services (115th), diversion of public funds (117th), and costs
imposed by crime and violence (140th). It is worth noting that both the WGI and WEF indicators have
important limitations in their ability to capture the institutional challenges of a country, nonetheless, there
is a correlation between these indices which appears to indicate he existence of institutional challenges in
Honduras.

227.     The analysis of the bottlenecks to growth, inclusion, and sustainability underscore issues
related to institutional quality. Indeed the discussion of the country development challenges has
continuously gravitated towards issues directly related to the quality of institutions (Figure 6.4). In the
case of inclusion, for example, limited access to basic services and unequal access can be traced back to
the country’s inefficient public spending as discussed in Chapter 4. Furthermore, the country’s high
minimum wages may be further increasing inequality in the country while potentially harming the growth
of more formal employment. Challenges on the growth side include lack of skills and low infrastructure,
two areas also affected by inefficient public spending. Access to capital, including issues affecting
property rights, can be traced back to weaknesses in the rule of law. And as regards competition, special
regimes and regulations in some markets appear to favor incumbents. All in all, these results are
consistent with the discussion emerging form WGI and WEF data. The exception might be the regulatory
framework, which according to the indicators of the WGI and WEF does not appear as a top policy
priority. Even so, enforcement matters, and, the country analysis concludes that weak enforcement hinder
the effectiveness of the rule in critical areas such as citizen security appears as a key constraint to growth
and inclusion.

           Figure 6.4: Proximate and root causes of development challenges in Honduras.




228.     As with the cycles related to crime and emigration, reverting the cycle between institutions
and development outcomes cycle is challenging given its self-reinforcing nature. While admittedly it
is difficult to present definitive evidence, this SCD argues that a plausible explanation for the high levels
of poverty is the quality of the country’s economic and social institutions, which, according to both
internationally comparable databases and country-specific evidence, needs to be addressed. This
hypothesis would help explain the many factors behind the low levels of growth, high levels of inequality,
and sustainability challenges. It would also help explain the persistence of weak institutions and poor
development outcomes, as these may be locked in a cycle in which poor institutional quality leads to high
poverty and this in turn leads to poor institutional quality. Moreover, this cycle of weak institutions-poor
development outcomes would be on top of the two vicious cycles identified previously (high crime and
low growth, and large emigration flows and low growth), and feed into them. For example, the low
ranking in the rule of law indicator of the WGI suggests difficulties in law enforcement, an area that is
critical to fight crime. Likewise, the presence of institutional challenges in the provision of education
services, and hence education outcomes would also indicate difficulties in an area that appears key in
explaining the challenges that emerge between large emigration flows and low growth.

Priorities Ahead
Approach to prioritization

229.     The prioritization exercise undertaken for this analysis is anchored on a number of criteria.
First, the exercise considers the extent to which improvements in a particular area would have substantial
impacts on tackling poverty and increasing the welfare of the bottom 40 percent of the income
distribution. Second, the exercise considers the time horizon of the expected impacts by identifying
measures that can generate short and long-term impacts. Third, emphasis is given to the complementarity
of the policy areas, in which an identified opportunity in one area could also help address challenges in
other areas. Finally, the prioritization exercise gives more weight to areas where the evidence base is
stronger.

230.     Noting the difficult development challenges that Honduras faces, the SCD does not discount
an area as a priority solely based on the criteria listed above. Given that the analysis identified the
existence of self-reinforcing vicious cycles, priority is given to entry points that could help break those
cycles. The basis for this emphasis stems from taking into account areas that complement progress in
other areas. Indeed, any effort to inform public discussion of the country’s priorities would be remised if
it would obviate actions that would help avoid the significantly negative consequences. This consideration
led to a focus on ‘policy levers’ that could help address the vicious cycles. The identified priorities were
also informed by consultations with stakeholders and experts in Honduras.

Policy levers and complementary measures

231.    Addressing Honduras’ challenges will require a ‘big push’ through coordinated action. In
addition to the need to deal with the vicious cycles created by high crime and large emigration and
remittances flows, one also needs to consider the role played by the country’s institutions as this, through
its negative impact on growth, inclusion, and sustainability, creates an additional and perhaps more
complex cycle that could keep the country in a low equilibrium. But what does this view of the
development challenges in Honduras imply for policy prioritizations?

232.      The analysis suggests three implications to identify priorities ahead.
         A first implication is the need to attack these challenges from multiple angles rather than from a
          single direction; otherwise the strategy would ignore the reinforcing nature of the different cycles.
         A second implication is the need to identify policy options that can generate a ‘big push’ to break
          the three cycles.185 Marginal interventions are unlikely to break the self-reinforcing dynamics of
          the different cycles.
         A third implication is that it is critical to find the appropriate policy levers that can help break
          these vicious cycles. When the focus is on breaking the institutions-poverty vicious cycle, actions
          aimed at (i) strengthening of the rule of law and the judiciary, building state capacity, and
          improvements in the accountability framework. Likewise, when the focus is on breaking the
          crime and violence-growth cycle, actions aimed at (ii) strengthening violence prevention and law
          enforcement would appear essential. And when the focus is on breaking the migration-growth
          cycle, actions aimed at (iii) improving education and skills to compete are needed so that the
          increased wage level resulting from high remittances and changes in the real exchange rate is
          accompanied by increases in worker productivity.



185
  This implication was also presented in the Systematic Country Diagnostic for El Salvador (see Calvo-Gonzalez and Lopez
2015), the neighboring country that also faces the vicious cycles related to high levels of crime and migration.

                                                           117
233.     Against this background, there are complementary measures that can support the policy
levers. These complementary measures would tackle specific challenges to growth, inclusion, and
sustainability. When the focus is on boosting growth, policies that support a competitive business climate,
in particular (i) promoting fiscal sustainability and improving infrastructure and financial intermediation
would be justified. When the focus is on fostering inclusion, complementary measures would include (ii)
strengthening the targeting and coverage of social programs (e.g. CCTs which have proven to be efficient
and effective for poverty reduction), improving access to basic services, and promoting active labor
market policies. And when the focus is on building sustainable development gains, complementary
measures include (iii) building resilience to natural hazards.

Breaking the cycle of high crime and low growth: Strengthening violence prevention and law
enforcement

234.     Honduras currently finds itself in a serious wave of violence. While this rash of violence also
affects neighboring El Salvador, Guatemala, Belize and Mexico, the situation in Honduras is particularly
alarming. Between 2006 and 2011, the country’s homicide rate more than doubled from an already high
44 homicides per 100,000 people, to 92 in 2011, the highest in the world. For reference, in 2012 the
global homicide rate was 6 per 100,000. Even as homicide rates have fallen since 2011 to an estimated 67
by 2014, they continue being among the highest in the world and remain particularly high among young
men, including a homicide rate of 130 for older adolescents (ages 15 to 19).186 At the same time, there is a
high degree of impunity, and the vast majority of homicides remain unsolved. High violence imposes
significant economic costs—on the public sector, the private sector, and private households—including
income losses, security costs and health costs, even driving some enterprises out of business. It also has
significant social costs, with implications for mental health, social cohesion, and educational outcomes.
Reducing crime and violence would yield positive results for growth, inclusion and sustainability. For
instance, lower security costs and fewer cases of extortion would increase the profitability of enterprises
and small businesses, boosting growth and leading to the creation of more job opportunities.

235.    Addressing crime and violence requires an integrated agenda. Tackling crime and violence
requires raising the opportunity costs of crime through increased law enforcement (which increases the
expected costs of criminality) and prevention through better opportunities (which decrease the relative
186   Observatorio de la Violencia de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras (UNAH).

                                                            118
payoff of criminality). That is, crime prevention must be thought of as a set of broad interventions that go
beyond law enforcement and security measures so as to address the root causes, including the country’s
lack of opportunities. Thus, it is important to connect crime prevention interventions with the underlying
causes of criminal activity by addressing perceptions of impunity, youth exclusion and general poverty.
This calls for capacity building for national, regional and local authorities and alignment of strategies as
well as coordination across sectors such as health, education, and criminal justice. Effective prevention
strategies address multiple risk factors and across multiple levels (individual, family, community,
society). Because violence tends to concentrate geographically, prevention is more effective when it
engages communities and connects them to regional and national prevention strategies. Social networks at
the community level can be effective in reducing violence and addressing the perceptions of safety and
trust.

236.    Another consideration is that crime prevention should also address the need for
rehabilitating citizens committing acts of violence. Many former gang members and drug traffickers
would need to be reintegrated into society for the sustainable prevention of violence. From law
enforcement to the judiciary to the penitentiary, programs must focus on holistic approaches to
prevention, intervention and rehabilitation activities. One example of a program that has proved
successful at preventing crime is the Programa de Apoyo Temporal al Empleo (PATI) implemented in El
Salvador. This program offers income support to vulnerable individuals in urban areas with program
beneficiaries committing to participate in community activities and capacitation programs to improve its
employability and entrepreneurial abilities. The World Bank supported a similar cash for work project in
Honduras, Employment Generation in Poor Urban Neighborhoods, which targeted at risk youth and
unemployed heads of household with young children. This project also included a number of crime and
violence prevention training and development of human capital, including conflict resolution and
preparation for employment. These type of programs have the effect of increasing the opportunity cost of
joining a criminal group by increasing both the present income and the future potential income of those
enrolled. Initial impact evaluations in El Salvador show that PATI contributed to lowering the levels of
crime in the communities where it was implemented.

Breaking the cycle of high emigration and low growth: Improving education and skills to compete

237.     Educational access and quality in Honduras is relatively low and improving it will help
boost long term growth and poverty reduction. The country’s test scores are low and fewer than half of
secondary school aged children are enrolled in school. While a lack of access to quality schooling
exacerbates inequality and limits intergenerational mobility, it also poses a challenge for growth with 28
percent of firms identifying a lack of skilled workers as a major constraint according to the 2010
Enterprise Survey. The combination of a small skilled labor force and the upward pressure on wages
resulting from the high levels of remittances received in Honduras has fed into relatively high wages for
skilled labor even as, overall, wages have remained flat and labor outcomes are weak for the average
Honduran. Better quality and more accessible education would enable more Honduran workers to better
acquire the skills necessary to compete for higher productivity employment thus alleviating the pressure
of high wages.

238.     To foster more skills, a priority for Honduras is improving the quality of basic schooling
and, in particular, addressing the country’s secondary school dropout rate. Access to primary and
secondary schooling of good quality is essential as it provides the basic building blocks necessary for
learning more advanced skills. In the short-run, it is also important to build skills in the current
workforce. Some possibilities include vocational training for adults, including technical skills and English
skills, so that more workers can participate in skilled tradable sectors, opening the door to a more diverse
set of exports so that the country can reap the rewards of its strategic geographical location. Since
agriculture continues to play a prominent role in Honduras and employs a large share of the poor and the

                                                    119
bottom 40 percent, it is also important to improve agricultural and agribusiness skills (for example, the
adoption of new technologies to improve output, and technical skills needed to connect to larger markets)
that can lead to improved income opportunities for rural households.

Improving institutional quality: strengthening of the rule of law and the judiciary, building capacity,
and strengthening the accountability framework

239.    A central question regards how to strengthen institutions beginning with improving the rule
of law and the capacity of the state. Tackling corruption requires addressing gaps in the accountability
framework. The 2009 World Bank’s Institutional and Governance Review (IGR) identified the need to
strengthen the country’s accountability framework and in particular, the accountability of policymakers
towards citizens and tax payers. The IGR suggested three key recommendations that could represent
important steps towards improving accountability and governance conditions in Honduras: (i) Improving
transparency in key policy- and decision-making processes; (ii) Strengthening mechanisms to hold policy-
and decision-makers to account, especially in cases of poor performance; and (iii) Supporting citizen
groups representing the broader public interest, to participate in policy discussions.

240.     The Honduran authorities have undertaken a self-assessment which identifies a number of
priorities to combat corruption and improve the rule of law. A self-assessment of United Nations
Convention on Anti-Corruption (UNCAC) Chapter III on Criminalization and Law Enforcement and
Chapter IV on International Cooperation has revealed that, with few exceptions, the legal framework of
Honduras complies with most provisions of the UNCAC in relation to criminalization of bribery and with
most requirements relating to international cooperation by signing a series of international treaties, which
are now part of domestic law.187 However, the self-assessment reveals that major challenges remain in
terms of law enforcement. The number of investigations, prosecutions and conviction for crimes such as
domestic bribery, bribery, embezzlement, and trading of influence are low. According to statistics from
the Honduras Electronic Judicial Center for Documentation and Information (CEDIJ), the Sentencing
Courts prosecuted only 16 cases related to bribery in 2012-2014. Ten cases ended with convictions and 6
in acquittals. During the same time period, there were 17 investigations related to illicit enrichment, only
one led to prosecution. The self-assessment identifies weaknesses in the criminal justice system and lack
of capacity to conduct robust investigations and obtain evidence as the main reasons to the poor
enforcement of the laws. The Self-Assessment also reveals that the National Anti-Corruption Agency
(CAN) needs institutional support, and that there is demand for technical assistance in drafting new
legislations as per the gaps identified in the legal framework; developing a registration, monitoring and
evaluation system for corruption crimes; and establishing IT-enabled asset declaration system. It also
reveals Public Prosecutor’s need for capacity building support in investigation techniques and forensic
audit, and management of crime statistics from the relevant authorities.

241.   To address these challenges, the Honduran self-assessment of Chapters III and IV of the
UNCAC revealed specific areas to strengthen the legal, regulatory and institutional framework for
enhancing accountability and enforcing the rule of law. Major gaps identified in the legal framework

187The World Bank entered into a partnership with the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crimes (UNODC) in March 2015 for
implementing UNCAC in selected countries and Honduras was selected as the first country where this partnership would be
piloted. The UNCAC requires that states establish and promote effective practices aimed at preventing corruption, to establish
criminal and other offences to cover a wide range of corrupt acts, to cooperate with one another in every aspect of the fight
against corruption, and to support each other in the recovery of stolen assets. UNCAC is the only legally binding universal
convention on anti-corruption and in many respects represents an accepted international standard regarding best practices for
combating corruption. The UNCAC Self-Assessment is an objective and evidence-based instrument to assess the gaps in the
legal, regulatory and institutional framework for combating corruption. It provides a comprehensive overview of the policies,
legislation, institutions and implementation capacities. The National Anti-Corruption Council (CNA) is the Focal Point
nominated by the government to conduct the Self-assessment. The UNCAC Self-Assessment of Chapter II on Prevention of
Corruption and Chapter V on Stolen Asset Recovery is about to start.

include: 1) lack of necessary provisions on transnational bribery of foreign public officials and officials of
public international organizations; 2) Laws criminalizing trade in influence do not cover “the promise,
offering or giving to a public official of an undue advantage” or “solicitation or acceptance by a public
official of an undue advantage”; 3) the criminal code does not include a definition of bribery in the private
sector; 4) obstruction of justice is not explicitly defined as a crime in the legal framework; 5)
responsibility of collaborators or instigators is not covered by the legal framework; 6) there is no specific
provision establishing the possibility of mitigating penalties in the case of cooperation on the part of the
accused; and 7) extradition law is incomplete and only offenses related to organized crime, drug-
trafficking and terrorism allow for extradition of Honduran nationals. At the same time, the self-
assessment also revealed gaps in enforcement, including a witness protection program that, by law, only
extends to individuals who have appeared in court and excludes those who are in the preparatory stage of
trials.

242.     Administrative simplification can also support improvements in the rule of law. Bribe
payments are the outcome of a wide range of factors and country circumstances that breed corruption,
rather than a policy variable that can be changed at the will of policy makers.188 One of the hypotheses,
known in the literature as the “control rights” hypothesis, considers the possibility of unscrupulous public
officials exerting an implicit control on firms to obtain bribes. This control would stem from the inherent
features of complex rules (which in turn can be related to the quantity and quality of regulation, either de
jure or de facto) and the discretionary power of officials enforcing those regulations. The second
hypotheses, known as the “grease the wheels” hypothesis, would postulate that firms may have incentives
to bribe officials to skip regulations or to secure contracts. In practice, there is evidence of both of these
behaviors present in most countries with high prevalence of corruption, as well as evidence that the
country’s general attitude toward corruption is a strong determinant of the incidence of bribes.189

243.     Improving institutional quality will require actions along the three dimensions – rules,
capacity and accountability; that is, there is a need to develop effective rules to boost growth,
inclusion and sustainability while at the same time building capacity to enforce these rules and hold
agents accountable. It is important to review the regulatory framework to create incentives that benefit
the public interest. Good rules, however, can suffer from bad enforcement because of overly cumbersome
procedures, lack of qualified personnel, or weak accountability mechanisms. Thus, administrative
simplification, together with a more professional civil service (which in turn will help improving the
capacity of the state), can be an effective tool for lowering the cost and improving the efficiency of
regulations, thereby increasing compliance and reducing the opportunities for corruption or rent seeking.
Moreover, it is important to improve enforcement and accountability, such as by increasing efforts to
monitor compliance and raising the costs of regulation infringement by adequately levying fines and
sanctions. To achieve this, strengthening the judicial system is essential; for example, increasing the
likelihood of punishment for both parties engaging in a corrupt agreement (thus increasing the expected
cost of entering into such agreements) is likely to lead to lower corruption levels.

Complementary policies to support the policy levers
244.    Addressing Honduras’ challenges would also require looking beyond the cycles and focus
on policies that foster growth, inclusion, and sustainability. The policy levers, identified as entry
points to tackling the cycles, can be complemented with measures aimed at (i) reigniting economic
growth; and (ii) fostering inclusion. Note that these type of policies would be fully justified not only
because of their static impact on poverty reduction and shared prosperity but also because of the impact
that they have on the identified country development dynamics, with higher growth feeding into lower

crime and lower migration pressures and hence these feeding back into future higher growth, and with
higher growth and lower inequality feeding into better institutions and these in turn into higher growth.
Lower inequality would also contribute to lower crime rates. Indeed Fajnzylber, Lederman, and Loayza 190
(2002) present empirical evidence suggesting that even though criminal inertia is quite significant,
declines in income inequality lower crime rates (this in addition to the beneficial impacts on crime levels
of economic growth). Interestingly a second round effect of a lower inequality induced lower-crime-rate
would be lower migration flows.

245.     What are the policies that could be expected to have the highest impact on growth over the
medium-term? The discussion in this report suggests that there is no trivial answer to this question but
rather that tackling the bottlenecks to growth that cut across sectors will be key. For example, the impact
that the macroeconomic instability during 2012 and 2013 had on the investment climate highlights the
need for ensuring fiscal sustainability as a necessary but not sufficient condition for reigniting economic
growth. A stronger fiscal position that is achieved now and sustained over the medium to the long-term
will set the basis for progress on service delivery, and growth and employment. Fiscal deficits and slower
economic growth since the 2009 crisis have increased public debt, reaching a concerning level and
possibly affecting investment decisions. While the authorities have recently made strides to reduce the
fiscal deficit, fiscal consolidation will require additional reforms that enhance public financial
management and rebalance expenditures from current spending towards capital spending. Curtailing the
fiscal losses in the power sector will also bolster the fiscal position, and in this regard the current
environment of low oil prices does provide an opportunity to advance electricity pricing reform. At the
same time, there is scope for mobilizing additional tax revenues by improving tax and customs
administration and reducing tax exemptions which represent a large share of GDP.

246.     With a view to generating sustained growth and facilitating further insertion into the global
markets, it is important to address the constraints of expensive and low quality infrastructure
services. As mentioned, a focus on the energy sector is warranted. Key objectives include: (i) improving
energy pricing and energy efficiency mechanisms, such as modernizing the energy matrix towards cleaner
and cheaper energy sources to reduce the dominance of thermal power; (ii) improving the legal
framework to reduce fraud and theft; and (iii) strengthening the corporate governance of the state-owned
electricity company, including building capacity at the newly created energy regulatory agency.
Regarding transport, a focus on port infrastructure and improved road maintenance—both which could
benefit from the development of public-private partnerships that bring private sector participation—is
warranted and should be combined with improved logistics and regulations to reduce waiting times while
improving customs enforcement. These investments, if planned and executed well, also represent an
opportunity for growth in the near term, providing opportunities for Public Private Partnerships and the
creation of jobs.

247.    These proposed measures to boost growth would support the private sector and help
generate more demand for labor, creating jobs. To the extent that a healthy fiscal environment leads to
less macroeconomic volatility, this would reduce the frequency with which the private sector must absorb
severe shocks. Reducing operating costs through improvements in the energy sector and transportation
would boost productivity. Meanwhile, improving financial intermediation including policies designed to
promote increased savings of remittances in the formal financial sector is expected to increase overall
savings, and the improved access to finance would particularly benefit SMEs and young firms, the source
of a disproportionate share of job creation in Honduras. Combined with the policy levers designed to
address the cycles of crime, emigration, and institutions identified above, these measures would be
expected to promote a better business climate and lead to more job creation by the private sector.


190   Fajnzylber, Lederman, and Loayza (2002).

                                                   122
248.     The challenge of fostering inclusion cannot wait for the indirect effects of growth and
employment creation. As noted, 80 percent of Honduran children live in poverty and a majority do not
finish secondary school. There is strong evidence that the current social assistance programs (CCT) are
having an impact in the reduction of poverty and should be expanded to cover all eligible extreme poor.
Over the long-term, efforts at inclusion need the support of basic services of good quality that empower
the population with the assets both to create and to profit from opportunities. Besides the attention to
education and skills, already noted, reducing child malnutrition should figure as a high priority. A solid
insertion into the labor markets is the best bet to a sustainable inclusion. This would call for active labor
market policy that rather than focusing on minimum wages emphasizes making the markets work, by
addressing issues of information, tailored skills, and linking with job creation. Minimum wages in line
with the market have the potential to unleash investment and production in high productivity sector and
contribute to a better allocation of resources in the economy. Addressing skills and information problems
can be conduit of improving employment opportunities for the young and poor and be a countervailing for
to violence and crime.

249.      There is also a need for measures focusing on addressing vulnerability. For this, it will be
critical that Honduras continues building resilience to natural disasters as these are expected to increase in
frequency and severity with climate change. There is already in place an ample agenda under
implementation for building institutions and improving infrastructure and local planning. Greater
attention is needed, however, to the impact of “small” natural events that affects the lives of the poor i n a
localized but dramatic manner. In this regard, the capacity of households to manage the impact of natural
disasters can be enhanced by linking them to saving mechanisms and increasing the availability of
financial instruments, such as agricultural insurance. Additionally, improved management of natural
resources, particularly water, can help protect households and agricultural production from the effects of
droughts. This is particular key in the Dry Corridor, an area of the country characterized by 4-6 months of
almost no precipitation and low water availability.

Conclusion
250.     Honduras is a country with great potential; unlocking these potentials will foster the
creation of greater opportunities for its citizens. It has a young population, is rich in natural resources,
is geographically well-located and open to trade, and already attracts high inflows of private investment.
Yet, it is also a country facing long-term and pressing challenges, particularly a self-reinforcing cycle
between weak institutional capacity and low development underlying the self-reinforcing cycles between
low growth and high crime and large emigration flows. To address these cycles the agenda is highly
complex and will require a long-term commitment and a high level of political consensus. The priorities
identified in this Systematic Country Diagnostic focus on breaking these cycles to bridge the gap between
potentials and actuals.

Annex 2. Poverty measurement in Honduras
To measure the incidence of poverty, Honduras uses two income-based poverty lines. First, the
extreme poverty, or “food poverty”, line reflects the cost of a locally obtained basic food basket that
meets minimum caloric requirements. Second, the overall poverty line is constructed by taking the
extreme poverty line and adding a set of basic nonfood goods. These lines are priced differently for rural
and urban areas to account for differences in the cost of living. Using the national household survey,
income estimates are constructed at the household level, which include both labor and non-labor income.
This aggregate income is adjusted by a factor to correct for under-reported incomes. The adjusted
household income is then divided by the number of household members to obtain the household income
per capita.

It is important to take into account the following considerations when comparing poverty
measurements in Honduras. First, the methodology used to adjust for non-declaration of income is not
clearly documented and may be outdated. Since a large share of households rely on informal employment,
including a significant share of households relying on subsistence agriculture, measuring income is not
always straightforward. Second, different poverty lines are used for urban and rural areas, but it is not
clear that there are spatial differences in cost of living as there is no information on rural prices. Third, the
poverty rate is reported as the share of households living in poverty, not as a headcount. To the extent that
poor households have more members, this yields a lower poverty rate than a headcount measure. During
the last decade, the headcount poverty rate has been on average six percentage points higher than the
household poverty rates: in 2013, for example, using both the extreme and the moderate poverty line the
headcount was 5.5 percentage points higher than the household poverty rates. Finally, the real value of the
urban poverty line may be set too high when compared to other countries in Central America, such as
Costa Rica or Panama, which have a higher GDP per capita than Honduras.191 Specifically, Honduras’
urban poverty line is the equivalent of $8.90 per day (2011 PPP), second only to Uruguay in the LAC
region.

To measure poverty across countries, the World Bank Group and its partners have developed
comparable welfare aggregates and international poverty lines. The figures produced by the
Honduran authorities reveal the evolution of nationally-defined poverty indicators over time. However,
poverty lines and estimation techniques vary between countries, resulting in poverty estimates that are not
internationally comparable. The comparable figures, on the other hand, enable international comparisons
and benchmarking. Hence, all cross-country analyses presented in this report are based on these
international lines. For Honduras and other countries in LAC, the source of comparable household
surveys is the SEDLAC project, a joint project of CEDLAS, at the National University of La Plata in
Argentina, and the World Bank Group.

 Annex 5. Emerging Research Area: What has been affecting low returns to
 investment in Honduras?
 Supported by strong inflow of FDIs, Honduras investment ratio to GDP has been consistently high
 by regional standards. From 1990 to 2014, investment as a share of GDP averaged 23.5 percent, higher
 than the LAC, OECD and World average (22.2, 21.7 and 22.6, respectively). The growth in investment
 has been driven by the private sector, while public investment has shrunk. FDI inflows played a
 significant role in expanding investment opportunities, especially since 2000s, driven by large investment
 in telecommunication infrastructure and maquila sector. Both telecommunications and maquila sectors
 accounted for 53 percent of the total FDI between 2001 and 2013, a total of almost US$5 billion in 13
 years.192 As a result, the share of FDI in investment went up from 6 percent in the 1990 – 1999 to 22
 percent in 2000 – 2013.

 The high levels of investment have not translated into high rates of economic growth. Over the past
 two decades, investment as a share of GDP has averaged 26 percent, compared with real output growth
 averaging only 3.6 percent per year.193 In contrast, during the same period, other lower middle income
 countries had average rates of investment of 23 percent of GDP with an average growth rate of 5.1
 percent per year. In other words, for each unit invested in Honduras, the growth generated has been lower
 than in peer economies. This represents a high investment/low growth paradox.

 Inefficiencies in the sectoral allocation of investment and the high costs of investment could be
 behind the low returns to capital. Honduras has registered high levels of investment and large FDI
 inflows despite the fact that total returns to capital are lower than in other comparable groups. Over the

 192 FDI and long term growth are usually positively correlated. There is micro level evidence pointing to positive externalities
 emanating from foreign owned companies to local industries in host countries. Carkovic and Levine (2005) have shown that FDI
 does not exhibit a strong independent influence on economic growth.
 193 Historically sources of economic growth have shifted between consumption-led and investment-led. Prior to the 1990s,

 growth was mostly led by consumption. At the beginning of the 1990s through to 2009, there was a market shift towards
 investment. Indeed, over the 1990s and the 2000-2008 period, investment growth contributed on average 47 percent of observed
 GDP growth, up from only 3 percent in the 1980s , and about 26 percent in the 1970s. More recently, there has been a return
 towards consumption as the primary driver of growth, with remittances playing an important role supporting consumption.

                                                                                               129
1990s, returns to factor investments have gradually deteriorated (Figure A.5.1 & A.5.2) and have
remained below the average return for Central America and other countries.194 Evidence suggests that
high misallocation of capital among sectors, high costs of doing business, low value-added industrial
activity, unsophisticated value chains with access to international markets (with some exceptions i.e.
textiles, automotive parts, among few others), inefficient public investment and regulatory structures, and
limited investment spillovers on the economy may be eroding the possible growth impact from Honduras’
high levels of investment.

A large share of private investment in residential construction might be a sign of possible capital
misallocation. Within the private sector, residential construction represents around 25 percent of the total
investment, of which 20 percent is self-construction. The importance of residential construction in
Honduras stands out as compared to other benchmark countries and may explain the higher ratio of
investment in GDP. In addition, this type of investment exhibits lower returns to investment relative to
commercial or industrial construction as well as more capital intensive sectors. When purchases of
machinery and equipment increased in 2000-2013, the decline in the return to capital leveled-off,
indicating that the low returns to capital might be associated with capital misallocation towards residential
construction.

Adjusting levels of investment by purchasing power parity (PPP), Honduras’ investment share in
GDP decreases, indicating that investing in the country may be costly. Although Honduras
investment levels are still higher than in other comparable countries, focusing on relative price of
investment suggests that Honduras could improve investment quality and its spillovers not only by
reducing barriers to investment (business climate constraints), but also by reducing the relative price of
investment (see Hsieh and Klenow, 2007). Why is it costly to invest in Honduras? As elaborated in
Chapter 3 under “Challenges to Competitiveness in Honduras”, high costs of investment in Honduras are
associated with issues of low human capital and labor costs, infrastructure, access to finance, ease of
doing business, security, and macroeconomic and political instability, all of which impose additional
194This analysis is confirmed by Honduras’ relatively high ICOR (Incremental Capital -Output Ratio), which is an index that
measures the effectiveness of investment: the higher the ICOR, the lower the productivity of investment. This analysis is also
linked to the evidence of low productivity levels in Honduras, which are confirmed through other studies, including a recent IMF
working paper (see Sosa et al, 2013).

costs to firms operating in the country. For instance, the lack of a qualified labor force and the relatively
expensive wages, as well as high costs of energy in industries such as maquila partly explain the lower
investment returns in these sectors.
